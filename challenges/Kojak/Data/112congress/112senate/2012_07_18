Madam President, the schedule here this morning is that the \nfirst hour will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, the majority controlling the first half and \nthe Republicans the final half.\n  Yesterday cloture was filed on the motion to proceed to the Bring \nJobs Home Act. Unless an agreement is reached, this vote will occur \ntomorrow morning.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 3393\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am told S. 3393 is at the desk and due \nfor a second reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3393) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to provide tax relief to middle-class families.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I object to any further proceedings on \nthis bill at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV.\n\n\n                         Taxpayer Subsidization\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if you want to do business in America \ntoday, your goal should be to make a profit. There is nothing wrong \nwith that. That is good. Millions of hard-working American \nentrepreneurs are the backbone of our economy. And if your company \nboosts profits by sending jobs overseas, that is your right as a \nbusiness owner. But American taxpayers shouldn't subsidize your \nbusiness decision to outsource jobs, especially when there are millions \nof people in this country looking for work.\n  Over the last 10 years, about 2\\1/2\\ million jobs in call centers, \nsales centers, financial firms, and factories were shipped overseas, \nand American taxpayers helped foot the bill for sending those jobs \noverseas. Every time U.S. companies ship jobs or facilities overseas, \nAmerican taxpayers help cover the moving costs. The Bring Jobs Home Act \nwill end these disgraceful subsidies for outsourcing and would give a \n20-percent tax break to cover the cost of moving those jobs back to the \nUnited States.\n  But Republicans are filibustering this commonsense legislation. It is \nno surprise Republicans are on the side of corporations--corporations \nmaking big\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\nbucks--sending American jobs to China, India, and other places. After \nall, their Presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, made a fortune in \noutsourcing jobs also. So Republicans are once again putting tax breaks \nfor big corporations and multimillionaires ahead of the needs of \nordinary Americans.\n  What most Americans need is a good job--a job here at home--and the \nassurance their taxes won't go up on January 1. Democrats, Republicans, \nand Independents across the country agree with our plan. It is only \nRepublicans in Congress who disagree. Yet Republicans here in the \nSenate are filibustering legislation to bring jobs back to America. \nThey have twice blocked a vote on legislation to keep taxes low for 98 \npercent of American families.\n  It was Republicans who asked for a vote on the plan to raise taxes \nfor 25 million families and a vote on our plan to keep taxes low for \n135 million American taxpayers. So we offered them what they wanted. We \noffered them up-or-down votes on both proposals--no procedural hoops, \nno delay tactics, just a simple majority vote on our plan and theirs. \nAnd they refused.\n  Maybe Republicans refused our offer because they don't have the votes \nfor their plan to raise taxes on 25 million Americans or maybe they \nhave refused it because the majority of Americans support our plan to \nkeep taxes low for 98 percent of families, while asking only the top 2 \npercent to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Everyone \nacross America--the majority of Republicans--supports our plan. Yet, \nstill, Republicans here in the Senate are holding hostage tax cuts for \nnearly every American family to extort more budget-busting giveaways to \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  For a year, the budget deficit was all Republicans wanted to talk \nabout. They were willing to end Medicare as we know it, slash funding \nfor nursing homes for seniors, investments in education, and raise \ntaxes on the middle class all in the name of deficit reduction. But now \nthat Democrats have a plan to reduce the deficit by almost $1 trillion \nsimply by ending wasteful tax breaks, Republicans have given up fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  So I say this to my Republican friends: You can't have it both ways. \nYou can't call yourself a deficit hawk and fight for more tax breaks \nfor millionaires and billionaires while the deficit increases. You \ncan't call yourself a fiscal conservative and fight to protect tax \nbreaks for companies that outsource jobs to India and China.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Senate Procedure\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I indicated to the majority leader \nbefore the Senate convened today that I wanted to have a discussion, \nthe two of us, on several items.\n  No. 1, I understand my friend the majority leader, last night on \nMSNBC, said it was his intention at the beginning of the next Congress, \nif Democrats were in the majority, to change the rules of the Senate by \na simple majority. So I want to begin by asking my friend the majority \nleader if his comments at the beginning of this Congress, on January \n27, 2011, are no longer operative. At that time, my friend the majority \nleader said:\n\n       I agree that the proper way to change Senate rules is \n     through the procedures established in those rules, and I will \n     oppose any effort in this Congress or the next to change the \n     Senate's rules other than through the regular order.\n\n  So my first question to my friend the majority leader is: Is that \nstatement no longer operative?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, through the Chair, I would answer my \nfriend the Republican leader, as I have said here on the floor. I \nbelieve what took place at the beginning of this Congress was something \nthat was very important for this body. It was led by Senator Udall of \nNew Mexico and Senator Merkley of Oregon. They had been here a little \nwhile and they thought the Senate was dysfunctional. Well, they hadn't \nbeen here a long time, and I was still willing to go along at that time \nwith the traditional view of let's not rock the boat here. But that was \nwith the hope, and I thought the assurance of my Republican colleagues, \nthat we would not have these continual, nonsensical motions to proceed \nfilibustered, taking a week to get through that before finally moving \nto a piece of legislation.\n  So I said here in the Senate a few months ago that I was wrong. It is \nhard to acknowledge you are wrong. It is difficult for any of us to do, \nespecially in front of so many people. But I said I think they were \nright and I was wrong, and I stick by that. I think what has happened \nthe last few years of changing the basic rules of the Senate where we \nrequire not 50 votes to pass something but 60 votes on everything is \nwrong. I think we waste weeks and weeks on motions to proceed.\n  I had a conversation with a real traditionalist last evening--Carl \nLevin, the Senator from Michigan--where we talked about this at some \nlength. He acknowledges the motion to proceed is a real problem here \nbut he disagrees with me. Others can talk to him personally, but that \nis the way I understood him. But I am convinced something must change, \nunless there is an agreement to change how we focus on the motion to \nproceed.\n  I will try to end this quickly, but I think the leader deserves a \nfull explanation. The filibuster was originally devised--it is not in \nthe Constitution--to help legislation get passed. That is the reason \nthey changed the rules here to do that. Now it is being used to stop \nlegislation from passing, and so we have to change things because this \nplace is becoming inoperable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I gather then my friend the majority leader's \ncommitment at the beginning of the Congress, that we would follow the \nregular order to change the rules of the Senate, is no longer \noperative. So let me turn to a second area of discussion.\n  The principal advantage of being in the majority is you get to \nschedule legislation. And of course there are a number of things that \ncan be done with a simple majority of 51. So I would ask my friend the \nmajority leader why it is his view Republicans have somehow prevented \nthe Senate from passing a budget, which could have been done with a \nmere 51 votes anytime during the last 3 years?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that is an easy question to answer. We \nalready have a budget. We passed, in August of last year, a budget that \ntook effect for the last fiscal year and this fiscal year. It set \nnumbers--302(b) numbers, in effect. There was no need for a budget this \nyear. We already had one.\n  So the hue and cry of my Republicans friends that we need to have a \nbudget is just a lot of talk. We already have a budget.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would say to my friend the majority \nleader, he knows the Parliamentarian disagrees with his view that we \nalready have a budget. But let us assume for the sake of discussion we \ndo have a budget. Then I would ask my friend the majority leader why we \nhaven't passed a single appropriations bill?\n  Mr. REID. That also is an easy question to answer. The Republicans in \nthe House--and this is a bicameral legislature--have reneged on the law \nthat was passed last August where it set numbers. Their appropriations \nbills have artificially lowered the numbers and violated the law, in \neffect, here in this Congress. As a result, Senator Inouye has marked \nup his bill--subcommittee bills.\n  But I would also say the House is not serious about what they do. \nEnergy and Water used to be one of the most important subcommittees--\nthe most popular, I should say, in addition to being important--in this \nbody. I was fortunate to serve on that subcommittee for more than a \nquarter of a century under great leaders--Domenici, Bennett, Johnson, \nand the committee chairs switched back and forth. But the House sent \nover here an Energy and Water Subcommittee appropriations bill that has \nmore than 30 riders directed toward EPA-type functions alone. I mean, \nthey are not serious about doing legislation. They are serious about \nsatisfying their tea party and the ridiculous messages they are trying \nto send.\n  I would also say one of the other problems we have is we have to \nfight to get to anything--any legislation. We have to fight to get that \ndone. As you know, we have wasted--I said weeks earlier--months trying \nto get legislation on the floor. So appropriations bills, I want to get \nthese done. I am an appropriator. But it has been unrealistic with the \nactions of the House.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, what we just heard is that it is not \nthe\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\nSenate's fault, it is the House's fault that the Senate won't schedule \nappropriations bills that have been marked up in the Senate \nappropriations committees.\n  My concern here is that nobody is taking responsibility for the \nSenate itself. We are not responsible for what the House is doing. And \ntypically these differences in what we call 302(b)s; that is, what each \nsubcommittee is going to spend, are worked out in conference. We can't \nhave a conference on any of the bills because we haven't passed any of \nthe bills across the Senate floor.\n  So the majority leader doesn't want to do a budget. He doesn't want \nto schedule votes on appropriations bills. Then I would ask my friend, \nwhy don't we do the DOD authorization bill?\n  Mr. REID. The answer is pretty simple there too: We have spent the \nlast many weeks working through procedural matters on bills the \nRepublicans have held up.\n  We are now in a cloture situation. I spoke to Senator Levin last \nnight about that. He is the chairman of that committee. I have spoken \nto John McCain several times on this matter. I know how important they \nfeel this legislation is, and I think it is important also. But we can \nonly do what we have to do.\n  One of the things I have an obligation for our country to get to is \ncybersecurity. I was asked to visit with General Petraeus. I did that a \nday or two ago. And we don't have to have a briefing by General \nPetraeus to understand how important it is to do something about \ncybersecurity. There are people out there making threats on this \ncountry every day, and we have been fortunate in being able to stop a \nnumber of them. So we are going to have to get to cybersecurity before \nwe get to the Defense authorization bill because on the relative merits \nof the two, cybersecurity is more important. They are both important, \nbut I believe that one is more important than the other.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is pretty obvious that the reason \nthe Senate is so inactive is because the majority leader doesn't want \nto take up any serious bills that are important to the future of the \ncountry. He mentioned cybersecurity. Why isn't it on the floor? Defense \nauthorization: Why isn't it on the floor? Appropriations bills: Why \ndon't we call them up? These are not partisan bills. They are widely \nsupported. They are the basic work of government, including the budget. \nAnd I understand his view is that the Parliamentarian is wrong and that \nwe really did pass a budget. But the budget could be done with a simple \nmajority. The appropriations bills are not partisan in nature. If there \nare differences in the 302(b)s, they could be worked out in conference, \nwhich is the way we did it for years.\n  We have followed the regular order occasionally, and when we have \nSenators have been involved, they were relevant in the process. I will \ngive five examples. The Export-Import Bank reauthorization, trade \nadjustment assistance patent reform, FAA reauthorization, the highway \nbill, and the farm bill are all examples of when Senators were made \nrelevant by the fact that we took up bills that actually came out of \ncommittees, that were worked on by Members of both parties, that were \nbrought up on the floor, amendments were offered, and in the end bills \npassed.\n  The core problem here is that my good friend the majority leader as a \npractical matter is running the whole Senate because everything is \ncentralized in his office, which diminishes the opportunity for \nSenators of both parties to represent their constituents.\n  Look, we all were sent here by different Americans who expected us to \nhave a voice, to have an opportunity to effect legislation.\n  I would say to my good friend the majority leader, we don't have a \nrules problem, we have an attitude problem. When is the Senate going to \nget back to normal?\n  I can recall my friends on the other side saying repeatedly that the \ndifference between the House and Senate is you get to vote; it is not a \ntop-down organization the way the House is, it is really kind of a \nlevel playing field in which the majority leader has a little more \nadvantage than any of the rest of us and the right of first \nrecognition, but really, once a bill is called up, it is a jump ball.\n  What my friend the majority leader is saying is that it is \ninconvenient, it is hard to work with all these Senators who have \ndifferent points of view and want to do different things. Well, heck, \nthat is the way legislation is passed. It is not supposed to be easy, \nand Senators are supposed to have an opportunity to participate.\n  I would argue that in the examples I just cited where Senators did \nparticipate--both in the committee and on the floor--the Senate \nfunctioned the way it used to. And all this talk about rules change is \njust an effort to try to find somebody else to blame for the fact that \nthe Senate has been ruled essentially dysfunctional by 62 efforts by my \ngood friend the majority leader to fill up the tree--in effect, deny \nSenators, both Democrats and Republicans, the opportunity to offer any \namendments he doesn't select. That is the reason we are having this \nproblem. So it doesn't require a rules change, it requires an attitude \nchange. And I sense on both sides of the aisle--this is not just a \nRepublican complaint, I would say to my friend the majority leader. I \nhave talked to a lot of Democrats about this too. They would like to be \nrelevant again, and the way Senators are relevant is for their \ncommittee work to be respected and to be important and to become a part \nof the bill coming out of committee or, if it didn't, an opportunity to \noffer an amendment to effect it on the floor.\n  Sure, we don't have rules of germaneness. We generally are able to \nwork that out. When we were in the majority, we got nongermane \namendments from the Democratic side, and I used to tell my Members that \nthe price of being in the majority is you have to cast votes you don't \nwant to cast because that is the way you get a bill across the floor \nand get it to completion.\n  So I would say to my good friend the majority leader, quit blaming \neverybody else. It is not the House; it is not the Senate; it is not \nthe motion to proceed. Why don't we operate the way we used to under \nleaders of both parties and understand that amendments we don't like \nare just part of the process because everybody here doesn't agree on \neverything? That would be my thought about how to move the Senate \nforward.\n  But at the beginning of this discussion, the majority leader made it \nclear that what he said at the beginning of the Congress is no longer \noperative. It is now his view that the Senate ought to operate like the \nHouse--it ought to operate like the House, with a simple majority. I \nthink that is a mistake. I think that would be a mistake if I were the \nmajority leader and he were the minority leader, which could be the \ncase by the end of the year. And now I will probably have to argue to \nmany of my Members why we shouldn't do what the majority leader was \njust recommending about 6 months before.\n  Let's assume we have a new President and I am the majority leader \nnext time and we are operating at 51. I wonder how comforting that is \nto my friends on the other side. How does it make you feel about the \nsecurity of ObamaCare, for example? I think that is worth thinking \nabout.\n  The Senate has functioned for quite a number of decades without a \nsimple majority threshold for everything we do. It has a good effect \nbecause it brings people together. To do anything in the Senate, you \nhave to have some bipartisan buy-in.\n  My colleagues, do we really want the Senate to become the House? Is \nthat really in the best interests of our country? Do we want a simple \nmajority of 51 to ramrod the minority on every issue? I think it is \nworth thinking about over the next few months as the American people \ndecide who is going to be in the majority in the Senate and who is \ngoing to be the President of the United States.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Republican leader has asked a few \nquestions, so I will proceed to answer.\n  I can remember reading with great interest George Orwell's ``1984'' \nbook where, as you know, it came out that up was down and down was up. \nThe Republican leader is living in a fantasy world if he believes what \nhe said, and I assume he does. That is why two scholars, Mann and \nOrnstein, a couple months ago wrote a book. They have been watching \nWashington for three or four decades, and they said they have over the \nyears been like a lot of people\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\nwho are writers--Democrats did this, Republicans did this--but their \nconclusion was that what has happened in recent years is the \nRepublicans have stopped this body from working by all of their \nshenanigans on these motions to proceed, creating 60 votes where it \nnever existed before.\n  Robert Caro, who is writing the definitive work on Lyndon Johnson, \none of my predecessors, said that I had a very difficult job based on \nhow the Senate has changed with what the Republicans are doing.\n  Now, we have tried mightily. We have gotten a few things done. \nWhenever there is a decision made that they want to help a bill get \npassed, we get it done--for example, the highway bill. That bill took \nso long to get done. We had one major piece of legislation that we \nwaited 4 weeks before they could get it out of their system that \ninstead of doing highways, we should be doing birth control, \ndetermining what birth control women should be entitled to. All of \nthese extraneous issues--important legislation held up. One of the \nRepublicans over here decides they are a better Secretary of State than \nHillary Clinton, holding up major pieces of legislation.\n  So I can take the criticism the Republican leader has issued. I \nassume it is constructive criticism, and I accept that. But I would \njust suggest to my friend that if a Democratic Senator--as the \nPresiding Officer knows--has a problem about anything going on around \nhere, they talk to me. I don't think there is any reason for them to \ntalk to the Republican leader. But if they do that, more power to them.\n  There have been volumes of pieces of legislation that have been \nbrought to a standstill here. Why do we now have a rule that every \nbasic piece of legislation has 60 votes?\n  I had a meeting with Senator Feinstein, Senator Tester, and Senator \nLautenberg. In the course of the conversation, Senator Feinstein looked \nback and said: You know, I had really a controversial amendment dealing \nwith what should happen to assault weapons. That passed on a simple \nmajority vote. No one suggested filibustering that thing to death. That \nis new. That is new--legislation being used as an excuse to stop \nthings.\n  Now, I want the record to be very clear--and I have made it all very \nclear in all of my public statements--about the need to get rid of the \nmotion to proceed. I am not for getting rid of the filibuster rule. It \nis ``1984'' to suggest that I think the House and the Senate should be \nthe same. But I do believe that when the filibuster came into being, it \nwas to help get legislation passed. I repeat: It is now to stop \nlegislation from passing. That is not appropriate.\n  So I am convinced that the best thing to do with filibusters is to \nhave filibusters. I have been involved in a couple of them, and I am \nsure I irritated people on both of them, but I did that. One of them \ndidn't last too long, but the first one lasted 11 or 12 hours. That is \nwhat filibusters are supposed to be, not throwing monkey wrenches into \ndecisions we are trying to make and then walking off the floor.\n  The rules have to be changed. I acknowledge that, and I don't \napologize for it for 1 second.\n  As far as how I attempt to run the Senate, I do the best I can under \nvery difficult circumstances, as indicated by the two writers Mann and \nOrnstein.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, most people think a filibuster is a \nlot of talking to stop the bill from passing. In fact, cloture is to \nend debate. And what we have had here on at least 62 occasions while \nthe majority leader was running the Senate are examples of times when \nSenators were not allowed to talk, not allowed to offer amendments, and \nnot allowed to participate in the process. Cloture is frequently used \nin order to advance a measure, but, as you can imagine, when Senators \nhave no opportunity to have any input, it tends to create the opposite \nreaction.\n  But what is all of this really about? It is about making an excuse \nfor a completely unproductive Senate, much of which could have been \ndone with simple 51 votes, passing a budget, and not even bringing up \nbills that we all want to act on--all the appropriations bills, the \nDefense authorization bill. And on the rare occasions when the majority \nleader has turned to a measure that Senators have been involved in \ndeveloping, we have come to the floor, we have had amendments, we have \nhad votes, and the bills have passed. That is the way the Senate used \nto operate.\n  So this isn't a rules problem, this is a making-excuse argument to \ntry to blame somebody else for the lack of productivity of a Senate \nthat I sense on a bipartisan basis would like to be a lot more \nproductive, which would involve the use of Senators' talents, speaking \nability, voting, and debating on the floor of the Senate.\n  Since when did that go out of fashion?\n  Yes, we have a big difference of opinion about the way this place is \nbeing run. It is not a rules problem; it is an attitude problem. It is \na looking for somebody else to blame game.\n  I say to my friend the majority leader, I think what we need to do is \nget busy with the serious business confronting the American people. \nWhere is the Defense authorization bill? Where are the appropriations \nbills? Don't blame it on the House. Don't blame it on Senate \nRepublicans. We want to go to these bills. Our Members have been \ninvolved in developing this legislation. In the Armed Services \nCommittee, in the Appropriations subcommittees, Senate Republicans are \ninvolved in developing that legislation. We would like to see it \nbrought up on the floor, debated, and considered.\n  What is more important than funding the government? What is more \nimportant than the Defense authorization bill? Why isn't it on the \nfloor? That is my question to the majority leader.\n  We can have the rules debate later, and apparently we will, but why \naren't we doing anything now is my question for my friend the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I think this best can be answered in my \nnot responding directly but quoting. This is from an op-ed that \nappeared around the country by Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein. \n``Let's just say it,'' is the headline, ``The Republicans are the \nproblem.''\n  I am quoting:\n\n       Rep. Allen West, a Florida Republican, was recently \n     captured on video asserting that there are ``78 to 81'' \n     Democrats in Congress who are members of the Communist Party. \n     Of course, it's not unusual for some renegade lawmaker from \n     either side of the aisle to say something outrageous. What \n     made West's comment--right out of the McCarthyite playbook of \n     the 1950s--so striking was the almost complete lack of \n     condemnation from Republican congressional leaders or other \n     major party figures, including the remaining presidential \n     candidates.\n       It's not that the GOP leadership agrees with West; it is \n     that such extreme remarks and views are now taken for \n     granted.\n\n  Understand, Ornstein works for the American Enterprise Institute, a \nconservative think tank. They go on to say:\n\n       The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American \n     politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of \n     compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, \n     evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its \n     political opposition.\n\n  I am a legislator. I have been doing it for 30 years here and for \nquite a few years in Nevada prior to getting here. I have enjoyed being \na legislator. These last few years, because of what we hear from \nOrnstein and Mann, has made it very unpleasant. For the Republican \nleader, with a straight face, to come and say: Why aren't we doing the \nDefense authorization bill? Why aren't we doing appropriations bills, \neveryone knows why we are not doing them. They have not let us get to \nvirtually anything. To be dismissive of me because I say the Republican \nleadership in the House has been dismissive of the law we have guiding \nthis country, I think says it all. I recognize we are a bicameral \nlegislature. We have our own things to do. But we have to take this as \na whole and look at the record--major pieces of legislation we cannot \nget to.\n  For example, we cannot get to something dealing with outsourcing of \njobs. We are here filibustering a motion to proceed to that--a motion \nto proceed to it, not the substance of the legislation, a motion to \nproceed to it.\n  The record speaks for itself. The record speaks for itself:\n\n       We have been studying Washington politics and Congress for \n     more than 40 years, and never have we seen them this \n     dysfunctional. In our past writings, we have criticized both \n     parties when we believed it was warranted. Today, however, we \n     have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the \n     problem lies with the Republican Party.\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\n       The GOP--\n\n  The Grand Old Party, the Republican Party--\n\n     has become an insurgent outlier in American politics. It is \n     ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by \n     conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; \n     and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The reason I am having a hard time restraining my \nlaugher, I actually know Norm Ornstein and Tom Mann. They are ultra \nultraliberals. Norm Ornstein is the house liberal over at the American \nEnterprise Institute. Their problem with the Senate is the Democrats \ndon't have 60 votes anymore. Their problem is the Republicans control \nthe House. Their views about dysfunctionality of the Senate carry no \nweight, certainly with me. I know they have an ideological agenda, \nalways have, and usually admit it--although it is cloaked in this \nparticular instance.\n  But I think the best way to wrap it up is nobody else is keeping the \nmajority leader from calling up the appropriations bills, from calling \nup the Defense authorization bill, from calling up a budget. That is \nhis responsibility. He has a unique role in this institution. He has \nthe opportunity to set the agenda, and just because all 100 Senators do \nnot immediately fall into line--and it may be a little bit difficult to \ngo forward--is no excuse for not doing the important and basic work the \nAmerican people sent us to do. It is time to bring up serious \nlegislation that affects the future of the country that the American \npeople expect us to act on and not expect 100 Senators to all agree on \nevery piece of legislation from the outset.\n  Passing bills is inevitably difficult but not impossible. That has \nbeen demonstrated on at least five occasions when the majority leader \nallowed the committees to function, allowed the Senate floor to \nfunction, allowed Members to have amendments, and we got a result.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in one committee, the Energy and Water \nCommittee led by Senator Bingaman--that committee alone has had \nhundreds of pieces of legislation held up. It can't get out of the \ncommittee. I am sorry it is an unusual thing to have Ornstein and Mann \nreferred to as liberals, but whatever they are, working for the \nconservative American Enterprise Institute, one of them at least--it is \nvery clear they view this body as being in deep trouble because of the \nRepublicans being dysfunctional themselves.\n  I think it is very clear we have a situation--I understand there is a \nPresidential election going on. I clearly understand that. I know there \nare efforts to protect their nominee. We do what we can to protect the \nPresident of the United States. But that should not prevent us from \nlegislating.\n  For my friend, who has been on the Appropriations Committee as long \nas I have, to talk about why aren't we doing appropriations bills--it \nis obvious. We have 12 or 13 appropriations bills. We have simply not \nbeen able to get to the appropriations bills----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Have you tried calling up any of them?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't think it calls for my being \ninterrupted. I have listened patiently to all his name calling and I do \nnot intend to do that. But I do say this. I have tried to call up lots \nof things--lots of things, by consent or by filing motions, and \nvirtually everything has been held up. The bills he is talking about, \nto stand here and boast about passing five pieces of legislation in an \nentire Congress is not anything any of us should be happy about. We \nshould not be happy about that at all. We should be passing scores of \npieces of legislation, as we did in the last Congress.\n  But, no, the decision was made at the beginning of this Congress--it \nmay not be a direct quote but substantively accurate--my friend the \nRepublican leader said his No. 1 goal is to stop Obama from being \nreelected, and that is what this legislation we have tried to get \nforward has had, the barrel we tried to get around continually. We are \ngoing to go ahead. We will have cloture tomorrow on another one of our \nscores of times we have tried to break cloture this Congress and move \non to something else. We have had 13 cloture votes on motions to \nproceed in the second session of the Congress alone--13. Others just \nwent away because we run out of time to do those kinds of things.\n  As indicated by the Republican leader, we passed five things. That is \nabout one-third of the motions I have had to file to invoke cloture on \nmotions to proceed, not on basic legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Just one final point on that. The reason it has been \ndifficult to get on bills is we cannot have an agreement with the \nmajority leader to let us have amendments once we do get on the bill. \nSo the reaction on this side is, if the majority leader is not going to \nlet us have amendments, if the only result of invoking cloture on a \nmotion to proceed is that he fills the tree and doesn't allow us to \noffer any amendments, why would we want to do that? All this is much \nmore easily avoided than you think.\n  The majority leader is basically trying to convince the American \npeople it is somebody else's fault that the Senate is not doing the \nbasic work of government. Regardless of the blame game, the results are \napparent: no budget, no appropriations bills, no Defense authorization. \nWe are not doing the basic work of government and that ought to stop. \nIt is within the purview of the majority leader to determine what bill \nwe try to turn to, and just because it may be occasionally difficult to \nget to a bill, particularly when the majority leader will not say we \ncan have amendments, is no good excuse for not trying. We spend days \nsitting around when we could be processing amendments and working on \nbills. All we would need is an indication from the majority leader that \nthese bills are going to be open for amendment. We tried that a few \ntimes and it worked quite well. It is amazing how the Senate can \nfunction when Members are allowed to participate, offer amendments, get \nvotes, and move forward. I recommend we try that more often.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are where we are. I think it is very \nclear from outside sources--take, for example, I repeat what Caro said, \nwriting the definitive work of Lyndon Johnson, about the difficult job \nI have had because of the way the Senate has changed because of what \nhas taken place in the last couple years. We have had bills we have \nbeen able to work things out with, with Republicans. That is pleasant, \nand I am glad we have been able to do that. Most of the time we cannot \ndo that. We have, for example, one Republican Senator, when we are in \ntense negotiations with Pakistan on a lot of very sensitive issues, who \nwants to do something that is outside the scope of rational thinking, \nwhich holds up legislation. We have had--we have tried very hard all \ndifferent ways to move legislation in this body. For the first time in \nthe history of the country, the No. 1 issue in the Senate of the United \nStates has been a procedural matter: How do we get on a bill? A motion \nto proceed to something--that has taken over the Senate and it needs to \ngo away. We should not have to do that anymore.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the final thing I would say is just \nlast week the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye, \nsaid his committee has been working hard to have the bills ready to go. \nTo date, the panel has cleared 9 of 12 annual bills. Senator Inouye is \nquoted, on July 10, just last week, ``After putting us all to work like \nthis I expect some of these bills to pass.''\n  I recommend that my good friend the majority leader heed the advice \nof the chairman of the Appropriations Committee of his party, let's \npass some appropriations bills.\n  Mr. REID. I do not have a better friend in this body than the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. I have been one of his big \nfans. He has been one of my big fans. He, of course, is a national \nhero, a Medal of Honor winner, and great chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. We work hand in glove. Everything I have said about the \nappropriations process will be underscored, will be and has been, by \nSenator Inouye. He supports what we are unable to do. He realizes that. \nHe realizes his counterpart in the House has fumbled with the numbers \nand it makes it extremely difficult to get things done. We understand \nthat.\n  But the main problem is we cannot get legislation on the floor \nbecause the No. 1 issue we have talked about in the Senate this entire \nCongress is how to get on a bill, and that is why the motion to proceed \nmust go away.\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. A good example of the problem is the bill we are on \nright now. The Stabenow bill bypassed the committee entirely. It was \nintroduced a week ago and placed on the calendar. This is not the way \nlegislation is normally done. It is crafted in somebody's office. Rule \nXIV is brought up by the majority leader. I expect it has something to \ndo with the campaign. We spent a week on it when we could have done the \nDOD authorization bill. Chairman Inouye says: Where are the \nappropriations bills?\n  That is my point.\n  What are we doing here? Is the Senate a messaging machine or are we \ndoing the basic work of government? We are not doing the basic work of \ngovernment, but we can change. There are a vast majority of Senators of \nboth parties who would like to become relevant, who would like to \nparticipate in the legislative process, and who would like to do the \nbasic work of governing.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, one of the most important issues facing \nAmerica today is jobs being shipped overseas. Whether it is Olympic \nuniforms being made in China when they could be made by Hickey Freeman \nin New York and made here in America, outsourcing is an important piece \nof America that we now have to deal with. And, of course, we have the \nadditional problem that Governor Romney has made a fortune shipping \njobs overseas.\n  The American people care about this issue. We can sit here and point \nfingers and say: Boy, that is terrible. We are now going to have to \ndeal with outsourcing. We should deal with outsourcing. We should have \ndone it before, but we have had a problem getting legislation on the \nSenate floor. So I don't apologize to anyone for having the debate on \noutsourcing. Senator Stabenow has done a wonderful job on that. We \ncouldn't have a better Senator to deal with outsourcing than her. \nBecause of what we did in the stimulus bill, the American Recovery Act \ndirected jobs back to Michigan, Detroit, and other places. With what we \ndid with batteries, billions of dollars were saved. Instead of \nimporting batteries, we are making most of them in America.\n  Governor Romney wanted to just let General Motors and Chrysler go \nbankrupt. We didn't do that, and as a result, that created almost \n200,000 jobs in the automobile industry alone. Outsourcing is \nimportant, and it is a debate we are going to have.\n  Let me remind the Republican leader it wasn't Democrats who \nthreatened to shut down government last year and took most all the time \nwe had. First, it was the debt ceiling, and then after we got through \nthe debt ceiling, then they weren't going to allow us to do anything \nfor getting funding to take us through the end of the fiscal year.\n  It was the Republican Party last year that threatened to default the \ndebt we have as a country. Now they are holding up tax cuts for 98 \npercent of the American people in an effort to satisfy this mysterious \nman I have never met, but he must be a dandy. He has gotten every \nRepublican, with rare exception, to sign a pledge that they are not \ngoing to deal with the 98 percent because they have to protect the 2 \npercent.\n  We are here dealing with outsourcing because that is what we should \nbe doing.\n\n\n                     Reservation of Leadership Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved. Under the previous order, the following \nhour will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees, with the majority controlling the first half and the \nRepublicans controlling the final half.\n\n\n                       Wind Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I am here on the Senate floor \nurging my colleagues in both parties to extend the production tax \ncredit for wind as soon as possible. I listened with great interest to \nthe discussion the majority leader and the Republican leader just had, \nand as the majority leader just said, to focus--as it should be--on \njobs and the economy. This is a way in which we can enhance job \ncreation and make sure our economy continues to grow; that is, by \nextending the production tax credit.\n  This tax credit is also critical to the maintenance of our economic \nleadership when it comes to clean energy technologies. Every day I have \ncome to the floor of the Senate to talk about a different State and the \nefforts that are underway in those States. I look forward to talking \nabout the Presiding Officer's State at some point in the future. Today \nI want to talk about the Buckeye State, Ohio.\n  Many families and businesses in Colorado and across our country are \nstill struggling in this economic downturn even though we have seen \nsome signs of improvement. This is especially true in Ohio. Over the \nlast couple of decades, Ohio has been plagued by outsourcing and \nlayoffs, which is one of the things we want to prevent by way of \nSenator Stabenow's bill. Those layoffs and outsourcing have cost \nOhioans thousands of jobs. It looked as though we literally devastated \nthe manufacturing base of one of the world's best manufacturing bases \nin the State of Ohio. But in recent years the wind industry has helped \nturn that around.\n  We can see on the map of Ohio that these green circles show all of \nthe activity tied to the wind industry in Ohio. That renewal, if you \nwill, is tied to Ohio's long history as a manufacturing powerhouse. \nThere are dozens of manufacturing facilities that have retooled to \nbuild wind turbines across Ohio, while in the process employing \nthousands of hard-working middle-class Americans. We can see that those \nmanufacturing skills easily transfer to the wind industry. PTC has been \nkey to this and has created those incentives that allowed the \nmanufacturing history of Ohio to take center stage.\n  I wanted to specifically talk about what is happening in Ohio. When \nwe think about the wind industry, it is not just the building of the \ntowers, the blades, and the cells, but there are maintenance needs. \nThey have support sectors and a supply chain that results in the \nmanufacturing of some 8,000 parts.\n  In Ohio, 6,000 jobs are tied to the wind energy industry, and that is \n50 different companies that have created those jobs. Here is an area \nthat is of real interest as well: $2.5 million in property tax payments \nresult to local governments. That is money that helps fund schools, \nroads, and other basic services.\n  It is important to focus too on the people to whom we are alluding. I \nwant to focus on one of the 6,000 employed Ohioans who has been a \nbeneficiary of the tangible effect of wind PTC, and that is Jeff \nGrabner. He is a wind product sales manager for Cardinal Fasteners in \nCleveland, OH. He was originally born in Ohio, but he left Ohio. He \nreturned to Ohio when the wind industry started looking for talented \npeople in the State, and he has been working now for almost 6 years in \nthe wind industry.\n  Cardinal's Cleveland facility employs almost 55 people. It has been \nin operation for 30 years. Cardinal used to supply the construction \nindustry, but the demand fell off in recent years. Now this growth in \nthe wind industry presented them with an entirely new market. The \nfactory is retooled and now supplies fasteners, which is the superglue \nthat holds a wind turbine together. In fact, thousands of fasteners \nwere used in every wind turbine to keep them standing and operating \nsecurely.\n  I don't think I have to say that Jeff loves his job at Cardinal, and \nbecause of it he is able to provide for his own growing family. In \nfact, he and his wife are about to celebrate their 1-year wedding \nanniversary this week. All of that could change if we don't extend the \nwind production tax credit.\n  Orders for wind turbines are down 98 percent from last year in large \npart because of the uncertainty tied to the market. Without new orders, \nCardinal and other manufacturers like it may be forced to shut down and \nlet people like Jeff go.\n  That is why I am back on the Senate floor today urging my colleagues \nto pass the wind production tax credit now. The PTC equals jobs. We \nshould pass it and extend it as soon as possible. It is a commonsense \nbipartisan measure. It has strong support across our country. Not only \nhas it shown that we can turn around manufacturing in States like Ohio, \nbut it has shown us that we can outcompete China and other countries. \nIf we want to continue to lead and then win the global economic race--\nand, specifically, the clean energy race--it is now\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\ntime for us to listen to the people of Ohio and Utah and South Carolina \nand New York.\n  This shouldn't be a partisan issue. This is an issue on which \nAmericans expect us to work together. We must pass an extension of the \nproduction tax credit as soon as possible.\n  As I close, I want everybody to know I will be back on the Senate \nfloor tomorrow to talk about wind production in another State, and I \nwill keep pushing for this commonsense policy. Let's pass this as soon \nas possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \ntoday. I am following the Senator from the State of Colorado. My topic \nis also about manufacturing jobs in the United States. I thank the \nSenator from Colorado for coming to the Senate floor every day and \nreminding us of the importance of the consequences of the choices we \nmake, whether it is the tax policy choice of failing to extend the \nproduction tax credit and the consequences for high-quality \nmanufacturing jobs in the wind industry or the consequences for \nmanufacturing all across our country, including the great State of New \nYork, the State of Colorado, or the State of Delaware.\n  What we are on the Senate floor talking about is the Bring Jobs Home \nAct, which is just one of the many important ways we can and should be \nfighting for high-quality manufacturing jobs in our home States and \nacross our country.\n  It was a very dark day when the Chrysler plant in Newark, DE, where I \nam from, shut its doors. It was built in the early 1950s first as a \ntank plant and then converted to an auto plant. This was a \nmanufacturing facility that had sustained whole communities over \nseveral generations with high-quality, highly-skilled, and highly paid \nmanufacturing jobs. In December of 2008, they closed their doors for \nthe very last time, and that plant has now been torn down to the \nground. It is an empty hole in the heart of the city of Newark.\n  We thought it couldn't have gotten any worse than the day that those \nthousands of workers filed out of the plant for the very last time, but \nit did just a few short months later when the General Motors plant--a \nfew miles away in Boxwood--shuttered its doors.\n  In just a year Delaware went from having two high-performing, high-\nquality auto plants to none. We lost nearly 3,000 middle-class \nmanufacturing jobs, and this was followed by a whole constellation of \nother plant closings from Avon, which lost hundreds of jobs to dozens \nof smaller manufacturers that had supported these auto plants for \ndecades.\n  I know 3,000 jobs may not sound like a lot in the wreckage of the \nrecession of 2008 to this whole country, but for Delawareans, for our \nsmall State, and for all the families who were supported for so long, \nit was huge.\n  I have an idea that I talk about all the time at home in Delaware; \nthat is, we need to get back to ``Made in America'' and ``Manufactured \nin Delaware.'' That means something to us. Back in 1985 when I was just \nfinishing school, transportation equipment manufacturing--which is the \nfancy way of saying making cars and all the stuff that goes in them--\nemployed 10,000 people in Delaware. Today it is well below one-tenth of \nthat.\n  Made in America and manufactured in Delaware has to mean something \nfor our families, for our communities, and for our future. Delaware was \nonce a great and strong manufacturing State, as America was once the \ngreatest manufacturing Nation on Earth. Some believe those days are \nbehind us, but I do not.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Debbie Stabenow from Michigan, the lead \nsponsor of the bill we are debating, the Bringing Jobs Home Act, also \ndoes not believe our future as a world-class, world-leading \nmanufacturer is behind us. I know the people of Michigan, the people of \nNew York, and the people of Delaware do not.\n  I had the great opportunity this morning to visit with two leaders of \nDelaware-based manufacturers whom I just wanted to lift up for a moment \nas we talk about the Bring Jobs Home Act. Marty Miller, the CEO of \nMiller Metal in Bridgeville, DE, has had a little heralded program \nknown as the manufacturing extension partnership that helps small \nmanufacturers streamline their production processes, reduce waste and \ninefficiency, do their ordering and throughput far more effectively, \nand compete head-to-head around the world successfully. This \nmanufacturing extension partnership has allowed Marty's company to grow \nby 25 jobs in just the last year and to compete head to head with \nChinese metal fabricating plants in the global market, and win.\n  ILC Dover has been known to Delawareans for its storied history in \nour space program. They made all the spacesuits for NASA. But they have \nalso made blimps that have hovered over Iraq and Afghanistan and \nprotected our troops with downward-looking radar and real-time \ninformation, and they make the escape hoods and the masks that actually \nare positioned around the periphery of this Chamber and throughout this \nbuilding and at the Pentagon. They have made remarkable high quality \nsoft goods for decades and they too have a promising future and the \nopportunity to grow even in this recovery because they too are focused \non things made in America and manufactured in Delaware.\n  These two companies, these two men, the organizations they lead, are, \nin my view, just an introduction to what can and should be a \nrenaissance, a recovery, of manufacturing in the United States. We \nstill produce more in dollar value in manufacturing than any country on \nEarth, but there has been a downward slope in the number of jobs and in \nthe sense of energy and investment and focus in our policy and in our \npriorities in manufacturing for years.\n  I think we can become a great manufacturing Nation again and our \nmiddle class can be stronger than ever, but we have to make smarter \nchoices. We have to make smarter choices in our Tax Code. We have to \nlook at our Tax Code with an eye toward fairness and investment for the \nfuture and not just short-term profitability. We need common sense and \nwe need, in my view, to support companies that are creating jobs here, \nand we need to cut our support for companies that instead want to \ncreate jobs in China, in India, in Vietnam, in Thailand, by exporting \njobs from the United States.\n  As our economy pulls back out of what has been a devastating \nrecession, I can think of no more galling idea than this country \nincentivizing American companies to ship some of our best jobs \noverseas. Yet, as the Presiding Officer knows, our current Tax Code \nallows businesses to deduct the cost of moving expenses, including \npermits and license fees, lease brokerage fees, equipment installation \ncosts, and certain other expenses. A company can take this deduction if \nthey are moving from Bridgeville, DE, to Birmingham, AL, but it also \nturns out they can take it if they are moving to Bridgeville from \nBangalore or Beijing. Can any of us think of a worse way to spend tax \ndollars? This is a loophole so big we could drive a car through it, \nright out of the shuttered manufacturing plants of Delaware.\n  Fixing the injustice of our Tax Code is the first half of the Bring \nJobs Home Act. We say: We are not going to pay anymore for companies \nthat send U.S. jobs overseas. We have better ways to invest our tax \ndollars in rebuilding the base of manufacturing and the high-quality, \nhigh-paying jobs that come from them.\n  The second thing this bill does is instead of incentivizing the \noutsourcing of American jobs, we incentivize insourcing. We say: Bring \nthese jobs home. The Bring Jobs Home Act says a company can keep the \ndeduction to help pay moving costs if they are moving from one facility \nin the United States to another. That is fine. They can still use the \nmoving cost deduction if they are moving from a facility abroad back to \nthe United States. That is better. But this bill takes a further step. \nWe say: If companies bring jobs home to the United States, we will give \nthem an additional 20-percent tax credit on the costs associated with \nmoving that production back to the United States.\n  The message of this bill is straightforward: If you are an American \ncompany and you have manufacturing jobs or service jobs that could be \ndone by Americans, we want you to bring those jobs home, and we are \ngoing to help you do it.\n  For my small State, I want to keep saying every chance I get that \nwhat we\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\nwant is made in America and manufactured in Delaware. Lord knows we \nhave the workforce. There is an army of talented Delawareans, of \nAmericans, ready to go. Ford knows it; Caterpillar knows it; GE knows \nit. As we have heard from Senator Stabenow, that is why they have \nbrought jobs home. They are opening new plants in the United States and \nputting Americans back to work.\n  There is a company in Newark, DE, called FMC BioPolymer. They make \nspecialty chemicals. They have run a factory in Newark, DE, for 50 \nyears--in fact, exactly 50 years this year. They make a type of \ncellulose we find in everyday products such as foods, pharmaceuticals, \ncosmetics, and cleaning products. They had outsourced some of their \nmanufacturing to China to save costs. But as we can imagine, when a \ncompany is working with these sorts of advanced products that go into \nconsumer products, safety is key. So for performance and engineering \nand intellectual property and safety reasons, they brought some of \ntheir most critical jobs home. They employ more than 100 people and \ncontribute more than $20 million to our local economy every year, and \nit is an important part of our economy. So to FMC BioPolymer, I say \nthank you for bringing jobs home and strengthening made in America, \nmanufactured in Delaware.\n  If big companies and small companies are figuring this out, when will \nthe Federal Government, when will this Congress figure it out as well?\n  The best thing we can do for our economy--for millions of talented \nAmericans looking for work, from our returning veterans to those who \nhave searched so hard for work for the last 2 or 3 years, is to invest \nin them. We can pass the Bring Jobs Home Act as a smart choice to \ninvest in American workers and their communities, to invest in their \neducation, in their schools and in their teachers, to invest in our \ninfrastructure and our roads and our power grid, to make smarter \nchoices as a country and a Congress. There is no better investment I \ncan think of than to make this phrase real, to return to Made in \nAmerica and manufactured in the States of every one of the Senators of \nthis great body.\n  This is common sense. But, alas, in the Senate, common sense these \ndays rarely seems to win the day. I hope those watching and I hope \nthose whom we represent take this seriously and recognize that the most \nimportant question before us is what are we going to do to take the \nfight in the global economy, on behalf of our families, on behalf of \nour communities, on behalf of our manufacturers, and change things in \nour Tax Code, in our trade policy, in our intellectual property policy, \nto make it possible to not just invent things here and make them \nelsewhere but to invent them here and make them here.\n  I hope this body will proceed to vote in favor of the Bring Jobs Home \nAct so that for every one of our home States we can make this phrase \ntrue--that we want things made in America and manufactured in our home \nStates.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Madam President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the remainder of the majority's time be reserved for use following \nthe Republicans' 30 minutes of controlled time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with some of my colleagues on the minority side for 30 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I will yield to Mr. Wicker who I believe has a unanimous \nconsent request as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, we have heard our colleagues talking \nabout jobs. Clearly, that needs to be the No. 1 priority in the country \ntoday, and it needs to be domestic jobs.\n  The private sector is not doing just fine. The answer to the problems \nwe face is not more government jobs, it is more private sector jobs, \nand the numbers aren't good anywhere we look, any way we look. In fact, \nif we look at the last 3 months in the country, more people signed up \nfor disability than new jobs were created. More people signed up for \ndisability than new jobs were created. More people decided they were \ngoing to opt out of the workforce because of disability reasons than \npeople who got jobs.\n  We are here talking about things that have minimal impact on the \neconomy when we could be talking about things that have lots of impact \non the economy: good energy policy, good tax policy, good regulatory \npolicy. As long as this uncertainty continues or as long as there is \nsubstantial certainty that all of those things are going to begin to \nwork against job creators, people aren't going to create jobs.\n  This week we voted twice on something called the DISCLOSE Act that \nhad absolutely no chance of becoming law this year and everybody on \nthis floor knew it. What we ought to be disclosing is what our budget \nwould look like. The Senate hasn't had a budget in 3 years and the law \nalready requires that. The law already requires a significant \ndisclosure on the part of the Senate, and that is disclosing how we are \ngoing to spend the money. The Senate of the United States, for the \nfirst time in the history of the Budget Control Act, 3 years ago--the \nsecond time 2 years ago and the third time this year--has decided we \nare not going to obey the law. One of the leaders was asked: Why aren't \nyou having a budget? He said: Well, we would be politically foolish to \nsay what we are for.\n  What kind of responsible position is that?\n  The other way we could disclose things is we could have the \nappropriations bills on the floor. The House has a budget. The House \nhas passed half of the appropriations bills already. We haven't had a \nsingle bill on the floor, and the majority leader announced last week \nthat we wouldn't have an appropriations bill on the floor before the \nelection. Why is it we don't want to say before the election what we \nare for? Why is it we don't want to say before the election how we are \ngoing to spend the people's money? Why is it we don't want to say \nbefore the election what the budget would be? Even before the last \nelection, the Senate wouldn't say what the budget would be, so we don't \nhave one.\n  When we don't have a plan, we plan to fail. Clearly, the economy is \ndoing exactly that. Statistic after statistic is not what the American \npeople would want them to be. Housing prices are down. Unemployment is \nup. The labor group of people who want to be in the economy is at a 30-\nyear low. If we had the same number of people looking for jobs who were \nlooking for jobs and had jobs in January of 2009, the unemployment rate \nwould be over 11 percent. The only reason the unemployment is 8.2 \npercent is because so many people have given up on the economy. Nobody \nthinks we have fewer working-aged people than we had when Ronald Reagan \nwas President, but the labor force we are counting is smaller than at \nany time since Ronald Reagan was President.\n  There must be some big problem or people would be out looking for \njobs. People would be out finding jobs. People would want to be part of \nan economy that they see as faltering. We are talking about little \nthings instead of big things while the big things that affect America \nare dramatically affecting American families and American job creators.\n  The President is telling small businesses that if their business was \nsuccessful, it wasn't because of them; it was because of all kinds of \nother factors that they happened to take advantage of. No small \nbusinessperson in America believes that. Nobody who ever opened the \ndoor to a business on the first day and put their phone number in the \nphone book the first day and said, ``Call me; I can provide these \nservices for you,'' thinks they weren't successful because of their \nwork.\n  I wish to turn to my friend, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. \nWicker, to speak on these issues as well. There are so many things we \ncould be talking about today, but clearly jobs and the economy are \ncritical to American families.\n  Mr. WICKER. Absolutely. I thank my friend for leading us in this \ncolloquy. We ought to be talking about jobs and the economy. We ought \nto be bringing\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\nlegislation to the floor and giving our side an opportunity to offer \nsuggestions and hearing if the majority party in this Senate has \nsomething to offer other than the 3\\1/2\\ years of failed policies.\n  Their intentions are absolutely honorable. Everyone wants to create \njobs. Everyone wants the unemployment rate to go down. But I think any \nfair observer would have to conclude that after 3\\1/2\\ years, the \npolicies of the majority party in this body, the policies of the Obama \nadministration, have been an utter failure--forty consecutive months of \nunemployment over 8 percent. The latest numbers were 8.2 percent. The \nlast time we had a comparable sustained period of joblessness was World \nWar II. It is absolutely unbelievable that the policies of our \nDemocratic friends have been so unsuccessful and such a failure.\n  To put that in context, in September of 2008, we had a severe crisis \nbecause of the subprime loans, because of the excesses of Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, which a lot of us who have been in the Congress for \nsome time have tried to rein in. Because of that subprime crisis, \nunemployment went through the roof, the economy crashed.\n  The other crisis we had earlier than that, of course, was September \n11, 2001, when the terrorists attacked the very heartland and soul of \nthe United States of America--the Twin Towers, the Pentagon. In 2001 we \nhad a spike in unemployment and our economy went in the tank.\n  Between that time, though, I think Americans should realize we did \nnot have exactly everything we wanted in terms of job growth, but \nunemployment between 2002 and the middle of 2007 actually averaged \nbetween 4.5 percent unemployment and 6 percent unemployment. We were \nnot happy with that then, but wouldn't we love to have that level of \nunemployment now rather than the 8.2 percent and the over 8 percent we \nhave sustained for 40 straight months.\n  As a matter of fact, Americans need to remember this does not have to \nbe the case, the 8.2 percent. As late as October 2007, the unemployment \nrate in this country was 4.4 percent. We can do that again, but we will \nnot do it again with the failed policies the President and his party \nhave been imposing on our country during their entire stewardship.\n  The Senator from Missouri mentioned it has been 8 percent or higher, \nand the effective rate is 11 percent if everybody who had left the job \nforce came back trying to get a job. Actually, the unemployment rate in \nthe African-American community is 15 percent--an astounding and \nshameful figure.\n  The Obama stimulus program failed. It cost us over $800 billion, and \nwe are going to have to pay that back somehow, but it failed. The \nunemployment rate for 40 straight months remains above 8 percent. Dodd-\nFrank failed. The Affordable Care Act not only has made health care \nless affordable and less available, but it has failed to stimulate any \njobs.\n  Then yesterday, as a member of the Banking Committee, I heard \ntestimony, and this country heard testimony, from the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve. Basically, he said he has lowered the economic \nexpectations. He and the rest of the Federal Reserve now say the \neconomy is going to get worse than they expected in January of this \nyear, and the unemployment rate will be above 7 percent in his \nestimation, even at the end of calendar year 2014. That would be 6 \nstraight years, under these current policies--unless we change our \napproach to job creation--that would be 6 straight years of \nunemployment higher than it ever was during the first 7 years even of \nthe Bush administration.\n  We have some ideas about how to turn that around: an American-made \nenergy policy; ending this regime of overregulation, which is just such \na wet blanket on job creation; and ending the situation we have now of \nthe tax burden on job creators. The tax burden on American risk takers \nis now higher than on any of our allies in the industrialized world. We \nhit job creators and risk takers and the people we want to help us with \nthis 8.2-percent unemployment rate. We hit them harder than they do in \nany other country in the industrialized world.\n  So we have some ideas. We would like an honest-to-goodness jobs bill, \nand we would like the majority leader to give us a vote on some \namendments. Do not just call up a bill, fill up the tree, offer every \namendment you could possibly offer on the Democratic side, file \ncloture, and call that a filibuster. We need to go back to regular \norder in this Senate and let's offer some ideas. Let's have a debate \nagain on this Senate floor about some ideas we have about job creation.\n  So I am glad to join my colleagues. I see my friend from Georgia in \nthe Chamber, and I know he has been very thoughtful about this issue.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi.\n  I rise to talk about something I know something about, which \nsometimes in the Senate we do not do very often. I ran a small business \nfor 22 years. I worked in a small business for 33 years. Quite frankly, \nI think I understand small business as well as anyone who has done it.\n  I was astounded, disappointed, and perplexed with the President's \nstatement last week that small business did not owe its success to \nitself, but it owed it to government, because it is the other way \naround. We would not exist as a Senate were it not for the taxpayers of \nthe United States of America. They send us our cashflow, they send us \nthe money we invest to build the roads and bridges and highways. So it \nis an affront to those who have risked capital, as Senator Wicker said, \nthose who have taken chances, and those who have succeeded and those \nwho have failed to build small businesses, to employ the American \npeople, to make this great engine of America work.\n  But I want to just go down a litany for a second of what small \nbusiness does to make us exist as a Congress and as a government. Every \nJanuary 15, April 15, June 15, and September 15 businesses pay their \nquarterly estimate on their taxes. So do independent contractors. \nEmployees pay it every month in withholdings. The cashflow of the \nUnited States is not owed to the government; it is owed to the American \npeople by the contributions they make.\n  Social Security. Every beneficiary of Social Security for their \nentire life paid 6.2 percent of their income, and their employer \nmatched it with another 6.2 percent, up to $102,500 in income.\n  Medicare. With no cap whatsoever, 1.35 percent of your income from \nday one to the day you die goes to the Medicare trust fund.\n  Talking about medicine for a second, many small businesses--19 \npercent of American jobs are in health care now. They now have device \ntaxes. If a small business is building an implant for dental work or \nsomething for some kind of a heart treatment or something like that, \nthey have an extra tax because of the affordable health care bill. For \nthose who pay dividends or pay out investment income to their \ninvestors, they have a new surtax to help pay for the Affordable Care \nAct. Then we have our ordinary income tax that we all pay on April 15. \nFor our highways, when we fill up our tanks with gas, we pay the motor \nfuel tax to build our highways. And for our airports, we pay the \npassenger facility charge that goes to the government to reinvest in \nour infrastructure.\n  So it sounds to me as if it is us who owe small business, not small \nbusiness that owes us. I think if we began acting like people who \nunderstood from whence comes our strength, America would begin to come \nback.\n  As Senator Wicker said about Mr. Bernanke yesterday, his downward \nforecast is because business is not deploying capital. People are not \nmaking investments. As one who did that, there is one simple reason. We \nare a nation of uncertainty. Nobody knows what the boundaries are going \nto be or what the policy is going to be on January 1.\n  Let me close with one example. On January 1, the estate tax goes back \nfrom a $5 million unified credit and exemption and 35-percent rate to a \n$1 million unified credit and a 55-percent rate. Do you know what that \nis going to do? That is going to close thousands of small businesses \neventually around America because when a small business is owned by a \nfamily--a family farm in Mississippi or Georgia--when the\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\nowner of that farm dies, and they go to pass their assets on to their \nheirs, after that $1 million deduction, they owe a 55-percent tax on \nthe rest. Most of their value is in real estate and land, which is \ndepressed. They are forced to liquidate land at suppressed prices to \npay an income tax within 9 months of death. That is wrong and that \nshould not happen. But if--as Senator Murray said yesterday or the day \nbefore--we allow every tax treatment we have today to go back to the \n2001 rates, small businesses in America will be hit again with a tax \nthat will force them to close or to liquidate.\n  It is time we understood from whence we get our strength. It is the \nAmerican taxpayers. As we consider them and their investment in small \nbusiness, we will make better decisions, we will act faster, and \nAmerica will be better, and America will be stronger.\n  I see the Senator from Utah is on the Senate floor. I would like to \nturn to him.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Madam President, on Monday we heard from Democrats who insist that \nCongress must now raise taxes on the American people. In fact, they are \nso committed to this task that they are willing to take the country off \nthe fiscal cliff in order to get their way. This is unfortunate. It is \nunnecessary, and it is a course of action we cannot pursue.\n  Mind you, they are not trying to pursue comprehensive tax reform. No. \nThey are not trying to fix this Byzantine-era Tax Code which occupies \ntens of thousands of pages. What they are doing instead is just to \nraise taxes right now so they can get their way right now, so they can \ncover the shortfall that exists right now because of a chronic failure \nby Congress over time to set and stick to spending priorities.\n  Well, the vast majority of Republicans are committed not to raise \ntaxes--not on anyone. There are some very good reasons for it.\n  First, the Federal Government has proven its inadequacy in this area. \nCongress has proven time and time again that the money it takes from \nthe American people, from hard-working taxpayers, is not always spent \ncarefully. In fact, it has been spending more than it takes in for so \nlong people almost cannot remember a time when Congress routinely \nbalanced its budget. This is a problem, and it is a problem that should \nnot be fixed by taxing the same people who are already paying this bill \neven more. This is not the fault of the American people, and the job of \nfixing it lies right here in Congress--not with the American people.\n  Second, from the CBO to the IMF to the Federal Reserve to Ernst & \nYoung, experts around the world are warning of the dire economic \nconsequences that await us if we raise taxes. We cannot allow it to \nhappen. We have had over $4 trillion added to the national debt during \nthis President's administration. At the same time, we have had \nunemployment exceeding 8 percent for the last 41 consecutive months. \nNearly 13 million Americans are currently out of work, and millions \nmore are underemployed and looking for more work. We cannot allow this \nto continue.\n  I would add here that there is a certain irony in the President's \nproposal to increase taxes on some Americans while leaving the \nnecessary tax relief in place for others. While purporting to help \nhard-working Americans, this approach would actually have the opposite \neffect, hurting most--many of those Americans who can least afford the \nhit right now.\n  A new study from Ernst & Young reveals that this tax hike--the tax \nhike that hits some Americans but not others--would kill 710,000 jobs. \nThese are people who cannot afford to lose their jobs. These are people \nwho are living paycheck to paycheck. These are not CEOs. These are not \nthe top 1 percent. These are hard-working Americans who cannot afford \nto lose a job. We cannot let a tax hike bring about that kind of \nterrible consequence.\n  Democrats will assure you that their tax hikes are all about reducing \nthe deficit. That is curious because their proposal would leave 94 \npercent of this year's deficit intact, which makes it an inherently \nunserious proposal insofar as it relates to deficit reduction.\n  Further, the President's own 10-year budget, which includes massive \ntax increases, by the way, still adds $11 trillion to the national \ndebt.\n  I really do appreciate the fact that the President is finally talking \nabout these issues--issues that have long gone unaddressed and need to \nbe addressed--but he cannot look the American people in the eyes and \ntell them he is doing something about the debt when his own budget, \nwhile raising taxes, nearly doubles our already sprawling national debt \nover the next 10 years.\n  Republicans have proposals. We have proposals to reform the Tax Code, \nreduce the deficit, and to do so in ways that will grow the economy, \nnot cause it to contract. I have an amendment I hope will get \nconsidered in the next week or two that would permanently keep tax \nrates at their current levels so American families and businesses can \nknow what to expect. It would also eliminate the death tax, and it \nwould stop the expansion of the alternative minimum tax, which is \nquickly becoming the middle-income penalty tax.\n  These measures and others would go a long way--a long way--toward \nimproving our economy and getting the American people back to work \nagain. If my friends on the other side of the aisle disagree, as is \ntheir right to do, then let's come together and work to find some \ncommon ground. These election-year antics and distractions are not what \nthe American people sent us here to do, and the longer we wait before \nenacting real reform, the worse the problem is going to get.\n  I would now like to turn the time over to my friend, the junior \nSenator from Missouri, who has fought long and hard on these issues, \nwho will wrap this up for us.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 8 minutes 43 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BLUNT. How much?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 8 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Well, I am pleased to have the time on the floor today to \ntalk about these issues: the attack on small business, and the idea \nthat the private sector is doing fine, that we just need more \ngovernment jobs. I just do not find anybody in America who believes \nthat is the reality of the world we live in today.\n  The reluctance of the Senate to take votes--Mr. Wicker, who has \nserved in the House of Representatives with Mr. Isakson and I, said we \nshould have amendments; we should take votes; we should say what we are \nfor; and we should not wait until after the election to say what we are \nfor.\n  The reports that are out are consistent with the President's view in \n2010 when he said we should not do anything to change tax policy \nbecause the economy was struggling. By any measure of the economy, it \nis struggling more now than it was in 2010. Growth in the economy is \nabout half what it was when the President said: With this kind of \neconomy, we should not raise taxes. So he agreed to extend the current \ntax policies for 2 more years.\n  But the minute we did that, we made exactly the same mistake we had \nmade the previous 2 years: We created a big question mark out there for \nthe American people as to what tax policies were going to be.\n  We already have the tax increases with the President's health care \nplan.\n  It raises the top rate to about 43 percent. The top rate goes up \nautomatically with the President's health care plan to about 43 \npercent. If we go back to the old 39 rate, then we add the President's \ntaxes in, we put an extraordinary tax on working families who, for \nwhatever reason, decide they are not going to participate in the \ninsurance system. The mandate--the tax on that would fall heavily--50 \npercent of all of that tax comes from families of four who make less \nthan $72,000. Between $24,000 and $72,000 for families of four--we \ndecided we are going to penalize them with a tax if you voted for the \nPresident's health care plan.\n  What are we thinking here? Why are we ignoring all of the warnings? \nLast month the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, gave a rare warning that if we let the \ndefense sequestration go into effect and return to the tax policies of \n2000, we will be in a recession, that we will see a 4-percent decline \nin\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\ngrowth in an economy, as I said earlier, that has more people signing \nup for disability than new jobs being created--already the case, and we \nwant to take another 4 percent out of that economy?\n  The Ernst & Young report my friend from Utah mentioned said that if \nwe drive over this fiscal cliff one of the Senate majority leaders said \nthis week at the Brookings Institute that the majority is prepared to \ndrive over, that we would lose 700,000 jobs, we would shrink the \neconomy by 1.3 percent, we would reduce investment by 2\\1/2\\ percent, \nand we would cut wages by 2 percent, and this is in a country in which \nmiddle-class incomes have already dropped by $4,350 since the President \ntook office. Why would we be looking for another time to cut wages? Why \nwould we think this is a better time to slow the economy than the end \nof 2010?\n  Chairman Bernanke from the Federal Reserve was here yesterday and \nsaid that we are being held back because there is so much uncertainty. \nWe are being held back because people are not making the investments, \nthey are not taking the risks Senator Wicker talked about.\n  I would like to go back to Senator Lee and talk a little more about \nhis ideas on taxes.\n  Whenever you do not reward risk, people do not take risk. If they do \nnot take risk, they do not create opportunity for others. If we look at \nputting this tax on small businesses, if we are putting this tax on \npeople who otherwise might take a chance with some of their \ninvestments, we are just not going to have the risk-reward system work \nthe way it needs to work. If you don't want people to take risks, don't \nreward risk.\n  Government has traditionally taxed the things it wanted to discourage \nand subsidized the things it wanted to encourage. We appear to be \nsubsidizing a lot of things, such as Solyndra, that don't work and \ntaxing a lot of things that might work by constantly talking about not \nonly today's taxes but the likelihood that if the current majority has \nits way and the President has his way, the current tax policies will \ndramatically go up. In fact, they are guaranteed to go up from the \ncurrent rate even if we stayed at the current rate because of all of \nthe health care taxes.\n  We would also say we want to go back to a death tax that goes back \nalmost to a $1 million exemption. If you are a small business or a \nfamily farm--many family farms, if you just calculate the value of your \nfarm equipment, you are suddenly at the edge of that number that sounds \nso big until you realize you would have to sell the farm to pay the \ntaxes. If you have the business that you are trying to pass along, \nmaybe to the very people who stood by your side, your children and \ngrandchildren, who helped you grow that business--it is almost \nimpossible to evaluate who created that growth. But when you pass away, \nas the person who started the business, suddenly this big tax \nobligation falls to your family. Senator Lee's proposal to eliminate \nthe death tax would address that.\n  The proposal that we are for on this side to continue current tax \npolicies as we look toward an effort to have tax policies that make \nmore sense--we have the highest corporate rate in the world. We are \nseeing American companies say: Well, we think we are going to \nincorporate in Great Britain. We are going to move our company, our \nheadquarters, who we are, to Great Britain because they have better tax \npolicies.\n  Who would have ever thought Great Britain would have better tax \npolicies than the United States of America, but it does today, as does \nevery other European country. We have managed to get at the top of the \nlist.\n  In return for those lower tax rates and a system that works \ninternationally, let's eliminate a lot of the complexity of this Tax \nCode. We are for that. But let's not increase taxes while we are having \nthat debate. Let's commit ourselves to that debate and not increase \ntaxes, not move forward with all of the new health care taxes and the \ntaxes that--apparently the majority says: Well, we are prepared to \nraise taxes on the middle class because then they will put so much \npressure on Republicans in the Senate that we will have to eliminate \nsome of the current tax policies that impact small businesses and other \nindividuals.\n  Does the Senator want to talk a little bit more about it? I think we \nhave now a couple more minutes to think about how these tax policies \nreally hold back opportunity for other people. If you don't reward \nrisk, people don't take risks. If they do not take risks, they do not \ncreate opportunity and we do not have the jobs out there in the private \nsector that are clearly the key.\n  Mr. LEE. That is right. I think that is the point that often goes \nmissing in this debate, which is that when people talk about wanting to \nraise takes on one group of Americans and not increasing them on \nanother, that causes problems. And we are concerned about job creation. \nWe are not concerned about any one particular group, we are concerned \nabout Americans as a whole--most importantly, about those who are most \nvulnerable, those who can least afford to lose their jobs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEE. I see our time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n       Financial Disclosure to Reduce Tax Haven Abuse Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there is an old adage that sunlight is \nthe best disinfectant. The reason it is an old adage is it is true. \nThat is why I introduced the Financial Disclosure to Reduce Tax Haven \nAbuse Act of 2012. I introduced this months ago. It would require \ncandidates for Federal office and certain Federal employees to disclose \nany financial interests they or their spouses have in an offshore tax \nhaven. If the bill becomes law, individuals who file financial \ndisclosure reports would be required to list the identity, category of \nvalue, and location of any financial interest in a jurisdiction \nconsidered to be a tax haven by the Secretary of the Treasury. The \nSecretary would be required to provide a list of those countries to \nfilers and to consider for its inclusion on the list any jurisdiction \nthat has been publicly identified by the Internal Revenue Service as a \nsecrecy jurisdiction.\n  The American people might be surprised to know that we do not already \nask whether candidates and Members of Congress are sheltering their \nmoney offshore to avoid paying taxes in America. That is because under \ncurrent law those individuals--that would be candidates and Members of \nCongress--are not required to account for where their financial \ninterests are held. Candidates for Federal office, including President, \ndo not have to explicitly disclose their holdings in tax havens. The \nbill, which I introduced months ago with Senator Franken, would change \nthat.\n  Today it seems that we have a tax system with two sets of rules: one \nfor those who are very wealthy and one for the rest of the people in \nAmerica. The wealthiest Americans are able to take advantage of certain \nbreaks, loopholes, to pay lower tax rates than working families. We \nshould not have a political system where a candidate can claim to \nchampion working people while that same person is secretly betting \nagainst America through tax avoidance and tax haven abuse.\n  Without this bill, the American people will not know whether a \ncandidate has taken advantage of foreign tax havens to avoid paying his \nor her fair share. Offshore tax havens and other similar loopholes cost \ntaxpayers in America $100 billion a year which otherwise would be paid \nby these Americans who are using these offshore tax havens.\n  Senator Carl Levin of Michigan may be joining me shortly. I hope he \ncan. He has held an extensive set of investigative hearings in the \nPermanent Committee on Investigations on this particular issue. No one \nhas explored it more than Senator Levin of Michigan. I am hoping he can \njoin me and share his findings.\n  The money that is invested in these offshore tax havens is money that \ncould be invested in America. It could be invested in America's \nschools, America's roads, America's Medical research, America's jobs, \nand it could be paying down America's deficit. Instead, that money is \nheaded to Swiss bank accounts and holding companies in Bermuda and the \nCayman Islands.\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\n  Senator Levin and Senator Conrad, who will be joining me, have both \ndone extraordinary work to shine light on these practices and what they \nmean to the American economy. Those two Senators, Levin and Conrad, \nsuccessfully included a provision in the Senate Transportation bill \nthat will give the Treasury Department greater tools to crack down on \noffshore tax haven abuse. Unfortunately, that provision was not \nincluded in the conference report, and so we have to continue to fight \nto put an end to offshore tax haven abuse.\n  The American people are rightly concerned that wealthy and well-\nconnected Americans are skirting our laws to avoid paying their taxes. \nThey deserve to know that the people who hope to represent them in \nWashington are not cheating the system.\n  Nothing in my bill impinges on any individual's right to hold \nfinancial interests anywhere in the world. If there is a legitimate \nreason for a candidate or a Member of Congress or any other individual \nwho files a financial disclosure to hold their money, let's say, in an \naccount in the Cayman Islands, they should not have any problem \nexplaining that to the voters. But any individual who has or wants to \nhave the public trust should be honest about the practices they have \nengaged in that, in fact, cost American taxpayers, whom they may wish \nto represent, literally billions of dollars every single year.\n  This is an important step we must take to restore the public trust. I \nwould hope that this issue, like the one we just finished debating in \nthe previous several days, is one most Americans will understand. It is \none that should be bipartisan.\n  I happen to have had the good fortune of coming into politics being \nschooled by two people who were my mentors and inspired me, Senator \nPaul Douglas of Illinois and Senator Paul Simon, both of whom enjoyed \npositive reputations after the end of their public career for being \nhonest people. One of the things Senator Douglas started doing--and \nSenator Simon followed--was to make public disclosure of income and net \nworth. They did it long before it was the law and always did it to a \ngreater degree and greater detail than was required by law.\n  I have followed that practice, and sometimes it has been hard. I can \nremember coming out of law school and going to work for then-Lieutenant \nGovernor Paul Simon in Springfield, IL. There I was, deep in student \nloan debt with a beat-up old car, a wife and two babies, filing an \nincome and net worth disclosure. My first filing, because of my student \nloan debt, showed me with a negative net worth. I took a little bit of \nribbing as a result of that. But I continued to do it every single year \nI served on a public staff and every year I was a candidate or elected \nto office.\n  So there is a rich trove for anyone who is summarily bothered and \nwants to spend some time, if they would like to read what happens to a \npublic official over the span of a lifetime, when they are in this \nbusiness, in terms of their own personal wealth. There have been \nmoments when the detail I have provided in these disclosures has been \nan invitation to the press; it makes their life easier to take a look \nat things that I and my family do. I can recall when, regarding my \ndaughter Jennifer, I got a question from a reporter about what was her \nfinancial interest in Taco Bell. It turned out her financial interest \nwas as a person working at the Springfield Taco Bell making tacos. That \nwas it. But because we go into detail, those things are open for \ninvestigation and provide some clarity about my financial circumstance.\n  Paul Simon used to always say: When my career comes to an end, I want \npeople to look at my record and say I never understood why he voted \nthis way or that way, but he said I never want them to question my \nhonesty in making a political decision. That has been my goal as well.\n  What I am suggesting is to expand the disclosure of Members of \nCongress and candidates for Federal office, such as President of the \nUnited States, to include foreign tax havens. I think it is an \nimportant element that people who are running for office and serving in \noffice stand and basically explain why they felt it was a better idea \nto put money, for instance, in a Swiss bank account.\n  I have made a point of asking people--Members of Congress and \nbusiness leaders--why would anybody have a Swiss bank account? I asked \nWarren Buffet, who is one of the wealthiest men in America. I said: You \nhave been a successful businessman for decades. Why would you have a \nSwiss bank account? He said: I don't know. I have never had one. We \nhave good banks in America, so why would I go there?\n  There are two reasons: One is to conceal their wealth and how they \nare changing, moving the money around; and second, if they happen to \nbelieve the Swiss franc is a stronger currency, a better bet than the \nU.S. dollar. That is it. There are no other reasons for an American to \nhave a Swiss bank account. Yet people do. I think they should disclose \nit, and then they should stand ready to explain which of those two \nexplanations stands behind their decision.\n  Senator Carl Levin has come to the floor. At this point, I will yield \nto him because he has done extensive investigation on the Senate \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations about these foreign tax \nhavens. He and Senator Conrad have probably told us more about dollars \nlost and tax collected and what is happening in some of these tax \nhavens and shelters around the world. I yield to Senator Levin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nleadership in dealing with the offshore tax haven problem.\n  This is not a new issue. It is not a new issue for me. In fact, my \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations has been exploring the damage \nthe secrecy of offshore tax havens has caused for the nearly two \ndecades we have been looking at this issue trying to change the \nsituation that exists, and it is not a new issue for Senator Durbin. He \nhas been on this issue a long time. Indeed, when President Obama was a \nSenator, he joined in an effort to bring tax haven abuses to light.\n  Then-Senator Obama, in 2007, was an original cosponsor of the Stop \nTax Haven Abuse Act, which I introduced with our Republican colleague \nSenator Coleman, and he said the following:\n\n       There is no such thing as a free lunch--someone always has \n     to pay. And when a crooked business or a shameless individual \n     does not pay its fair share, the burden gets shifted to \n     others, usually to ordinary taxpayers and working Americans \n     without access to sophisticated tax preparers or corporate \n     loopholes.\n\n  It was a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing the loss to taxpayers \nthat results from tax-avoidance schemes that use secret tax haven \njurisdictions, such as the Cayman Islands.\n  Those words I quoted remain just as true today as they were in 2007. \nThere is indeed no free lunch. In 2006, our Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations estimated that tax havens cost the Treasury in the \nneighborhood of $100 billion a year, and though we have had some \nsuccesses in the battle against tax havens since then, tax dodgers and \navoiders have continued to exploit every offshore loophole and tax \nhaven they can find.\n  This has significant consequences to the rest of us. Offshore tax \nevasion and avoidance takes money out of the hands of our military, \ntakes money out of programs that millions of Americans rely on for good \nschools, roads, health care, protecting the environment or securing our \nborders. When money is lost to these tax havens that belongs in our \nTreasury, it adds to our deficits and debt. Ultimately, the rest of us \nare forced to pay more on our tax bills to make up for those who shirk \ntheir tax-paying responsibilities.\n  As I said, we spent years in my subcommittee exploring this problem. \nIn 2001, we heard testimony from the former Cayman Islands banker who \nsaid 100 percent of his clients were avoiding or evading taxes. In \n2006, we reported on some brothers from Texas, who, over the course of \n13 years, stashed more than $700 million in offshore tax havens in a \nmassive tax evasion scheme.\n  When a company incorporates in the Cayman Islands or another tax \nhaven, with a mail drop as their only physical presence in that \ncountry, they most likely have one purpose: avoiding taxes. In 2006, we \nexplored the history\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\nof the Ugland House, a small building in the Caymans that, remarkably, \nis listed as the headquarters for nearly 20,000 different corporations. \nIn 2005, we showed how a Seattle securities firm called Quellos devised \na scheme of faked stock trades between two offshore companies, creating \nphantom stock losses used to avoid taxes on billions of dollars in \nincome. In 2001 and 2002, we explored how Enron used offshore tax \nhavens--dozens of them--as part of its deceptive schemes.\n  Just yesterday, in our subcommittee hearing on a global bank called \nHSBC and money laundering, we saw how the secrecy of tax havens, such \nas the Caymans, so often used to conceal income, can also be used by \ncriminal enterprises to conceal and launder the proceeds of their \ncrimes. HSBC's Mexican affiliate had an office in the Caymans with \nthousands of U.S. dollar accounts. The bank had no client information \non 41 percent of those accounts, and internal documents, our \ninvestigation discovered, showed the bank was aware the accounts were \nbeing used by drug cartels and were subject to ``massive misuse . . . \nby organized crime.''\n  These tax havens have been a pervasive problem for our Treasury and \nfor our economy and for our security.\n  We can stop them. When it comes to tax avoidance, our Federal fiscal \nsituation demands we stop them. In the past, addressing offshore tax \nevasion was not a partisan issue. In 2004, Congress stopped companies \nfrom taking advantage of what was called inverting. When a company \ninverts, it will shift its headquarters, on paper, to a low-tax or no-\ntax country. It is just on paper, though. It was decided we were not \ngoing to allow that game to be played by American companies, and we \nstopped that practice. Since then, every year I have worked with \nSenator Durbin and colleagues of both parties to ensure that these \ninverted companies are prohibited from receiving government contracts. \nIf these tax dodgers cannot see fit to pay their taxes, we shouldn't be \ngiving them our tax dollars.\n  Much more needs to be done. We could pass the Stop Tax Haven Abuse \nAct, which I have introduced again in this Congress, to address some of \nthe worst offshore tax abuses and end the use of these tax havens that \ncost American taxpayers. We could pass the CUT Loopholes Act, which \nSenator Conrad and I introduced earlier this year, which includes a \nnumber of provisions aimed at stopping offshore tax evasion and closing \nloopholes that allow companies to dodge their taxes.\n  The Senate, earlier this year, passed one important provision of the \nCUT Loopholes Act. This provision is known as the special measures \nprovision. This would have given the Justice Department the same tools \nto combat tax haven abuses they now have to combat money laundering. \nUnfortunately, the House of Representatives succeeded in stripping this \ncommonsense provision from the surface transportation bill to which it \nwas attached in the Senate. That vote by the House allows the wealthy \nand powerful to continue dodging the taxes they owe, increasing the tax \nburden on American families who abide by the law and by their tax \nobligations.\n  The bill Senator Durbin offered is another way we can combat tax \nhavens, and I thank him for this effort. Simply put, his legislation \nwould bring much needed daylight to the use of offshore tax havens. It \nwould require that officeholders and candidates for public office \ndisclose their financial interests located in tax haven countries. \nPerhaps there are some who believe individuals and corporations should \nbe allowed to continue concealing their income and their assets \noverseas, adding to the deficit and forcing the rest of us to carry \ntheir own share of the burden and that of tax dodgers as well. But \nsurely we can all agree the American people deserve to know when their \npublic officials are using offshore tax havens. Senator Durbin's bill \nwould ensure that Americans know when their elected representatives and \ncandidates for office are taking advantage of the offshore tax havens.\n  This is not about a political campaign; this is about years of effort \nto make visible those who shortchange their fellow citizens by \nconcealing their finances abroad and to argue for reforms that make our \ntax system more fair for the vast majority of hard-working Americans \nwho pay what they owe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Murray are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I wish to thank the chairman for her \nhard work, as well as the staff of the committee, and Representative \nJeff Miller and others who have worked on this bill. I am very \nsupportive of the underlying bill, and I appreciate Senator Murray's \nwillingness to consider the modification to make sure the veterans who \ndeserve these benefits get them and they are not taken advantage of by \nthe fraud of others who don't deserve them.\n  I think the modification the Senator and I have talked about will \nsolve that problem, and hopefully we can get this bill agreed to this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I am here today to talk about the state of \nmanufacturing in this country, how we can do better, and how we can \ncreate more jobs here at home.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act is a good bill that will help keep jobs in \nthis country, and help businesses bring more jobs back here at home. It \nwould be especially good for manufacturing--and manufacturing, as we \nall know, is a critical part of our economy.\n  A healthy manufacturing sector is key to better jobs, rising \nproductivity, and higher standards of living. Every individual and \nindustry depends on manufactured goods, and the production of these \ngoods creates the quality jobs that keep so many Americans families \nhealthy and strong. That is why we need continued investment in the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, or MEP, as it is called.\n  Created in 1994, MEP is not just a Federal Government-funded program. \nMEP is unique in that it is funded almost equally between the States, \nfees paid by companies that use MEP, as well as the Federal Government. \nEach year, a bipartisan effort led by Senator Snowe, Senator Lieberman, \nand myself has worked to secure funding for this important program.\n  MEP is the only public-private program dedicated to providing \ntechnical support and services to small and medium-sized manufacturers, \nhelping them provide quality jobs for American working people. MEP is a \nnationwide network of proven resources that helps manufacturers compete \nnationally as well as globally. Simply put, MEP helps manufacturers \ngrow sales, increase profits, and hire more workers.\n  Throughout our country, day in and day out, MEP is working with small \nand medium-sized manufacturers to keep jobs here, and also helping \nexisting businesses bring their outsourced jobs back to the United \nStates. Let me say that again, because it bears repeating. Each day, \nMEP is working with manufacturers to keep jobs here, and bring their \noutsourced jobs back to the United States.\n  Our small and medium-sized manufacturers face different challenges \nthan larger companies, especially in this tough economy. The \nimprovements that come to a business from working with an MEP center \ncan make the difference between profitability or shutting their doors.\n  You would be hard pressed to find another program that has produced \nthe results MEP has. In fiscal year 2010--the most recent data \navailable--MEP clients across the United States reported over 60,000 \nnew or retained workers, sales of $8.2 billion, cost savings of $1.3 \nbillion, and plant and equipment investments of $1.9 billion.\n  And in a sign of how strong manufacturing is in Wisconsin, the \nWisconsin MEP is opening up a third office in my\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\nState, this time in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee region--which ranks No. 2 \namong the Nation's top 50 metropolitan areas for manufacturing \nemployment--is seeing high growth in the food processing, equipment \nmanufacturing, and industrial controls fields. These businesses want to \ncreate jobs and grow here in the United States, and they are turning to \nMEP, a public-private partnership, to help them compete in the global \neconomy. Since 1996, Wisconsin MEP has helped over 1,300 Wisconsin \nmanufacturers make nearly $400 million in improvements in technology, \nproductivity, and profits, helping to generate $2 billion in economic \nimpact, and creating or saving over 14,000 manufacturing jobs.\n  Many people seem to think the decline of American manufacturing is \ninevitable. These critics point to high wages and claim that those make \nus uncompetitive worldwide. I do not agree. Look at Germany and Japan, \ntwo countries with high-wage structures, and yet both have a larger \nmanufacturing sector as a portion of their economy than we do. So \nhigher wages are not why we trail Germany and Japan in manufacturing. \nWe have failed to invest in manufacturing and employee training \nsufficiently to keep up with global competition--and that is the \nproblem.\n  We do have the tools and the programs available to help grow our \neconomy and bring jobs back to the United States. Workers in Wisconsin \nand across the country stand ready to get back to work. Programs such \nas MEP help companies do the right thing for both their country as well \nas their bottom line--because betting on the American worker is still \nthe best investment in the world.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Defending Huma Abedin\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, rarely do I come to the floor of this \nbody to discuss particular individuals. But I understand how painful \nand injurious it is when a person's character, reputation, and \npatriotism are attacked without concern for fact or fairness. It is for \nthat reason that I come to the floor today to speak regarding the \nattacks recently on a fine and decent American, Huma Abedin.\n  Over the past decade, I have had the pleasure of knowing her during \nher long and dedicated service to Hillary Rodham Clinton, both in the \nSenate and now in the Department of State. I know Huma to be an \nintelligent, upstanding, hard-working, and loyal servant of our country \nand our government, who has devoted countless days of her life to \nadvancing the ideals of the Nation she loves and looking after its most \nprecious interests. That she has done so well maintaining her \ncharacteristic decency, warmth, and good humor is a testament to her \nability to bear even the most arduous duties with poise and confidence.\n  Put simply, Huma Abedin represents what is best about America: the \ndaughter of immigrants, who has risen to the highest levels of our \ngovernment on the basis of her substantial personal merit and her \nabiding commitment to the American ideals she embodies. I am proud to \nknow her, and I am proud--even maybe with some presumption--to call her \nmy friend.\n  Recently, it has been alleged that Huma Abedin, a Muslim American, is \npart of a nefarious conspiracy to harm the United States by unduly \ninfluencing U.S. foreign policy at the Department of State in favor of \nthe Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist causes. On June 13, five \nMembers of Congress wrote to the Deputy Inspector General of the \nDepartment of State demanding that he begin an investigation into the \npossibility that Huma Abedin, and other American officials, are using \ntheir influence to promote the cause of Muslim Brotherhood within the \nU.S. government. The information offered to support these serious \nallegations is based on a report, ``The Muslim Brotherhood in \nAmerica,'' which is produced by the Center for Security Policy. I wish \nto point out, I have worked with the Center for Security Policy. The \nhead of it is a longtime friend of mine. Still, this report is \nscurrilous.\n  To say that the accusations made in both documents are not \nsubstantiated by the evidence they offer is to be overly polite and \ndiplomatic about it. It is far better and more accurate to talk \nstraight. These allegations about Huma Abedin and the report from which \nthey are drawn are nothing less than an unwarranted and unfounded \nattack on an honorable citizen, a dedicated American, and a loyal \npublic servant.\n  The letter alleges that three members of Huma's family are \n``connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.'' \nNever mind that one of these individuals--Huma's father--passed away \ntwo decades ago. The letter and the report offer not one instance of an \naction, a decision, or a public position that Huma has taken while at \nthe State Department or as a member of then-Senator Clinton's staff \nthat would lend credence to the charge that she is promoting anti-\nAmerican activities within our government. Nor does either document \noffer any evidence of a direct impact that Huma may have had on one of \nthe U.S. policies with which the authors of the letter and the \nproducers of the report find fault. These sinister accusations rest \nsolely on a few unspecified and unsubstantiated associations of members \nof Huma's family--none of which have been shown to harm or threaten the \nUnited States in any way. These attacks have no logic, no basis, and no \nmerit, and they need to stop. They need to stop now.\n  Ultimately, what is at stake in this matter is larger even than the \nreputation of one person. This is about who we are as a Nation and who \nwe aspire to be. What makes America exceptional among the countries of \nthe world is that we are bound together as citizens, not by blood or \nclass, not by sector or ethnicity, but by a set of enduring universal \nand equal rights that are the foundations of our Constitution, our \nlaws, our citizenry, and our identity. When anyone--not least a Member \nof Congress--launches specious and degrading attacks against fellow \nAmericans on the basis of nothing more than fear of who they are and \nignorance of what they stand for, it defames the spirit of our Nation, \nand we all grow poorer because of it.\n  Our reputations and our character are the only things we leave behind \nwhen we depart this Earth, and unjust acts that malign the good name of \na decent and honorable person are not only wrong, they are contrary to \neverything we hold dear as Americans.\n  Some years ago, I had the pleasure, along with my friend, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, of traveling overseas with our \ncolleague then-Senator Hillary Clinton. By her side, as always, was \nHuma, and I had the pleasure of seeing firsthand her hard work and \ndedicated service on behalf of the former Senator from New York, a \nservice that continues to this day at the Department of State and bears \nwith it a significant personal sacrifice for Huma.\n  I have every confidence in her loyalty to our country, and everyone \nelse should as well. All Americans owe her a debt of gratitude for her \nmany years of superior public service. I hope these ugly and \nunfortunate attacks on her can immediately be brought to an end and put \nbehind us before any further damage is done to a woman, an American, of \ngenuine patriotism and love of country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to comment on a \ncouple of things. One is the dialog that took place this morning \nbetween the majority leader and the minority leader regarding how the \nSenate should function. There were two different views on this between \nthe two, and they had quite a back-and-forth exchange. I am\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\nnot sure how many people in America were watching that conversation \nthis morning, but I watched in my office while I was trying to catch up \non some other work and then found myself pretty engaged in that \ndiscussion.\n  It all stemmed from the fact that the majority leader announced he \nwas not going to bring any of the appropriations bills to the floor for \ndebate, consideration, amendment, or voting. I am a Member of that \nAppropriations Committee. The initial information passed on to us was \nthat we would return to regular order; that is, the committees forming, \nthrough the committee process, how we spend our money, the limitations, \nwhere it should be sent.\n  We have held all the hearings. We bring in all the agencies. \nEverybody presents their budget, defends their budget. We make \ndecisions, and we come up with legislation--13 separate pieces of \nlegislation--that essentially covers the functions of this Congress and \nhow we are going to pay for it.\n  So we go through all this work. We work through subcommittee, then we \nwork through the full committee, and then the bills are ready, stacked \nup, waiting to be brought to the floor to be debated by Members--both \nRepublicans and Democrats, both sides of the aisle--with amendments \noffered.\n  The same process happens in the House. We merge the two bills. We \nbring one product here. We make a final vote on that and send it to the \nPresident. He either signs it or rejects it. But that is a necessary \nprocedure that is a written part of the way this Congress is designed \nto function.\n  Yet that procedure has essentially been discarded. To then hear that \nafter all that effort by all of us in our respective committees, \nincluding the Appropriations Committee but also authorizing committees \nin terms of how we are going to spend the money and what direction it \ngoes--after all of this effort, we are told: No, none of those bills \nwill be brought to the floor.\n  Well, that is not the function of the Senate. The response is, well, \nwe will put it all into one big bill at the end--13 bills, called an \nomnibus bill. Earlier, we had something put together called a minibus--\nthey took three major bills, and put them together--and we were then \nasked to have either a ``yes'' or a ``no'' vote on the whole thing.\n  You know, there is a reason the public is so frustrated with the \nCongress. They cannot get clear answers from their respective Members \nas to whether they are for something or against something because when \nyou combine all of those bills together, of course you are for parts of \nit and you are against parts of it, but Members are only allowed one \nvote, yes or no.\n  When I ran for office in 2010, I pledged to the people of Indiana \nthat if I were elected, I would let my yes be yes and my no be no as it \napplied to a specific program or a specific spending item so that they \ncould then evaluate their Senator in terms of how he was representing \nthem. And they could then make a judgment that, I want to support this \nperson or I am opposed to supporting this person because I do not agree \nwith his vote on this or I support him because I do agree with a vote \nhe took. That is the clarity and transparency the American people are \nasking for. Of course, they are getting exactly the opposite here.\n  The other problem with not bringing these bills to the floor one by \none and having open debate, with the opportunity to offer amendments, \nto adjust them--you either pass your amendment or you do not pass your \namendment, but in the end the whole thing has been vetted, vetted in \nfront for the American to see, for us to understand, and therefore, \nwhen we do vote, we know that our yes means yes and our no means no.\n  So it is a mystery to me why this year and in previous years under \nthe leadership of the majority leader we have not done what the Senate, \nhistorically is designed to do and has done and what I think is a duty \nand a responsibility to the people whom we represent.\n  Now, in normal times of economic growth, maybe you can get away with \nsomething like this. But at a time when lack of action in Congress \ncontributes to an already staggering economy--many analysts say we are \nheading back into recession--when we look at the situation around the \nworld and see the slowing down of economic activity and the problems in \nChina and Brazil and in India, the major markets, and we see what is \nhappening in Europe, and we read from analysts their evaluation of our \ncurrent economic situation and this fiscal cliff that we are driving \ntoward by the end of the year unless we address it, how uncertainty \nover all of that is negatively affecting our economy and affecting \nthose who are in a position to either buy new machinery for their \nplant, increase employment, do more research, or expand a business. \nThey are frozen in time saying: I cannot make decisions because there \nis uncertainty about what money will be available, what our budget will \nbe, what our tax rate will be, what our health care obligations will \nbe, what the Federal Government will be doing with this budget and how \nit affects our business.\n  So whether it is paving roads or funding hospitals, addressing \neducation issues or any other function that Federal, State, local \ngovernments or individuals and businesses get involved in, this cloud \nof uncertainty that has settled over this country has kept us from \nputting those policies in place that are going to restore our country \nto economic growth, that are going to put people back to work and get \nour country back on track toward fiscal health.\n  This is an issue that should not be dividing us on a partisan basis. \nWhether you are listening to a liberal economic commentator or \nconservative economic analyst, there is a growing consensus that \ninactivity, this stalemate that exists is contributing significantly, \nand the failure to address the fact that we are heading toward this \nfiscal cliff, with all its ramifications, will have enormous negative \nconsequences if we do not take some action.\n  So it is not just about the appropriations process, although I think \nthat speaks to the dysfunction of this Senate. It is also about the \nlarger question of some of the major issues that lie before us that the \nCongress is simply not addressing. We are viewed as a dysfunctional \ninstitution, either incapable or unwilling to address the critical \nissues facing our country--in particular, the dismal state of our \neconomy and the fact that we have now for 41 straight months had \nunemployment above 8 percent.\n  This morning more than 12 million Americans woke up without a job and \nmany others woke up with a job much below their abilities, much below \nwhat they had hoped to gain in a salary and a pay package that allows \nthem to pay the mortgage, buy the groceries, save for their children's \neducation. So the underemployed combined with the unemployed is a \nstaggering number. That is something I believe we have a moral duty to \naddress.\n  We may have a disagreement on the policies to address this crisis. I \nunderstand that. But when we are not even allowed to come down to this \nfloor and debate those policies and have a package of legislation in \nfront of us that we think will address some of these situations, that \nis simply taking a pass at a time when our country desperately needs us \nto be engaged.\n  If you looked at the Washington Post this morning, you saw the \naccount of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, his testimony before \nthe Senate yesterday, and I want to quote what he said:\n\n       The most effective way that the Congress could help support \n     the economy right now would be to work to address the \n     Nation's fiscal challenges in a way that takes into account \n     both the need for long-run sustainability and the fragility \n     of the recovery.\n\n  I think if that question was posed to a Member of this body, whether \nthat Member is conservative or liberal, Democratic or Republican, I \nthink most would simply say: I agree with that. I cannot find fault \nwith what he said.\n  You know, we look to the Fed to solve all of our problems but the Fed \nhas used about every major tool they have--they might have a couple of \nlittle ones left. You can only do so much with monetary policy. The \nproblem is fiscal policy, and fiscal policy is the responsibility of \nthe Congress and the executive branch and the President.\n  Look, it is clear that we are not going to get any leadership from \nthis President, at least until after this election has taken place. He \nis clearly in campaign mode. He is not doing business out of the White \nHouse relative to policy. He even said months and\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nmonths ago: Well, we are not really going to do any more this year.\n  So that has all been put on hold. Well, in normal times, that might \nbe what Presidents ought to be doing. These are not normal times. We \nare not getting the leadership we need. And everything we tried to do \nin 2011 was stopped simply because we did not get support from the top.\n  But let's set that aside right now and acknowledge that what the \nFederal Reserve Chairman has said will have a major negative impact on \nthis economy if Congress does not step up and take its responsibility \nand do what we all know we need to do. I repeat again that statement by \nthe Federal Reserve Chairman:\n\n       The most effective way that the Congress could help support \n     the economy right now would be to work to address the \n     nation's fiscal challenges in a way that takes into account \n     both the need for long-run sustainability and the fragility \n     of the economy.\n\n  Economists from across the political spectrum are sounding the alarm. \nAnalysts report that the threat of the fiscal crisis in Europe is now \nbeing displaced by the threat of our country's inaction and refusal to \naddress this fiscal cliff now. The American people and American \nindustry and American businesses need to know what our plan is to \nstabilize our economy. Yes, it is important what Spain is doing and \nItaly is doing and Greece is doing and Germany is doing and France is \ndoing to work on the European situation. Those of us who live in glass \nhouses should not be throwing stones. There is a lot of criticism over \nwhat they are doing or not doing across the Atlantic. But we ought to \nbe looking at ourselves and saying: How dare we tell them what they \nneed to do--as some have tried to do--when we are not doing anything \nourselves to address this.\n  The failure of Congress to act is having a negative impact, not only \nin my State but across the country. Household confidence is waning. \nRetail sales are down, according to the latest report. The \nmanufacturing sector is taking a hit. As I said earlier, there have \nbeen 41 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent.\n  So it falls to Congress to act. Unfortunately, now we have been told \nthat even on the regular process of how we act on a year-by-year basis \nto set the spending standards for the taxpayers' hard-earned money out \nof this Federal Government, set those standards, we are unwilling to \nhave open debates, we are unwilling--the majority leader will not allow \nus to have amendments, will not even bring the bill to the floor. All \nof this legislation is needed to ostensibly run this Federal \nGovernment. Yet it is being run in a way that throws everything into \nthe pot. It goes right up to the edge, and we have this drama about \nwhether they will pass it or not pass it. In the meantime, the negative \nimpact that it has on our economy is very troubling and not something \nwe ought to be doing.\n  So here I am again voicing my frustration over our inability to step \nup to the responsibility that has been given to us by the American \npeople to come here and do our very best, make our best arguments, put \nforward our best plan, but come to some conclusion as to where we are \ngoing in this country in dealing with this fiscal cliff.\n  It is not just a fiscal cliff, it is a whole range of issues that \nhave enormous implications for our national defense, for our economy, \nfor our budget, for going forward for our retirees, for those \nbeneficiaries of some of the programs of the Federal Government--major \nimplications--and all of that is left in a cloud of uncertainty.\n  The interesting thing to me is that whether you are a Democrat or \nRepublican, whether you are President of the United States or a \ncandidate for President of the United States, good policy is what the \nAmerican people are looking for. Action is what they are looking for. \nDebate is what they are looking for, and then putting that forward with \nsome sense of certainty in terms of where we are going. But right now \npolitics seems to be dominating the Presidential race. I do not think \nthere is anything we can do about that, but what we can do here in this \nbody is acknowledge what was acknowledged by a lot of Democrats and a \nlot of Republicans in 2011 but not accomplished; what we can do is what \nwe have the responsibility to do, and that is to step into the breach \nand do everything we can to put those policies in place that I think \nthere is substantial agreement on, put those policies in place that \nwill get our economy moving again, and, most important, put some \ncertainty into what the future looks like so that those who go shopping \nand those who make products and those who are part of our American \neconomy have the certainty of knowing what the future looks like so \nthey can make decisions.\n  We have a chance, Mr. President--even as recent discoveries can lead \nus to energy independence, given our established rule of law, given the \nfact that right now America is the only safe haven--even though it is \ngetting less safe--to invest your money if you are overseas--we have \nthe opportunity, if we step up to our responsibilities, to open a new \nchapter and put America back in its place as that ``shining city on a \nhill,'' that place of freedom and opportunity where you want to put \nyour money and invest, raise your children, an opportunity to be the \ncountry the world looks at to take the lead.\n  We have a golden opportunity now to send that signal. I think the \ninvestment markets would respond dramatically, we would start putting \npeople back to work, and get our economy humming again. People would \nthen look at us and say: They are taking this debt and deficit \nsituation seriously. They put a credible long-term plan in place to \naddress it, and we have the confidence to go forward, knowing that \nAmerica will still be the place to live, work, raise a family, and \ninvest. We can bring our economy back.\n  I am trying to end on a positive note simply by saying good policy is \ngood politics. The people are hungry for us to stand up and basically \nsay this is what we believe in, what we stand for. Yes, we had to \nmodify this or that in order to get consent on going forward, but we \nare going forward. We know what the plan will be, and we can send a \nsignal to the world that Congress has lived up to those \nresponsibilities. You are not going to get it out of the White House--\nat least until November. This is the body where the responsibility \nfalls. I think we all need to stand up and understand not only our \nconstitutional duties but our moral responsibility to move forward and \nin the regular order address these issues that are so critical to the \nfuture of this Nation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nKansas is recognized.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          KC-46A Tanker Basing\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, Kansas has a long and remarkable history of \nsupporting our Nation's aviation industry both commercially and in \nsupport of our Nation's men and women in uniform. In Kansas, roughly \n40,000 citizens support approximately 270 aviation and aerospace \ncompanies and generate nearly $2.9 billion in exports annually from our \nState. Many of those workers live in Wichita, which has long been known \nas the air capital of the world. Not only do these workers contribute \nto the vitality of our State's economy, but they also strengthen our \nNation's economy, and they certainly contribute to our Nation's \ndefense.\n  At both McConnell Air Force Base and Forbes Field, in Topeka, members \nof the Active, Reserve, and the National Guard serve our country \nthrough a variety of missions. Since 1941, McConnell Air Force Base has \nbeen an instrumental part of the Wichita community, and Kansans have a \nproud history of standing behind the air men and women who have called \nMcConnell home. McConnell Air Force Base employs more than 17,000 \npeople, military and civilian, and last year it had an overall impact \nof more than $520 million on our local economy.\n  I have come to the floor today to outline my support, strong support, \nfor McConnell Air Force Base as the best choice for our Nation's new \ntanker fleet, the KC-46A. Currently, the Air Force is considering \nMcConnell for the first home--or main operating base 1--for the new \ntanker, which will be put into service in 2016. McConnell Air Force \nBase is our Nation's best choice.\n  McConnell already houses a total of 63 KC-135R tankers--48 assigned \nand manned, plus an additional 15 for global contingency purposes, \nmaking it by\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\nfar the largest tanker presence in our country. In fact, McConnell is \nconsidered the supertanker base in the Air Force, with twice the number \nof tankers than any other base.\n  Looking at the geography of the United States, it is clear McConnell \nserves our country well in terms of air mobility. Strategically located \nin the Nation's heartland--equidistant from both coasts--McConnell's \nlocation is a great asset.\n  To this point, the 22nd Air Refueling Wing and the 931st Air \nRefueling Group at McConnell are frequently called upon for refueling \nmissions, within a 1,000-mile ``service radius'' of the base, which \nfurther highlights the reliability of this location in the Midwest for \ndomestic or overseas missions. One thousand nautical miles is a vast \nportion of the continental United States and includes hundreds of \nroutes, military operating areas, and airspace reserved for various air \nmissions.\n  McConnell supports all branches of the military and allied partners, \nrefueling off of either coast and around the world every day. The Air \nForce has long taken advantage of the expansive airspace available over \nand around Kansas, so it would be natural for McConnell Air Force Base \nto continue its important air mobility missions with the KC-46As.\n  McConnell also has a clear advantage in personnel because it houses \nboth Active and Reserve air men and women in the air mobility mission. \nThe Air Force calls this arrangement a classic association, and \nMcConnell is one of the only few bases in the country that can boast \nthis level of coordination between the Active and Reserve in air \nmobility missions.\n  The 22nd and 931st are prime examples of Active and Reserve \ncomponents working together, sharing capabilities, collocating in \nvarious facilities, integrating crews and providing global support to \noperational needs.\n  The 22nd and 931st have a tremendous history of conducting air \nmobility operations not only throughout the United States, but in \nplaces in Libya, Serbia, Turkey, Iraq and Afghanistan. Furthermore, the \nAir Force has indicated their strong preference for this arrangement as \nthey choose the location for the first round of KC-46A tankers.\n  Another advantage McConnell boasts is a surrounding community that \nfully supports and embraces the air men and women and their families. \nSince 1960, an organization of area business leaders and residents \ncalled Friends of McConnell has supported the men and women of \nMcConnell Air Force Base through a wide range of programs and special \nevents on and off the base each year.\n  One of those programs, called the Honorary Commander Program, pairs \nup more than 30 squadron and group commanders with local civic leaders \nfor 2 years to build meaningful relationships between civilian and \nmilitary leadership. When I talk with the air men and women stationed \nat McConnell, they often tell me how much they have enjoyed the quality \nof life Wichita offers them and their families.\n  When it comes to Air Force air mobility missions, there are four \ncomponents that make a mission successful: airmen, command and control, \ninfrastructure, and equipment. McConnell Air Force Base not only has \nthe extremely capable airmen of the 22nd and 931st, but it also has the \nproven command and control to handle a myriad of operational needs and \na sprawling infrastructure with enormous capacity. In fact, McConnell \nwill soon have the newest runway in the Air Force at a length of 12,000 \nfeet, which more than exceeds the requirements of the first round of \ntankers.\n  By locating the new tankers at McConnell, the Air Force would have \nthe strategic flexibility and capacity needed to carry out a variety of \nmissions both at home and abroad. Now is the time for the Air Force to \nreplace the aging KC-135Rs with the ``iron'' of KC-46As at McConnell \nAir Force Base.\n  The Air Force has made clear that the acquisition and \nrecapitalization of the KC-46A is their top priority. Air Force Chief \nof Staff GEN Norton Schwartz said it best when he stated:\n\n       The KC-46A tanker is a critical force multiplier and \n     essential to the way this Nation fights its wars and provides \n     humanitarian support around the globe.\n\n  I agree. I recently had the opportunity to speak with Air Force \nSecretary Michael Donley while at the Farnborough airshow, and I \nemphasized personally the need to base KC-46A tankers at McConnell Air \nForce Base in order to meet this need for global mobility.\n  It is often said in the military that the difference between success \nand failure is logistics. McConnell Air Force Base offers the \ninstrumental, logistical muscle that is vital to successful, strategic \nair power. Kansans have a long history of supporting air power and air \nmobility, and I know McConnell Air Force Base is the best choice for \nour Nation's new tanker fleet.\n  I am hopeful that Kansas air men and women will have the opportunity \nto continue their tradition of service in defending our Nation with \nthis first round of KC-46As.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sessions pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3396 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to join the voices \nof my colleagues in favor of supporting strongly, and I hope \npersuasively, the Bring Jobs Home Act.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act is a measure that contains some provisions \nthat are hardly novel, not complex, and a matter of common sense.\n  They involve some of the basic ideas we have advanced and advocated \nin this Chamber for some time. They are measures that are contained in \na proposal very eloquently argued for by my colleague, Senator \nStabenow, and I thank her for her leadership, as well as for Leader \nReid's leadership, in bringing this measure to the floor now.\n  Very simply, the Bring Jobs Home Act will reshore and restore jobs to \nthis country with two simple, straightforward provisions. This measure \nprovides a 20-percent tax credit for the expenses incurred in moving \nfacilities or plants--basically, jobs--back to America. It also does \nsomething that is critically vital to this country, which is to close \nthe loopholes that right now reward companies for moving those jobs \noverseas. Again and again over the past 2 years I have advocated this \nstraightforward, simple step: Close the loopholes that permit companies \nto deduct expenses when moving those jobs overseas.\n  The average American--certainly the average person in Connecticut--\nwhen told that these loopholes exist, simply is incredulous. They \ncannot believe the United States of America rewards companies for \nmoving these jobs overseas. Let's close that loophole now. It will \nproduce revenue for the United States. Literally tens of millions of \ndollars will come back to our country as a result of closing this \nloophole, and jobs will come back as well. The 20-percent tax credit, \nalthough it may not sound like a lot of money to major corporations, \ncould well be the tipping point for executives considering what to do \nin terms of investing in this country. It is an incentive to invest in \nthe United States instead of moving those jobs abroad. A 20-percent tax \ncredit could be a critical decision point and a turning point in those \ndecisions. The Boston Consulting Group surveyed 37 companies which have \n$10 billion or more in revenues and found that 50 percent are at that \ntipping point.\n  This measure should not be partisan. It should not be a matter of \ngeography or party as to whether one of our colleagues supports it. \nThere should be a bipartisan coalition behind it. I have found in \nConnecticut, as I go around the State, regardless of party, people \nsupport this idea of bringing jobs home and reshoring and restoring \njobs to our State and to our country, particularly manufacturing jobs.\n  In the city of Waterbury, I visited on Monday a steel plant where \nthere are\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\n3,000 manufacturing jobs--part of the 165,000 manufacturing jobs that \nwe have in Connecticut. Manufacturing is alive and well. Taxpayers \nshould not be subsidizing companies that move those kinds of jobs \noverseas. In the last 10 years, 2.4 million jobs were shipped \noverseas--mostly manufacturing--and taxpayers helped to foot the bill \nfor it. In Connecticut, the National Bureau of Economic Research has \nfound more than 250,000 jobs are at risk of being outsourced. People \nare angry and outraged that they are subsidizing that risk, that \noutsourcing and offshoring of jobs.\n  In the steel plant I visited, fortunately those jobs have stayed. But \nfrom around the country and in Connecticut, many of them have moved \noverseas because of the economic incentives we have created and that \nnow we should stop. At a time when job creation is our No. 1 priority, \nAmerican taxpayers deserve that these loopholes and hidden subsidies be \nclosed and ended forever.\n  I hope I speak for many of my colleagues in saying shipping jobs \noverseas with the subsidies and incentives now provided very simply is \nunacceptable. Let's pass the Bring Jobs Home Act now to close those \nloopholes and to provide these incentives so that companies such as \nOtis Elevator, United Technology, DuPont, Ford, Master Lock, GE, \nSpectrum Plastics in Ansonia, CT, will be encouraged to continue doing \nthe right thing, bringing those jobs back, walking the walk, and \nwalking jobs back to Connecticut and to the United States. I will be \nvoting yes to bring jobs home.\n  Again, I thank my colleague Senator Stabenow for her invaluable \nleadership on this issue. I am proud to join her today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first want to thank my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut for his commitment and compassion and \npassion on this issue. I appreciate very much his joining with me and \nothers to come together to put forward what I think is a commonsense \nbill that focuses on closing a major loophole that is requiring \nbasically taxpayers to help foot the bill when jobs are shipped \noverseas. So I want to thank the Senator from Connecticut for his \nefforts and commitment. I know he shares my belief that we need to be \nbringing jobs home, and that is what we intend to do.\n  I do want to speak today about the legislation that is in front of \nus. We can come together and agree we don't have to go forward and have \nthis vote to stop a filibuster. If we could agree to bring up the bill \nand discuss it and pass it, it would be terrific. We know we have a \nmajority to support this bill and be able to pass it, send it to the \nHouse, and the President will sign it in 30 seconds, I know, to be able \nto close this loophole. But we are, unfortunately, engaged in something \nright now that we are engaged in all the time now. It used to be a rare \noccurrence to have an objection that triggers a filibuster. Now it is \non every issue. So we find ourselves waiting to be able to vote to see \nwhether we are going to be able to get a supermajority to be able to go \nto this bill. That is very concerning to me, given the fact that we do \nhave the majority in the Senate that wants to debate and pass this bill \nand we have the vast majority of Americans. It is not about Democrats \nor Republicans. We have people all over this country who want to see us \nmove forward on this bill as well as others that will focus on jobs and \nfocus on bringing jobs home. We want to build an economy that lasts. \nThe way we do that I believe is by making things--making things in \nAmerica.\n  Two weeks ago, we passed the farm bill on an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan vote. As chair of the Agriculture Committee, working with my \nranking member Senator Roberts, we very much appreciated the hard work \nand support of Members on both sides of the aisle to pass something \nthat is involved in growing things. We don't have a middle class in \nthis country and we don't have an economy unless we make things and \ngrow things. So we showed we could come together around a major piece \nof legislation that invests in growing things and all of the offshoots \nof that as it relates to the food economy.\n  This is an opportunity to say ``we get it'' when it comes to making \nthings and bringing jobs back from overseas so we can make more things \nagain in America. It is unbelievable to me--and I know it is \nunbelievable to hard-working men and women in Michigan and I know all \nacross the country--that companies actually get a tax writeoff for \npacking up shop, paying for the moving expenses, doing what they need \nto do to close down and move jobs overseas. It is actually astounding. \nAnd when we look at the fact that we have lost 2.4 million jobs in the \nlast 10 years because of that, it is outrageous when you think about it \nthat we are losing 2.4 million jobs and it continues, and, at the same \ntime, American taxpayers are helping to foot the bill. That makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  We have heard a lot about tax reform from Members on both sides of \nthe aisle, and I support that. I think there are some larger tax \nissues. As a member of the Finance Committee, I am committed to \naddressing a range of issues that deals with incentives and how we \ncompete globally and our companies are able to compete globally. But \nthis is tax reform we can do right now. We don't have to wait for \nsomething big to come someday. We are going to have an opportunity in \nthe next day to vote on tax reform immediately. I know the Presiding \nOfficer shares the desire to bring those jobs home. The fact is, we \nhave something very simple and straightforward we are going to be asked \nto vote on.\n  First of all, the Bring Jobs Home Act would end the taxpayer \nsubsidies that are helping to pay for moving costs for corporations \nthat are closing up shop and sending jobs overseas. Secondly, we are \ngoing to allow companies to have that deduction when they bring the \njobs back. So if we have a company wanting to close up shop in China \nand bring the jobs back, we are happy to allow a business tax deduction \nfor that. And, on top of it, we will allow an additional 20-percent tax \ncredit for the cost of bringing those jobs back. So we are happy to do \nthat. But we are not paying to ship the jobs overseas.\n  I don't know of any country in the world right now that would have a \ntax policy that involves helping to pay for jobs leaving their country. \nIf anything, we are in a situation today where we have other countries \neither trying to block us from selling to them or they create \nincentives. I have mentioned so many times but it is true, I have \ntalked to companies that had the Chinese Government approach them and \nsay, ``Come on over, we will build the plant for you.'' And then they \nsteal your patent.\n  But the fact is other countries are aggressively trying to get what \nwe have had as America, what has created the middle class of America, \nwhich is the ability to make things in this country. We don't seem to \nunderstand that if we are not vigilant, if we are not paying attention, \nif we are not focused, if we don't have the right policies and the \nright kinds of investments and partnerships with the private sector, \nthey are going to have all of those middle-class jobs. So when we look \nat this, it is time to begin that process. In fact, it is way past time \nto do this.\n  Cheryl Randecker would certainly agree with that. She worked at \nSensata for 33 years. She has a daughter who is ready to go to college. \nShe is worried about how she is going to pay her bills and put food on \nthe table and pay for her daughter's schooling. And now she finds she \nhas lost her job. It is being shipped to China. Her employer gets a tax \ndeduction that she is helping to pay for, for the moving expenses.\n  Her coworker Joyce is 60 years old and has worked at the same company \nfor 29 years. She has given them her whole career, and in those years \nshe has developed a very specific set of job skills that have made her \na tremendous asset to the work they do at their facility. But those \nskills aren't necessarily transferrable to another company, and she is \nworried those companies would rather hire somebody half her age to save \nmoney. She is another person who must be absolutely outraged to find \nout that the taxes she has paid for nearly 30 years in her career are \nbeing used to help her company ship her job to China.\n  I have heard similar worries from my constituents all over Michigan, \npeople who have worked all their lives--often for the same company--in \ntheir late fifties, early sixties, a few years shy of\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\nretirement, and who suddenly find the rug pulled out from under them. \nIt is outrageous to think that those individuals, who have played by \nthe rules and worked hard their whole lives, suddenly find themselves \nin a situation where their jobs are shipped overseas and American \ntaxpayers are subsidizing it. We can change that. We can change that \nwhen we vote to move forward on this bill.\n  The good news, and the reason we need to do this to keep this \nmomentum going, is that we have a lot of companies that are now doing \nthe math and finding it makes good business sense to bring jobs home. \nSo we have some good news stories, and we need to keep them going.\n  But our Tax Code needs to catch up with that and reward those \ncompanies instead of putting them at a competitive disadvantage when we \nhave companies closing up here and shipping jobs the other way.\n  Caterpillar is making major new investments in the United States, \nbringing jobs back from Japan, Mexico, and China.\n  DuPont is building a plant in Charleston, SC, to produce Kevlar. That \nis great news. They are making investments in Ohio, Iowa, Pennsylvania, \nand Delaware.\n  All-Clad Metalcrafters, the folks who make high-end cookware, have \nbrought their production of lids back from China to the United States.\n  Keen, a shoe manufacturer, just opened a 15,000-square-foot plant to \nmanufacture boots in Portland, OR--production that used to be in China.\n  Master Lock, the world's largest padlock maker, moved jobs back to \ntheir facility in Milwaukee, WI, and they now have 50 products \nmanufactured exclusively in the United States made with U.S. component \nparts.\n  US Airways brought hundreds of jobs back to their call centers in \nNorth Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada. Today, Lori Manuel is joining me \nin just a few moments at a press conference to talk about how important \nthose jobs are to her and her colleagues.\n  Yesterday I was on the floor talking about our American automobile \nindustry. I am very proud that Ford has retooled. The largest plant \nthey have is in North America, in Wayne, MI, and because of that effort \nand new advanced batteries, they are bringing jobs back from Mexico \nand, we are now hearing, from China and other places. I know GM and \nChrysler are very focused on jobs here and bringing jobs back, and that \nis all good news.\n  These are companies that want to invest in America. They want to \nbring jobs home. Our Tax Code should be rewarding that, not rewarding \nthose who want to leave. Our Tax Code still rewards their competitors \nwho are not making investments in America, and it makes absolutely no \nsense. When CEOs are making calculations about where to move \nproduction, we do not want the Tax Code standing in the way.\n  It is very simple. We know we have to focus on jobs in America. We \nare in a global economy. Our companies are competing with countries and \npolicies of countries and investments by other countries. We have to \nmake sure that we are doing everything, that it is all hands on deck, \nthat everybody is moving in the same direction, that the Tax Code \nworks, that we are partnering in the right way in every part of our \neconomy so that the message is sent out: Bring jobs home. ``American \nmade.'' We want to strengthen America.\n  This is about America first. That is what the Tax Code ought to focus \non, and that is what this bill is all about. I am hopeful that our \ncolleagues will get beyond the politics of the moment. I know we are in \nan election year. I get the partisan politics of the moment. But there \nare people around our country counting on us--Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents, folks who vote, folks who do not vote--counting on us to \nactually step up together and do things that make sense. This makes \nsense. We need to bring jobs home. This bill will help do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I do each week, \nas a physician who practiced medicine in Wyoming for a quarter of a \ncentury, taking care of so many families there, to give a doctor's \nsecond opinion about the health care law that has now been found \nconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Although it may not be \nunconstitutional, it is still unworkable, it is unaffordable, and it is \nvery unpopular.\n  Today I wish to talk about one of the specific components of the \nhealth care law; that is, the issue of Medicaid expansion.\n  Most of the discussion of the Supreme Court's health care decision \nhas been focused on the individual mandate, that incredibly unpopular \nportion of the law that forces every American to buy a government-\napproved product, government-approved health insurance. The Supreme \nCourt has ruled it a tax. It is a tax. Still, the American people know \nit is a mandate coming out of Washington that they buy a government-\napproved product for the first time ever in American history.\n  Today I would like to talk about another important part, which is the \nSupreme Court's ruling that the law's Medicaid mandate is \nunconstitutional. As many Americans know, Medicaid is a government \nprogram that is jointly funded between States and the Federal \nGovernment. The President's health care law contained a huge expansion \nof Medicaid, and more than half of the new insurance coverage provided \nby the health care law was supposed to be delivered through the \nMedicaid Program.\n  The President's health care law forces States to expand their \nMedicaid eligibility or face the loss of all of their Medicaid matching \nfunds. Currently, the States put up some money, and the Federal \nGovernment puts up some--it varies from State to State. In my State of \nWyoming, the State puts up half, the Federal Government puts up half, \nand 15 States are in that 50-50 range. In some States, it goes up to 70 \ncents from the Federal Government and 30 cents from the State. Across \nthe board, the average is about 57 cents from Washington, 43 cents from \nthe home State.\n  Many States believed that this expansion, this forced expansion, this \nforced mandate on them was unconstitutional, that it was expensive, and \nthat it would essentially leave States with no choice but to \nparticipate in the program. That is why 26 different States filed a \nlawsuit against the Federal Government to stop this massive Medicaid \noverreach.\n  Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts and a majority of Justices agreed \nwith the States. Chief Justice Roberts described the Medicaid expansion \nas a ``gun to the head'' that would leave States no choice but to \nparticipate in the program. The decision of the Supreme Court made \nclear that States cannot be forced by Washington--cannot be forced by \nWashington--to participate in the health care law's Medicare expansion.\n  In response, after the Supreme Court announced its decision, a \nreporter asked senior White House officials how they would entice \nStates to participate. According to Kaiser Health News, the White House \nofficials responded with laughter. Apparently it seemed almost \ninconceivable to these White House officials that States would want to \nopt out of the Medicaid expansion. In fact, Washington Democrats have \nargued that it is a good deal for States since the Federal Government \nis paying for the entire expansion through 2017, and then it will cover \n90 percent of the cost of the States. But, again, that is not of all of \nthe people on Medicaid, that is only of these newly eligible \nindividuals. Never mind that the Congressional Budget Office predicted \nthat the Medicaid expansion would cost the Federal Government over $900 \nbillion between 2014 and 2022. Apparently Washington Democrats, who \nhave not passed a budget--Members of this Senate--in over 3 years, \nbelieve the Federal Government has extra money to spend. It is \ncompletely irresponsible.\n  While this might be a laughing matter for the White House, people who \nwork in State governments take this issue much more seriously. The \nconcerns of Governors of both parties was recently highlighted in a \nWashington Post article. Not only are Republican Governors concerned \nabout the expansion, but at least seven Democratic\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\nGovernors have been noncommittal about expanding the program in their \nown States as well. Governors are concerned because they know Medicaid \nhas been the fastest growing part of the State budget for over the past \ndecade. In fact, Medicaid spending has expanded twice as fast as \nspending on education, and this is according to the bipartisan National \nGovernors Association.\n  In addition, State leaders worry that the Federal Government will not \nkeep the promises Washington has made to the States regarding \nMedicaid's payment rates.\n  The Wall Street Journal referred to the matching rate this way:\n\n       This 100 percent matching rate is like a subprime loan with \n     a teaser rate and a balloon payment.\n\n  When asked to comment about the Medicaid expansion, Jay Nixon, the \nGovernor of Missouri, who is a Democrat, said:\n\n       This deals with hundreds of thousands of Missourians, it \n     deals with their health \n     care . . .\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n     . . . it deals with billions of dollars, and we will be \n     involved in the process that defines the best fit for our \n     state and respects the sovereignty of our state and the \n     individuality of our state.\n\n  Brian Schweitzer, Democratic Governor of Montana, put it best when he \nsaid:\n\n       Unlike the Federal Government, Montana just can't print \n     money. We have a budget surplus and we are going to keep it \n     that way.\n\n  Unlike this current administration, Governors of both parties \nrecognize the importance of controlling government spending.\n  Washington cannot expect States to simply trust that the money will \ncome through in the future. States basically do not trust Washington, \nand they are right to not trust Washington. States and Governors across \nthe country are much smarter than trusting Washington.\n  It did not have to be this way. If the White House and Democrats in \nCongress had actually focused on lowering costs--that was supposed to \nbe the concern of the health care law, lowering the cost of care--if \nthe White House and Democrats in Congress had actually focused on \nlowering the cost of care, States now would not be facing this bad \nchoice.\n  We need to repeal this bad health care law. We need to replace it \nwith legislation that will make it easier for States to work with \nWashington without going bankrupt. We need to move forward. We need to \nmove forward with legislation that will allow Americans to get what \nthey have been looking for, which is the care they need from a doctor \nthey choose at lower costs.\n  I point out that the Republican Governors Association has a lot of \nquestions about this Medicaid expansion. As a matter of fact, Virginia \nGovernor Bob McDonnell, who is chairman of the Republican Governors \nAssociation, sent a letter to the President seeking answers to a number \nof questions dealing with Medicaid and dealing with the exchanges that \nare part of this health care law. There are 30 specific questions in \nthe letter Governor McDonnell sent. I suggest that possibly the \nPresident has not thought of these issues as they relate to the health \ncare law and does not have answers. But these are answers Governors of \nboth parties continue to seek because they want to know what the impact \nof this Medicaid expansion is going to be on their own States and their \nown budgets.\n  The health care law may not be unconstitutional. It continues to be \nunworkable, it continues to be unaffordable, and it continues to be \nunpopular. You say: How unpopular is it? In a poll done just after the \nSupreme Court ruling, just last week, July 9 to July 12, a Gallup Poll \ntalked to Republicans, they talked to Democrats, but then they focused \non the Independents, and what they have shown is, of Independents in \nthis country, how they think this health care law will affect different \ncomponents of our society. They think it will actually make things \nworse for doctors, make things worse for people who currently have \nhealth insurance, they think it will make things worse for hospitals, \nthey think it will make things worse for businesses, it will make \nthings worse for taxpayers and, most importantly, they believe it will \nmake things worse for them personally.\n  That is where we are today, which is why we need to repeal and \nreplace this health care law. My advice to Governors around the country \nwould be to wait a minute until after the election to decide what you \nwant to do about Medicaid expansion because we are continuing to work \nto repeal and replace this broken health care law.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch pertaining to the introduction of S. 3397 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll of the Senate.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, would the Chair please let me know when \nthere is a couple of minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                         Senate Responsibility\n\n  Mr. President, earlier this year I came to the floor with a group of \nRepublican and Democratic Senators to congratulate the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, and the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, as well as \nthe leaders of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye and Senator \nCochran. The reason for the congratulations was this: They said they \nwere going to do their best to bring all of the appropriations bills to \nthe floor and pass them. That may not seem like such a monumental \npledge or promise, but it, in fact, is, because only twice since the \nyear 2000 has the Senate gone through the whole process of bringing all \n12 appropriations bills to the Senate floor and enacting them in time \nfor the beginning of the fiscal year on October 1.\n  Why is that so important? Well, we are in the midst of a fiscal \ncrisis. We are borrowing 42 cents out of every dollar we spend. One way \nto deal with that is through the appropriations process. That is our \nfirst constitutional responsibility. Judges judge; we appropriate. That \nis the first thing we do. We have control of the people's money. The \nappropriations bills I am talking about, the 12 of them together, \nconstitute a pretty big number. More than a third--38 percent--of all \nthe dollars we spend in the Federal Government go through those 12 \nbills. It used to be a lot more.\n  So when the majority leader and the Republican leader said, Yes, we \nare going to do our best to bring all of those appropriations bills to \nthe floor, I thought the Senate had taken an important step in \nfunctioning the way the American people expect the Senate to function. \nThe American people expect us to get about the serious business of this \ncountry so that, in the words of the Australian Foreign Minister, Bob \nCarr, we can show the people we recognize that we are really one budget \nagreement away from reasserting America's preeminence in the world. We \nhave that within our power.\n  The economy of the country, the economy of other countries depends, \nto a great extent, on our ability to govern ourselves properly. So I \nwas very encouraged when the majority leader and the Republican leader \nsaid, Yes, we are going to do our best to bring all 12 of those bills \nto the floor.\n  I regret to say I am equally disappointed that the majority leader \nsuddenly announced last week he won't bring any appropriations bills to \nthe floor. The reasons he gives are very puzzling to me. First he says, \nWell, the House is using a different number than the Senate. What is so \nnew about that? That is why we have the House and the Senate. They are \none kind of body and\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\nwe are another kind. They have their opinion; we have ours. We vote on \nour opinions. Then we have a procedure called the conference in which \nwe come together and we get a result. We have had so few conferences \nlately that maybe some people have forgotten we do that, but we have a \nway to do it.\n  Then the majority leader said, Well, they in the House violated the \nBudget Control Act. The Budget Control Act was simply something we \nagreed on--I voted for it--to try to put some limits on the growth of \ndiscretionary spending in the budget. If we stick to that over the next \n10 years, the discretionary spending--not the two-thirds of the budget \nthat is entitlement spending but this one-third we are talking about--\nwill only grow at an little bit more than the rate of inflation. If our \nwhole budget grew at that rate, we wouldn't have a fiscal problem.\n  Those aren't good reasons. We have a way to reconcile our \ndifferences. The Budget Control Act is only limits. The Senate actually \nhas exceeded those limits, according to my colleague Senator Corker, \nalready three times in this year. So there is no excuse whatsoever for \nnot bringing up appropriations bills on the floor of the Senate.\n  If we think the Solyndra loan was a bad idea, that is the place to \ntake it out. Or, if we want to spend more money for national defense, \nthat is the place to put it in. Or if we think we are wasting money on \nnational parks or too much government land, that is the place to take \nit out. Are those bills ready to come to the floor? Yes, they are. In \nthe Senate, we have been doing our job in our committees. Let me be \nexactly right about this, but I believe we have nine of our \nappropriations bills that are ready to come to the floor, that we are \nready to go to work on right now. The House of Representatives has \nalready passed 11 of the 12 appropriations bills through committee and \n6 of those have been passed by the House. So this month, we could be \ndebating any of those appropriations bills. We could have amendment \nafter amendment after amendment. We could reduce our spending. We could \nincrease our spending. We could say to the American people: We are \ndoing our job.\n  That brings me to my second disappointment. I was greatly encouraged \nthis year--and a lot of the credit goes to Senators on the Democratic \nside as well as some on our side--who are saying, Wait a minute. We are \ngrownups. We recognize we are political accidents. We have been given \nthe great privilege of representing the people of our State and \nswearing an oath to our Constitution of the United States so we can \nhelp lead this country. So we want to go to work. We want to go to \nwork.\n  What does the Senate do? Well, the Senate brings bills up through \ncommittee, it brings bills to the floor, and then, as the late Senator \nByrd used to say, almost any amendment comes to the floor and we debate \nit and we vote on it, and then we either pass the bill or we don't pass \nthe bill. That is what the Senate does.\n  We on our side have been saying to the majority leader: Mr. Majority \nLeader, let us offer our amendments. Don't silence the voices of the \npeople in our States that we represent. So he has been allowing that to \nhappen more. Of course, he has the procedural ability to stop that. The \nSenator from Michigan said: Let's try just having relevant amendments, \nso we said: OK, let's try that. So we began to make some progress.\n  There was a dispute over district judges. We resolved that. We have \nbeen confirming them. The Postal Service bill, the farm bill, the FDA \nbill, the highway bill--these are all important pieces of legislation \nthat affect almost every American family, and what did we do? They went \nthrough committee; they had the expertise of the members who work on \nthose committees; they came to the floor; we had a lot of amendments, \nwe voted on them, and they were passed by the Senate. In other words, \nwe did what we should do.\n  I thought we were on a lot better track until the last 2 or 3 weeks. \nSuddenly, what has happened? Suddenly, all that ends. We revert to \npolitical exercises--little bills of no real importance compared to the \nbills we should be debating. We have a jobs bill, the DISCLOSE Act \nbill, and the bill we are about to go to that the Senator from Michigan \nis proposing. The problem with those bills is they have not been \nthrough committee. They are not going to pass the House. Everybody \nknows that. So we are wasting our time at a time when we could be \ndebating all of the appropriations bills of the U.S. Government. At a \ntime when the U.S. Government is borrowing 42 cents out of every dollar \nwe are spending, we are not even going to do our job and consider \nappropriations bills on the floor and amend them. What will the whole \nworld think? What will our constituents think about our ability to \ngovern ourselves if we can't pass--even consider--an appropriations \nbill in the U.S. Senate?\n  On top of that, we haven't had a budget for over 1,000 days. I \nremember when Condoleezza Rice, the Secretary of State, came back and \nmet with a group of Senators. She came back from Iraq early after their \ngovernment was formed and she said, They can't even get a budget over \nthere in Iraq. Senators looked around at each other, and here we have \nbeen a Republic for a long time and we can't get one, either. So I am \nvery disappointed by the fact that after such a promising surge of \nactivity that was bipartisan and that got results, we have suddenly \nreverted back to forgetting that we have a way to deal with our \ndifferences.\n  It is not because we don't have anything to do. Where is the \ncybersecurity bill? Where is the Defense authorization bill? Where are \nthe appropriations bills? They are all ready to be considered, at a \ntime when we are in a fiscal crisis, looking at a fiscal cliff which, \nif we don't solve, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board yesterday, it will plunge us into \na recession in the first 6 months of 2013. Those are the stakes we are \nplaying with.\n  There is also a third area in which I must express my severe \ndisappointment. We worked hard at the beginning of this Congress to \naccommodate a number of Senators who felt we needed changes in the \nrules, and we made some changes. But we preserved the Senate's \nintegrity as a different sort of institution--as a place where the \nparty that has 51 votes doesn't run over anybody else.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville said the two greatest problems he foresaw with \nthe American democracy--this was back in the 1830s--were, No. 1, \nRussia; and No. 2, the tyranny of the majority. Well, the Senate, as \nSenator Byrd used to so eloquently say, is the single most important \ninstitution in our country, to protect minority rights and minority \npoints of view. Sometimes we are in the minority on this side, and we \nwill notice there are some fewer desks. Then after an election, maybe \nmore people vote for Democrats and they come in and they pick up the \ndesks and they move them over to that side. Whichever side is in the \nminority in the Senate still has rights, and those aren't just the \nrights of the Senators themselves, those are their rights to speak the \nvoices of Tennessee or Maryland or Nevada or New York or Kentucky. It \nis those voices that need to be heard on the floor of the Senate. And \nwhen we can't debate, when we can't offer amendments and we can't vote, \nthose voices are silenced.\n  So to my great surprise, the majority leader--and as I said, I came \nto the floor more than once to compliment him for this--said at the \nbeginning of this Congress that he wouldn't seek to change the rules of \nthe Senate except according to the regular order--except according to \nthe rules of the Senate which say we have to have 67 votes. That is \nwhat the rules say. We agreed on that. What that meant was we needed a \nchange in behavior, not a change in the rules, to show that the Senate \ncould function.\n  Last night on television, apparently the majority leader said that in \nthe next Congress--he had changed his mind and that if he is the \nmajority leader, he will seek to change the rules of the Senate by 51 \nvotes. That will destroy the Senate. That will make it no different \nthan the House. I would say to my friends on the other side, if they \nwant to make the Senate like the House where a freight train can run \nthrough it with 51 votes, they might not like it so well when the \nfreight train is the tea party express, which it could be. Republicans \ncould be in control of the Senate after this session. Republicans could \nhave a President, and then where would ObamaCare be?\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nWhere will a whole series of things be? There will be a great many \nSenators on the other side who will say, Wait a minute, let's slow down \nthe train. Let's think about what we are doing. That was the original \nintention of the Founders of this country. The House is majoritarian \nand 51 votes control. A freight train can run through it day in and day \nout. But when it gets to the Senate we stop and think and minority \nrights are protected. As a result of that, usually that forces us to \nhave a supermajority 60, 65, or 70 votes--in order to do anything big, \nsuch as the time when finally the civil rights bill was enacted in the \n1960s. Senator Russell, who led the debate against the Civil Rights \nAct, filibustered it. He was finally defeated. He flew home to Georgia \nand said, It is now the law of the land; we support it. That is why \nPresident Johnson wrote the bill in the office of the Republican \nleader, even though the President was a Democrat. He wanted bipartisan \nsupport.\n  President Johnson knew he had the votes in the 1960s to pass the \nCivil Rights Act without Republican support, but he had the bill \nwritten in the office of Senator Everett Dirksen, the Republican \nleader. I remember I was a young aide at that time. The Senators were \nin there and the aides were in there. Pretty soon everyone was invested \nin it. When it passed, as I said, Senator Russell went home to Georgia \nand said, it is the law of the land. We have to support it.\n  Now we are coming up on what the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard has called the fiscal cliff. This is a convergence of big issues \nranging from the debt ceiling to how we pay doctors to the spiraling, \nout-of-control entitlements we have, to the need for a simplified Tax \nCode, to the need for lower rates. We have been working on this in \nvarious ways across party lines for several months.\n  There is a growing consensus that the time to act is after the \nelection. It will require Presidential leadership, whether it is newly \ninaugurated President Obama or a new President Romney, and our job will \nbe to see that the newly inaugurated President succeeds, whether he is \na Republican President or a Democratic President, because if he does, \nthen our country succeeds.\n  What are the stakes? The Foreign Minister of Australia, Bob Carr, put \nit very well when he said in a speech here--and he is a great friend of \nthe United States and I have known him for 25 years--he said: The \nUnited States is one budget agreement away from reasserting its global \npreeminence--one budget deal away from reasserting our global \npreeminence.\n  But if we cannot even bring up an appropriations bill to debate it, \nto amend it, to vote on it, and to pass it, if we suddenly are dealing \nwith bills that have not gone to committee that are nothing more than a \npolitical exercise, if we are sitting around in the Senate with nothing \nto do of significance--and there is only one person who can bring up \nissues here; that is, the majority leader--how is that going to convey \nto the American people we are capable of governing ourselves? I think \nit sends a clear message that we are failing to do that.\n  So having expressed my disappointment, I wish to express my respect \nfor the majority leader and to say again how much I appreciated the \nefforts he made at the beginning of the Congress to say we would not \nchange the rules of this institution, except according to the rules, \nand the effort he said he would make at the beginning of this year to \nbring up the appropriations bills and the efforts he has made to allow \nmore amendments on a whole series of bills this year and say: Can we \nnot go back to that, even though this is a Presidential election year?\n  The stakes are too high. As far as voting on amendments, that is why \nwe are here. Why would you join the Grand Ole Opry if you do not want \nto sing? That is why we are here. We are here to express the views of \nourselves and the people we represent to make sure their voice is \nheard, and then we are here to get results.\n  I hope my record is a pretty good record of working to get results. I \nsometimes say to my friends--they will say: You are being bipartisan. I \nam not interested in being bipartisan. I am interested in results. I \nlearned in the public schools of Maryville, TN, how to count, and I \nknow it takes 60 votes to get results. So anything important we do is \ngoing to require Democrats and Republicans. We are going to need a \ncoalition of Democrats and Republicans, not 51 or 53 or 54, no matter \nwho is in charge next year. We are going to need a coalition of 60 or \n65 or 70 who will come around some of the most difficult issues we have \nhad to face in terms of tax reform, in terms of deficit reduction, in \nterms of reining in entitlements--a whole series of issues. We are \ngoing to have to remember our pledge to the Constitution that we take \nat the beginning of each 6-year term, and we are going to have to honor \nthat pledge.\n  That is the Senate I hope to see. That is the Senate I am working to \ncreate. I wish to create an environment in which the Democratic leader \nand the Republican leader can succeed on big issues in helping us put \ntogether results on the serious problems. I wish to make the Australian \nForeign Minister--a great friend of the United States--I wish to show \nhim we can answer his question and that we realize, just like he does, \nthat we are one budget agreement away from reasserting America's global \npreeminence and that we in the Senate are perfectly capable of doing \nit.\n  By not bringing up appropriations bills, by reverting to political \nexercises, by leaving off the table many amendments that need debate, \nand by even suggesting we would change the nature of the Senate so a \nfreight train could run through it with 51 votes, none of that \nencourages confidence in the ability of the United States to govern \nthat I think exists.\n  I know my colleagues pretty well. I work hard with people on both \nsides. I respect them all and their opinions and I do not question \ntheir motives. It is my personal judgment that 80, 85 percent of us on \nboth sides of the aisle want a result on the big fiscal issues and on \nevery other big issue that comes here, and I would like to do my best \nto create an environment in which that could happen.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am here to speak in favor of the Bring \nJobs Home Act. I wish to thank my colleague Senator Stabenow of \nMichigan, who understands this issue because in her State of Michigan \nthey almost lost the auto industry. They almost lost the auto industry. \nThere were those who said: Let them go bankrupt. We know who those \npeople are.\n  We supported our President. We had a majority who did so. We had \ntough votes, and we said: We are not going to be the only \nindustrialized country in the world to not have an auto industry. We \nlooked at it as not only a jobs issue--clearly, it is a jobs issue--but \nwe looked at it as a national security issue as well.\n  What this bill is about, the Bring Jobs Home Act, is making sure we \nsee the words ``Made in America'' again--we see the words ``Made in \nAmerica''--so it is not a surprise when we see those words, but we say: \nThat is right. It is made in America because we have the best \nworkforce, the best entrepreneurs in the world, and we need the jobs \nhere.\n  What has happened over the years is that shipping jobs overseas \nbecame a trend and a lot of important voices were heard saying: That is \njust the way it is. It is not just the way it is. If we have policies \nin place that incentivize manufacturing and production here, we are not \ngoing to lose those jobs. But what happened during these years is that \ncompanies got a tax deduction for moving jobs overseas. Imagine that. \nWe American taxpayers were subsidizing companies, giving them tax \nbreaks for moving jobs overseas.\n  The Bring Jobs Home Act ends those tax breaks for companies that ship \njobs overseas. What we do instead is say: We will give a 20-percent tax \ncredit to companies that move their jobs back from overseas. So they \nget a 20-percent tax credit for their moving expenses. So we stop \ngiving tax incentives to companies that move jobs overseas, and we \ninstead give tax incentives to those who bring them back.\n  Let me tell you the good news. The good news is that there are some \ncompanies that are coming back home. I wish to highlight a couple \ncompanies in California.\n  Simple Wave, a company that makes snack bowls from recycled \nmaterials,\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\nrelocated its production to Union City, CA, from China. Simple Wave \nchose to complete its manufacturing in America because they said it \nsaves time and allows for greater quality control and flexibility.\n  A cofounder of Simple Wave, Rich Stump, said:\n\n       Our business is growing very quickly and by having the \n     ability to react quickly and provide just-in-time \n     manufacturing will provide the fuel to our growth. Knowing \n     that we are contributing to the US economy re-shoring effort \n     is a great feeling--\n\n  Listen to that. This is a businessman who says: ``Knowing that we are \ncontributing to the US economy re-shoring effort is a great feeling''--\n\n     and we are confident that this will in turn provide a better \n     quality product to our customers.\n\n  I say to my Republican colleagues--I do not know how they are going \nto vote, but they have not been very supportive of this bill--if a \nbusinessman feels great because he is bringing jobs home to the United \nStates, why don't you feel great and do your part and take away tax \nbreaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and give them to companies \nthat bring jobs home?\n  Here is another one.\n  LightSaver Technologies, in Carlsbad, CA, makes emergency lighting \nfor homes. They also moved their manufacturing back from China. They \nfound that making adjustments to the manufacturing process is easier \nwhen the plant is only 30 miles away, as opposed to 12 time zones away.\n  Jerry Anderson, one of the company's founders, said:\n\n       If we have an issue in manufacturing, in America we can \n     walk down to the plant floor. We can't do that in China.\n\n  He says manufacturing in the U.S. is 2 to 5 percent cheaper once he \ntakes into account the time and trouble of outsourcing jobs overseas.\n  Again, I say to my friends, if entrepreneurs such as these feel good \nabout bringing jobs home, why are you continuing to support subsidies \nto companies that move jobs overseas?\n  We are coming out of a very tough recession--a very tough recession--\nand we know we need to create jobs here at home. I truly wish to say to \nthe people who may be watching this debate--if there are a few; I think \nthere might be just a few--we have control over this. We know if we \ngive incentives to companies to ship jobs overseas, their bottom line \nis going to be changed by that. But if we give incentives to companies \nto bring jobs back, their bottom line will look much better.\n  So we have the opportunity with this important bill to move forward \nand turn things around. Do not believe when people say: Oh, it is just \nthe way it is. We are just outsourcing. That is the global marketplace. \nThat is it.\n  If we take that attitude, the future is going to be pretty bleak. \nBecause we do have the greatest workers in the world. They have the \nbest productivity of any workers--the best. So why would we say: It is \njust the way it is. We need to fight for those jobs. We need to fight. \nWe have to stand up to the people who say: It is just the way it is. It \nis just the way business is.\n  When somebody tells us that kind of a simple statement, we should \nquestion it. It is the way it is for many reasons. One of them is, we \nare giving incentives right now to companies to ship jobs overseas.\n  A Wall Street Journal survey found that some of our largest \ncorporations cut 2.9 million U.S. jobs over the last decade from \nAmerica, while hiring 2.4 million people overseas. So they cut jobs \nhere, and they created jobs there.\n  So when a politician says to you: I am for job creation, ask him, \nwhere. We want it here. We do not want it in other countries at the \nexpense of American workers. We wish all countries well, but we have to \ntake care of America.\n  People talked about the uniforms at the Olympics, and some said: Oh, \nI am not going to get into that. That is not such a big deal.\n  It is important. It is important we make a conscious effort for our \nathletes that they do have a ``Made in America'' label.\n  Many of us have had the experience of using, as a fundraising tool, \nthe sale of T-shirts or purses or shopping bags or hats. Yes, it takes \nan effort to find the right place to go, but those can be made in \nAmerica. I say it takes a little effort for a good result. As Senator \nReid said, we have people in the textile industry crying for work. So \ndo not just brush it off as a nonissue. It is an important issue.\n  In California, more than 3,400 jobs were lost to outsourcing this \nyear alone--3,400.\n  From 2000 to 2010, the United States lost 5.7 million manufacturing \njobs.\n  But it is not just manufacturing. Science and high-tech jobs, legal \nand financial services, business operations are being moved overseas as \nwell. We all know we make those calls trying to find out something, \nwhether it is an airline schedule or information on a product, and you \nget the sense the person is not talking to you from an American city. \nWhy on Earth would we give incentives to have those jobs created \nelsewhere?\n  That is what this bill is all about. With 12.7 million unemployed \npeople and only 3.6 million jobs that we have open nationwide, we have \nto find ways to reverse this trend.\n  I think Senator Stabenow has hit on a very good way to start with the \nbringing American jobs home act. It is so easy. We want to say to \ncompanies: We are for your bringing jobs back, to the extent that we \nwill give you an actual tax credit for doing that. It is very key.\n  So I hope we can come together across the lines that divide us, these \nartificial lines, and work together. We have done it on a few \noccasions. We did it on the highway bill. I am so pleased we were able \nto do it then. The Presiding Officer was very involved in that. It was \nnot easy. This one is easy. The highway bill had 30 different programs \nin it. We are talking about a very simple premise: Right now we give \ntax breaks to companies who shift jobs overseas, and we want to end it. \nEnough. It is not complicated; it is easy.\n  Why my Republican friends cannot join hands with us on this one I do \nnot understand. But I have to say, we can do this for the American \nworker, whether they are from California or Ohio or Texas or Arizona or \nMaryland or Kentucky--wherever they may be. This is one we can do for \nthe working people and the entrepreneurs of our Nation.\n  So I congratulate Senator Stabenow. I look forward to voting in favor \nof the Bring Jobs Home Act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Defense Sequester\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we know with some certainty that on \nJanuary 20, 2013, regardless of who the President is, he will swear, to \nthe best of his ability, to protect and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States; that more than 60,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines will remain deployed in Afghanistan, and that our All-Volunteer \nForce will stand ready to defend American interests in the Strait of \nHormuz, in the Republic of Korea, as well as defend our allies across \nthe globe.\n  Our forces will remain committed on that day to denying the Taliban a \nreturn to Afghanistan, to denying al-Qaida a safe haven, to training \nthe Afghan national security forces, and to fulfilling the operational \nplans of our regional commanders. As important: the troops in the \ntraining pipeline and the schoolhouse, the F-35s in production, and the \nbasic research and development programs in progress will provide the \ncapabilities to meet future threats.\n  What is not certain is whether the President who is sworn in on that \nday will have to attempt to manage the damage done on January 2, 2013, \nby across-the-board cuts to the Defense Department of roughly $50 \nbillion. But he will if the President and the Democrats in Congress \nfail to act on the cuts to defense that the President has insisted on, \nbut which his own Secretary of Defense has said would be \n``devastating.''\n  Let me say that again. These are cuts the President is insisting on, \nbut his own Secretary of Defense says would be ``devastating.''\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\n  That is why I and my Republican colleagues call on the President to \nmake his plans for these cuts clear right now. The President owes it to \nour forces around the world and to their families to put a plan on the \ntable for all to see now rather than waiting until after the November \nelections pass. To keep these details secret and to leave the defense \nsequester in place as written would be irresponsible regardless of the \noutcome of the Presidential election.\n  Think about it. If Governor Romney is elected, he will be responsible \nfor managing $50 billion of programmatic cuts before he or a new \nSecretary of Defense has even had a chance to conduct a review of the \nDefense Department's plans, programs, and strategy. And if President \nObama is reelected, the arbitrary spending cuts directed by the Budget \nControl Act of 2011 that he insisted on would eviscerate the \nPresident's own defense strategic guidance issued earlier this year.\n  No wonder Secretary Panetta has said these cuts would be like \n``shooting ourselves in the head.'' The weapons systems and \ncapabilities required to provide a dominant presence in the Asia-\nPacific Theater, attack submarines, amphibious ships, marines afloat \nand ashore, the next generation bomber, completing acquisition of the \nF-35, and the Ford class aircraft carriers will be required to deter \nand defeat aggression and to project power.\n  Investments in these capabilities must be made while we continue to \ncombat and pursue al-Qaida, deploy and equip special operations forces, \nand, of course, seek to deter Iran. That is why the President should \nprepare for the possibility of a possible transition in power now and \nshould do so with the same foresight and concern for our operations \nthat previous administrations have demonstrated.\n  The last two transfers of political power, that from President \nClinton to President Bush, and that from President Bush to President \nObama, are instructive in how past administrations have managed the \ntransition of the Defense Department's leadership both in peace and in \nwar.\n  Early in 2001, before the Senate majority changed control from that \nof Republicans to Democrats, before the attacks of September 11, and \nbefore an envelope containing anthrax was sent to the Hart Building, \nSecretary Rumsfeld assumed his duties as the Secretary of Defense. He \ninformed the Congress that he would conduct a strategic review of the \nDepartment's plan and programs and submit an amended budget later in \nthe year.\n  That document was ultimately provided to the Congress in June 2001. \nSecretary Rumsfeld had months--literally months--to develop an initial \nplan. And this, by the way, was prior to the war on terror, or as we \nthought it then, during peacetime.\n  At the end of the second term of President Bush, Secretary Gates \nfound himself responsible for the first Presidential transition during \nwartime in 40 years. Secretary Gates established a transition staff and \na briefing process to ensure all incoming Obama administration \nofficials were well prepared during a time of war. He encouraged \npolitical appointees to remain in office and to help with the new \nadministration. Ultimately, he ended up staying on as Secretary.\n  Just consider the plight of what a President-elect may face in \nJanuary 2013. Iran has shown no willingness to end its uranium \nenrichment effort. A young, inexperienced, untested leader is in charge \nof North Korea. The Taliban patiently waits for the United States and \nNATO to withdraw from Afghanistan. And al-Qaida's senior leadership, \nthough weakened, and al-Qaida and an affiliate remain determined to \nstrike the homeland. Egypt and Libya struggle with forming new \ngovernments. The revolt in Syria threatens regional stability, and al-\nQaida affiliates stay active in Mali, North Africa, and Yemen.\n  As the next President attempts to have his Cabinet Secretaries \nconfirmed, he will be dealing with managing a disruption in procurement \ncontracts and deliveries, actions that are likely to elevate the cost \nof weapons systems and lead to layoffs in our industrial base. Troops \npreparing for deployment will see training curtailed. Permanent change-\nof-station orders will likely be delayed. Training and maintenance \nreadiness levels will decline. All of this will occur while a new \nadministration is reviewing war plans in Afghanistan.\n  Think of what this would say to a President-elect: As you are \ndeveloping your new national security strategy, attempting to seat your \nCabinet, and assessing the war in Afghanistan, the sequester will slash \nevery program under review. Welcome aboard, sir. You have your hands \nfull.\n  More important is what this will say to every soldier and marine \nstill fighting in Regional Command East: Despite the outcome of the \nelection, you may still be fighting the Taliban, attempting to train \nand mentor an Afghan soldier, conducting a drawdown of forces, and \nhanding off operational responsibilities at the same time the funding \nof your operational training, weapons maintenance, and operations of \nyour base childcare center are being slashed. If you are wounded, the \nfunding for the defense health program and the care you receive will \nalso be cut. That is why allowing the sequester to go into effect as \ncurrently written and as demanded, demanded by the President, would \nbreak faith with the forces we have sent abroad.\n  To confront a new President with this level of disruption as he \ntransitions to wartime command would be deeply irresponsible. We must \ndeal with defense sequestration prior to the election. The sequester \nshould be equally concerning to President Obama.\n  In January of this year, the Department of Defense released strategic \nguidance that entails a rebalancing of our forces with an emphasis on a \ngrowing presence in the Asia-Pacific Theater. The wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and the counterinsurgency strategy used in both campaigns \nrequired an expansion of our Marine Corps and Army ground forces. \nPresident Obama has announced plans to reduce the Army by 72,000 \nsoldiers between 2012 and 2017 and the Marine Corps by 20,000 between \n2012 and 2017. Yet the force structure required to conduct \ncounterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan is far different from that \nrequired to convince friend and foe alike that our presence in Asia is \nsignificant and sustainable.\n  We must invest in a new generation of warfighting capability. The \nPresident's budget insufficiently funds this new strategy, and that is \nactually before sequestration. This year's budget request delayed \nconstruction of a large-deck amphibious ship, a new Virginia-class \nsubmarine, and announced the early retirement of other ships. These \nreductions are envisioned without those related to sequestration. \nNaval, air and forced-entry capabilities to combat anti-access weapons \nare the capabilities required under the new strategy, and they are \nunderfunded in the President's budget. This comes at a time when \nmilitary expenditures in Asia are outpacing those in Europe.\n  Let me be clear. The failure of the administration to match the \nPresident's budget request to his new strategy is not an argument for \ngrowing the defense top line, it is emblematic of the difficulty our \nregional commanders will have in fulfilling current operational plans \nbefore you even get to the sequester.\n  Although the administration has emphasized that the rebalancing of \nour forces in Asia is not a strategy to confront the growth of China's \nmilitary, if we fail to match our commitment to Asia with the requisite \nforce structure, China's influence, military posture, and sphere of \ninfluence will actually expand. As the Pentagon's own Annual Report to \nCongress makes clear, China is committed to annual military spending \nincreases of roughly 12 percent, and it has undertaken a broad-based \neffort to expand the capabilities of the People's Liberation Army.\n  Both Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey have made it clear that \nthe ability of our Armed Forces to execute the new strategy under \nsequestration would be at risk. As General Dempsey, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, has stated, under sequestration, ``it's coming out of \nthree places: equipment and modernization--that's one. It's coming out \nof maintenance, and it's coming out of training. And then we've \nhollowed out the force.''\n  In his new strategic guidance, President Obama articulated a \ncommitment to our enduring national security interests; the security of \nour Nation, allies, and partners; the prosperity that\n\n[[Page S5117]]\n\nflows from an open and free international system; and a sustainable \ninternational order. Needless to say, those interests will be extremely \ndifficult to maintain with a hollow force.\n  Just as the next President will take the oath on Inauguration Day, we \ntoo take an oath as Senators. We have a responsibility to raise and \nsupport armies and provide and maintain a navy. If we let sequestration \nas currently written go forward and do not act, we will have failed. \nThat is why I am so disappointed with the President's failure of \nleadership on this issue and that of Senate Democrats as well.\n  Both House and Senate Republicans have offered proposals to replace \nthe savings from sequestration with more thoughtful and targeted \nspending cuts. Both of those proposals also either eliminated or \nreduced the sequester on nondefense programs as well.\n  Last week, Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Cantor, Senator Kyl, and \nI sent a letter to the President asking him to work with us to find a \nbipartisan solution before the end of the fiscal year. With a $3.6 \ntrillion annual budget, clearly there is a smarter, more thoughtful way \nto achieve at least $110 billion in savings.\n  It is simply outrageous that this President and Senate Democrats are \nmissing in action on this issue. We are committed to finding a solution \non this before we recess for the election. Are they? Or are they \ncommitted to jeopardizing our national security? When will they sit \ndown and work with us to find a solution?\n  The House overwhelmingly passed the Sequestration Transparency Act \ntoday by a vote of 414 to 2. This bill is modeled after a Thune-\nSessions bill. It asks the President's Office of Management and Budget \nto submit a report to Congress on the impact of sequestration on both \ndefense and nondefense programs. Every single Democrat in the House \nBudget Committee supported it--every one. Will that bill die in the \nSenate because Democrats not only do not want to address sequestration, \nthey want to hide the ball on the impact of sequestration until after \nthe November elections? If they resist this effort to get more \ninformation on sequestration out in the open, it is clear that they \nwish Congress to be both blind and mute when it comes to our national \ndefense and the fate of those who volunteer to defend it.\n  We need President Obama to tell this Congress his plan for avoiding \nthe sequester, for preventing the gutting of his strategy, for \nresponsibly transitioning to a new Commander in Chief, and for keeping \nfaith with the warriors we have sent into combat. In all of this, our \noverriding objective--in fact, our duty--should be to work with the \nPresident to achieve the level of savings called for in the Budget \nControl Act without doing harm to our national security or to our \nmilitary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield to the majority whip for a \nunanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that \nwhen the colloquy is finished with the five Republican Senators on the \nfloor, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, listening to the distinguished Republican \nleader, I am reminded of that quotation from former Secretary of \nDefense Robert Gates, who said that our records of predicting when we \nwill use military force since Vietnam is perfect--we have never been \nright once.\n  We live in a dangerous and unpredictable world. We also know the \nglobal economy is in dire straits, in some places worse than others. In \nEurope, relevant to the national security question, we can no longer \nnecessarily depend on our NATO allies to step up and do what they have \ndone heretofore because they have their own economic and budgetary \nproblems. Talking to some of our counterparts in the United Kingdom, \nthe British Army is being cut by 20 percent because of austerity \nmeasures. So at a time when the world continues to be a very dangerous \nplace--and Secretary Gates said we cannot know where the next threat to \nAmerica or our allies will come from--we are finding the capability to \naddress that threat reduced because of the budgetary cuts and thus \nincreasing the risk to not only the United States but to our allies as \nwell.\n  I wish to make just one point clear. National security is not just \none thing on a laundry list of the things the Federal Government can or \nshould do, it is No. 1. It is the ultimate justification for the \nFederal Government to provide for the safety and security of the \nAmerican people. When the Federal Government treats national security \njust like any other expense on the government ledger, I think it \ndenigrates the priority it should be.\n  When I heard the Senator from Washington the other day speaking at \nthe Brookings Institute, she made an amazing speech in which--I am \nsummarizing--she suggested that she and her colleagues will be prepared \nto trigger a recession unless this side would agree to raise taxes. It \nis not just the expiring tax provisions on December 31, which would be \nthe single largest tax increase in American history, it is this $1.2 \ntrillion sequester that cuts not only into the muscle but into the bone \nof our Defense Department and our ability to provide for our national \nsecurity needs. It also has collateral impact on private sector jobs \nacross the country. By one estimate, it is 90,000 jobs in my State \nalone. So why we would see our colleagues and the Commander in Chief \nhimself wanting to play a game of chicken with our national security \nand our economy is beyond me.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With regard to the impact on the economy, I wonder how \nmany Boeing employees, for example, there may be in the State of \nWashington. Does the Senator have a number on that?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Responding to the question, I don't have an exact number, \nbut I do know that by one estimate as many as 1 million private sector \njobs would be affected if this sequester goes into effect as currently \nwritten.\n  We made it clear under the leadership of Senator McCain, ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, that we are willing to work \nwith our colleagues to try to change the structure of this sequester. \nWe all believe Federal spending needs to be cut. But this is something \nthat would, as the Republican leader said and Secretary Panetta \nadmitted, would hollow out our national security and would be \ndisastrous. Why the President won't listen to his own Secretary of \nDefense is beyond me.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So I say to the Senator from Texas, it is not just the \nimpact on the military, which is devastating enough, but on our economy \nas well, correct?\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is exactly right. The consensus appears to be--I \nremember that Alice Rivlin, a former budget director under President \nClinton, said that if the sequester goes into effect as currently \nwritten and this tax increase occurs at the same time, we will be in a \nrecession.\n  This is the part I really don't understand. I think we all have been \naround politics enough to know that people act in their own self-\ninterest, but how in the world could this be in the President's or his \nparty's self-interest--it is certainly not in the national interest--to \nsee the economy bouncing along from the bottom, with slow growth and \nthe threat of a recession going into a national election? That makes no \nsense to me whatsoever.\n  I know we have other colleagues from the Armed Services Committee \nhere who have something to say about this. I will reiterate something \nthe Republican leader said. We stand ready to deal with this issue \nnow--sooner rather than later. To ignore this until after the election, \ncreating not only more uncertainty but the inability of our Department \nof Defense and our military to provide for the protection and the \nsecurity of the American people, is completely irresponsible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I say to my colleague that I thank him \nfor his important words, and I thank the Republican leader for his \ncommitment. I also point out that the Senator from Alabama, the ranking \nmember on the Budget Committee, has some very\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\ninteresting statistics that I hope in the course of our colloquy he \nwill talk about--how America's spending on defense has decreased over \nthe years and how Draconian the effects on national defense will be in \nthe case of the implementation of the sequester on our defense spending \nand the security of our Nation.\n  We need to discuss this issue in the context of what the Secretary of \nDefense said. He said that if this sequestration is implemented, it \nwill place our national security in jeopardy. It will be, in his words, \ndevastating. So I believe it is important for the American people and \nour colleagues to understand that the Secretary of Defense--not John \nMcCain, Senator Sessions, or any of my Republican colleagues, but the \nSecretary of Defense--said it will be devastating.\n  We live in a dangerous world--a very dangerous world. If we cut \ndefense the way this sequestration is headed, then there is no doubt we \nwill have the smallest Navy and Air Force in history, with fewer ships \nthan we have had since before World War II, and it will be a hollow \nforce.\n  I would like to make one other comment as my friends join me. What is \nour country's greatest obligation? What is our No. 1 obligation, both \nthe administration and Congress? It is to ensure the security of our \nNation. That takes priority over every other item on our agenda. So \nwhen we start talking about sequestration, that is important in its \neffect, but I also think it is entirely proper--in fact, it should be \nour priority to talk about sequestration's effect on our defense.\n  I will point out that all of my colleagues here know we are facing \nreductions in defense. We already had $87 billion implemented by \nSecretary Gates, and another $400 billion has already been implemented. \nIf we implement this sequestration, it will be over $1 trillion in a \nvery short period of time.\n  We need to sit down and work together, Republicans, Democrats, and \nthe President--who so far has been completely MIA--and work this out so \nthat we can avoid what can be Draconian cuts and jeopardize our \nnational defense, not to mention, as I am sure my colleague from \nAlabama will point out, the effect on our economy--the effect on our \neconomy of over 1 million jobs lost and a reduction in our GDP.\n  So this is an important discussion. This is a very important debate. \nAnd if someone disagrees with our assessment and that of the Secretary \nof Defense, then I will be glad to listen to their arguments. But until \nthen, I will take the word of the Secretary of Defense that this \nimplementation of Defense sequestration will put our Nation in \njeopardy.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  From the Senator's perspective--as the Senator has been on this \ncommittee a long time, he has served in the military, and he is the \nranking Republican on the committee--in the Senator's judgment, based \non the obligations we have--and I know the Senator has openly and \naggressively condemned waste and abuse in the Defense Department--but \ndoes the Senator think the Defense Department can maintain its \nresponsibilities with this cut?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would respond to my friend, through the Chair, that I \ndon't think in the dangerous world in which we live that we can afford \nto have the smallest Air Force in history, the smallest Navy since \nbefore World War II, and the smallest Army since before World War II. \nMost importantly, we have to continue to modernize and we have to \ncontinue to invest, as my friend from Alabama knows.\n  The fact is we have a crisis with Iran, we have a rising challenge \nwith increasing activities of China, we have an unsettled North Africa, \nwe have an Arab spring going on all over the Middle East, and all of \nthese present a compelling argument for us to be prepared to meet \ncontingencies.\n  If we were having this debate a year and a half ago, Ben Ali is in \npower in Tunisia, Qadhafi is in power in Libya, Mubarak is in power in \nEgypt, and there would not be a bloody civil war taking place in Syria. \nSo where will we be, I ask my friend from Alabama, a year and a half \nfrom now? I don't know. But it seems to me we cannot afford to be \ncutting defense in this fashion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I value Senator McCain's judgment \nbecause he has been engaged in these debates for many years.\n  Mr. President, I want to yield to Senator Inhofe because I know he \nwants to share his thoughts at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. A lot \nhas been said, and those of us who serve on the Armed Services \nCommittee have been watching what is going on with a lot of distress. I \nthink it is important for us to understand how we got into this mess to \nstart with. By his own budget, we have a President who has given us \nover $1 trillion in deficit each year for 4 years, totaling $5.3 \ntrillion. So that is the mess we are in that we are trying to get out \nof. But in all that time, the one that has not been properly funded has \nbeen the military. The first budget he had he cut out the F-22, the C-\n17, and the future combat system--all these systems that were so \nimportant--and it has gone downhill since then.\n  As you project the President's budget out, as has been said, we are \ntalking about reducing about $\\1/2\\ trillion. Now comes sequestration. \nThat is over and above. A lot of people don't realize it. They think we \nare talking just about the $\\1/2\\ trillion that will be cut over a \nperiod of time. I will use one of the charts that was actually put \ntogether by the Senator from Alabama that shows where this stuff is \ncoming from. Everything seems to be exempt except the military. Food \nstamps, exempt 100 percent of it; Medicaid, 37 percent; and only 10 \npercent of the DOD base budget. So why is it we find ourselves in a \nsituation where that is the problem?\n  The only thing other thing I want to mention is this. I have every \nreason to believe, because I have heard from people in industry, the \nPresident of the United States is trying to get them to avoid sending \nout pink slips until after the November 7 election. I would remind him \nthat we have something called the Workers Adjustment Retraining and \nNotification Act--WARN Act--and that requires any of these companies, \nprior to sequestration on January 2, within 60 days, which would be \nNovember 2, to notify people of their pink slips.\n  But this is what I wish to remind people. They do not have to wait. \nIf they want to do it today, they can do it. I think it is imperative \nthe people--the workers who will be laid off work as a result of \nObama's sequestration--know in advance of the November election, and we \nare going to do everything we can to make sure that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe referred to this chart \nand I have now had it brought over at his request. This is something we \nprepared, and it dispels the myth that the reason this government is \nrunning such huge deficits is surges in military spending. That is an \ninaccurate event.\n  The base defense budget from 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 increased \nabout 10 percent. Medicaid, during the same time, increased 37 percent; \nand food stamps, during this same 4-year period, doubled--a 100-percent \nincrease. Under the sequester, food stamps get not a dime of cuts; \nMedicaid gets not a dime worth of cuts. These cuts are \ndisproportionately targeted at the Defense Department.\n  The Defense Department, as the Senator says, has already taken a $487 \nbillion reduction under the BCA, and due to sequestration it would be \nanother $492 billion. That is why, I believe, it has gone from belt \ntightening, waste reducing, and efficiency to producing the damage to \nthe Defense Department.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Would the Senator show this other chart?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. Senator McCain asks we look at this chart. This \nagain shows what would happen under the sequester. Our budget staff has \nworked hard to correctly do these numbers. Under the sequester, the \nadditional $492 billion in cuts, adjusted for inflation, the defense \nbudget over 10 years would be reduced by a real 11 percent. That is, \none-sixth of the Federal Government's spending is defense. The \nremaining five-sixths of the Federal Government would increase 35 \npercent under the sequestration and current\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\nBCA policies. So again, I think that is clear proof the Defense \nDepartment is disproportionately being asked to reduce.\n  Senator McCain suggests another chart. He likes my charts.\n  How about the 50-year switch? It is so dramatic. And the American \npeople have to know this. I wish it were not so. I wish I could be more \noptimistic about our financial future and the ease with which we can \nget ourselves on the right track, but it is not going to be easy, and \nthis chart indicates that.\n  In 1963, defense made up 48 percent of the outlays of the United \nStates--48 percent in 1963. This was not at the height of Vietnam or \nthe Korean war or anything. The entitlements of America amounted to 26 \npercent of the budget. What has happened in the past 50 years? \nEntitlements have now reached 60 percent of the budget and the Defense \nDepartment is 19 percent of the budget.\n  This is a dramatic alteration of where we are. Some of this is normal \nand natural. But I think what Senator McCain is saying is that \ndefending America is a core function of government and we need to be \nsure this alteration does not put us in the position where America is \nnot properly defended.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would say to my colleagues who are here \non the floor that this is a defining moment for our country. The most \nbasic responsibility and the most important priority we have as \nAmericans is to defend the country. If we don't get national security \nright, the rest is conversation. We can talk about all these other \nthings in the budget--we can talk about all the other priorities the \ncountry has, all of which are important--but if we fail to defend the \nUnited States of America, we have failed the citizens of this country. \nIt is the No. 1 priority we have. It is the most important \nresponsibility and obligation we have as public servants here in the \nSenate--to make sure we are taking the steps necessary to keep this \ncountry strong and secure from threats both here at home and abroad.\n  What happened--and how we got to where we are today--goes back to the \nfact that we haven't passed a budget for 3 years in the Senate. I need \nto remind my colleagues why we are where we are today. The reason we \nare here is because for 3 consecutive years now the Democratic majority \nin the Senate has not done the most fundamental responsibility we have, \nwhich is to pass a budget that addresses our national security \ninterests. What did we end up with? We ended up last summer with the \nBudget Control Act--something cobbled together at the eleventh hour to \navoid a deadline on raising the debt limit--and we put in place a \nprocess where a supercommittee would look at ways to define long-term \nsavings so we could avoid the sequester. But the sequester was put in \nplace as a result of the Budget Control Act, which was put in place \nbecause the Senate hasn't passed a budget now for 3 straight years. \nThat is why we are where we are.\n  Having said that, we need to fix the problem. And the problem is we \nhave defense cuts that are going to cut very deeply into our national \nsecurity interests, and we even have the Secretary of Defense coming \nout and saying these cuts would be devastating. The President's own \nSecretary of Defense has made a statement to that effect. With \nsequestration, we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the \nsmallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest tactical Air \nForce literally in the history of the Air Force. That is the dimension \nof the problem we are talking about, as has been described by the \nexperts who are supposed to know these things. As I said, the \nPresident's own Defense Secretary has made these sorts of statements.\n  One of the problems we have, of course, is we don't even know what \nthe full impact of the sequester will be because the administration \nhasn't put a plan forward. So we are awaiting that plan. Today the \nHouse of Representatives voted 414 to 2 to require the administration \nto at least submit to Congress and to the American people how they \nintend to implement sequestration so we can at least have a better idea \nabout what these impacts will be, where are they going to make the \ncuts, by account, so we can examine that and come up with a plan, \nhopefully, to replace those deep unbalanced cuts in the defense budget \nwith reductions elsewhere in the budget. But we don't know that because \nwe can't get the administration to put forward the plan we need to move \nforward with our proposals here in order to do away with what we think \nwill be a very dangerous cut to America's national security.\n  I hope the Senate will do something to address that. We can start by \ntaking up the bill passed in the House, pass it here in the Senate, and \nrequire the administration to put forward a plan about how they are \ngoing to implement the sequester.\n  As has already been pointed out by the Senator from Alabama and \nothers, we are talking about basically a 50-percent cut in the defense \nbudget--or 50 percent of the cuts coming out of the defense budget on \ntop of $487 billion in cuts that were already approved last year. So we \nare talking about another huge amount of reduction, up to about another \n$\\1/2\\ trillion on top of what already is $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts that \ncame last year.\n  Remember, the defense budget, as has been pointed out, only \nrepresents 20 percent of all Federal spending, so we are going to take \nhalf the cuts out of 20 percent of the budget. Where is the \nproportionality in that? And as the Senator from Alabama has \nhighlighted, what we have done essentially is we have shielded many \nareas of the budget. So a lot of the things some of our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle don't want to see cut are protected from \nthis. Yet we are going to make huge, steep, Draconian, and dangerous \ncuts in America's national military and national security budget.\n  I would hope we can at least act on what the House of Representatives \ndid earlier today by a 414-to-2 vote, pick up that legislation, and \nrequire the administration to tell us how they are going to implement \nthese reductions. Then let's go to work on a bipartisan basis and try \nto come up with a plan whereby we can avoid what will be a disaster, as \nhas been described by every national security expert out there, for our \nnational security interests.\n  We live in a dangerous world. We can't avoid that. The United States \nof America is looked to for leadership around the world. We have to \ncontinue to ensure we can protect this country and America's interests \naround the world. In order to do that, we have to make sure our \nmilitary is resourced in a way that enables them to protect our \ninterests. We cannot continue to go forward with this sequester, which \nwould dramatically and in a very dangerous way harm those national \nsecurity interests.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be \nallowed to proceed as in a colloquy so we can address one another \ndirectly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Thune is in the leadership on the Republican \nside and he is in the Budget Committee and the Defense Committee and is \naware of how this all happened. So we are at a point where it appears \nto me the Defense Department is being asked to take unacceptable, \ndisproportionate reductions in spending that go so far as to create \ndamage rather than improving its efficiency.\n  Isn't it true the Secretary of Defense and all the top officials \nunder the Secretary of Defense are appointed by the President and serve \nat his pleasure?\n  Mr. THUNE. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Secretary of Defense now has said this would be a \ndisaster to the Defense Department for these cuts to take effect. Isn't \nit true that the President is the Commander in Chief of all our \nmilitary forces?\n  Mr. THUNE. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Isn't it true that we are at a situation at this point \nin history where we are heading toward a sequester, and the Commander \nin Chief is utterly silent on how to fix the problem?\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator from Alabama is correct. That is one of the \nremarkable things about this. The Commander in Chief, of course, is \ntasked with the responsibility of being just that, the Commander in \nChief. Yet when it comes to the national security interests that we \nhave and to at least spelling out how he would implement\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\nwhat we believe are going to be some disastrous cuts to the defense \nbudget, he is not even informing us about what his ideas are with \nrespect to that so we can react to that. More importantly, he doesn't \nseem to be the least bit interested in addressing this.\n  There is a huge silence coming out of the White House--the Senator \nfrom Alabama is absolutely correct--and it has to change if we are \ngoing to be able to fix this. It starts by at least him presenting a \nplan, and the Senator from Alabama and I have introduced legislation in \nthe Senate that would require that, much like what passed in the House \ntoday, and that is where it all starts.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his \nleadership, and I was proud to join with him on similar legislation to \nthat in the House. But isn't it true that we agreed last August with \nthe Budget Control Act to reduce spending over 10 years by $2.1 \ntrillion; that is, reduce $47 trillion to $45 trillion, and there are \nno tax increases involved in that? Now we are discovering that late-\nminute deal has disproportionately impacted the Defense Department, as \nthe President's own Secretary of Defense acknowledged.\n  Should we not be able to expect that the President would enter into \ndiscussions about how to deal with this? Does it not seem to the \nSenator, as an experienced part of the leadership in this Senate, that \nthe President is saying: You Republicans care about the Defense \nDepartment. You Republicans care about preserving America. But I am not \ngoing to do it unless you agree to my tax increases. I am not going to \ndo, as Commander in Chief, what I ought to be doing and providing the \nleadership on this because I am going to use this as leverage against \nyou guys to force you to agree to a tax increase; is that the bottom \nline? I hate to be so frank about it, but that is the way I feel it is \nsort of developing; am I wrong about that?\n  Mr. THUNE. I don't think the Senator from Alabama is wrong at all. In \nfact, that is what much of the news stories that have been printed in \nthe last few days and reporting on the subject have said. Some of our \ncolleagues on the other side have essentially concluded this is \nleverage--leverage for them to get higher taxes.\n  It strikes me, at least, that there is a tremendous risk associated \nwith allowing the country to go over a fiscal cliff--which includes not \nonly these Draconian cuts to the defense budget but also tax increases \nthat would occur on January 1, to go over the fiscal cliff, risk \nplunging the country into a recession, raise the unemployment rate \nwhich is already at historically high levels, all to prove a point \nabout raising taxes. But that appears to be--at least by the reporting. \nThere was a story in the Washington Post over the weekend that said: \nDemocrats threaten going over the fiscal cliff basically to get higher \ntaxes out of Republicans.\n  That, to me, seems like a terrible trade to make, to risk the country \ngoing into a recession, to risk these tremendous cuts in our national \nsecurity priorities, just simply so they can get higher taxes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think so. I would just say this--and I am so glad our \ncolleague Senator Ayotte is here.\n  One thing more I would say about it is the agreement last August was \nto raise the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion and to reduce spending over 10 \nyears $2.1 trillion. It did not include a tax increase.\n  What we are saying is we need to simply reorganize how all those cuts \nfell so they are more realistic and the government is not so damaged, \nand we don't need to have agency after agency totally exempt from any \ncuts.\n  We are glad to have Senator Ayotte here. She is a new member of the \nArmed Services Committee and the Budget Committee. She is a fabulous \nnew addition to the Senate. Her husband is a military officer. She has \ncontributed greatly to our discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Sessions. I \nappreciate his leadership as the ranking member on the Budget Committee \nand also as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  This is so troubling, where we are right now with respect to our \nDepartment of Defense, our military--the most important constitutional \nfunction we have as a government to make sure the American people are \nsafe.\n  Essentially, where we are is the Budget Control Act, as described, \ninitially has cut $487 billion from our military over the next 10 \nyears. But on top of that, there are across-the-board cuts coming in \nJanuary. I think the No. 1 lesson we learned from the Budget Control \nAct is when we kick the can down the road and we don't make the \ndecisions right away or when we delegate it to some other committee to \nmake the decisions, when we don't do a budget in 3 years, here is where \nwe are. So we owe it to the American people to make the decisions that \nneed to be made now.\n  It is irresponsible to put our Department of Defense and our \nmilitary--our men and women who have fought so bravely for this \ncountry--at risk because somehow there are Members who think it is \nimportant to play roulette and to play chicken with our national \nsecurity.\n  This isn't just from the Senator from New Hampshire. Just listen to \nour own Secretary of Defense. He describes what is coming with these \nacross-the-board cuts in January as:\n\n       Devastating. Catastrophic. Would lead to a hollow force \n     incapable of sustaining the missions of the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n  He has compared sequestration or these across-the-board cuts to \n``shooting ourselves in the head, inflicting severe damage to our \nnational security.''\n  To the point the Senator from Alabama made as well as the Senator \nfrom South Dakota, which is the President who is the Commander in Chief \nof this country, I would call upon him: Mr. President, lead an effort \nto resolve this. We can come up with alternative spending reductions. \nYes, we need to cut spending, and I will be the first to stand in line \nto say we need to make sure we make those spending cuts. But let's not \ndo it at the sake of our military.\n  If the Presiding Officer doesn't want to listen to me, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, please listen to your own Secretary of Defense and \nmake sure we do not undermine our national security.\n  I serve as the ranking Republican on the Readiness Subcommittee. I \nasked the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps: What is the impact \non the Marine Corps from these across-the-board meat axe cuts that are \ncoming in January to our military?\n  Already the Marine Corps, under the initial reductions, is going to \nbe reduced 20,000. If this goes forward, this irresponsible way of \ntreating our military and our Department of Defense, the Marine Corps \nwill take another 18,000 reduction. The Assistant Commandant of the \nMarine Corps said: The most shocking thing to me is actually something \nthat keeps me up at night; that is, he said, the Marine Corps will be \nincapable of responding to one single major contingency.\n  Think about it. Think about it in terms of protecting our country. \nThat is why it is so important that we resolve this now. It is my hope \nMembers from the other side of the aisle will come to the table now.\n  To put it in perspective, we could resolve and find spending \nreductions to deal with not only the defense but the nondefense part of \nthese across-the-board cuts by living within our means for 1 month \nwithin this government. It is $109 billion. We need to do this for the \nAmerican people.\n  Our men and women in our forces of every branch of this service are \nso astounding in their courage. Just one example. There was a sergeant \nin the Marine Corps who lost his leg in Afghanistan and he took 1 year \nto recover. With a prosthetic leg, he reenlisted. He actually \nredeployed in the Marine Corps. Those are the types of men and women to \nwhom we owe that they don't just get pink slips because we aren't \nshowing the courage that needs to be shown right here in the Senate to \ncome up with the spending reductions that don't put our country at \nrisk.\n  Our Commander in Chief should be leading that effort. Unfortunately, \nall we have seen so far from the President is punting this issue. I \nwould call upon him and Members of both sides of the aisle to come \ntogether to resolve this.\n  We should resolve this before the election. If we wait until after \nthe election, then our Department of Defense\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\nis going to be under this cloud of uncertainty. Our men and women in \nuniform need to know we will not break faith with them, that we will \nstand with them, that we are not going to use them as a political \nfootball for other issues because, on a bipartisan basis, we should \nstand with them, with our national security.\n  In addition, one of the reasons we should resolve this before the \nelections is it is not just about the safety of our country, which \nshould come first and foremost, but we are also talking about nearly 1 \nmillion jobs in the private sector in our defense industrial base, \nbased on a report from AIA and George Mason University--just looking at \ndefense, 1 million jobs.\n  Those jobs are the manufacturers, both large and small, that build \nthe equipment, the protection, the weapons systems our men and women in \nuniform need to fight the wars we ask them to do to keep them safe and \nprotected. If we lose that capacity, not only do we lose the jobs that \nare good jobs in this country, but we also lose capacity, which is very \nmuch a part of the defense of this Nation. Under Federal law, these \ncompanies will be required to issue, under the Warren Act, notices of \nlayoff, potential layoff 60 days before it happens, which brings us to \nNovember.\n  That is why we need to address this issue before the election as \nwell. We should not put all those Americans who work for those \ncompanies and those companies at risk.\n  Yesterday, AIA also issued a report looking at the nondefense \nimplications of sequestration. If we put it all together, it is over 2 \nmillion jobs in this country that are at issue.\n  We should get to the table right now, resolve this, cut the spending \nin a responsible way that doesn't add a national security crisis to our \nfiscal crisis. We can do it, but we aren't going to do it if we \ncontinue to put off the difficult decisions, if we kick this can down \nthe road again, if we use this as roulette or chicken or in some other \ndebate in December.\n  This needs to be resolved right now for our men and women in uniform \nwho have shown the courage, the tenacity, and the love of country. They \nhave done so much for us and they deserve better from us than to use \nthem as a political football in some other debate.\n  I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come to the \ntable now. I urge the President to come and lead this effort so we can \nresolve this issue on behalf of the American people.\n  I yield my time to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. She made a \ngreat series of points. One of the most dramatic, is that we should not \nbe waiting.\n  This is going to cost the Defense Department tremendous amounts of \nmoney. Private contractors may well assess against the Department of \nDefense costs for confusion and delays.\n  I just want to wrap up with these three charts.\n  One of the myths is the reason the United States is running the \nlargest deficit in its history is the wars, the Afghan and Iraqi wars. \nWe ran the numbers on that. The war outlays represent only 4 percent of \ndefense spending. That is a lot, but it is only 4 percent. It is not \nthe biggest part of it. In 2001-2011 it totaled $1.1 trillion during \nthat time; 2001 through 2011 we spent $1.1 trillion on both wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  During that same time--this represents the rest. The red represents \nthe remaining expenditures of the U.S. Government, 96 percent. It is \nnot so that defense and the war have caused the deficit we are in. \nIndeed, last year our deficit was about $1.3 trillion. The entire 10 \nyears of the war effort amount to less than 1 year's deficit last year. \nIn fact, we have averaged over $1.2 trillion for the last 4 years in \ndeficits. For one year, you could eliminate the entire Defense \nDepartment, all $540 billion of it, and you would not cut the deficit \nin half. You can add the war costs to it, which is a little over $100 \nbillion, and it is still less than half. It is not so that the reason \nthis country is in financial trouble is that defense and the war have \ncaused the deficit.\n  There are other factors going on. From 2008 through 2010, this shows \nthe growth in spending as a percentage of those budgets. Defense \nspending, through those 3 years, increased 11 percent. The non-defense \ndiscretionary spending increased 24 percent. That is a rate of more \nthan twice as fast. So it is not surging defense spending that is \ndriving up the cost of government as much as the increase in the non-\ndefense spending.\n  One more chart that should make us all nervous. This is a \nCongressional Budget Office estimate of interest costs on the debt we \nare now accumulating. We are now at $16 trillion in debt. Every penny \nof that is borrowed money. We have to pay interest on that $16 \ntrillion. We are adding $1 trillion a year to it. We have added $1.2-\nplus trillion for each year for the last 4 years. According to the CBO, \nin 2019, just 7 years from now, interest will exceed the Defense \nexpenditures. The amount of money we spend servicing the debt that we \nhave run up will exceed the Defense Department and surge past it.\n  If we have a situation that could happen as is now happening in \nEurope, and the interest rates surge faster, that number could be a \ndevastating number to the economy. It is a matter of great concern to \nus.\n  That is why we have to contain spending. The Defense Department has \nto reduce spending. We support the $487 billion in cuts they are \nworking on today, but the additional $492 billion is so large that it \ndoes damage to the Defense Department and actually will cost us money \nby making rapid reductions in spending in such a way that cannot be \naccommodated in any rational way.\n  I believe if we work together, get this thing on the right path, be \nhonest with ourselves about how much we can reduce the defense budget \nwithout hurting our security, I believe we can work out something \nbefore the end of the year. But I tell you, the President is going to \nhave to get engaged. He cannot just sit back and think he is going to \nuse this for leverage to raise taxes as it appears to me he is doing. I \nknow others want to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the last hour my friends on the \nRepublican side of the aisle have had the floor, and they have \npresented their point of view. I would like to--and I am joined by the \nSenator from Vermont--I would like to spend a few moments, if I can, \nreflecting on what they said and perhaps making some observations that \ndisagree with some of their conclusions.\n  There are some points on which we agree. The deficit is a serious \nnational problem. Right now we are borrowing 40 cents for every dollar \nwe spend. Whether we are spending that dollar on education, student \nloans, food stamps, missiles, or the paychecks for our soldiers, we \nborrow 40 cents for every dollar we spend. No company, no family could \nsurvive borrowing 40 percent of everything they spend. That is a fact. \nSo we need to be serious about reducing this deficit.\n  We are confronted, however, with a reality in terms of our economy. \nSince 2008 we have had a weak economy. We have had a recession that has \nkilled off a lot of jobs. We are coming back but slowly. If we are not \ncareful in the way we reduce the deficit, we can make it worse. I think \neverybody agrees with that premise on both sides of the aisle.\n  So we have a massive deficit, and we have a weak economy. We have to \nbe careful how we reduce spending and raise revenue in a way that \ndoesn't kill off the recovery. Ultimately, we cannot have a strong \nAmerican economy unless we start putting people back to work in larger \nnumbers. I think both sides will agree on that.\n  Here is an area where we start to disagree. How do we achieve this? \nSeveral years ago the majority leader, Senator Reid, asked me to serve \non the Simpson-Bowles Commission. I sat for over a year listening to \ntestimony about ways to reduce the deficit. At the end of the day I \ncame to a conclusion that turned out to be bipartisan, and 11 out of 18 \nof the members of the Commission voted for it--Democrats, Republicans, \npublic members.\n  It basically said this: Any honest approach to reducing our deficit \nputs everything on the table--everything. It puts spending cuts on the \ntable for sure, but it also puts on the table revenue. And \nentitlements.\n  I can tell you, there is a great deal of pain in addressing some of \nthese issues.\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\nOn the Republican side of the aisle when you say the word ``revenue''--\nI wouldn't dare use the word ``taxes''--but when you say the word \n``revenue'' they race for the door.\n  On our side of the aisle, when you mention the entitlements--my \ncolleague from Vermont and I and many others share a real concern about \nthe future of programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, \nthe basic insurance policy for senior citizens of America and the \nsafety net for the poor and disabled. So you can understand this \nbecomes extremely difficult in terms of cutting spending, raising \nrevenue, reducing the deficit, and not killing off an economic \nrecovery.\n  What happened last year? Last year we faced what is called the debt \nceiling. The debt ceiling is a vague term that not many people \nunderstand. Let me try to put it in simple words, if I can.\n  The debt ceiling is America's mortgage. America's mortgage is growing \nin size, unlike many home mortgages which go down. America's mortgage \nis growing because our national debt is growing. Periodically, we have \nto borrow more money to cover what we have spent. So Members of the \nSenate on both sides of the aisle who vote for the spending--whether it \nis for a war or for education or health care--ultimately know the day \nwill come when we have to borrow more money to cover the 40 percent of \nwhat that expenditure is that we are not raising in revenue.\n  The debt ceiling came up for us to consider last year, and for the \nfirst time--the first time--the Republicans in the House and Senate \nsaid: Let's default on the national debt.\n  What would happen if you started missing mortgage payments at home? \nAfter a month or two somebody might give you a phone call. Then on the \nthird month you might get a letter from a lawyer. On the fourth month \nyou might be in foreclosure proceedings. In other words, you were not a \ntrustworthy borrower and your credit rating is being destroyed by your \nfailure to pay your bills.\n  The same thing would happen to America if we did not pass the debt \nceiling, if we did not extend our mortgage, if we did not make our \ntimely payments on our debt. But that was what the Republicans \nthreatened. So in order to get through this crisis, the possibility \nthat our entire economy would shut down over this default on our \nnational debt, we came up with a plan. Here is what the plan was.\n  We would create a bipartisan House and Senate supercommittee. We said \nto that supercommittee: Come up with $1.5 trillion in deficit \nreductions over the next 10 years--$1.5 trillion in deficit reduction. \nWe did not say to the committee how to do it, but we told them if they \nfail to come up with this savings of $1.5 trillion over the next 10 \nyears, there will be automatic spending cuts--automatic spending cuts \ncalled sequestration. We said specifically what they would be: $500 \nbillion from defense spending, $500 billion from nondefense spending. \nThat was the alternative. Reach an agreement, cut the deficit, or face \nthis automatic penalty.\n  What we have heard on the floor of the Senate today are the protests \nof a half dozen or more Republican Senators to what we are now facing. \nYou see, the supercommittee could not reach an agreement. There was no \nagreement because basically the Republican side refused to even \nconsider raising revenue--raising taxes on anybody over the next 10 \nyears. So the alternatives were to continue to cut spending and/or cut \nMedicaid and Medicare.\n  It broke down. So the automatic spending cuts, sequestration is now \nlooming. January 2 they are looming as a possibility. The protests on \nthe floor today from Republican Senators are over the possibility of a \n$500 billion cut in defense spending over the next 9 years, $55 billion \na year--not an inconsequential cut by any means.\n  Here is what is interesting. I asked for the transcript from the \nRepublican Senators in describing the defense sequestration cut, and \nevery one of them came to the floor to condemn it. The words they used \nin describing it are ``predictable,'' ``devastating,'' ``arbitrary,'' \n``irresponsible''--one after the other. That is how they described \nthis.\n  Then I asked my staff to please get me a copy of the rollcall of \nSenators who voted for this option. Of the Senators--Republican \nSenators--who spoke on the Senate floor this afternoon protesting the \ndefense sequestration as devastating, irresponsible, and arbitrary, the \nfollowing Republican Senators voted for it: Senator McConnell of \nKentucky, Senator McCain of Arizona, Senator Thune of South Dakota, and \nSenator Cornyn of Texas. In fact, the entire Republican leadership team \nvoted for what they are now branding as devastating, arbitrary, and \nirresponsible. So it is a little hard for me to understand how on this \ndate, August 2, 2011, in the early afternoon, they could vote for this \nand now come to the floor and condemn it.\n  Here is the reality. The reality is we need to deal with our deficit \nin a responsible fashion. We need to keep this economy moving forward. \nIn order to deal with the deficit in a responsible fashion, I still \nbelieve the Bowles-Simpson approach is the right approach--put \neverything on the table and work through it in a responsible way. I \nthought it was right then; I still believe it is right.\n  I am troubled, though, by this concept about defense spending. Let me \nconfess my own personal family feelings. An hour ago my nephew Michael \nCacace, who is in the 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Totten, NY, \ncame to visit me upstairs. He was a sight for sore eyes. I hadn't seen \nhim in a long time. A little over a year ago he was a doorman letting \npeople into the gallery upstairs, and then he enlisted in the U.S. Army \nand spent a year in Afghanistan. I thought about him every single day. \nWe sent him care packages and got notes back from him and occasional e-\nmails, and in he walks to my office today safe and sound. I couldn't \nhave been happier to see him. In just a few weeks he is off to Korea. \nHe has 2 more years in his commitment to the Army.\n  I thought about him--and think about him and so many others like \nhim--every time the issue of America and the military came up. While \nMichael and so many others are risking their lives for our country, we \ncan do nothing less than to keep them safe--as Michael was able to do. \nI am committed to that personally, politically.\n  To suggest that any of us, in either party, would jeopardize the \ndefense and security of America for political reasons I do not accept. \nEveryone here is committed to the basic premise of keeping America safe \nand standing behind our men and women in uniform. I also want to be \nrealistic about the defense budget. It is a big budget.\n  The last time the Federal budget was in balance was about 10 years \nago, and we hit the sweet spot when it came to taxes and revenue on one \nside and spending on the other. The sweet spot was 19.5 percent of our \ngross domestic product. That is the sum total and value of all the \ngoods and services produced in America. So we raised 19.5 percent of \nour gross domestic product on taxes and that is how much we spent. We \nwere in balance 11 years ago.\n  What has happened since? Senator Dan Inouye, chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, told us. Since the budget was last in \nbalance, domestic discretionary spending for things such as education, \nhealth care, correction systems, highways, and all the nondefense items \nin our budget has not grown at all. It flatlined, zero growth. When it \ncame to the entitlement programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare, veterans \nprograms, and the like, they have gone up about 30 percent in costs \nsince the budget was last in balance.\n  What about the defense budget? What has happened to the defense \nbudget since we had a balanced budget? It has gone up 73 percent. Zero \non domestic discretionary, 30 percent on entitlements, 64 percent on \nthe military side. So what happened in the last 10 years? There were \ntwo wars we didn't pay for, a dramatic buildup in the military, and the \nreality is all of it was added to the debt.\n  When we had the Simpson-Bowles Commission, we brought in experts from \nthe Department of Defense and asked them a lot of questions about our \nspending over there. There were some things there that were troubling. \nThe F-35, which is supposed to be the fighter of the future, ends up \ndramatically overspent. There were cost overruns in every direction. \nYou may have heard a lot about the Solyndra energy project. The cost \noverrides on the F-35\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\nproject are more than 10 times the money we lost on the Solyndra energy \nproject. There has been a dramatic overrun on some of these major \nweapons systems.\n  We then asked the Department of Defense: How many contractors do you \nhave working for you, not including civilian employees, in the \nDepartment of Defense or uniformed employees? Their answer to us was \nvery candid: We don't know. We really don't. We hire contractors, and \nthey hire people. We have no idea how many people work for us. It could \nbe a million people, it could be 3 million people. It raises a question \nin my mind: Can we be safe as a country and still save some money at \nthe Department of Defense? I think we can.\n  What I hear from the Republican side of the aisle is: Keep your hands \noff the Department of Defense. Well, I don't want to cut them and \njeopardize our security or endanger our servicemen, but I do believe \nmoney can be saved there. How did we find ourselves in this position \nwhere we are even considering these cuts? Because the Republicans have \nsteadfastly refused to consider revenue.\n  Before you took the chair, Madam President, our colleague and friend \nSenator Merkley of Oregon sent me a note to ask Senator Sessions of \nAlabama a question. I want to read it. He said: Ask Senator Sessions \nthe following: What is more important, taking care of our national \nsecurity or giving bonus tax breaks of over $100,000 a person for the \nrichest 2 percent of Americans? What the President has proposed is that \nwe cut the tax breaks off at $250,000 of income, and it means the top 2 \npercent of Americans would pay more. They would pay the rate they used \nto pay under President Clinton, and the Republicans have said: No way. \nPresident Obama's tax proposal would save us $800 billion. The \nDepartment of Defense cut over 9 years is $500 billion. So the \nRepublicans here, almost to a person, are basically arguing that rather \nthan raise taxes on the richest 2 percent in America at all, we would \nrun the risk of jeopardizing our national security. That is a false \nchoice. We can have a strong national defense and we must, but we can \nalso have a rational approach to reducing our debt.\n  Our military is the best in the world, the biggest in the world, and \nlarger than most other nations--the next 10 combined--and it is \ndramatically larger than any potential enemy of the United States. It \nhas kept us safe as a Nation, and we want it to continue to do so. The \nmen and women who serve us in the military are the best, but we can \nsave money in the Department of Defense. We can do it and reduce the \ndeficit.\n  What we need from the Republican side of the aisle is the willingness \nwe found in the Simpson-Bowles Commission of a few Republicans to step \nup and say: Yes, we need to put everything on the table. Let's avoid \ndeep cuts either on the domestic side or the defense side. Let's \nbasically come up with an approach that is fair across the board, and \nwe can do it. Let's spare those who are the most vulnerable in America, \nthe homeless and helpless. For goodness sake, we all care for them. We \nshould all care for America's needy. Those programs have to be \nprotected.\n  When the Senator from Alabama comes to the floor and decries the fact \nthat more people are using food stamps, I say to my friend from \nVermont, who has probably seen the same thing I have: Meet these \nfamilies on food stamps.\n  Meet them when you go to the soup kitchens and when you go to the \nfood pantries. Many of them are working families. They can't make it on \nwhat they are being paid. They are struggling from paycheck to \npaycheck. At the end of the month, they are looking for something to \nput on the table. Sadly, families who have an income still qualify for \nfood stamps because their income is too small.\n  The Senator from Alabama said the food stamp costs have gone up way \ntoo high. True, they are high, but they reflect the state of the \neconomy and the troubling challenges that face working families and \npoor families across America. He also made a point of saying the \nentitlement payments are going up dramatically. Why? Because today in \nAmerica 10,000 of our fellow citizens reached the age of 65. Yesterday \nwas the same thing, tomorrow is the same thing, and for the next 18 \nyears it will be the same thing: The boomers have arrived. And when \nthey arrive at age 65, they look around and say: Well, we paid in all \nof our lives for Social Security and Medicare. Aren't we qualified? \nAren't we entitled to our benefits?\n  Is the Senator from Alabama suggesting we walk away from those \ncommitments? I don't think that is fair. We can make these better \nprograms, we can make them more efficient, but we certainly don't want \nto give up on our commitment to Medicare, for example, as the Paul Ryan \nbudget did. I think that is a serious mistake.\n  To my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, I think the \nmessage is clear: You voted for this, so don't keep coming to the \nSenate floor and criticizing it. They knew what they were voting for. \nIt said if you failed to reach a bipartisan agreement on the \nsupercommittee, this is what we would face.\n  Secondly, we can solve this problem still. We can avoid sequestration \nwith a bipartisan approach that considers all of the key elements to \nbring deficit reduction in a sensible and thoughtful way, that doesn't \nkill our economic recovery.\n  Third, I will never question any colleague's commitment to the safety \nand security of this Nation, and I hope our friends on the other side \nwon't either. Everyone is committed to that, and we are committed to \nour men and women in uniform. Now let's do them proud and make \nAmerica's economy stronger and make America stronger. Let's invest in \nwhat we know will make us a strong Nation. In addition to our military, \nlet's invest in our schools and education, research and innovation, \nclean energy projects that offer an opportunity for 21st century \nleadership for America, the infrastructure which serves our country \nfrom one side to the other and keeps products moving and keeps America \ncompetitive. We can make the investments in these key areas and not \njeopardize our national defense. We can do that and reduce the deficit.\n  I yield to my colleague from Vermont, Senator Sanders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and I wanted to amplify on them a little bit. But before \nI do, I wanted to mention something we don't talk about enough here on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  In New England, and I'm sure in Minnesota, we have a lot of sports \nfans. When we are interested in baseball, basketball, football, hockey, \nor whatever, the key question everyone always asks is: Who wins and who \nloses? Well, I think it is appropriate that in terms of the economy, as \nit currently stands, we should also ask that simple question: Who is \nwinning and who is losing? Let me discuss that for one moment before I \nget into deficit reduction.\n  We don't talk about it almost at all on the floor of the Senate. The \nmedia doesn't talk about it terribly much either. But the reality is we \nhave the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major \ncountry on Earth and more income and wealth inequality in this country \nthan at any time since the late 1920s.\n  Today the wealthiest 400 people own more wealth than the bottom half \nof America, which is about 150 million people. We could squeeze 400 \npeople into this room, and if they were the wealthiest people in \nAmerica, they would own more wealth than the bottom half of America.\n  A report came across my desk yesterday which I want to share with the \nAmerican people. This is quite incredible and kind of tells us where we \nare moving as a Nation, and that is that today the Walton family of \nWal-Mart fame--the folks who own Wal-Mart--now owns more wealth than \nthe bottom 40 percent of America. One family owns more wealth than the \nbottom 40 percent of America.\n  Today the top 1 percent owns 40 percent of the wealth of the country. \nI think a lot of people are very surprised by that number. The top 1 \npercent owns 40 percent of the wealth of America. But what people would \nbe far more shocked at is if we asked them how much the bottom 60 \npercent of the\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\nAmerican people own. I have done this. In Vermont, I have asked people. \nThey say: 10 percent, 20 percent. The answer is less than 2 percent. \nThe top 1 percent owns 40 percent of the wealth of America. The bottom \n60 percent owns less than 2 percent. The bottom 40 percent of America \nowns three-tenths of 1 percent, less than one family--the Walton \nfamily--owns.\n  Why is that important? It is important because it tells us from both \na moral and economic perspective the direction we have to move in terms \nof deficit reduction. I find it a little bit amusing that some of my \nRepublican friends come to the floor of the Senate and say: We are \ndeficit hawks. We have got to cut, cut, cut. We are worried about our \nkids, we are worried about our grandchildren, and we are worried about \nborrowing money from China. They have a whole set of talking points. \nThey are worried about the deficit.\n  I am worried about the deficit, every American should be worried \nabout the deficit, but I have a question to ask some of my Republican \nfriends who today are great deficit hawks and that is: Where were they \na few years ago? I voted against the war in Iraq for a number of \nreasons, not the least of which is it wasn't paid for. The war in \nAfghanistan wasn't paid for. I find it kind of interesting that former \nPresident Bush, who was a great deficit hawk, and all of my Republican \nfriends who are great deficit hawks went not just to one war, they went \ninto two wars. And you know what. It just slipped their minds. They \nforgot to pay for it. We all have slips of memory. You go to the \ngrocery store and forget to buy the container of milk your wife wanted \nyou to buy. It just slipped their mind. They were so busy talking about \nthe deficit, they went into two wars that cost trillions of dollars and \nforgot to pay for them. Today they have noticed and it has come to \ntheir attention that there is a deficit.\n  I voted against the war in Iraq. I am not so sure many of them did.\n  The second issue. If we go on a shopping spree or a gambling spree or \nwhatever it may be and we spend a lot of money, give away a lot of \nmoney, we have less money. Our Republican friends fought for and \ncreated huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country. \nHundreds and hundreds of billions of tax dollars in tax breaks went to \nthe top 1 percent, went to the top 2 percent. So our deficit hawk \nfriends who come down here every day to tell us how concerned they are \nwent into two wars they forgot to pay for, and, for the first time in \nAmerican history, they actually gave tax breaks to the very rich while \nthey were at war.\n  Furthermore, one of the major problems our country is facing now in \nterms of the deficit, which Senator Durbin touched on, is that because \nof the recession, which was caused by the greed and recklessness and \nillegal behavior of Wall Street--and many of my Republican friends and \nsome Democrats told us awhile back when I was in the House how \nimportant it was to deregulate Wall Street, to allow the large \ncommercial banks that have merged with the investor banks to merge with \nthe insurance companies, and just get the government off the backs of \nthese honorable people on Wall Street who are looking out for the \nAmerican people. It turned out, of course, that they are a bunch of \ncrooks. We deregulated them, and they did what many of us thought they \nwould do: they began exchanging incredibly complicated financial \ntransactions, which took this country to the verge of an international \nfinancial collapse. And our friends on Wall Street needed their welfare \npayment from the middle class of America--$700-and-some billion of \nwelfare payments for Wall Street--to bail them out. The Fed provided \n$16 trillion in low-interest loans on a revolving loan basis. So in the \nmidst of all of that, what ended up happening is that revenue is now \ndown to 15.8 percent of GDP, which is the lowest amount of revenue per \nGDP we have seen in a very long time.\n  So we go into two wars and don't pay for them; we give tax breaks to \nbillionaires; we deregulate Wall Street, which causes a recession; \nrevenue declines as a percentage of GDP; and we have a serious deficit \ncrisis, which is where we are right now. We have a $16 trillion \nnational debt. I think it is a $1.2 trillion-a-year deficit--a serious \nsituation. How do we deal with it? Everybody here recognizes that it is \na problem. We don't want the younger generation to have to pick up this \nnational debt. How do we deal with it?\n  Well, my Republican friends have a great idea. Let's see. We went to \ntwo wars and didn't pay for them; tax breaks for the rich; deregulated \nWall Street; a recession. Oh, I know how we can deal with the deficit. \nLet's cut Social Security. That is a good idea. After all, we only have \n50-some-odd million people on Social Security. Why don't we come up \nwith a chained CPI? Nobody outside of Capitol Hill knows what a chained \nCPI is. And to any senior citizen, somebody on Social Security, who is \nwatching this, please don't laugh, but I do want to tell you what a \nchained CPI is. You will think I am not telling you the truth. Check it \nout. I am.\n  There are people here in the Senate and in the House who think your \nCOLAs have been too large; that the formula that determines COLAs--\ncost-of-living allowance increases for seniors--has been too generous.\n  Now, the seniors are saying: What is this guy talking about? How can \nit be too generous when for the last 2 years we didn't get any COLA? At \na time when our prescription drug costs are going up and our health \ncare costs are going up, what are they talking about?\n  Well, you are right, I say to those back home, they are a little bit \noff their rocker. The idea that they could think that after 2 years of \nzero COLAs, those are too large, and that we have to create a new \nformula to reduce COLAs--that is what people--certainly Republicans and \nsome Democrats--are talking about right now.\n  So what about Social Security? How much of the deficit did Social \nSecurity cause so that my Republican friends--all of them--want to cut \nit and some Democrats may want to cut it? Well, the answer is zero, and \neverybody in America back home understands it, because Social Security \nis funded by the FICA tax, by the payroll tax. Social Security does not \nget general fund money, it comes independently. Social Security, \naccording to the Social Security Administration, has a $2.7 trillion \nsurplus--let me say it again: surplus--to pay every benefit for the \nnext 22 years. Why do they want to cut Social Security? Go ask them. I \ndon't know. It certainly doesn't make any sense to me. It should not be \npart of any deficit reduction effort. But it is not just Social \nSecurity that is under attack. They want to go after Medicare. They \nwant to go after Medicaid. They want to go after nutrition programs for \nelderly people and for children. They want to go after Pell grants. You \nname the program that benefits working-class and middle-class families, \nand they want to go after it.\n  What about asking the wealthiest people to pay a nickel more in \ntaxes? Oh, we can't do that, just can't do that--moral objection to \nhaving billionaires, who are doing phenomenally well and who are now \npaying the lowest effective tax rate they have paid in a very long \ntime--we cannot allow them to pay a nickel more in taxes. It is far \nmore important to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and \neducation.\n  Well, I think that set of priorities is dead wrong, and I think the \nAmerican people think those priorities are dead wrong. We have to work \ntogether to make sure that doesn't happen in some kind of grand plan or \nwhatever it is. Yes, we can deal with the deficit. We should deal with \nthe deficit but not on the backs of the elderly.\n  Millions of senior citizens of this country are living on $12,000, \n$13,000, $14,000 in Social Security--it is either all or most of their \nincome--and people here are talking about cutting Social Security? We \nhave 50 million people who have no health insurance. We have 45,000 \npeople who died this year because they didn't get to a doctor on time, \nand people say: Let's take our kids off Medicaid. Let's take lower \nincome people off Medicaid. What happens? Let's do away, says the Ryan \nbudget, the Republican budget, with Medicare as we know it. Let's give \npeople an $8,000 check instead of Medicare. Well, a person has cancer \nor heart disease, and we have an $8,000 check for them to go out and \nget private insurance. How many days do my colleagues think they are \ngoing to stay in a hospital with cancer on $8,000? Not a whole long \ntime, but that is what their plan is.\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\n  So we are now in the midst of a great philosophical and economic \ndebate. The rich are getting richer, and our Republican friends want to \ngive them more tax breaks. The middle class is collapsing. Our \nRepublican friends want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  In terms of defense spending, I would just say this: Everybody here \nagrees we want and need a strong defense. Do we really have to spend \nmore on defense in the United States of America than the rest of the \nworld combined? We spend more on defense than the rest of the world \ncombined. Do we really have to do that? We spend 4.8 percent of our GDP \non defense.\n  Our European allies, by the way, provide health care to all of their \npeople as a right. Our European allies provide, in many instances, \ncollege education free to their young people--not $40,000 or $50,000 a \nyear. Our European allies--and I say this in all due respect to them; I \nrespect that, and it is what we should be doing--provide excellent \nquality childcare to their working families. Our European allies spend \n2 percent of their GDP on defense.\n  We spend 4.8 percent.\n  So we are in the midst of an interesting moment. I hope the American \npeople become engaged in this debate because I think, by and large, the \nposition the Republican Party is taking--tax breaks for billionaires, \ncuts in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--is way out of touch \nwith where the American people are today.\n  I hope we have a serious debate on these issues. I hope the American \npeople join us, and I hope the road we go down in terms of deficit \nreduction is one that is fair to working families and the middle class, \nand that means asking the wealthiest people in this country and the \nlargest corporations in this country to start paying their fair share \nof taxes.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Russia Permanent Normal Trade Relations\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise because the pending \nproposal to grant permanent normal trade relations with Russia must be \ndone right. It was voted out of the Finance Committee today. There is \ndiscussion about further changes in the legislation on the Senate floor \nwhen it reaches here.\n  People in my home State of Ohio know too well that we cannot afford \nto continue our normal, business-as-usual trade agreements that fail to \nhold our trading partners responsible.\n  We know what happened in the early 1990s with the North American Free \nTrade Agreement. We know what happened in the late 1990s with the \npermanent normal trade relations with China. Look at the most recent \nevents around the U.S. Olympic Committee and these American athletes, \nwith hundreds and hundreds of them soon to parade down the streets in \nLondon, England, wearing clothes made in China. If that does not tell \nsomebody about our trade relations with China.\n  We need to do it right because we know what happened not too many \nyears ago with the Central American Free Trade Agreement, so-called \nCAFTA. The American people recognize that.\n  Too often we have allowed countries to violate their trade \ncommitments with detrimental consequences to our own industries, \nespecially our manufacturing.\n  Between 2000 and 2010, we lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs in \nthis country. More than 5 million manufacturing jobs disappeared. Madam \nPresident, 60,000 plants closed. That is not by accident. That \nglobalization evolved that way. It was because of trade law and tax law \nin our country that gave incentives in far too many cases for companies \nto shut down in the United States and move overseas.\n  We know a number of large American businesses have decided their \nbusiness plan is to shut down production in Sandusky or Hamilton, OH, \nand to move production to Shihan or Wuhan, China and sell those \nproducts back into the United States of America.\n  Never, to my knowledge, in world history has a large number of \ncompanies in one country put together a business plan such as that: \nShut down production in the home country, move it overseas, and sell \nback those products into the home country. By and large, it has not \nworked for our country. Part of the result is a diminished middle class \nwith stagnant wages.\n  That is what we need to make sure we understand as we go, with eyes \nwide open, into this PNTR with Russia.\n  Too often we compromise our values in these trade agreements, we \ncompromise our commitment to upholding human rights.\n  Granting Russia PNTR status without oversight is another such deal in \nthe making. We have a responsibility to American steelmakers and \nwelders, the companies and the workers, the small manufacturers and the \nemployees, the engineers, the laborers, all of them, to get it right \nthis time.\n  I want more trade, and this is not just about Russia. This is about \nAmerica's trade policy, America's workers, American job creation. This \nis about the guy in Zanesville who made big things with his hands for \nyears and now has gone from $17 an hour to $11 an hour--and still has \nto provide for his family.\n  It is just this simple: enforcement and accountability must be at the \nheart of our trade commitments with every single country in the world.\n  Granting Russia PNTR; that is, granting Russia permanent normal trade \nrelations, is important for U.S. businesses. It could be a major step \ntoward boosting exports of machinery, aerospace products, and other \nmanufactured goods. I get that. I support that. It could be helpful to \nOhioans who produce nearly 328 million pounds of chicken. It could be \nhelpful to hog farmers around Johnstown, OH, and pork producers \nthroughout Ohio and throughout the United States.\n  But we need to ensure our manufacturers, our ranchers, and our \nproducers are not economically hogtied, if you will, by our trading \npartners. U.S. workers have learned the hard way that promises about \nstrict enforcement simply do not go far enough and are simply too often \nempty.\n  A decade of experience with China's failure to abide by its WTO \ncommitments has provided ample evidence that we must strengthen our \nenforcement regime.\n  How many Senators who voted for permanent normal trade relations with \nChina, how many Congress men and women who voted for permanent normal \ntrade relations with China have come to the floor and complained about \nChina breaking the rules? They have attacked China because China \ncheats. They have complained to China on the Senate floor. They have \ngone to the International Trade Commission saying China is not playing \nby the rules. Yet they voted for PNTR a dozen years ago.\n  But put that aside, make up for it by passing a Russian PNTR that has \nreal commitments, has real language, not just for reporting language \nbut for enforcement language.\n  After 10 years, after hundreds of thousands of American jobs lost, we \nare seeing the same arguments we saw for PNTR made in support of \ngranting Russia WTO membership.\n  Our experience with China has shown we must ensure that our trading \npartners follow through on their commitments. Our workers, our farmers, \nour ranchers, our producers, our manufacturers should have confidence \nthat if a trade deal is signed, it will actually be enforced.\n  We cannot afford another one-way trade agreement because one-way \ntrade agreements tend to lead to one-way job movements--companies \nshutting down here, manufacturing somewhere else, and selling back into \nthe United States.\n  That is why we must have oversight. We must have mechanisms in place \nto ensure that Russia adheres to its commitments.\n  We must learn from the Chinese case.\n  Our PNTR with China caused huge damage to our country and \nmanufacturing job loss. From the implementation of PNTR--passed in \n1999, begun in\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\n2000--accession to the World Trade Organization, around then for China, \nwe saw what happened with job loss.\n  I mentioned a minute ago, between 2000 and 2010, we lost one-third of \nour manufacturing jobs in this country, more than 5 million jobs. We \nlost 60,000 plants in this country--not entirely because of China not \nplaying fair, not entirely because of PNTR, not even entirely because \nof PNTR with China and the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  It is our tax law. It is our trade law. It is our unwillingness or \ninability to enforce these trade rules. All that has conspired for this \njob loss.\n  Since 2010, I might add--because of the auto rescue and some other \nthings--we have gained back one-half million manufacturing jobs. Ten \nyears of manufacturing job loss; since the auto rescue, 500,000 \nmanufacturing job gains.\n  We have to have monitoring. We have to have appropriate consequences \nin place when these rules are violated. If we repeat our mistakes of \nthe past--from the lessons we should have learned from China--we will \nhave no one to blame but ourselves.\n  My bill, the Russian World Trade Organization Commitments \nVerification Act of 2012, would help ensure Russia abides by the \nschedules set out in its WTO terms of accession.\n  Russia said it is going to do A, B, C, D, and E. So did China. The \npoint is, we need not just reporting language about evaluating--did \nthey do A, B, C, D, and E--but we need enforcement mechanisms. So if \nthey do A and they do not do B, then the administration or the House or \nthe Senate or we individually can begin to bring some actions against \nRussia for not following these rules.\n  We accomplish this by requiring USTR to report to Congress annually \non how Russia is adhering to the commitments it made as part of joining \nthe World Trade Organization.\n  If Russia fails to comply--and here is what our language does \ndifferently from what we have done in the past; learning from what \nhappened with China--if Russia fails to comply, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative will be required--required, not an optional thing \nbecause we see how Trade Representatives, particularly during the Bush \nyears, acted on these kinds of problems--the U.S. Trade Representative \nwill be required to explain what the administration is doing about it. \nIf the administration does nothing, my bill clarifies that Congress can \nrequest that the administration take action.\n  It is commonsense accountability. It has been lacking in our trade \nenforcement.\n  This is an American issue. We can solve it together. We can solve it \nbipartisanly. We can solve it because it is an issue in all regions of \nour country.\n  President Reagan once said about Russia we must ``trust, but \nverify.'' He was actually talking about the old days of the Soviet \nUnion. The same applies today--``trust but verify.'' Bring the \nreporting requirements forward. Bring accountability forward. It will \nmatter for American jobs, for American manufacturers, for a middle-\nclass standard of living for so many in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, earlier today, we had a colloquy on this \nfloor talking about the devastating effects of sequestration, and I \nthink we covered most everything. One of the significant parts of this \nis how we got here in the first place.\n  Not many people realize that in our form of government the President \nof the United States, whether he is a Democrat or a Republican, comes \nout with a budget each year. Of course, we have not actually passed a \nbudget in the Senate, so that becomes the budget.\n  In his budget, starting 4 years ago, he has had, each year, in excess \nof $1 trillion of deficit each year. Add them all up and it is $5.3 \ntrillion of deficit.\n  I only mention that in conjunction with the concern we have on \nsequestration. How did we get here in the first place? This is \nsomething that is very much of a concern for us because it seems as if, \nwhen we look at all the increases, the deficit increases during this \nadministration since 2008, the only area that has not been dealt with \nfairly, in terms of keeping up with our obligations, is national \ndefense.\n  I am not too surprised this happened, but it did. In fact, I can \nremember going over to--let me interrupt myself.\n  Madam President, it is my understanding I have 30 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time allocation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Oh, fine. I like that better.\n  After the first budget, I can recall going over to Afghanistan, \nknowing this President would be disarming America in his first budget. \nI think he will go down in history as the most antidefense President we \nhave ever had. But I remember going over there. I knew, with the tanks \ngoing back and forth in the background, that I would be able to respond \nand to get some attention of the American people.\n  Of course, that first budget, I remember it so well. He did away with \nour only fifth generation fighter, the F-22; did away with our lift \ncapability, the C-17; did away with our Future Combat Systems, which \nwould have been the first ground transition in 60 years. Then what I am \ngoing to talk about in another portion of my presentation this \nafternoon did away with the ground-based interceptor in Poland. Now \nthat was the first budget.\n  Since that time, it has been deteriorating even more. So our national \ndefense has been doing everything it can to try to stay afloat, try to \nsupport our troops who are over in harm's way. It is becoming more and \nmore difficult.\n  If we project what this President has done and would be doing over \nthe next 10 years, it would be cutting the military by $\\1/2\\ trillion. \nNow, that is bad enough, but what is worse is what would happen under \nsequestration.\n  Under sequestration, the way he has engineered sequestration, the \ncuts would take place--as was pointed out very effectively by the \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions--the amount of cuts that would come \nfrom sequestration would be coming almost entirely from the military. \nSo not only is he projecting a cut of $\\1/2\\ trillion in our military \nas it is today, but if Obama's sequestration goes into effect, it is \ngoing to be another $\\1/2\\ trillion. So we know what this is going to \ndo to jobs, we know what it is going to do to our ability, we know what \nit is going to do in terms of putting our troops in harm's way.\n  So I would only say, in my State of Oklahoma an article came out. It \nwas by Marion Blakley, the president and CEO of the Aerospace \nIndustries Association. She released a report, and it was covered very \nwell by Chris Casteel in the Oklahoman in this morning's paper.\n  They talked about: Surely, Oklahoma could lose 16,000 jobs. Well, \nthat is bad enough, but the figure actually is much higher than that \nwhen we throw in the uniformed presence we have and the jobs we would \nlose.\n  In my State of Oklahoma we have five major military installations. We \nhave Tinker Air Force Base, which does a lot of the repairs on the \nheavy stuff, KC-135s, and so forth. We have Vance that does primary \ntraining, an excellent job. We have our depot and the ammunition depot \nthat is in McAlester. We have Altus Air Force Base that trains people \nin flying the heavy stuff. And we have Fort Sill in Lawton, OK.\n  I have to say, this is a great compliment to my State of Oklahoma \nbecause we have had, since 1987, five BRAC rounds. It is called Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission rounds. These are rounds where they \ngo through and make evaluation as to which of these military \nestablishments are perhaps not making the contribution to our Nation's \ndefense they should, and then they go through readjustment and \nrealigning, and so forth.\n  I am proud to say in my State of Oklahoma, the five military \nestablishments I just now mentioned all have benefited from each of the \nrounds in terms of numbers of missions and numbers of people. I have to \nsay there is a reason for that. It is not political influence, as a lot \nof people might guess. It is community support.\n  I have people saying, well, every community, every State has that. \nNo, it is not true. When there is a problem and a need, we pass bond \nissues such as\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\nthe very large bond issue in Oklahoma City to allow us to get the GM \nplant and, consequently, we have new missions going in. So I am saying \nthat in a complimentary way.\n  On the other hand, with the sequestration that will be the Obama \nsequestration that will take place starting on January 2 of this coming \nyear, we would have huge losses in Oklahoma. The estimate is probably \ncloser to 22,000 jobs in the first year that we would be suffering in \nmy State of Oklahoma.\n  It is bad enough what that will do to the economy in my State of \nOklahoma, but what is even worse is what it does to our national \ndefense. We have no way of knowing right now where that money is going \nto be coming from. I had a conversation--the first one in a long time \nyesterday--with Dick Cheney. Of course, we all recall not just his \nVice-Presidential relationship, but he used to be Secretary of Defense.\n  He was one of those who was trying to make a lot of the cuts, and he \ndid make a lot of the cuts. But he was talking about, if they do this \nand have these across-the-board cuts, it would be not just \ndevastating--I mean, we all understand it would be devastating. That \nword was actually used by Secretary of Defense Panetta, who is under \nthe Obama administration, saying the Obama sequestration would be \ndevastating to our military.\n  But Dick Cheney was kind of pointing out some of the areas of \ninterest. One of my backgrounds, and I still do it today, I have been a \nflight instructor for 50 years. I am sensitive to the need we have for \npilots and how to train them. If we are to take across-the-board cuts, \nthat would mean our pilots in the Air Force, in the Navy, and the \nMarines would not be subjected to the training I believe, in my \nopinion, would keep them as the crack pilots they are today.\n  The thing they would probably do is say: Well, we have simulators. We \nhave simulators. That does not do it. Everybody knows that does not do \nit. So the cuts the Obama sequestration would make would be devastating \nto the whole country, devastating to my State of Oklahoma but more so, \nit would affect the lives of our troops.\n  You know, there is this kind of a myth out there, and the American \npeople believe it, that the United States has the best of everything; \nwhen we send our kids into battle, that they have the best equipment \nalways. That is not true. There are a lot of areas where we do not have \nthe best. For example, the Non-Line-of-Sight Cannon. There are five \ncountries, including South Africa, that have better equipment than we \ndo.\n  So as we look down the road and we see these cuts that are taking \nplace, and then come back, as I just did from the Farnborough Airshow, \nseeing the other countries--France and all the other countries--and \ntheir propulsion systems, they are developing vehicles that are \nactually, in some cases, better than what we are doing over here.\n  The problem we are having is the deep cuts that have taken place in \ndefense. I would have to say there is one thing that I am concerned \nabout. This is kind of a warning shot for manufacturers, for defense \ncontractors around the country that it is my opinion that the \nPresident--and I have heard this from several of the defense \ncontractors, saying the administration is leaning on them not to send \npink slips out on firing these people as a result of the Obama \nsequestration until after the November 7 election.\n  Well, I think they are overlooking that there is a law that was \npassed back in 1988 called the WARN law. It was the Worker Adjustment \nand Retraining Notification law. It says if we go through something \nlike this, we have to send out pink slips--or the contractors have to \nsend out pink slips to those who are going to lose their jobs 60 days \nprior to the time that is going to take place.\n  Well, if sequestration takes place on January 2, that would mean \nNovember 2, only 5 days before the election. So I just want to make \nsure everybody knows. The law says they must do it by 60 days. But they \ncan do it tomorrow if they want to. I think the people of this country \nwho are going to lose their jobs due to the Obama sequestration should \nbe entitled to know they are going to get their pink slips before the \nelection so that could certainly affect what they are going to be doing \nin an election.\n\n\n                            Missile Defense\n\n  That is not what I came down to talk about because we already talked \nabout that before. But I would like to mention something that occurred \nin the last couple of days that has put us in a more dangerous \nposition, and nobody is talking about it.\n  Back in December of 2002, President Bush issued a National Security \nPresidential Directive, Directive No. 23, announcing the plan to begin \ndeploying a set of missile defense capabilities that would include \nground-based interceptors, sea-based interceptors--land, sea, and \nspace, kind of a triad system.\n  This is a system that people did not object to at that time because \nthey remember back when people used to give President Reagan a hard \ntime. When they talk about Star Wars, they talk about there will be a \ntime when people have missiles that can be aimed at the United States, \nand they said the idea that we could shoot down a missile with a \nmissile or shoot down a bullet with a bullet is inconceivable. They did \nnot believe that would ever happen, but it is happening today and we \nall know it. We know the missile capability of countries that would \nlike to kill all of us. So it is a very serious threat right now.\n  By the end of 2008 President Bush had succeeded in fielding a missile \ndefense system capable of defending all 50 States and had security \nagreements with the Czech Republic and Poland on the construction of a \nthird missile defense site. The radar would be in the Czech Republic.\n  I can remember talking to one of my favorite people, who was the \nPresident of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Klaus, about this subject. This \ntook a lot of courage for President Bush to go in there and say: Look, \nwe have a serious problem.\n  Let me kind of get into the record--I want to make sure people \nunderstand this. We have great ground-based interceptors in Alaska and \nCalifornia. I am confident that any missile coming in from that \ndirection we can kill, we can knock down. The problem is if it came \nfrom the other direction, such as Iran, we do not have that capability. \nSure, we might get one lucky shot from the west coast, knock it down, \nsomething coming into the east coast. With 20 kids and grandkids, that \ndoes not give me a lot of comfort.\n  Instead, in his wisdom and the wisdom of the administration under the \nBush administration, we started building a ground-based interceptor in \nPoland with the radar located in the Czech Republic. Russia did not \nlike that. They do not like the idea that we are defending ourselves \nin--you have to use your own judgment to decide why they have come to \nthat conclusion. But it took courage for the Poles and the Czechs to \ncome up and build this thing, and they agreed to do it.\n  I remember talking to Vaclav Klaus when it first started. He said: We \nwant to make sure if we make this commitment and we anger Russia that \nyou are not going to pull the rug out from under us. I gave them the \nassurance that was not going to happen.\n  Well, unfortunately that did happen. When President Obama was \nelected, he first cut the budget for missile defense by $1.4 billion, \nand he killed the ground-based interceptor in Poland. At that time--\nthis is very significant our intelligence had said Iran will have the \ncapability of sending a nuclear weapon over a delivery system by 2015.\n  Well, the Obama administration cut that program. They said: No, they \nare not going to have that capability until 2020. Well, guess what \nhappened. Just 2 or 3 days ago, Secretary Panetta said on ``60 \nMinutes'' that he believes Iran would be able to procure the nuclear \nweapon in about a year, and then it will take them another year or two \nin order to put it on a delivery vehicle. That would be 2015. So now we \nknow we were right way back in the Bush administration. We know the \ndanger that the Obama administration has put us in. I think people are \ngoing to have to understand that is true.\n  For us to use the system that President Obama wants to use, we would \nhave to have capability--it is a system called SM32B. That missile \nwould give us that protection we would have otherwise gotten by the \nsystem in Poland and the Czech Republic and would not be developed to \nbe able to use until after 2020.\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\n  So this is something that is probably one of the most serious matters \nwe are dealing with right now. I remember very well when President \nObama was meeting with Russian President Medvedev on Monday, March 26, \nof this year, President Obama said--this is when the mic was on and \nnobody knew that he could be heard. He said:\n\n       On all of these issues, but particularly missile defense, \n     this, this can be solved but it's important for him to give \n     me space.\n\n  He was talking about Russian incoming President Vladimir Putin. These \nare his words.\n\n       This is my last election. After my election, I have more \n     flexibility.\n\n  What does that tell us? It tells us that not only is it bad enough \nwhat he has already done in taking out our ability to defend ourselves \nagainst an incoming missile from anywhere, specifically from Iran, but \nit is a crisis that we are dealing with that has got to be dealt with.\n\n\n                         Law of the Sea Treaty\n\n  I want to mention one last thing because it is new--it is not new; it \nis something they have been trying to do for a long time. I quite often \ncriticize the United Nations. Many times they do not have our interests \nat heart. I am very glad we got the 34th signature on a letter we were \nprepared to send saying: Do not bring the Law of the Sea Treaty for a \nratification vote to the Senate because we will vote against it.\n  Now, 34 Senators signed that letter, which means they cannot do it. \nThey are still having the hearings and all of that because they like to \ntalk about it, I guess. But we are not going to cede our jurisdiction \nover 70 percent of the Earth's surface to the United Nations, nor are \nwe going to give the United Nations the power, for the first time, to \ntax the United States of America. That is what we would find in this \ntreaty.\n  That is when he signed this treaty. I only mention that because these \ntreaties that come along somehow--I don't know what it is, but there is \nsomething about the internationalists, and a lot serve in this body. \nThey don't think any idea is a good one unless it comes from the U.N. \nIt makes you wonder where is sovereignty anymore.\n  Here is another one, the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which they are \ntrying to get through. Over the past 15 years, the idea of creating a \nglobal arms trade treaty has been debated at the United Nations. During \nthe Bush administration, the United States stood in opposition to such \na treaty. Yet it should come as no surprise that soon after entering \nthe White House, President Obama reversed this position and went to \nwork crafting and negotiating a U.N. arms trade treaty.\n  We all hear about gun control and what we are going to do with your \nability to keep and bear arms. We hear about the second amendment to \nthe Constitution, how it means very little to a lot of people.\n  It should be noted first that the treaty is currently being \nnegotiated, so we cannot speak with certainty about the details. \nHowever, in March the president of the conference that is negotiating \nthe treaty released a ``chairman's draft.'' Through the draft, we know \nthat the treaty may seek to establish certain criteria that must be met \nbefore the international transfer of conventional weapons--including \nsmall arms and light weapons--is allowed to take place.\n  Here is what we are talking about. I remember that back during the \nClinton administration they were saying: We have to do something about \nrestricting arms in the United States. After all, they said, look at \nall of the things happening with the drug cartels in Mexico and in \nCentral America; they are getting their weapons from the United States. \nThat was the justification for having a gun treaty at that time. This \nisn't all that bad.\n  We don't know the details of this yet, but we know the draft treaty \nmay seek to establish certain criteria to be met before we can sell to \nother countries. We have a lot of friendly countries out there to which \nwe would like to sell.\n  Although we all agree that a committed effort must be made to prevent \nterrorists and criminals from acquiring weapons, the treaty could \nundermine our foreign policy and national security strategy and \ninfringe Americans' second amendment rights. In Oklahoma, maybe people \nare a little more sensitive to second amendment rights, but I seem to \nbe hearing from them, and they are dead right. The heart of the problem \nwith the treaty is the notion that bad actors will continue to be bad \nactors. We have seen this time and time again. Law-abiding nations will \nconstrain themselves to the terms of the treaty, and rogue nations and \ncorrupt states will contravene the explicit text of the treaty that \nonly months ago they were negotiating and wholeheartedly endorsing.\n  I can remember using this argument on gun control in the United \nStates. Gun control assumes that people out there are going to obey the \nlaws. But they are not the problem people; it is the people who are not \ngoing to obey the law. Why would they single out a law on gun control \nthat would preclude them from having guns if they are criminals to \nstart with? It doesn't make sense. Internationally, the same thing is \ntaking place.\n  This treaty is rife with opportunities for such behavior. In fact, \nthe draft requires that provisions ``shall be implemented in a manner \nthat would avoid hampering the right of self defense of any state \nparty.'' One need look no further than the current conflict in Syria to \nsee how ridiculous this requirement is. The arms that Russia is \ncurrently supplying to Syria obviously have a dual purpose--for its \nnational defense against a foreign aggressor but also to be used in the \noppression of its own people. We know that is happening. Just yesterday \nwe watched this taking place. Russia would, of course, claim they are \ndoing it for their own defense.\n  How, then, does anyone expect an arms trade treaty which would not \nhave stringent enforcement mechanisms to have any impact whatsoever? \nThe answer is, against bad actors and rogue nations, it will not. But \nagainst nations such as the United States, the arms trade treaty may \nhave a considerable impact.\n  Take, for example, the requirement in the draft that arms should not \n``be used in a manner that would seriously undermine peace or security, \nor provoke, prolong or aggravate internal, regional, subregional or \ninternational instability.'' Does anyone deny that each and every time \nwe supply weapons to some of our greatest allies, such as Israel, \nTaiwan, and South Korea, that we are, in fact, prolonging regional or \ninternational stability? The answer is no. But this is instability that \nis necessary for international order and the prevalence of democracy in \nregions where it might not otherwise exist. Yet the terms of the draft \ntreaty could be read to prohibit such weapons sales.\n  We can all agree that it is a great understatement to say that we \ndon't want American gun companies selling weapons internationally when \nthey might be used to commit violations of human rights, but, as \neveryone knows, we already have laws on the books that prohibit this. \nThe export of firearms is already subject to a very strict and complex \nregime.\n  The U.S. international trade in arms regulations--that is why I call \nthis the foot in the door, a first step--which has been promulgated \npursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, already strictly limits the \ntransfer or sale of firearms. This regulatory regime has been in place \nsince the 1950s. The United States has been doing this for a very long \ntime. Other nations--our allies primarily--have mirrored our export \ncontrol regime because it is so comprehensive.\n  This goes back to my earlier point. The United States has been very \nresponsible in the area of exporting firearms, but other nations will \nnot be, even as signatories to this treaty. It gets back to the nations \nthat are the bad guys--they will not pay attention to the treaty even \nthough they signed it.\n  The final point is that this treaty, even if negotiations result this \nmonth in a finalized version, is just going to collect dust in the \nSenate. We already have 58 Members of this body who have already signed \na letter in opposition, and I feel strongly that this will meet the \nsame fate as the Law of the Sea Treaty and so many other U.N.-sponsored \ntreaties.\n  So you know the administration is in constant negotiations with \ninternational groups, such as the United Nations, and we have to go \naround and get people, as we did on the Law of the Sea Treaty. We have \n35 Senators saying they will vote not to ratify, and that means you are \nwasting your time. Why are we even talking about it if it can't\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\nbe ratified because it takes two-thirds for ratification? The same \nthing is true here, except we have 58 Members.\n  Keep in mind that the collectivists who are opposed to the private \nownership of firearms, opposed to the second amendment rights, are the \nones who are trying to do it internationally.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, it has been a tough day, a tough week. We \ncould use a little bipartisanship in this Chamber and in this Congress. \nI don't understand it. We heard the Democratic leadership of the \nsupercommittee come right out the other day and say that it was \npreferable to her that the fiscal cliff be encountered and that we \nactually bring our Nation over the fiscal cliff rather than working \ntogether in a bipartisan way to avoid it before the end of the year.\n  Then I was mystified today to learn that the majority leader of this \ngreat body proposes next year, if his party remains in power, to \nforever change the nature of the Senate in terms of being a great \ndeliberative body and to go to the majority-rule 51-vote process that \nthey have in the House. It worked OK in the House, but we have never \ndone that in the Senate.\n  I am concerned with some of the things I have been hearing, and, \nfrankly, I hope we can come back from the precipice of some of these \ndisturbing proposals I have heard. One way to do that would be to \naddress, in a bipartisan way, this issue of sequestration. So I rise \nthis afternoon to point out to my colleagues that we are now less than \n6 months away from seeing sequestration go into effect. This is a grim \nreality that was never supposed to happen. It is a reality that doesn't \nhave to happen. But it will happen unless we act and unless the \nPresident signs legislation. Budget sequestration means defense and \nnondefense spending will be cut automatically and across the board, \nwithout regard to the priorities or the importance of programs. We need \nto avoid this.\n  How did we get here? Almost a year ago, Congress voted for the Budget \nControl Act as a first step toward seriously addressing the national \ndebt. We authorized, in good faith, a supercommittee to produce a \nblueprint that would reduce the national deficit by $1.5 trillion or \nmore. Our hope and our expectation was that both political parties \nwould come to a reasoned, long-term solution to America's debt crisis. \nOf course, that hope faded quickly with the announcement of an impasse \nby the supercommittee.\n  With a national debt approaching an unprecedented $16 trillion, \nreining in Federal spending is imperative to our national and economic \nsecurity. ADM Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, put it simply: ``Our debt is our number one national security \nthreat.'' Severe, across-the-board cuts to the Department of Defense \nare not the way to address this security threat, and they are not the \nway to achieve long-term fiscal responsibility. Federal debt is a \nnational security threat, to be sure, but so is unilaterally cutting \nkey funding to America's men and women in uniform.\n  Realistically confronting the debt problem means addressing soaring \nentitlement costs, which are growing at three times the rate of \ninflation, three times the rate of our economic growth. We can't \nsustain that. But realistically confronting the debt does not mean \ngambling with the resources our military needs to protect this Nation \nand the skilled jobs necessary to supply today's advanced force.\n  Unless we act, and act soon, $492 billion will be cut from defense \nspending beginning January 3, 2013.\n  According to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the effect would be \n``devastating''--a ``meat axe.'' Our Secretary of Defense, a member of \nthe Obama administration, said it would ``hollow out the force.'' \nUnfortunately, Secretary Panetta and the White House, so far, have \nfailed to identify the specific impact of these cuts. Clarity is needed \nas to how these automatic cuts would limit our capabilities. As of this \nmoment, sequestration is the law of the land unless Congress passes--\nand the President signs--a bill to stop it. The administration needs to \nget specific about the results of this ``meat axe.''\n  Our military faces a diverse set of challenges and emerging threats--\na nuclear North Korea, a volatile Iran that wants to be nuclear, our \ncommitment to a Democratic Taiwan, and the competition for mineral \nresources in the South China Sea. All of these and more require the \nability to project American power abroad.\n  This year we celebrate the bicentennial of the War of 1812, and the \nlessons of that conflict should be remembered. During that war, it was \nour Navy that reaffirmed America's sovereignty. The United States saw \nthat even the border of an expansive ocean would not fully protect our \nNation. The influence of sea power on national security and commerce \nwas clear then and it remains clear today.\n  As ranking member of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower, I \ncan attest that the Navy Department is the Armed Forces' most capital-\nintensive branch, and the Navy will be particularly hit hard by \nindiscriminate sequestration cuts. According to civilian and uniformed \nNavy leaders, our capacity to deter threats, defend our priorities, and \nproject sea power could be gravely compromised. Sequestration would \nhurt readiness, fleet size, strategic investment, and the strength of \nAmerica's workforce.\n  The projected numbers are striking. The Marine Corps would endure an \nadditional 10-percent cut in troop strength, leaving our marines \nwithout sufficient manpower to meet even one major contingency \noperation. The Navy fleet would drop to 230 ships, well below the \nNavy's 313-ship requirement. It would drop to 230 from 313, hindering \nthe ability of our combatant commanders to execute their missions \nabroad. Even now, the Navy can satisfy only half of combatant commander \nrequests for naval support.\n  Sequestration could affect the quality of future investments and the \nlong-term vitality of America's shipbuilding workforce. Experience has \nshown that stable shipbuilding rates have a direct impact on the \nacquisition and operational cost of amphibious ships, aircraft \ncarriers, and submarines. Cuts would prevent the Navy from ensuring new \nships are delivered on time and on budget.\n  The average age of today's shipyard worker is 45, and only 24 percent \nof our naval shipbuilding workforce is under 35 years of age. \nSequestration would drive a generation of skilled shipbuilders from the \nworkforce and would have a prolonged negative impact on American high-\ntech manufacturing.\n  I am proud to be from a State with a highly skilled manufacturing \nbase. Mississippi workers produce ships, aircraft, and equipment that \nour troops depend upon throughout the world. Sharp cuts to defense will \nhave a direct and detrimental impact on Mississippi's families and \ncommunities.\n  The stakes are high for the military and America's economy. These \nlooming cuts are real, they are drastic, and they are just around the \ncorner. Sequestration is real and not a hypothetical threat. It is the \nlaw unless we change it. Our national security is on the line, and it \nis in our interest either to prevent sequestration or prepare for it. \nIndeed, some defense manufacturers have already begun the process of \nissuing legally required layoff warning notices to shareholders and \nemployees.\n  According to multiple forecasts, up to 1 million American jobs are at \nrisk. The current unemployment rate already stands at 8.2 percent, and \nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke projected unemployment rates will \nremain high, as he testified before the Congress yesterday and today.\n  There are some faint and hopeful signs this catastrophe can be \navoided. Indeed, in the Congress, there has always been bipartisan \ncooperation to ensure our military remains the best trained, the best \nequipped, and most professional fighting force in the world. We argue \nabout a lot of things, but bipartisanship has prevailed when it comes \nto the defense budget. The fiscal year 2013 Defense authorization bill \nis a hopeful example.\n  The bill recently passed by the Armed Services Committee, of which I\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\nam a member, contains many provisions reflecting Congress's support of \nthe Defense Department's top strategic priorities. It also reflects the \nchallenges we may encounter while outlining ways to reduce spending, \nand we must reduce military spending, no question about it. But \nsequestration is not the way.\n  Also, with regard to the Defense authorization bill, I should mention \nthis is the 51st consecutive year that Congress has passed such a bill. \nAgain, that is testimony to bipartisanship with regard to DOD \nreauthorization. That is the good news. The bad news is the failure to \naddress our past spending has compounded the situation we now face. \nFurther delays only make the problem worse.\n  We know tough decisions will have to be made to fix our country's \ndebt problem. All Federal agencies, including DOD, will have to do more \nwith less in today's era of fiscal austerity. But the bottom line is \nthis: We have an overriding constitutional obligation to provide for \nthe common defense, to ensure our country is safe, and that our men and \nwomen in uniform are well equipped to face the challenges of the 21st \ncentury. I urge my colleagues to work together in a bipartisan fashion \ntoward a solution that achieves the fiscal discipline we need without \ncompromising the ability of our military to protect and defend America.\n  Addressing sequestration should be our No. 1 priority--this week. We \nshould act before the August break. After Labor Day, after the \npolitical conventions, when campaigns are in full swing and we have \nonly 2 months to go before these devastating cuts go into effect, do we \ntruly believe the atmosphere will be conducive to solving \nsequestration? I don't think so. Is it truly in our Nation's best \nnational security interest to address this during a lameduck session? I \ndon't think so. We should not leave town for an August break if we have \nnot answered this sequestration issue. The hour is upon us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bennet pertaining to the introduction of S. 3400 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BENNET. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bring Jobs Home \nAct.\n  Growing up in a blue-collar neighborhood in Baltimore during World \nWar II, my father had a small neighborhood grocery store.\n  We were the neighborhood of mom-and-pop businesses and factories. We \nmade liberty ships. We put out turbo steel to make the tanks. Glenn L. \nMartin made the seaplanes that helped win the battle of the Pacific. We \nwere in the manufacturing business. But the blue-collar Baltimore of \nWorld War II, Korea, and Vietnam just isn't what it used to be.\n  The jobs are leaving now. Our shipyard jobs have left. Our steel \nmills have shrunk to miniscule levels. We don't make ships. And we \ndon't make clothing.\n  Where did those jobs go?\n  Those jobs are on a slow boat to China. They are on a fast track to \nMexico and other jobs are in dial 1-800 anywhere.\n  And why did they go?\n  In some cases, they went because of tax breaks that rewarded \ncorporations for moving manufacturing overseas.\n  It is wrong to give companies incentives to send millions of jobs to \nother countries, especially when millions of Americans are looking for \nwork. It is wrong to put companies that stay in America at a \ncompetitive disadvantage.\n  It is time we look at our Tax Code and call for a patriotic tax code.\n  We walk around the floor of the Senate. We go to rallies. We love to \nbe in parades. We wear our flags because we want to stand up for our \ntroops, and we should stand up for our troops. But we also have to \nstand up for America.\n  The current Tax Code is putting companies that stay in America at a \ndisadvantage because they keep their business here, hire their workers \nat home, pay their share of taxes, and provide health care to their \nemployees. We should be rewarding these companies with ``good guy'' tax \nbreaks for hiring and building their businesses right here in the \nUnited States.\n  I have been on a jobs tour of Maryland. I visited bakeries, \nmicrobreweries, and factories of small machine tool companies. I \nvisited Main Street, small streets, and rural communities.\n  I talked with business owners and their employees. These are ``good \nguy'' businesses. They work hard and play by the rules. They have jobs \nright here in the United States. They want to expand. They want to \nhire. They need a government on their side and at their side. They are \nharmed by thoughtless government tax incentives that reward competitors \nwho move overseas.\n  That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the Bring Jobs Home Act. This \nbill ends the loophole that gives companies a tax break for sending \njobs overseas.\n  There is a loophole in the Federal Tax Code that lets businesses \ndeduct the ``business expense'' for costs of moving the company or its \nworkers right out of the country.\n  This legislation tells these companies. If you want to export jobs \nout of America, you can't file a deduction for doing it. And it ensures \nthe Tax Code can't be used to boost corporate rewards at the expense of \nAmerican workers.\n  This bill is about helping those ``good guy'' businesses who are \ncreating jobs here. It says: If you bring jobs back to the United \nStates, you can get a tax break for 20 percent of the cost of bringing \nthe jobs home.\n  That is why I am proud to stand with my colleague from Michigan to \ncall on us to think about economic patriotism, a tax code that rewards \nAmerican companies that bring jobs back home, and a tax code that ends \ndespicable tax breaks and subsidies to companies that move jobs \noverseas.\n  I call upon my colleagues to think about where America is going in \nthe 21st century. Where are we going to be? Are we going to create more \nopportunity? Are we going to create more jobs that pay good wages with \ngood benefits or are we going to resemble the economy of a third-world \ncountry?\n  I really want to have a tax code that brings our jobs back home, \nbrings our money back home, and stands up for America. So let's pass \nthe Bring Jobs Home Act and take an important step toward economic \npatriotism.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/18/senate-section/article/S5130-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I remain concerned about the high price of \ngasoline that continues to disproportionately hurt working class \nfamilies, especially those in rural States like Vermont. In Vermont, \nthe average price of gasoline remains above the national average. \nDespite significant efforts to improve public transportation in the \nState, many Vermonters must still rely on their cars as the primary \nmode of transportation. More can and must be done to help families who \nare struggling to find jobs and put food on the table.\n  Crude oil accounts for the largest share of the price of gasoline. I \nam concerned that excessive speculation in the oil market has \ncontributed to a significant rise in the price of gasoline. Congress \nincluded important protections to address excessive speculation\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\nin the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As a \nconferee and strong advocate for that law, I have pushed the U.S. \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission to quickly implement the \nprotections and rules to help curb these abuses.\n  At the same time, we must ensure that local and regional markets \nremain competitive and that oil companies do not engage in \nanticompetitive practices. While prices have eased somewhat nationally \nthis summer, there have been concerns raised about price disparities in \nthe cost of gasoline in Vermont. Vermont prices remain higher than the \nnational average and residents of northern Vermont are paying even more \nthan their neighbors just one or two towns to the south. I support the \nefforts by the State of Vermont, Senator Sanders and Federal regulators \nto look into whether these differences can be explained by market \nconditions, and to take action if they cannot. Such serious allegations \nshould be properly investigated by the Oil and Gas Price Fraud Working \nGroup at the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \nCommission.\n  The largest oil companies raked in $137 billion in profits last year \nalone, while also taking in billions in taxpayer subsidies. Repeated \nefforts to repeal these ridiculous subsidies by myself and a majority \nof the Senate have been filibustered by friends of the big oil \nindustry. It is these large oil companies and those working at the \nwholesale level that are reaping tremendous profits, while many of our \nindependent and locally owned stations are struggling to make ends \nmeet. Regrettably, many of these same local stations are forced to \nshutter their doors when the large oil chains undercut their business.\n  The real cost of high gas prices is more than just the bill at the \npump. These prices force families to choose between filling their gas \ntanks and putting food on the table. And they mean rising food prices \ndue to increased shipping costs. These are costs that working families, \nparticularly in these difficult economic times, often cannot absorb. I \nwill continue to push for creative, long-term solutions to relieve the \npain at the pump.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/18/senate-section/article/S5131-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nMassachusetts General Hospital, located in my home State of \nMassachusetts. Mass General has recently been named the number one \nhospital in America by U.S. News & World Report for their dedication \nand excellence in providing care to thousands of patients every year. I \nalso want to acknowledge Brigham and Women's Hospital for being named \namong the top hospitals in the country.\n  Mass General cares for more than 47,000 inpatients each year, and \nserves as the largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. It \nis also the oldest and largest hospital in New England. Located right \nin Boston, Mass General's 907 bed facility has a tradition of \nexcellence. They also have four additional health centers in \nCharlestown, Chelsea, Revere and the North End. Together, these \nlocations handle over one million outpatient visits, as well as over \n80,000 emergency visits, each year. It is no surprise that Mass General \nis the top hospital in the Nation, with its impressive research \nprogram, innovative primary care, and distinguished staff.\n  Massachusetts is home to a number of remarkable research programs, \nmany of which are housed within Mass General's network, which is the \nlargest hospital-based research program in the United States. This \nnetwork includes over 20 clinical departments and centers, investing \n$550 million per year to work towards discoveries that transform \ntreatments and patient care.\n  For example, the Global Network for Women's and Children's Health \nResearch at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children is one of only \n7 locations in the country funded by the NIH to study the rates of \nmorbidity and mortality in women and children in developing countries. \nThese discoveries have not only led to better treatments for children, \nbut have also led to policy changes at the World Health Organization--\nWHO--to better address international health for women and children.\n  Mass General has also made important strides in primary care, \nespecially for our State's seniors. The Mass General Geriatric Medicine \nUnit is rated one of the top departments in the nation for geriatric \ncare, due to their diverse staff of specialists, including those in \ngeriatric medicine, geriatric psychiatry, rehabilitation medicine, \ngeriatric nursing, and social work, who focus on both the patient's \nphysical and mental wellbeing.\n  Mass General is changing the way that we look at patient primary \ncare. You may be familiar with Patient Centered Medical Homes, which \nfocus on patient care and health in a very personalized and coordinated \nway. Mass General Senior Health is a recognized Level 3 Patient \nCentered Medical Home, which is setting the standard for the industry. \nI recently visited Mass General, and I am continually impressed by \ntheir coordination to bring together multiple doctors and services to \nensure the highest quality of care for Massachusetts residents.\n  I would also like to recognize the Mass General nursing staff, as the \nhospital is a designated Magnet hospital. This is the highest honor in \nnursing excellence that is awarded by the American Nurses Credentialing \nCenter, and recognizes Mass General's excellence and innovations in \ntheir nursing practice.\n  Finally, Mass General's Home Base Program has partnered with the \nBoston Red Sox Foundation to raise awareness about post-traumatic \nstress and traumatic brain injuries among our returning veterans. I am \nencouraged by their work to develop new treatments for these injuries, \nas well as their efforts to educate our community. Roughly 50,000 \nveterans returning from Iraq or Afghanistan are affected by these \ninjuries, and the Home Base Program is making great strides in \nsupporting these wounded warriors.\n  In closing, I congratulate Mass General Hospital for achieving the \nnumber one hospital ranking in the country. I know that the people of \nMassachusetts are extremely proud of this accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/18/senate-section/article/S5131-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5131-S5132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER WILLIAM MOELLER\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the tremendous \nlifetime of service by one of our Nation's most courageous heroes, CDR \nWilliam Moeller. Commander Moeller has served for 22 years in the Coast \nGuard in four location assignments, dedicating his time, energy, and \neven risking his life for his fellow servicemen and women, the U.S. \nCoast Guard, and his country. On September 1, 2012, he will retire from \nthe U.S. Coast Guard Reserve.\n  Upon graduation from the United States Coast Guard Academy in 1990 \nwith a B.S. in government, Commander Moeller began his career and his \nsea tour as a deck watch officer aboard the USCGC Tamaroa. He soon rose \nto first lieutenant and in this capacity led the rescue of four members \nof the Air National Guard in October 1991. This rescue among monstrous \nwaves, churned by the worst storm off the Eastern seaboard in 100 \nyears, captured the Nation's imagination in the book and later the film \nadaptation of ``The Perfect Storm.''\n  Following his commission as group captain, he transferred to reserve \nstatus at the Port Long Island Sound in New Haven. Promoted to \nlieutenant commander in the Marine Safety Office located in Portland, \nME, he served in the Coast Guard Reserve until recalled to active duty \nduring 9/11. Returning to reserve status and to the Sector Long Island \nSound, he was promoted to commander in 2006. After a few years at \nActivities New York, he returned to New Haven in 2010 for the last time \nas reserve logistics section chief. Commander Moeller's dedicated \nprotection of the Nation, most of which took place at the Long Island \nSound--waters significant to Connecticut and the Eastern seaboard--is \nappreciated by millions.\n  In addition to receiving extensive military recognition--including \nthe Coast Guard Medal for Extraordinary Heroism, the Coast Guard \nCommendation Medal, and the Air Force Commendation Medal--Commander \nMoeller has been awarded the Coast Guard Medal by President George W. \nBush. In\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\nApril 2012, he was inducted as a member of the Coast Guard Academy's \nWall of Gallantry.\n  Commander Moeller has further contributed to our Nation's safety and \nsecurity as a business executive with Pratt & Whitney. In this \ncapacity, he has furthered the development of the aerospace industry, \ncommitted to our national defense by both air and sea.\n  I invite my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Commander \nMoeller on his retirement and remarkable allegiance to the Coast Guard \nand his country. We wish him great success and thank him for his \ntremendous service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/18/senate-section/article/S5132-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING RICHARD EARDLEY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nDick Eardley, who will be remembered as a man who cared deeply about \nhis loved ones and community and worked hard to make a difference on \ntheir behalf.\n  As mayor for more than a decade, he was the longest serving mayor of \nBoise and was successful in enriching the city. During his time as \nmayor, he focused on revitalizing the city and worked extensively with \nbusiness and community leaders to draw more commerce into downtown \nBoise. Those efforts led later to both a vibrant downtown core and to \nthe development of the Boise Towne Square Mall, preservation of Boise's \nhistoric North End, creation of the Boise Arts Commission and bringing \nthe World Center for Birds of Prey to Boise. He was also involved in \nmany other local advancements, including the Greenbelt, the Senior \nCitizens Center, the parks, and Warm Springs Golf Course.\n  In addition to his public service, Dick had a career as a newsman. In \nhis hometown of Baker City, OR, Dick worked in radio before moving to \nIdaho, where he went to work as a reporter covering sports and news for \nthe Idaho Statesman. He then went on to work for KBOI-Channel 2 and \nKBOI-670. He announced high school sports and worked as a sportscaster \nand news executive. His reporting and work as city councilman and mayor \nearned many honors and recognitions.\n  Dick was an extraordinary individual who moved forward from a modest, \nDepression-era beginning in pursuit of his dreams. He had an \nexceptional way of connecting with people, which is likely why he had \nso many friends and acquaintances who admired and respected him. He had \na deep love and devotion for his wife, Pat, of 57 years, who passed \naway 5 years ago, and he was a caring, giving and supportive father. \nDick was also a natural athlete, who played semi-pro baseball and was \nknown for his fondness and knack for golf.\n  I extend my condolences to Dick's loved ones, including his three \nsons, Randy, Rick and Ron; six grandchildren, and two great-\ngrandchildren. Dick's example of respectful sincere, humble, benevolent \nservice and hard work will endure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/18/senate-section/article/S5132-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GARDEN CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Garden \nCity, SD. The town of Garden City will commemorate the 125th \nanniversary of its founding this year.\n  Located in Clark County, Garden City was first settled in 1882. \nHowever, it was not until 1887 that the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul \nRailroad line was built and sparked the official establishment of the \ntown. By the end of 1887, Garden City had a post office, a railroad \ndepot, and a grocery and hardware business. In the years that followed, \nGarden City became an agricultural center for the area, especially for \npotatoes. The first potato crop in the Garden City area was planted in \nthe early 1900s. By the 1940s, half a million bushels of potatoes were \nbeing harvested from the area each year.\n  South Dakotans living in the Garden City area have a proud tradition \nof hard work and remain committed to their strong heritage and \ntraditions. Though many things have changed in the last 125 years, the \nquality of character of Garden City residents has remained something of \nwhich the town should be very proud.\n  Garden City has been a tight-knit community for the past 125 years, \nand I am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of \nSouth Dakota values and hospitality. I would like to offer my \ncongratulations to the citizens of Garden City on this landmark \noccasion and wish them prosperity in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/18/senate-section/article/S5132-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/18/senate-section/article/S5132-4", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/18/senate-section/article/S5132-5", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT WAS \n      ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13581 ON JULY 24, 2011--PM 57\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin the 90-day period prior to the anniversary date of its \ndeclaration, the President publishes in the Federal Register and \ntransmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to \ncontinue in effect beyond the anniversary date.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \na national campaign to increase public awareness and knowledge of \nCongenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with my friend and able colleague, Senator Ben Cardin of \nMaryland, that would create a national campaign at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to bring attention to congenital \ndiaphragmatic hernia.\n  What is CDH? It is a birth defect that occurs when the fetal \ndiaphragm fails to fully develop, allowing abdominal organs to migrate \nup into the chest.\n  This invasion of organs--including the bowel, stomach, spleen, and \nliver--may severely limit the growth of a baby's lungs.\n  Regrettably, some have recommended terminating the pregnancy when a \nwoman learns that her unborn child has CDH.\n  This is an important issue, and makes promoting awareness of this \nbirth defect and the positive outcomes of good treatment especially \nimportant.\n  CDH will normally be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound as early as the \n16th week of pregnancy. That is important. If undiagnosed before birth, \nthe baby may be born in a facility that is not equipped to treat its \ncompromised respiratory system because many CDH babies need to be \nplaced on a heart-lung bypass machine, which is not available in many \nhospitals.\n  The lungs of a baby with CDH are often too small, biochemically \nimmature, structurally immature, and the flow in the blood vessels may \nbe constricted, resulting in pulmonary hypertension.\n  As a result, the babies are intubated as soon as they are born, and \nparents are often unable to hold their babies for weeks or even months \nat a time.\n  Most babies are repaired with surgery 1 to 5 days after birth, \nusually with a GORE-TEX patch. The abdominal organs that have migrated \ninto the chest are put back where they are supposed to be and the hole \nin the diaphragm is closed, hopefully allowing the affected lungs to \nexpand. However, hospitalization often ranges from 3 to 10 weeks, \ndepending on the severity of the condition.\n  Survivors often have difficulty feeding, some require a second \nsurgery to control reflux, others require a feeding tube, and a few \nwill reherniate and require additional repair.\n  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect that occurs in 1 \nout of every 2,500 babies. Every 10 minutes a baby is born with CDH, \nadding up to more than 600,000 babies with CDH since just 2000. CDH is \na severe, sometimes fatal defect that occurs as often as cystic \nfibrosis and spina bifida. Yet most people have never heard of CDH.\n  In my opinion, awareness and early diagnosis and skilled treatment \nare the keys to a greater survival rate in these babies. Fifty percent \nof the babies born with CDH do not to survive.\n  In 2009, my grandson, Jim Beau, now 2\\1/2\\ years old, was diagnosed \nwith CDH during my daughter Mary Abigail's 34th week of pregnancy. \nAlthough she had both a 20-week and a 30-week ultrasound, the nurses \nand doctors did not catch the disease on the baby's heartbeat monitor. \nThankfully, when Mary Abigail and her Navy officer husband Paul and \ndaughter Jane Ritchie moved to southeast Georgia, the baby's irregular \nheartbeat was heard at her first appointment with her new OB.\n  She was sent to Jacksonville, FL, for a fetal echo. The technician \nthere told her she wasn't going to do the echo because there was \nsomething else wrong with the baby. She asked my daughter if she had \never heard of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Of course, Mary Abigail \nhad not, and at that time our family did not know of this problem or \nthe extent of our grandson's birth defect.\n  The Navy temporarily allowed my daughter and her family to move to \nGainesville, FL on November 16, and Jim Beau was born 2 weeks later on \nNovember 30. They heard their son cry out twice after he was born, \nright before they intubated him, but they were not allowed to hold him.\n  The doctors let his little lungs get strong before they did the \nsurgery to correct the hernia, when he was 4 days old. As it turned \nout, the hole in his diaphragm was large, and his intestines, spleen, \nand one kidney had moved up into his chest cavity. Thankfully, Jim Beau \ndid not have to go on a heart-lung bypass machine, but he was on a \nventilator for 12 days and on oxygen for 36. In total, he was in the \nNICU--the neonatal intensive care unit--for 43 days before he was able \nto go home, all under the constant watch of his angel mother. I could \nnot have been prouder of her. She and Paul were wonderful during this \ntime.\n  This country has superb health care--the world's best. Without even \nour knowledge, this young Navy family had their unborn child diagnosed \nand sent to a university hospital three hours away the University of \nFlorida's Shands Hospital.\n  Fortunately for my family, and for thousands of other similar \nfamilies across the United States, there are a number of physicians \ndoing incredible work to combat CDH. By chance, the University of \nFlorida's Shands Children's Hospital is surely one of the world's \nbest--maybe the best. The CDH survival rate at Shands in Gainesville is \nunprecedented. The survival rate of CDH babies born at Shands is being \nreported at 80 to 90 percent, while the nationwide average is 50 \npercent.\n  Dr. David Kays, who directs the CDH program and who was the physician \nfor my grandson's surgery, is a magnificent surgeon and physician. He \nuses gentle ventilation therapy as opposed to hyperventilation. Gentle \nventilation therapy, he has discovered over the years, is less \naggressive and therefore protects the underdeveloped lungs. Jim Beau, I \nhave to say, is a wonderful little boy, full of energy and enthusiasm. \nHe is active and happy--one of the most happy young children I have \never seen--and so quick to smile.\n  This weekend, he attended his big sister Jane Ritchie's 5 year \nbirthday party and he was totally happy and running around, climbing \nover all the playground equipment, with the older children just as \nthough he was one of them. He thought he was in high cotton to be \nplaying with these big boys and girls.\n  While the challenges are many, so are the successes with this \ncondition. Every year more is learned and there are more successes. My \nfamily has been very lucky that Jim Beau's defect was caught before he \nwas born and that he was able to go to the right place--a first-rate \nplace--to seek excellent care for his CDH.\n  The bill Senator Cardin and I are introducing today is important \nbecause a national campaign for CDH will help bring awareness to this \nbirth defect and save lives, I am convinced of it. Although hundreds of \nthousands of babies have been diagnosed with this defect, the causes \nare unknown and more research is needed. The thousands of happy, \ngrowing children who have overcome this condition validates what\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\nhas been accomplished to date and encourages us to do even more.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and my friend and colleague Senator \nCardin in supporting this bill to bring awareness of CDH to the world. \nI think it will create many more happy and healthy young people in the \nyears to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Enzi, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Thune, Mr. Burr, Mr. Kyl, \n        and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 3397. A bill to prohibit waivers relating to compliance with the \nwork requirements for the program of block grants to States for \ntemporary assistance for needy families, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I introduce the Preserving Work \nRequirements Act of 2012. Chairman Camp of the House Committee on Ways \nand Means will introduce a companion measure in the House. This bill \nhalts last week's unprecedented power grab from the Obama \nadministration, whereby unelected bureaucrats unilaterally granted \nthemselves the authority to waive Federal welfare work requirements.\n  To put this another way, unelected bureaucrats ignored the law passed \nby Congress, the elected representatives of the American people. They \nignored the work requirements intended by Congress and by the \nPresidents of both parties who signed welfare reform and its subsequent \nreauthorizations.\n  Ultimately, they decided they knew better than the American people. \nThe American people, through their representatives, enacted work \nrequirements in welfare reform. These unelected administrators decided \nthey did not like these work requirements, so with the stroke of a pen, \nthey have attempted to eliminate them. Not to put too fine a point on \nit, but this action is fundamentally illegitimate in a Democratic \nRepublic and is just the latest example of President Obama's \nadministration acting without legal warrant when the law stands in \ntheir way.\n  The Camp-Hatch bill, introduced today, is cosponsored in the Senate \nby my friends and colleagues, Leader McConnell and Senators Grassley, \nKyl, Crapo, Roberts, Enzi, Cornyn, Coburn, Thune, and Burr--valuable \nand distinguished members of the Senate Finance Committee.\n  This bill includes dispositive findings clearly demonstrating that \nthe Obama administration acted outside the scope of the law and the \nclear intent of Congress. I would like to stress the fact that I am \nintroducing this legislation because I believe the Obama administration \ngrossly undermined the constitutional authority of the legislative \nbranch to effect changes and settle the law.\n  It does not mean I believe the 1996 law is perfect in every way and \ncannot be improved upon. That could not be further from the truth. A \ncase could be made that due to prolonged inaction the TANF Programs, \nthe Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Programs, have withered on \nthe vine, and now many States see TANF as a funding stream rather than \na welfare program.\n  An exception to this is my State of Utah. Utah runs a gold standard \nwelfare program which focuses, like a laser, on work. By work, I mean \nreal work, as in a paying job; work as most Americans define work, not \nwork as defined in the ``Alice in Wonderland'' world of TANF, where \nrunning errands, smoking cessation, and bed rest count as work. Utah \nwould like some relief--I think a lot of other States, in addition to \nUtah, would like some relief--from a number of administrative \nprocedures in order to focus even more vigorously to moving welfare \nclients to jobs. This is a very reasonable proposition, especially if \ncombined with a robust evaluation of the success of moving clients into \nwork.\n  I do not want the introduction of this legislation to prevent the \nObama administration from bypassing Congress to imply that when \nCongress does take up the reauthorization of the TANF Programs, that I \nwill not be open to giving States flexibility in exchange for results. \nThe fact remains that this administration and the Democratically \ncontrolled Senate could have made welfare reform a priority for several \nyears. They did not. For the administration to be arguing now that they \nneed to give States flexibility under TANF rules is so urgent the need \nto bypass Congress right this very minute does not pass the laugh test.\n  I am going to do everything I can to stop the administration from \ngoing forward with its waiver scheme. Then we should roll up our \nsleeves and take a good, honest look at how welfare reform has been \nworking for the past 16 years.\n  Domestic social policy is rarely permanently settled. Things change; \npeople change. A law that is more than halfway through its second \ndecade can most assuredly be updated and improved. That is why we have \nreauthorizations. I do not view the Preserving Work Requirements for \nWelfare Programs Act of 2012 as the end of the debate on how best to \nget families out of poverty. In fact, I see it as the beginning of what \nI hope will be a thoughtful and deliberative discussion of these \ncritical issues.\n  Finally, some in the press have attempted to characterize this \ndebate, which at its heart is one of Executive overreach as a standoff \nbetween me and my own home State of Utah. As they say in the country, \nthat dog just won't hunt. I have consistently supported State \nflexibility in exchange for measurable outcomes. One of the few pieces \nof domestic social policy legislation that has actually been enacted \nduring this session of Congress, Public Law 112-34, was authored by \nChairman Baucus and me to provide States with waivers to improve \noutcomes in their child welfare systems. Utah has applied for one of \nthese child welfare waivers. As Casey Stengel said: You can look it up.\n  I worked very hard back in the middle 1990s to get welfare reform \npassed. We required a work part of that. We said: We are going to help \nyou folks. We are going to subsidize you, we are going to give you help \nfinancially, but at the end of a certain period of time, you better \nhave a job. The work clauses of that bill have helped millions of \npeople to get jobs and get the self-esteem that comes from working and \nsupporting themselves. To have this administration unilaterally, and \nwithout any congressional authorization, modify that work requirement \nis just plain wrong.\n  Frankly, I will be for flexibility in the work requirement, but I \ndon't consider bed rest work. We can list 10 or 15 other things that \nthe administration has been talking about that don't qualify for work \neither.\n  This is an important issue. I hope the Congress will stand up for \nitself and let this administration know there is a limit to what we are \ngoing tolerate from an Executive order standpoint.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (by request):\n  S. 3398. A bill to provide for several critical National Park Service \nauthorities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last month the Department of the \nInterior transmitted two draft legislative proposals relating to the \nNational Park Service. Both executive communications were referred to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  The first legislative proposal, the National Park Service Critical \nAuthorities Act of 2012, would address three National Park Service \nmanagement concerns. The second proposal, the National Park Service \nStudy Act of 2012, would authorize the Park Service to undertake or \nupdate fifteen special resource studies to determine the \nappropriateness of adding the study areas to the National Park System.\n  I am pleased to introduce these bills, S. 3398 and S. 3399, by \nrequest as a courtesy to the Administration. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the transmittal letters from the Secretary of \nthe Interior, including a section-by-section analysis of each bill, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2012.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft of a bill entitled, \n     ``National Park System Critical Authorities Act of 2012.'' \n     Also enclosed is a section-by-section analysis of the bill.\n       We recommend that the bill be introduced, referred to the \n     appropriate committee for consideration, and enacted.\n       This proposal is needed to resolve three specific National \n     Park Service issues that are of critical concern. Enactment \n     of this legislation would promote more effective and \n     efficient government operations. None of the three measures \n     would result in costs to the federal government, other than \n     very nominal costs.\n       These new authorities address:\n       District of Columbia Snow Removal: The proposal amends a \n     1922 law by requiring federal agencies in the District to be \n     responsible for the removal of snow and ice in the public \n     areas associated with their buildings. Although federal \n     agencies have assumed responsibility for snow removal at \n     their respective sites, the language in the 1922 law \n     specifies that the National Park Service is responsible. \n     Enactment of this provision would eliminate a longstanding \n     legal liability burden for the National Park Service.\n       George Washington Memorial Parkway: The proposal authorizes \n     the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) and the National \n     Park Service to exchange lands along the George Washington \n     Memorial Parkway. Currently, the Service has a written \n     agreement with the FHA permitting public access to the Claude \n     Moore Historical Farm. Land exchange authority would allow \n     for a permanent guarantee of visitor access to the site as \n     well as the ability to increase security at the FHA's Turner-\n     Fairbank Highway Research Center and the Central Intelligence \n     Agency complex adjacent to the farm.\n       Uniform Penalties for Violations on Park Service Lands: The \n     inclusion of a number of military and historic sites into the \n     National Park System during the 1930's created \n     inconsistencies in the penalties used for violations at \n     various parks. This disparity in penalties undermines fair \n     and effective law enforcement and criminal prosecution. This \n     proposal would eliminate these inconsistencies in federal \n     penalties for crimes committed in certain park units.\n       The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 provides that \n     revenue and direct spending legislation cannot, in the \n     aggregate, increase the on-budget deficit. If such \n     legislation increases the on-budget deficit and that increase \n     is not offset by the end of the Congressional session, a \n     sequestration must be ordered. This proposal would affect \n     revenues, but the effects of this proposal would net to zero; \n     therefore, it is in compliance with the Statutory PAYGO Act.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the attached draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ken Salazar.\n       Enclosures.\n\n   National Park System Critical Authorities Act of 2012 Section-by-\n                            Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1: Provides a short title, ``National Park System \n     Critical Authorities Act of 2012''.\n       Section 2: Amends ``An Act providing for the removal of \n     snow and ice from the paved sidewalks of the District of \n     Columbia'' by directing federal agencies in the District to \n     be responsible for snow and ice removal in public areas in \n     front of or adjacent to their managed properties.\n       Section 3: Authorizes an exchange of land between the \n     National Park Service and the Federal Highway Administration. \n     The exchange would allow for permanent access to the Claude \n     Moore Colonial Farm, part of the George Washington Memorial \n     Parkway, and for improved security at the Turner-Fairbank \n     Highway Research Center and the Central Intelligence Agency's \n     Langley Headquarters.\n       Section 4: Amends the Act of March 2, 1933, to make \n     violations occurring in various park sites consistent with \n     the penalties set out in 16 U.S.C. 3 and 18 U.S.C. 3571.\n       Section 5: Authorizes appropriations to carry out this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2012.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft of a bill entitled. \n     the ``National Park Service Study Act of 2012.'' Also \n     enclosed is a section-by-section analysis of the bill.\n       We recommend that the bill be introduced, referred to the \n     appropriate committee for consideration, and enacted.\n       This proposed legislation would authorize the National Park \n     Service to conduct several studies of areas and themes that \n     merit consideration. The studies would include:\n       Kau Coast--Adjacent to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, the \n     area includes more than 20,000 acres along 27 miles of the \n     spectacular Kau Coast on the south side of the island of \n     Hawaii. A reconnaissance survey completed in 2006 found the \n     area contains significant natural, geological, and \n     archeological features including both black and green sand \n     beaches as well as a significant number of endangered and \n     threatened species, most notably the endangered hawksbill \n     turtle. It also exhibits some of the best remaining examples \n     of native coastal vegetation in Hawaii.\n       Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands--Rota \n     was the only major island in the Mariana Archipelago to be \n     spared the destruction and large-scale land use changes \n     brought about by World War II and its aftermath. The best \n     remaining examples of this island chain's native limestone \n     forest are found on Rota. Rota is also regarded as the \n     cultural home of the indigenous Chamorro people and contains \n     the most striking and well-preserved examples of their three \n     thousand-year old culture.\n       Aleut Relocation and Confinement--Nine sites in the State \n     of Alaska are associated with the forced relocation of the \n     Aleut people by the United States during World War II. Unlike \n     the internment of Japanese-Americans during the war, the \n     forced evacuation and confinement of Alaska natives is little \n     known but equally poignant and historically significant. Four \n     Unangan villages were left behind in the evacuations and \n     never permanently resettled. Residents of the villages of \n     Biorka, Kashega, and Makushin, all in the Unalaska Island \n     area, were removed and taken to southeast Alaska. Residents \n     of Attu were taken by Japanese soldiers to an internment camp \n     on Hokkaido, Japan for the duration of the war.\n       Japanese American Relocation Camps--Japanese Americans were \n     forced into 10 internment and relocation camps in the \n     contiguous United States by the U.S. Government during World \n     War II. The special resource study proposed by this \n     legislation would look at seven camps where the extant \n     resources remain without National Park Service protection: \n     Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming; Gila River and \n     Poston in Arizona; Grenada in Colorado; Jerome and Rohwer in \n     Arkansas; and Topaz in Utah.\n       American Latino Heritage in the San Luis Valley and Central \n     Sangre de Cristo Mountains--The San Luis Valley represents \n     the northernmost expansion of the Spanish Colonial and \n     Mexican frontiers into North America. Here at the edge of the \n     southern Rocky Mountains, the legacy of this Latino \n     settlement is still clearly evident. A reconnaissance survey \n     conducted in 2011 identified a distinctive and exceptional \n     concentration of historic resources associated with Latino \n     settlement, including Colorado's oldest documented town, only \n     communal pasture, first water right, and oldest church, and \n     called for further study.\n       Goldfield--Goldfield is a historic mining community in \n     southwestern Nevada. A reconnaissance survey completed in \n     2009 found the site contained nationally significant \n     resources, and recommended that a special resource study be \n     completed. The study would include extensive public \n     involvement with local landowners, government agencies, area \n     businesses and non-profit organizations. It would examine a \n     wide range of public and private options for the future \n     protection and interpretation of the Goldfield site in \n     relation to the mining history of the United States and the \n     State of Nevada.\n       Hudson River Valley--The Hudson River Valley in New York is \n     known for its unique natural resources, its archeological \n     remains documenting 6,000 years of human occupation, and its \n     history as the river that revolutionized a new method of \n     waterborne transportation--the steamboat. It also provides \n     recreational opportunities to millions of residents. The area \n     may provide an opportunity to explore a new prototype of \n     landscape scale protection in an urban, suburban and rural \n     setting through the combination of potential unit designation \n     and a Federal, state and local cooperative effort to protect \n     non-federally owned natural and historic resources.\n       Norman Studios--Norman Studios was a silent movie \n     production house in Jacksonville, Florida during the 1920s \n     specializing in what were then known as ``race films.'' These \n     films used African American writers and actors to create \n     entertainment for an African American audience, portraying \n     African Americans in realistic terms rather than the \n     caricatures and stereotypes commonly found in Hollywood films \n     of that era. On the basis of a reconnaissance survey \n     completed in 2010, the National Park Service concluded that a \n     special resource study of the Norman Studios site is \n     warranted.\n       Mobile-Tensaw River Delta--This delta, in southern Alabama, \n     is the second largest delta in the United States, after the \n     Mississippi River Delta, and is considered the best remaining \n     delta ecosystem of its kind in the country. At 40 miles long \n     and 6 to 16 miles wide, it contains 300 square miles of flood \n     plains, cypress-gum swamps, tidal marshes, and bottomland \n     forests. The Delta is ecologically rich, supporting 126 \n     species of fish, 46 species of mammals, 99 species of \n     reptiles and amphibians, and over 300 species of birds. It \n     was designated as a national natural landmark in 1974 and has \n     more than 100,000 contiguous acres of Federal and state \n     property.\n       Galveston Bay--Galveston Bay is the largest, most \n     biologically productive estuary along the Texas Gulf coast. \n     The shallow bay's 600 square miles (384,000 acres) of open \n     water, freshwater and tidal marshes, seagrass meadows, and \n     oyster reefs are surrounded by bottomland forest and prairie \n     wetland and are home to over 1,800 pairs of\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\n     endangered brown pelicans. The bay produces more oysters than \n     any other body of water in the United States, and yields \n     about one third of Texas' commercial fishing harvest. Dredged \n     shipping channels cross the bay to the busy port of Houston. \n     The east and west lobes of the bay adjoin the Anahuac and \n     Brazaria National Wildlife Refuges, which together protect \n     over 77,000 acres of habitat.\n       Peleliu--A special resource study of the World War II \n     Peleliu battlefield was completed in 2003. The study found \n     that the Peleliu battlefield met significance and suitability \n     criteria but the village clans who claim ownership of the \n     lands would consider setting aside only a small portion as a \n     battlefield site. The area was considerably smaller than that \n     identified by the NPS as the minimum area for which a \n     determination of feasibility could be made. There has been a \n     substantial shift in support by the local people for the site \n     becoming a unit of the National Park System and an updated \n     study would allow a reexamination of the feasibility issue.\n       Vermejo Park Ranch--A special resource study of the Vermejo \n     Park Ranch in New Mexico and Colorado was completed in 1979, \n     and concluded that the ranch possessed nationally significant \n     cultural and natural resources that merited inclusion in the \n     National Park System. Thirty-two years have elapsed since the \n     special resource study and several significant changes to the \n     ranch have occurred during the interim. A recent \n     reconnaissance survey recommended an update of the 1979 study \n     to determine whether this area still meets the criteria for \n     addition to the National Park System.\n       Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks--In the early years \n     of the National Parks, the Buffalo Soldiers were the \n     forerunners of today's park rangers, patrolling the \n     backcountry, building trails, and stopping poaching. The \n     study would evaluate the suitability and feasibility of \n     establishing a national historic trail commemorating the \n     route traveled by the Buffalo Soldiers from their post in the \n     Presidio of San Francisco to Sequoia and Yosemite National \n     Parks. It would also identify sites that could be further \n     evaluated for listing on the National Register of Historic \n     Places and for designation as National Historic Landmarks.\n       Reconstruction Era in the South--A National Historic \n     Landmark theme study would identify sites that are \n     significant to the Reconstruction era in the south. It was a \n     controversial and difficult period in American history \n     characterized by the adoption of new constitutional \n     amendments and laws, the establishment of new institutions, \n     and the occurrence of significant political events all \n     surrounding the efforts to reincorporate the South into the \n     Union and to provide newly freed slaves with political rights \n     and opportunities to improve their lives. The theme study \n     would include recommendations for the nomination of any new \n     National Historic Landmarks, and sites which merit further \n     study for potential inclusion in the National Park System.\n       Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area--A study of a \n     boundary expansion for the Chattahoochee River National \n     Recreation Area is proposed for an area extending \n     approximately 45 miles from the southern boundary of the \n     existing National Recreation Area south to the junction of \n     Coweta, Heard, and Carroll Counties. These areas along the \n     Chattahoochee River corridor include several state and county \n     parks.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the attached draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ken Salazar.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNET (for himself and Mr. Udall of Colorado):\n  S. 3400. A bill to designate certain Federal land in the San Juan \nNational Forest in the State of Colorado as wilderness, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about \nColorado. This summer, most people have been thinking about the \nwildfires we have had up there. These fires were widespread throughout \nthe State, and it is still just the beginning of fire season. We have \nalready seen a lot of damage, including the destruction of hundreds of \nhomes, and, most sadly, the loss of life.\n  I wish to say in this Chamber, to all my colleagues, how much I \nappreciate their kindness. The knowledge that all of you have been \nthinking about people at home has been very comforting to the people I \nrepresent. Thanks to the heroic work of the firefighters, and with a \nlot of help also from Mother Nature, the fires are under control. So I \nwish to remind people, as I have been doing now for months, that \nColorado is the best place to visit during the summer. It is the best \nplace to bring your family.\n  In fact, last week--or during the recess--Susan and I loaded up the \nminivan and drove across the State with our kids. It takes all the fun \nout of playing the license plate game when you are driving in Colorado \nbecause in about 2 hours the kids saw half the license plates \nrepresenting half the States in the United States--just 2 hours from \nDenver, CO. So I would say, as I have said time and time again, over \nthe coming months, if you have plans to come to our State, please do.\n  Today, I wish to focus on one area that illustrates how special our \nState of Colorado is.\n  The Hermosa Creek watershed is a beautiful parcel of land just up the \nroad from Durango in the southwest corner of our State.\n  Over 4 years ago, an incredibly diverse group of local citizens, \nmountain bikers, fishermen, outfitters, local elected officials, and \nothers got together to talk about the future of this striking land. \nEverybody involved likes to visit the area for recreation or to do \nbusiness there. Their discussion was about how to put together a plan \nfrom the local level up to manage the area so everyone could enjoy it \nand benefit, and so that we could protect it for the next generations \nof Coloradans and the next generations of Americans.\n  A little over a year ago, the group invited my family and me to take \na hike through the watershed and join the discussion. During a tour \nover the last Memorial Day weekend, we unloaded at the Hermosa Creek \ntrailhead, we tied up our boots, and my youngest daughter Anne made a \nhiking stick out of a nearby fallen branch. We started up the trail \nwith 40 or so others from the local community.\n  As we climbed higher and higher, we were all overcome by the beauty. \nPeople stopped talking. I stopped talking largely because I was out of \nbreath. But the people I was with were as awestruck as I was by the \nbeauty of this place. It was a particularly settling walk after being \ncooped up with my children.\n  There are forested valleys, crystal-clear streams, and unspoiled \nviews. After about an hour, the group pulled off the Forest Service \ntrail into a meadow. And as Anne, Helena, and Caroline Bennet made \nthemselves and their father and mother dandelion necklaces, we started \na discussion about what this area means to the people who live there \nand the people who visit. The sportsmen come to fish for native \nColorado cutthroat trout and for back-country elk hunting. The mountain \nbikers come to enjoy single-track riding on trails known throughout the \nUnited States of America, and actually in other countries as well. The \nlocal water districts love Hermosa because it provides drinking water \nfor the great city of Durango. Workers in the timber and mining \nindustries stress that some of the watershed could contribute to \nextractive development in the future. Some might not know that mining \nhas long been an economic driver in that region of our State.\n  This is a photograph of the group that hiked that day. The upshot of \nthe discussion we had in that meadow was an agreement to work together \non a bill, a balanced bill that managed the watershed so it would \ncontribute to the local economy long into the future. After nearly 14 \nmonths of discussions and negotiations since that hike, I introduced \nthat bill earlier today.\n  The Hermosa Creek Watershed Protection Act governs the entire \n108,000-acre watershed. It includes provisions to allow for multiple \nuses, such as timber harvesting for forest health; access and trails \nfor off-road vehicle enthusiasts, and for mountain bikers.\n  It keeps getting better. The bill also adds nearly 40,000 acres to \nthe National Wilderness Preservation System, lands that provide unique \nand important opportunities for solitude and reflection, lands that \nwill remain undeveloped forever, so they will always have clear streams \nof fish and lush forests for a local outfitter to take clients into the \nwilderness on horseback.\n  I am proud to report the bill has the unanimous bipartisan backing of \nthe two county commissions involved, the San Juan County Commission and \nthe La Plata County Commission. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of letters of support from both counties.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\n\n\n\n                                              San Juan County,\n\n                                     Silverton, CO, June 27, 2012.\n     Sen. Michael F. Bennet,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennet: San Juan County is supportive of the \n     collaborative community process conducted by the Hermosa \n     Creek Workgroup. This was an open, inclusive process that has \n     brought together local citizens and organizations that are \n     concerned with protecting the special values of the Hermosa \n     Creek Watershed in San Juan and La Plata Counties in \n     southwest Colorado.\n       For more than two years the Hermosa Creek Workgroup worked \n     within the framework developed by the River Protection \n     Workgroup whose goal is ``Involving the public in protecting \n     the natural values of selected streams while allowing water \n     development to continue.''\n       As a result of this process, the Hermosa Creek Workgroup \n     determined that ``The Hermosa Creek Area is exceptional \n     because it is a large intact (unfragmented) natural watershed \n     containing diverse ecosystems, including fish, plants and \n     wildlife, over a road elevation range, and supports a variety \n     of multiple uses, including recreation and grazing, in the \n     vicinity of a large town.''\n       San Juan County supports the proposed Federal Legislation \n     for the Hermosa Creek Watershed Protection Act of 2012 and \n     respectfully requests that your office initiate a legislative \n     process to achieve the goals set forth by the Hermosa Work \n     Group.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Ernest F. Kuhlman,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n     San Juan County Commissioners.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              La Plata County,\n\n                                    Durango, CO, November 3, 2011.\n     Hon. Michael Bennet,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bennet: You recently released draft \n     legislation to protect the Hermosa Creek area just north of \n     Durango, and we wish to express our strong support for that \n     component of the legislation. We have previously supported \n     the work and recommendations of the Hermosa Creek Workgroup, \n     and believe that this draft accurately reflects those \n     recommendations.\n       The Board of Commissioners has followed the public process \n     conducted by the Hermosa Creek Workgroup since its beginning \n     over two years ago, and we believe that the process has been \n     open, transparent, and effective. Virtually every group with \n     an interest in the Hermosa watershed participated in the \n     discussions, which were constructive and well-facilitated.\n       The Hermosa Creek watershed is an invaluable resource for \n     La Plata County for a number of reasons. The recreational \n     opportunities the area offers, from hunting and fishing to \n     hiking, mountain biking, and skiing, are world class, and \n     contribute significantly to the County's recreation and \n     tourism economic base. Local outfitting businesses, hotels, \n     restaurants, gas stations, and gear shops all benefit from a \n     protected Hermosa Creek region.\n       With its Outstanding Waters designation by the State of \n     Colorado, Hermosa Creek provides a major clean water \n     contribution to the Animas River, which is the water source \n     for many of La Plata County's residents. As a source of clean \n     air and spectacular scenery, Hermosa Creek also plays a key \n     role in maintaining the natural amenities that make La Plata \n     County attractive to new residents and businesses.\n       The proposal to protect the Hermosa Creek watershed through \n     a special management designation, containing wilderness and \n     un-roaded designations for portions of the area, is truly a \n     community-based approach to local land management. We commend \n     you for respecting the hard work of the Hermosa Creek \n     Workgroup by including the group's recommendations in your \n     draft legislation. We support the legislation, and stand \n     ready to help in whatever way to see it enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kellie C. Hotter,\n       Chair.\n     Robert A. Lieb, Jr.,\n       Vice-Chair.\n     Wallace ``Wally'' White,\n       Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. It has the support of the Hermosa Creek Workgroup, \nranging from hard-rock miners to wilderness advocates. I am pleased to \ncarry this bill on behalf of the people of Colorado. I am especially \nproud because this was a community-driven process at its very finest, \nthrough and through, from beginning to end. Colorado wrote this bill. \nThis bill wasn't written in Washington, DC. The bill has grown from the \ngrassroots up, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents working \ntogether to cement a long-term plan for the community's future.\n  I also want to thank my senior Senator, Senator Udall of Colorado, \nfor joining me as a cosponsor of the bill, and to thank Senators \nBingaman and Murkowski for their past help moving Colorado land bills \nthrough their committee. I am confident that as we work on this bill \ntogether we will find similar consensus.\n  To bring this back to the beginning, I don't have to convince most \npeople that Colorado is a special place. Many have visited our State \nover their lifetimes to ski our mountains, run our rivers, or climb a \n``14er.'' The Hermosa Creek watershed represents some of the best \nColorado has to offer. It deserves to be protected for our outdoor \nrecreation economy, and for future generations.\n  I want to thank all of the people who have spent countless hours \nworking together to make sure they could overcome their differences and \nreach a consensus on this bill. As I have told all of them, it makes my \nwork so much easier when people work in such a constructive way \ntogether, and for that, they have my deep appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/18/senate-section/article/S5139-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2554.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans \nAffairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. \n1627.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1627) to amend title 38, United States Code, \n     to provide for certain requirements for the placement of \n     monuments in Arlington National Cemetery, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, I am pleased to speak in support of the Honoring America's \nVeterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012.\n  I thank my colleagues from the Veterans' Committee for their \ncontinuous support of our Nation's veterans--especially my ranking \nmember Senator\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\nBurr of North Carolina, for his steadfast advocacy of the government's \nresponsibility to provide health care for the veterans and family \nmembers stationed at Camp Lejeune.\n  In addition, I thank Representatives Jeff Miller and Bob Filner, the \nchairman and ranking Member of the House Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, for their hard work in developing this bipartisan, bicameral, \nand fully paid-for legislation.\n  With the passage of the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for \nCamp Lejeune Families Act of 2012, military families affected by \ncontaminated water at Camp Lejeune, NC, would have the health care they \nneed.\n  These families have waited for decades to get the assistance they \nneed, and they should not be forced to wait any longer.\n  The legislation would also allow the VA to continue a number of \nprograms that are so critical to helping veterans who have no place to \ncall home.\n  Currently, the VA can only provide emergency shelter to veterans who \nare diagnosed with a serious mental illness. But we all know not all \nhomeless veterans are mentally ill. Yet the VA is currently prevented \nfrom offering these critical services to all our veterans.\n  The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families \nAct of 2012 would also make much needed improvements to the VA's \nhousing programs by expanding the eligibility for the VA's specially \nadapted housing assistance grants.\n  These are some of the most disabled veterans in our Nation, and they \ndeserve to be able to move about in their homes freely and safely.\n  This bill will also help more veterans use telehealth and \ntelemedicine and allow veterans to receive travel assistance for visits \nto our vet centers. These provisions will especially help our veterans \nin rural and highly rural areas to access care from the VA.\n  It will also improve the way the VA reimburses State veterans homes \nfor the care of elderly, seriously disabled veterans.\n  I know every Member of the Senate has at least one State veterans \nhome in their State. Without this change, some of these homes may have \nto lay off staffers or be unable to accept more veterans, so it is a \nvery important provision of the bill.\n  This legislation will also require important policy changes to \nprotect veterans from sexual assault and other threats in the VA's \ninpatient mental health units and homeless programs.\n  Finally, we all know veterans continue to find themselves waiting \nentirely too long for a decision on their claims. This legislation will \naddress the claims backlog by providing the VA with the ability to \nprocess appeals much more quickly and by supporting the VA's \ntransformation to a paperless system. It will also make other needed \nimprovements to the claims system, such as ensuring surviving spouses \nreceive proper and timely benefit payments.\n  Above all, this bill fulfill's the responsibility this Nation has to \nprovide care and service to our veterans and their families. In the \ncase of those families who spent time at Camp Lejeune, this bill gives \nsick veterans and their families the benefit of the doubt their illness \nor condition was caused by the water at Camp Lejeune so they can \nfinally get the health care they need.\n  This is something Congress has done before. When an illness or \ncondition comes about after a veteran's service and any relationship \nbetween the veteran's current illness and their service is not readily \napparent, the burden of proving the illness is a result of one's \nservice can be insurmountable. In such circumstances, we have presumed \na veteran's exposure caused their current condition and got them the \nhelp they needed. We have lived up to the responsibility we owed them, \nwhich is in the core of this bill.\n  Many veterans and their families are waiting for the passage of this \nbill. Our House colleagues are ready and willing to move this forward \nquickly as well. We did have one concern from the Senator from South \nCarolina, Mr. DeMint. We had a very productive conversation, and we now \nhave that language resolved and have had a gentleman's agreement to \nmove the bill forward today.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from South Carolina for his work and \neffort to get this bill passed. I know our veterans and families across \nthe Nation are waiting.\n  I thank all our colleagues who have worked so hard on this very \ncritical piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Joint \nExplanatory Statement in relation to this bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Joint Explanatory Statement for Certain Provisions Contained in the \n                   Amendment to H.R. 1627, as Amended\n\n       The Amendment to H.R. 1627, as passed by the House on May \n     23, 2011, reflects a Compromise Agreement reached by the \n     House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs \n     (hereinafter, ``the Committees'') on provisions within the \n     following bills reported during the 112th Congress: H.R. \n     1627; S. 277; S. 914; S. 951; H.R. 802; H.R. 1484; H.R. 2074; \n     H.R. 2302; H.R. 2349; H.R. 2433; H.R. 4299; and several free-\n     standing provisions.\n       S. 277, as amended, was reported favorably out of the \n     Senate Committee on August 1, 2011; S. 914, as amended, was \n     reported favorably out of the Senate Committee on October 11, \n     2011; and S. 951, as amended, was reported favorably out of \n     the Senate Committee on July 18, 2011 (hereinafter, ``Senate \n     Bills''). H.R. 802, as amended, passed the House on June 1, \n     2011; H.R. 1484, as amended, passed the House on May 31, \n     2011; H.R. 2074, as amended, passed the House on October 11, \n     2011; H.R. 2302, as amended, passed the House on October 11, \n     2011; H.R. 2349, as amended, passed the House on October 11, \n     2011; and H.R. 2433, as amended, passed the House on October \n     12, 2011 (hereinafter, ``House Bills'').\n       The Committees have prepared the following explanation of \n     certain provisions contained in the amendment to H.R. 1627, \n     as amended, to reflect a Compromise Agreement between the \n     Committees. Differences between the provisions contained in \n     the Compromise Agreement and the related provisions of the \n     House Bills and the Senate Bills are noted in this document, \n     except for clerical corrections, conforming changes made \n     necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, \n     technical, and clarifying changes.\n\n                      Title I--Health Care Matters\n\n\n   HOSPITAL CARE AND MEDICAL SERVICES FOR VETERANS STATIONED AT CAMP \n                        LEJEUNE, NORTH CAROLINA\n\n     Current Law\n       In a few specific instances, Congress has acted to provide \n     benefits and health care to veterans who may have been \n     exposed to environmental hazards during their military \n     service. On a few occasions, Congress has extended health \n     care and benefits to the children of servicemembers and \n     veterans based on a concern that they were born more \n     susceptible to certain diseases or conditions because of a \n     parent's exposure to an in-service environmental hazard.\n     Senate Bill\n       S. 277, as amended, would provide health care benefits \n     through the Department of Veterans Affairs (hereinafter, \n     ``VA'' or ``the Department''), starting in fiscal year \n     (hereinafter, ``FY'') 2013, to certain veterans for any \n     illness that is attributable to the contaminated drinking \n     water on Camp Lejeune. The bill would provide health care \n     benefits to spouses and dependents of veterans for conditions \n     associated with exposure to the contaminated drinking water \n     on Camp Lejeune. The bill would also direct the Secretary of \n     the Department of Defense (hereinafter, ``DOD'') to transfer \n     funds to VA to cover the costs of the health care provided to \n     these veterans and their families. In order to pay for the \n     increase in funding for providing health care to veterans and \n     their families, the bill would decrease DOD spending by \n     consolidating its commissaries and exchanges.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 102 of the Compromise Agreement would provide \n     health care benefits through VA to certain veterans and \n     family members who lived aboard Camp Lejeune during the \n     period the drinking water was contaminated and have certain \n     illnesses or conditions. VA would reimburse family members \n     for health care services provided under this section as a \n     final payer to other third party health care plans. Similar \n     to the treatment, under current law, of other exposures, such \n     as Agent Orange and toxins from the Gulf War, the Compromise \n     Agreement includes language that health care may not be \n     provided to veterans or family members if that illness or \n     condition is found by VA to have resulted from a reason other \n     than residence of the family aboard Camp Lejeune. The \n     Compromise Agreement directs VA to report annually on the \n     number of veterans and family members who were provided \n     hospital care and medical services under the Compromise \n     Agreement; the illnesses, conditions, and disabilities for \n     which care and services were provided under the Compromise \n     Agreement; the number of veterans and family members who \n     applied for care and services under the Compromise Agreement \n     but were subsequently denied (including information on the\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\n     reasons for denial); and the number of veterans and family \n     members who applied for care and services and are awaiting a \n     decision from VA.\n       The Committees understand that it may take VA some time to \n     implement this section; however, the Committees anticipate \n     the process should be executed as expeditiously as possible \n     to enable eligible veterans and their family members to \n     receive needed care and medical services.\n\n\n    AUTHORITY TO WAIVE COLLECTION OF COPAYMENTS FOR TELEHEALTH AND \n                    TELEMEDICINE VISITS OF VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Pursuant to section 1710(g) of title 38, United States Code \n     (hereinafter, ``U.S.C.''), VA is required to collect \n     copayments from veterans, who are not otherwise exempted from \n     such copayments under section 1710(a) of title 38, U.S.C., \n     for medical services provided by VA.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 101 of S. 914, as reported, would amend subchapter \n     III of chapter 17 of title 38, U.S.C., by adding a new \n     section 1722B. The new section would authorize VA to waive \n     collections of copayments from veterans for the utilization \n     of telehealth or telemedicine.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 103 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill. The Committees expect that, despite the loss of \n     copayments, the resulting reduction in hospitalizations and \n     in the length of stay per hospitalization will allow VA to \n     deliver health care to veterans in a substantially more \n     efficient and cost-effective manner. In addition to this cost \n     avoidance, veterans' quality of life should increase through \n     more effective management of chronic medical conditions and \n     reduced time spent in medical facilities.\n\n\n TEMPORARY EXPANSION OF PAYMENTS AND ALLOWANCES FOR BENEFICIARY TRAVEL \n      IN CONNECTION WITH VETERANS RECEIVING CARE FROM VET CENTERS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 111 of title 38, U.S.C., authorizes VA to reimburse \n     beneficiaries for travel to VA facilities in connection with \n     care, subject to certain restrictions, at a rate of 41.5 \n     cents per mile.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 103 of S. 914, as reported, would clarify that VA \n     is authorized to pay travel benefits to veterans receiving \n     care at Vet Centers pursuant to existing authority under \n     section 111(a) of title 38, U.S.C. It would also require VA \n     to submit a report to Congress, no later than one year after \n     the enactment of the Senate Bill, on the feasibility and \n     advisability of paying travel benefits to veterans receiving \n     care at Vet Centers. Finally, this section of the Senate Bill \n     would authorize such sums as may be necessary be appropriated \n     for the Department to pay such expenses and allowances for \n     the one-year period following the enactment of the Senate \n     Bill.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 104 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill with a modification to limit the authority to a \n     temporary three-year expansion, and a modification that would \n     limit eligibility for reimbursement under the temporary \n     expansion to only veterans who live in highly rural areas. \n     The Committees note that Vet Centers offer valuable services \n     to veterans but those services are inaccessible to some \n     veterans living in highly rural areas. For instance, an \n     eligible individual living in Glasgow, Montana has to travel \n     five hours each way to receive care at the nearest Vet \n     Center, which is located in Billings, Montana. Another \n     example is an eligible individual living in Liberal, Kansas \n     has to travel four hours each way to receive care at the \n     nearest Vet Center, which is located in Wichita, Kansas.\n\n\n             CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS FOR NURSING HOME CARE\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1745(a)(1) of title 38, U.S.C., requires VA to pay \n     the cost of nursing home care in a State home to veterans in \n     need of such care due to a service-connected disability or \n     with a service-connected disability rated at 70 percent or \n     greater. Section 1745(a)(2) establishes such cost as the \n     lesser of either a prevailing rate determined by VA or the \n     actual cost of care in a State home. Section 1745(a)(3) \n     establishes that such payment shall constitute payment in \n     full.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 109 of S. 914, as reported, would require VA to \n     enter into contracts or agreements with State homes, based on \n     a methodology developed in consultation with State homes, to \n     pay for nursing home care provided to certain veterans with \n     service-connected disabilities, and would apply to care \n     provided on or after January 1, 2012.\n     House Bill\n       Section 3 of H.R. 2074, as amended, contains a similar \n     provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 105 of the Compromise Agreement generally reflects \n     this provision except the Compromise Agreement adjusts the \n     effective date from January 1, 2012, to the date 180 days \n     after the date of enactment. The Compromise Agreement also \n     includes a provision that would require VA, at the request of \n     a State home, to offer to enter into a contract or agreement \n     that replicates the reimbursement methodology that was in \n     effect on the day before enactment.\n       The Committees note that State homes are significantly \n     under compensated by the current reimbursement framework. VA \n     has been aware of and actively assisting with the development \n     of these provisions. The Committees expect VA to make the \n     negotiation and execution of these contracts a top priority--\n     and further expect that no State home will be without a \n     contract on the date that this provision goes into effect. \n     This includes the immediate development of the contract \n     language required under subsection (c)(2) of this section of \n     the Compromise Agreement.\n       The Committees further expect that VA and the State homes \n     will negotiate equitably and agree upon several elements of \n     all contracts or agreements under this section. First, that \n     reimbursement will be not only adequate but will also reflect \n     the reasonable cost of care provided. Second, that the \n     services for which VA will make reimbursement will be \n     mutually acceptable. Finally, that the contracts will provide \n     appropriately for updating, revising, or renegotiating the \n     contracts as payment rates or other circumstances change.\n\n\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY ON REPORTING AND TRACKING SEXUAL ASSAULT INCIDENTS \n                       AND OTHER SAFETY INCIDENTS\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no similar provision in current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 2074, as amended, would amend chapter 17 \n     of title 38, U.S.C., to require VA to develop, by March 1, \n     2012, a comprehensive policy on sexual assault and other \n     safety incidents to include the: (1) development of clear and \n     comprehensive criteria with respect to the reporting of \n     sexual assault incidents and other safety incidents for both \n     clinical personnel and law enforcement personnel; (2) \n     establishment of an accountable oversight system within VA to \n     report and track sexual assault incidents for all alleged or \n     suspected forms of abuse and unsafe acts; (3) systematic \n     information sharing of reported sexual assault incidents, and \n     a centralized reporting, tracking, and monitoring system to \n     ensure each case is fully investigated and victims receive \n     appropriate treatment; (4) use of specific ``risk assessment \n     tools'' to examine any danger related to sexual assault that \n     a veteran may pose while being treated, including clear \n     guidance on the collection of information relating to the \n     legal history of the veteran; (5) mandatory training of \n     employees on safety awareness and security; and (6) \n     establishment of physical security precautions including \n     appropriate surveillance and panic alarm systems that are \n     operable and regularly tested. This section of the House Bill \n     would also require VA to report to the Committees on the \n     development of the policy not later than 30 days after \n     enactment, and to report on the implementation of such policy \n     not later than 60 days after it is put in place and not later \n     than October 1 of each subsequent year.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 106 of the Compromise Agreement generally reflects \n     the House Bill but it modifies the date the comprehensive \n     policy is required to be in place from March 1, 2012, to \n     September 30, 2012. The Compromise Agreement also requires \n     VA, in developing the comprehensive policy and risk \n     assessment tools, to consider the effects on veterans' use of \n     mental health and substance abuse treatments, and the ability \n     of VA to refer veterans to such services.\n\n\n    REHABILITATIVE SERVICES FOR VETERANS WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY\n\n     Current Law\n       Sections 1710C and 1710D of title 38, U.S.C., direct VA to \n     provide comprehensive care in accordance with individualized \n     rehabilitation plans to veterans with traumatic brain injury \n     (hereinafter, ``TBI''). Although these sections of law do not \n     provide a definition of the word ``rehabilitation,'' the \n     phrase ``rehabilitative services'' is defined in section \n     1701(8) of title 38, U.S.C., for VA health-care purposes as \n     professional, counseling, and guidance services and treatment \n     programs that are necessary to restore, to the maximum extent \n     possible, the physical, mental, and psychological functioning \n     of an ill or disabled person.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 105 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     1710C of title 38, U.S.C., to include (1) the goal of \n     maximizing the individual's independence, and (2) improving \n     such veteran's behavioral functioning. Section 105 would also \n     require the inclusion of rehabilitative services in (1) a VA \n     comprehensive program of long-term care for veterans with \n     TBI, and (2) cooperative agreements for the use of non-VA \n     facilities for veterans' rehabilitation from TBI within a \n     program of individualized rehabilitation and reintegration \n     plans for veterans with TBI.\n     House Bill\n       Section 4 of H.R. 2074, as amended, contains a similar \n     provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 107 of the Compromise Agreement contains this \n     provision.\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\n                   TELECONSULTATION AND TELEMEDICINE\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no similar provision in current law.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 102(a) of S. 914, as reported, would amend \n     subchapter I of chapter 17 of title 38, U.S.C., by adding a \n     new section 1709, which would require VA to create a system \n     for consultation and assessment of mental health, TBI, and \n     other conditions through teleconsultation when a VA medical \n     facility is unable to do so independently.\n       Section 102(b) of the Senate Bill would require VA to offer \n     opportunities for training in telemedicine to medical \n     residents in facilities that have and utilize telemedicine, \n     consistent with medical residency program standards \n     established by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical \n     Education.\n       Section 102(c) of the Senate Bill would require VA to \n     modify the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation \n     (hereinafter, ``VERA'') system to include teleconsultation, \n     teleretinal imaging, telemedicine, and telehealth \n     coordination services. VA would also be required to assess, \n     within one year of modifying the VERA system, the effect on \n     the utilization of telehealth technologies and determine \n     whether additional incentives are necessary to promote their \n     utilization. VA would also be required to include \n     telemedicine visits when calculating facility workload.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 108 of the Compromise Agreement reflects \n     subsections (a) and (b) of the Senate Bill with a \n     modification to specify that the implementation of the \n     teleconsultation program does not preclude the referral of \n     veterans to third-party providers under VA's existing fee-\n     basis or contracting authority.\n\n\n USE OF SERVICE DOGS ON PROPERTY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 901 of title 38 authorizes VA to prescribe rules to \n     govern conduct on Department property, which is defined as \n     land and buildings under the Department's jurisdiction and \n     not under the control of the Administrator of General \n     Services. Section 1714(c) of title 38, U.S.C., authorizes VA \n     to provide service dogs to veterans who, in order of \n     precedence, are hearing impaired, have spinal cord injuries, \n     or are mentally ill.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 104 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     1714 of title 38, U.S.C., by adding a new subsection (e), \n     which would require VA to admit full access to all service \n     animals accompanying individuals at every VA facility \n     according to the same regulations that govern the admission \n     of the public to such facilities. The provision would apply \n     not only to service dogs as provided for in section 1714(c) \n     of title 38, U.S.C., but would also include trained service \n     animals that accompany individuals with disabilities not \n     specified by that subsection. Further, VA would be authorized \n     to prohibit service animals from roaming or running free and \n     to require the animals to wear harnesses or leashes and be \n     under the control of an individual at all times while at a \n     Department owned or funded facility.\n     House Bill\n       Section 5 of H.R. 2074, as amended, would amend section 901 \n     of title 38, U.S.C., by adding a new subsection (f), which \n     would prohibit VA from refusing to allow the use of service \n     dogs in any facility or on any property owned or funded by \n     the Department.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 109 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the House \n     Bill with a modification to specify that the provision \n     applies only to service dogs that have been trained by \n     entities that have been accredited for such work by an \n     appropriate accrediting entity.\n\n\n Recognition of rural health resource centers in office of rural HEALTH\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 7308 of title 38, U.S.C., establishes the Office of \n     Rural Health within the Office of the Under Secretary for \n     Health and sets the functions of such Office as: conducting, \n     coordinating, promoting, and disseminating research into \n     issues affecting rural veterans; working with all Department \n     personnel and offices to develop, refine, and promulgate \n     policies, best practices, lessons learned, and successful \n     programs to improve care and services for rural veterans; \n     designating a rural health coordinator within each Veterans \n     Integrated Service Network; and performing other duties as \n     appropriate.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 106(a) of S. 914, as reported, would create a new \n     section 7330B in title 38, U.S.C., which would require VA, \n     acting through the Director of the Office of Rural Health, to \n     establish and operate centers of excellence for rural health \n     research, education, and clinical activities.\n       Those centers would be required to perform one or more of \n     the following functions: collaborate with the Veterans Health \n     Administration's Office of Research and Development on rural \n     health research; develop specific models for the Department \n     to furnish care to rural veterans; develop innovative \n     clinical activities and systems of care for rural veterans; \n     and provide education and training on rural health issues for \n     health care professionals.\n       Section 106(b) of the Senate Bill would further amend title \n     38, U.S.C., by adding a new subsection (d) to section 7308, \n     which would codify the existence and describe the purposes of \n     rural health resource centers. Rural health resource centers \n     would be required to work to improve the Office of Rural \n     Health's understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans, \n     identify disparities in the availability of health care to \n     rural veterans, create programs to enhance the delivery of \n     health care to rural veterans, and develop best practices and \n     products for VA to use in providing services to rural \n     veterans.\n       Finally, section 106(c) of the Senate Bill would designate \n     the VA Medical Center (hereinafter, ``VAMC'') in Fargo, North \n     Dakota, as a center of excellence for rural health research, \n     education, and clinical activities.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 110 of the Compromise Agreement reflects section \n     106(b) of the Senate Bill.\n\n\n Improvements for recovery and collection of amounts for department of \n             veterans affairs medical care collections fund\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1729A of title 38, U.S.C., creates within the \n     Treasury the VA Medical Care Collections Fund (hereinafter, \n     ``MCCF'') in which amounts recovered or collected under \n     several VA collections authorities are to be deposited.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 111 of S. 914, as reported, would require VA to \n     develop and implement, within 180 days of enactment of the \n     Senate Bill, a plan to ensure accurate and full collections \n     by the VA health care system, pursuant to existing \n     authorities for billing and collections.

\n     or B) a disability due to blindness in both eyes, having \n     light perception plus the loss, or loss of use, of one lower \n     extremity; or C) a disability due to loss, or loss of use, of \n     one lower extremity with residuals of organic disease or the \n     loss, or loss of use, of one upper extremity that affects \n     balance or propulsion to preclude locomotion without the aid \n     of braces, crutches, canes or a wheelchair; or D) a \n     disability due to the loss, or loss of use, of both upper \n     extremities such as to preclude use of the arms at or above \n     the elbows; or E) a disability due to a severe burn injury, \n     is entitled to grant assistance for housing adaptations.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 201 of the Compromise Agreement would temporarily \n     add certain severe injuries and dismemberment disabilities \n     that affect ambulation to the eligibility criteria for the \n     specially adapted housing program under section 2101(a) of \n     title 38, U.S.C., for those veterans 1) who served on or \n     after September 11, 2001, and 2) became permanently disabled \n     on or after that same date. This expansion of authority would \n     expire on September 30, 2013, and require that VA receive \n     grant applications prior to that date in order to receive \n     consideration.\n       Because of advances in medical technology, many individuals \n     are surviving traumatic events which past generations of \n     military personnel were not able to survive. However, as a \n     result of these traumatic events, these individuals are left \n     with specific types of physical losses and injuries which \n     often affect their ability to ambulate without assistance. \n     For example, some individuals are returning from the current \n     conflicts with varying degrees of impairment that impact \n     mobility due to the loss or loss of use of one limb, such as \n     a single above the knee amputation.\n       The Committee intends that this provision assist those \n     individuals with balance problems resulting from traumatic \n     injuries that affect their ability to ambulate. The \n     Committees believe that there are numerous home adaptations \n     available which would maximize physical abilities and enhance \n     the quality of life for individuals with these types of \n     injuries. While these individuals would clearly benefit from \n     home adaptations, VA cannot assist these individuals with \n     home modifications because of existing statutory limitations. \n     Changes to these provisions are necessary in order for VA to \n     be responsive to the growing numbers of these different types \n     of injuries.\n       Some of these adaptations include: adding a new bathroom or \n     adapting existing bathroom fixtures with features such as \n     grab bars, bath transfer benches, or high-rise toilets; \n     providing non-slip flooring for balance-related issues; and \n     installing special kitchen and laundry appliances (with \n     locations and controls in optimal reach zone) to address \n     safety issues.\n\n\n Expansion of eligibility for specially adapted housing assistance for \n                    veterans with vision impairment\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, section 2101(b) of title 38, U.S.C., a \n     veteran with a permanent and total service-connected \n     disability due to blindness in both eyes has to have visual \n     acuity of 5/200 or less in order to qualify for certain \n     adaptive housing assistance grants.\n       According to the National Eye Institute, visual acuity is \n     defined as the eye's ability to distinguish object details \n     and shape with good contrast, using the smallest identifiable \n     object that can be seen at a specified distance. It is \n     measured by use of an eye chart and recorded as test \n     distance/target size. Visual acuity of 5/200 means that an \n     individual must be 5 feet away from an eye chart to see a \n     letter that an individual with normal vision could see from \n     200 feet.\n       While VA had used the 5/200 or less standard of visual \n     acuity for blindness over the last several decades, a \n     consensus definition of what constitutes ``legal blindness'' \n     has emerged.\n       This consensus definition is the statutory definition used \n     for the Social Security disability insurance program and the \n     Supplemental Security Income program and is less stringent \n     than VA's standard, encompassing individuals with lesser \n     degrees of vision impairment. The American Medical \n     Association has espoused this definition since 1934 and \n     defines blindness as a ``central visual acuity of 20/200 or \n     less in the better eye with corrective glasses, or central \n     visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a visual field \n     defect in which the peripheral field is contracted to such an \n     extent that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends \n     an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better \n     eye.''\n       Recognizing this consensus definition, Public Law \n     (hereinafter, ``P.L.'') 110-157, the Dr. James Allen Veteran \n     Vision Equity Act of 2007, amended the criteria for receiving \n     special monthly compensation to allow veterans who are very \n     severely disabled as the result of blindness, and other \n     severe disabilities, to be eligible to receive a higher rate \n     of disability compensation if their visual acuity in both \n     eyes is 20/200 or less.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 306 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     2101(b) of title 38, U.S.C., by requiring central visual \n     acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a \n     standard correcting lens. It also provides that an eye with a \n     limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest \n     diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater \n     than 20 degrees shall be considered as having a central \n     visual acuity of 20/200 or less.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 202 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n\n    Revised limitations on assistance furnished for acquisition and \n              adaptation of housing for disabled veterans\n\n     Current Law\n       Since 1948, VA has provided adaptive housing assistance \n     grants to eligible individuals who have certain service-\n     connected disabilities to construct an adapted home or modify \n     an existing home to accommodate their disabilities. Today, VA \n     provides adaptive housing assistance primarily through two \n     programs--Specially Adapted Housing (hereinafter, ``SAH'') \n     and Special Home Adaptation (hereinafter, ``SHA''). Both \n     programs are codified under chapter 21 of title 38, U.S.C.\n       The SAH grant program provides financial assistance to \n     veterans and servicemembers who are entitled to compensation \n     for permanent and total service-connected disability due to \n     the loss or loss of use of multiple limbs, blindness and limb \n     loss, or a severe burn injury. Eligible individuals may \n     receive up to three SAH grants totaling no more than 50 \n     percent of the cost of a specially adapted house, up to the \n     aggregate maximum amount for FY 2011 of $63,780. This amount \n     is adjusted annually based on a cost-of-construction index. \n     Grants may be used to construct a house or remodel an \n     existing house, or they may be applied against the unpaid \n     principal mortgage balance of a specially adapted house. The \n     SHA grant program, which is similar to SAH but is for \n     individuals with other disabilities, may be used for slightly \n     different purposes and cannot exceed $12,756 during FY 2011. \n     This amount is also adjusted annually based on a cost-of-\n     construction index.\n       P.L. 109-233, the Veterans' Housing Opportunity and \n     Benefits Improvement Act of 2006, authorized VA to expand its \n     previously existing adaptive housing assistance grants to \n     include eligible individuals temporarily living in a home \n     owned by a family member. The Temporary Residence Adaptation \n     (hereinafter, ``TRA'') benefit, codified at section 2102A of \n     title 38, U.S.C., allows veterans to apply for a grant to \n     adapt the home of a family member with whom they are \n     temporarily residing. The benefit was extended to active duty \n     servicemembers with the passage of P.L. 110-289, the Housing \n     and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The TRA grant program \n     enables veterans and servicemembers eligible under the SAH \n     and SHA programs to use up to $14,000 and $2,000, \n     respectively, to modify a family member's home.\n       Under current law, section 2102(d) of title 38, U.S.C., \n     each TRA grant counts as one of the three grants allowed \n     under either SAH or SHA. TRA grants also count toward the \n     maximum allowable FY 2011 amount of $63,780 under SAH and \n     $12,756 under SHA.\n       The Government Accountability Office's (hereinafter, \n     ``GAO'') congressionally mandated reports on the TRA grant \n     program noted the limited participation in the TRA program. \n     GAO found that one of the reasons for the low usage was that \n     veterans often choose to wait to take advantage of benefits \n     to adapt their own home because the TRA grant amount counts \n     against the overall amount available to an individual under \n     the SAH or SHA grant programs. One potential solution GAO \n     identified would be no longer counting TRA grants against the \n     maximum funds available under SAH and SHA.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 307 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     2102(d) of title 38 to exclude the TRA grant from the \n     aggregate limitations on assistance furnished to an eligible \n     veteran or servicemember pursuant to section 2102 of title \n     38, U.S.C. TRA grants would no longer be counted against the \n     maximum funds available under SAH and SHA grants.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 203 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill. The Committees believe this change would increase \n     participation in the TRA grant program.\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\n IMPROVEMENTS TO ASSISTANCE FOR DISABLED VETERANS RESIDING IN HOUSING \n                        OWNED BY A FAMILY MEMBER\n\n     Current Law\n       P.L. 109-233, the Veterans' Housing Opportunity and \n     Benefits Improvement Act of 2006, authorized VA to expand its \n     previously existing adaptive housing assistance grants, known \n     as TRA grants, to include eligible individuals temporarily \n     living in a home owned by a family member. The benefit was \n     extended to active duty servicemembers with the passage of \n     P.L. 110-289, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008.\n       Under current law, section 2102A of title 38, U.S.C., the \n     TRA grant program allows veterans and servicemembers eligible \n     under the SAH and SHA programs to use up to $14,000 and \n     $2,000, respectively, to modify a family member's home. The \n     TRA grant program is scheduled to expire on December 31, \n     2012.\n       Section 101 of P.L. 109-233 also required the GAO to submit \n     a report to Congress on VA's implementation of the TRA grant \n     program. The interim report, ``Veterans Affairs: \n     Implementation of Temporary Residence Adaptation Grants'' \n     (GAO-09-637R), and the final report, ``Opportunities Exist to \n     Improve Potential Recipients' Awareness of the Temporary \n     Residence Adaptation Grant'' (GAO-10-786) (hereinafter, ``GAO \n     Reports''), both noted limited participation in the TRA \n     program. The interim report examined a number of reasons for \n     the low usage, and noted that veterans often choose to wait \n     to take advantage of benefits to adapt their own home because \n     the TRA grant counts against the overall amount available to \n     an individual under the SAH or SHA grant program. One of the \n     potential solutions GAO identified was to increase the \n     maximum benefit available under SAH and SHA.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 305 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     2102A of title 38, U.S.C., by increasing the amount of \n     assistance available for individuals with permanent and total \n     service-connected disabilities that meet the criteria of \n     section 2101(a)(2) of title 38, U.S.C., from $14,000 to \n     $28,000. It would increase the amount of assistance available \n     for individuals with permanent and total service-connected \n     disabilities that meet the criteria of section 2101(b)(2) of \n     title 38, U.S.C., from $2,000 to $5,000.\n       It would add a new paragraph to section 2102A that would \n     provide for automatic annual adjustments to the maximum grant \n     amounts, based on a cost-of-construction index already in \n     effect for other SAH and SHA grants authorized under chapter \n     21 of title 38, U.S.C. Finally, the Senate bill would amend \n     section 2102A of title 38, U.S.C., by extending VA's \n     authority to provide assistance under the TRA grant program \n     until December 31, 2021.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 4299 would amend section 2102A of title \n     38, U.S.C., by striking ``December 31, 2012'' and inserting \n     ``December 31, 2014.''\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 204 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate Bill except the authority to provide TRA grants is \n     extended to 2022.\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HOUSING LOAN GUARANTEES FOR SURVIVING \n              SPOUSES OF CERTAIN TOTALLY DISABLED VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       VA currently provides that surviving spouses of veterans \n     whose deaths were not service-connected, but who had service-\n     connected disabilities that were permanent and total for at \n     least 10 years immediately preceding their deaths, are \n     eligible to receive a monthly dependency and indemnity \n     compensation (hereinafter, ``DIC'') payment from VA. However, \n     surviving spouses of such veterans are not eligible for the \n     VA home loan guaranty benefit administered by VA.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 502 of H.R. 2433, as amended, would amend section \n     3701(b) of title 38, U.S.C., to extend eligibility for the VA \n     Home Loan guaranty benefit to surviving spouses of veterans \n     whose deaths were not service-connected, but who had service-\n     connected disabilities that were permanent and total for at \n     least 10 years immediately preceding their deaths.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 205 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the House \n     Bill.\n\n\n  OCCUPANCY OF PROPERTY BY DEPENDENT CHILD OF VETERAN FOR PURPOSES OF \n   MEETING OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENT FOR DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS \n                             HOUSING LOANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law, section 3704(c)(2) of title 38, U.S.C., states \n     that, ``[i]n any case in which a veteran is in active-duty \n     status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to \n     occupy a property because of such status, the occupancy \n     requirements [for purposes of obtaining a VA-backed home \n     loan] shall be considered to be satisfied if the spouse of \n     the veteran occupies the property . . . and the spouse makes \n     the certification required by paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection.'' Under current law, a single veteran with a \n     dependent child is disqualified from obtaining a VA-backed \n     home loan if he or she is on active-duty status, because he \n     or she does not have a spouse to satisfy occupancy \n     requirements.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 303 of S. 914, as reported, would add to section \n     3704(c)(2) a provision allowing a veteran's dependent child \n     who occupies, or will occupy, the property as a home to \n     satisfy the occupancy requirements. To qualify them for a VA-\n     backed home loan, the veteran's attorney-in-fact or a legal \n     guardian of the veteran's dependent child must make the \n     certification required by section 3704(c)(1) of title 38.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 206 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill. The Committees believe this provision would allow \n     single-parent veterans performing active-duty service to \n     obtain a VA-guaranteed home loan in situations where a \n     veteran's dependent child will be occupying the home with an \n     approved guardian. The Committees also intend that this \n     provision apply to situations where veterans, married to each \n     other, are both deployed.\n\n\n MAKING PERMANENT PROJECT FOR GUARANTEEING OF ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3707(a) of title 38, U.S.C., authorizes the \n     guaranty of adjustable rate mortgages for veterans. The \n     authority for VA to guaranty such mortgages is set to expire \n     at the end of FY 2012.\n     House Bill\n       Section 501 of H.R. 2433, as amended, would amend section \n     3707(a) to reauthorize the adjustable rate mortgages until \n     the end of FY 2014.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 207 of the Compromise Agreement would make this \n     authority permanent.\n\n\n MAKING PERMANENT PROJECT FOR INSURING HYBRID ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES\n\n     Current law\n       Section 3707A(a) of title 38, U.S.C., authorizes the \n     guaranty of hybrid adjustable rate mortgages for veterans. \n     The authority for VA to guaranty such mortgages is set to \n     expire at the end of FY 2012.\n     House Bill\n       Section 501 of H.R. 2433, as amended, would amend section \n     3707A(a) to reauthorize hybrid adjustable rate mortgages \n     until the end of FY 2014.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 208 of the Compromise Agreement would make this \n     authority permanent.\n\n\n   WAIVER OF LOAN FEE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITY RATINGS ISSUED \n                     DURING PRE-DISCHARGE PROGRAMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, section 3729(c) of title 38, U.S.C., a \n     housing loan fee may not be collected if a veteran is rated \n     eligible to receive compensation as a result of a pre-\n     discharge VA disability examination and rating. The time \n     period between pre-discharge ratings and release from active-\n     duty service can be quite long. During that time, many \n     disabled servicemembers utilize their VA home loan benefit. \n     Under current law, servicemembers who are rated eligible to \n     receive compensation solely as the result of a pre-discharge \n     review of existing medical evidence and not as the result of \n     a VA examination are required to pay the housing loan fees \n     until they have been discharged or released from active duty.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 304 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     3729(c) of title 38, U.S.C., by adding a provision that \n     waives the collection of housing loan fees from a \n     servicemember rated eligible to receive compensation based on \n     a pre-discharge review of existing medical evidence that \n     results in the issuance of a memorandum rating.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 209 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill. The Committees believe this provision would ensure that \n     all servicemembers eligible to receive compensation as the \n     result of a pre-discharge program are eligible for the \n     housing loan fee waiver, regardless of whether the \n     eligibility was the result of an examination or a review of \n     existing evidence.\n\n\n  MODIFICATION OF AUTHORITIES FOR ENHANCED-USE LEASES OF REAL PROPERTY\n\n     Current Law\n       Subchapter V of chapter 81 of title 38, U.S.C., provides VA \n     with authority to enter into enhanced-use leases \n     (hereinafter, ``EULs''). EULs allow VA to lease underutilized \n     real property to third-parties, so long as it will be used \n     for a purpose that complements the mission of VA. VA was \n     permitted to accept monetary or in-kind consideration for \n     EULs and to spend any money collected on medical care via the \n     MCCF. This authority expired on December 31, 2011.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 210 of the Compromise Agreement would reauthorize \n     VA's EUL authority until December 31, 2023. The Compromise \n     Agreement also would make several changes to VA's authority, \n     including permitting EULs only for the purpose of creating \n     programs to assist veterans who are homeless or at risk of \n     homelessness, requiring VA to receive approval for future \n     EULs from the Office of Management and Budget, prohibiting VA \n     from receiving any type of in-kind consideration for leased \n     property, and forbidding federal entities from leasing \n     property from a lessee when that property is already subject \n     to an EUL.\n       The Compromise Agreement also would require a report to \n     Congress 120 days after enactment and annually thereafter, \n     and include the key changes made to the administration of the \n     program to address deficiencies identified by VA's Office of \n     Inspector General in a February 29, 2012, report titled \n     ``Audit of the Enhanced-Use Lease Program.'' The Committees \n     note, with significant concern, the findings of the Office of \n     Inspector General and expect VA to ensure substantial \n     improvements are made to the management of the EUL program.\n\n                      Title III--Homeless Matters\n\n\n             ENHANCEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE PROGRAMS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2011 of title 38, U.S.C., sets forth the authority, \n     criteria, and requirements for VA's grant program. The law \n     requires VA to establish criteria and requirements for grants \n     awarded under this section. Eligible entities for these \n     grants are restricted to public or nonprofit private entities \n     with the capacity to administer these grants effectively who \n     demonstrate that adequate financial support will be available \n     to carry out the project for which the grant is sought \n     consistent with the plans, specifications, and schedule \n     submitted by the applicant. An eligible entity must also \n     agree to meet, as well as have the capacity to meet, the \n     applicable criteria and requirements established by VA. \n     Subsection (b) specifies the kinds of projects for which the \n     grants are available, including the expansion, remodeling, \n     and alteration of existing buildings. Subsection (c) of this \n     section stipulates that funds may not be used to support \n     operation costs and may not exceed 65 percent of the \n     estimated cost of the project concerned. In addition, the \n     grants may not be used to support operational costs and the \n     amount of the grant may not exceed 65 percent of the \n     estimated cost of the project concerned.\n       Section 2012 of title 38, U.S.C., sets forth the authority \n     for VA's per diem program. The law requires VA to provide to \n     recipients of grants under section 2011 of title 38, U.S.C., \n     per diem payments for services furnished to any homeless \n     veteran whom VA has referred to the grant recipient or \n     authorized the provision of services. The per diem rate is \n     defined as the estimated daily cost of care, not in excess of \n     the per diem rate for VA's State Home Per Diem Program.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 201 of S. 914, as reported, would authorize grant \n     funds to be used for new construction and stipulates that the \n     Department cannot deny a grant on the basis that the entity \n     proposes to use funding from other public or private sources, \n     including entities that are Low-Income Housing Tax Credit \n     recipients controlled by eligible nonprofits. This provision \n     also would require VA, a year after enactment, to complete a \n     study on grant and per diem payment methods within the \n     comprehensive service grant and per diem programs, and issue \n     a report to Congress on the findings therein.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 301 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n\nMODIFICATION OF AUTHORITY FOR PROVISION OF TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION \n       TO CERTAIN VETERANS TO INCLUDE PROVISION OF TREATMENT AND \n REHABILITATION TO HOMELESS VETERANS WHO ARE NOT SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2031 of title 38, U.S.C., authorizes VA to provide \n     outreach services, care, treatment, rehabilitative services, \n     and certain therapeutic transitional housing assistance to \n     veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including \n     such veterans who are also homeless.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 203 of S. 914, as reported, would modify the \n     authority for the provision of treatment, rehabilitation, and \n     other services to certain veterans to include the provision \n     of such services to homeless veterans who are not seriously \n     mentally ill.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 302 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n\n MODIFICATION OF GRANT PROGRAM FOR HOMELESS VETERANS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2061 of title 38, U.S.C., authorizes VA to operate \n     a grant program for homeless veterans with special needs. \n     Section 2061(b) defines homeless veterans with special needs \n     as: 1) women, including women who have care of minor \n     dependents; 2) frail elderly; 3) terminally ill; or 4) \n     chronically mentally ill.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 202 of S. 914, as reported, would include male \n     homeless veterans with minor dependents as an additional \n     population with special needs for the purpose of receiving \n     per diem payments to provide services. It would also \n     authorize recipients of special needs grants to provide \n     services directly to a dependent of a homeless veteran with \n     special needs who is under the care of such veteran while \n     receiving services from the grant recipient. Section 202 also \n     authorizes the provision of grants to entities that are \n     eligible for, but not currently in receipt of, funding under \n     VA's Comprehensive Service Programs.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 303 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n\n   COLLABORATON IN PROVISION OF CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO HOMELESS \n                 VETERANS IN SUPPORTED HOUSING PROGRAM\n\n     Current Law\n       The Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs \n     Supportive Housing Program (hereinafter, ``HUD-VASH'') is a \n     cooperative partnership between HUD and VA that provides \n     long-term case management, supportive services, and permanent \n     housing support for eligible homeless veterans. Section \n     2003(b) of title 38, U.S.C., requires VA to ensure that there \n     are adequate case managers available for veterans who receive \n     section 8 vouchers under the HUD-VASH program.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 209 of S. 914, as reported, would require VA to \n     consider entering into contracts or agreements with State or \n     local governments, tribal organizations, or nonprofit \n     organizations to collaborate in the provision of case \n     management services to veterans in the supported housing \n     program.\n       Section 209 of S. 914, as reported, also would require a \n     report to Congress 545 days after enactment and not less \n     frequently than once each year thereafter. This report would \n     include, but would not be limited to, a description of any \n     consideration to contract for case management; a description \n     of the entities with whom VA entered into contracts; a \n     description of the veterans served via contract; an \n     assessment of contract performance; and recommendations for \n     legislative or administrative action for the improvement of \n     collaboration in the provision of case management services \n     under the HUD-VASH program.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 304 of the Compromise Agreement generally reflects \n     the Senate Bill with the addition of technical changes in \n     subsection (b) that ensure veterans who meet eligibility \n     criteria when entering the program and who are receiving case \n     management from a contract provider can continue to receive \n     case management from that same entity after they are placed \n     into housing.\n\n\n EXTENSIONS OF PREVIOUSLY FULLY-FUNDED AUTHORITIES AFFECTING HOMELESS \n                                VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 2013 of title 38, U.S.C., funds are \n     authorized to be appropriated for comprehensive service \n     programs for homeless veterans. $250 million is authorized to \n     be appropriated for the program in FY 2012, but only $150 \n     million is authorized to be appropriated for FY 2013.\n       Under section 2021 of title 38, U.S.C., $50 million is \n     authorized to be appropriated for the Homeless Veterans \n     Reintegration Program (hereinafter, ``HVRP'') for FY 2012. \n     There are no funds authorized to be appropriated for this \n     program in FY 2013.\n       Under section 2044 of title 38, U.S.C., $100 million is \n     authorized to be appropriated in FY 2012 for financial \n     assistance for supportive services for very low-income \n     veteran families in permanent housing. There are no funds \n     authorized to be appropriated for this program in FY 2013.\n       Under section 2061 of title 38, U.S.C., $5 million is \n     authorized to be appropriated annually for the grant program \n     for homeless veterans with special needs between FY 2007 and \n     FY 2012. There are no funds authorized to be appropriated for \n     this program in FY 2013.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 201 of S. 914, as reported, would increase the \n     authorization of appropriations to $250 million for the \n     comprehensive service programs for homeless veterans in FY \n     2012.\n       Section 206 of S. 914, as reported, would extend through FY \n     2012 the existing $50 million authorization of appropriations \n     for HVRP.\n       Section 207 of S. 914, as reported, would authorize the \n     appropriation of $100 million for financial assistance for \n     supportive services for very low-income veteran families in \n     permanent housing in FY 2012.\n       Section 208 of S. 914, as reported, would authorize the \n     appropriation of $5 million for\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\n     the grant program for homeless veterans with special needs in \n     FY 2012.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement would increase the \n     authorization of appropriations to $250 million for \n     comprehensive service programs for homeless veterans in FY \n     2013 and $150 million for every fiscal year after and \n     including FY 2014.\n       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement would extend \n     through FY 2013 the existing $50 million authorization of \n     appropriations for HVRP.\n       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement would authorize the \n     appropriation of $300 million for financial assistance for \n     supportive services for very low-income veteran families in \n     permanent housing in FY 2013.\n       Section 305 of the Compromise Agreement would authorize the \n     appropriation of $5 million for the grant program for \n     homeless veterans with special needs in FY 2013.\n\n                      Title IV--Education Matters\n\n\nAGGREGATE AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO \n  RECEIVE BOTH SURVIVORS' AND DEPENDENTS' EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE AND \n           OTHER VETERANS AND RELATED EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE\n\n     Current Law\n       Under chapter 35 of title 38, U.S.C., certain survivors and \n     dependents of individuals who die or are disabled while on \n     active duty are eligible for educational assistance benefits. \n     Section 3511(a)(1) provides that each eligible person is \n     entitled to the equivalent of 45 months of full-time \n     benefits.\n       P.L. 110-252, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance \n     Act of 2008, codified at chapter 33 of title 38, established \n     a new program of educational assistance for individuals who \n     served on active duty after September 11, 2001. This Act \n     established a program of educational assistance in which \n     individuals may earn up to a maximum of 36 months of full-\n     time benefits.\n       Further, under section 3695 of title 38, U.S.C., an \n     individual who is eligible for assistance under two or more \n     specific educational programs may not receive in excess of \n     the equivalent of 48 months of full-time benefits. This means \n     that an eligible survivor or dependent who is entitled to \n     receive education benefits under the chapter 35 program, who \n     uses all 45 months of those benefits to obtain a college \n     education, and who subsequently decides to enter the \n     military, would only be able to earn the equivalent of three \n     months of benefits under P.L. 110-252.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 702 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     3695 of title 38, U.S.C., to provide that an individual \n     entitled to benefits under chapter 35 will not be subject to \n     the 48-month limitation. However, the maximum aggregate \n     period of benefits an individual may receive under chapter 35 \n     and certain other educational assistance programs listed at \n     section 3695 of title 38, U.S.C., would be capped at 81 \n     months.\n       Section 702 would also revive a period of entitlement to \n     education benefits in situations where such benefits were \n     reduced by the 48-month limitation. The maximum period of \n     assistance for individuals with revived benefits would also \n     be capped at 81 months.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 401 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n\n    ANNUAL REPORTS ON POST-9/11 EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND \n       SURVIVORS' AND DEPENDENTS' EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 3036 of title 38, U.S.C., DOD and VA, both \n     bi-annually report to Congress on the effectiveness of the \n     Montgomery GI Bill (hereinafter, ``MGIB'') Program in meeting \n     the statutory objectives of the program.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 504 of H.R. 2433, as amended, would require DOD and \n     VA to annually submit to Congress reports on the \n     effectiveness of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. The section would \n     require DOD's report to measure what effect the level of GI \n     Bill benefits has on DOD's ability to recruit and maintain \n     qualified active-duty personnel. This section would also \n     require VA to report on the level of utilization of benefits \n     under all education programs administered by VA, the number \n     of credit hours, certificates, degrees, and other \n     qualifications earned by students under the GI Bill, and VA's \n     recommendations on ways to improve the benefit for \n     servicemembers, veterans, and their dependents. This section \n     also repeals section 3036 of title 38, U.S.C., which requires \n     the current biennially report on the MGIB program.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 402 of the Compromise Agreement generally reflects \n     the House Bill with some minor modifications. With the advent \n     of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and the resulting reduction in the \n     participation in the MGIB, the Committees believe it is time \n     to refocus this report on the Post-9/11 GI Bill.\n       The Compromise Agreement provides VA increased flexibility \n     in determining what additional type of data on student \n     outcomes can be included in the report and specifies that the \n     first reports are due by November 1, 2013.\n       The Committees believe that, with the significant \n     investment, estimated to be as much as $60 to $80 billion \n     over the first 10 years, Congress needs to be able to \n     determine whether provisions of the Post-9/11 GI Bill are \n     meeting their intended outcomes.\n\n                       Title V--Benefits Matters\n\n\n   AUTOMATIC WAIVER OF AGENCY OF ORIGINAL JURISDICTION REVIEW OF NEW \n                                EVIDENCE\n\n     Current Law\n       Current law precludes the Board of Veterans' Appeals \n     (hereinafter, ``Board'') initial consideration of evidence \n     submitted in connection with a claim, unless the claimant \n     waives the right to initial consideration by the Agency of \n     Original Jurisdiction (hereinafter, ``AOJ''). Evidence first \n     must be considered by the AOJ in order to preserve a \n     claimant's statutory right under section 7104 of title 38, \n     U.S.C., to one review on appeal.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 404 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     7105 of title 38, U.S.C., by creating a new subsection, (e), \n     to incorporate an automatic waiver of the right to initial \n     consideration of certain evidence by the AOJ. The evidence \n     subject to the waiver is evidence in connection with the \n     issue or issues with which disagreement has been expressed, \n     and which is submitted by the claimant, or his or her \n     representative, to the AOJ or the Board concurrently with or \n     after the filing of a substantive appeal. Such evidence would \n     be subject to initial consideration by the Board, unless the \n     appellant or his or her representative requests, in writing, \n     that the AOJ initially consider the evidence. The request \n     would be required to be submitted with the evidence. These \n     changes would take effect 180 days after enactment and apply \n     with respect to claims for which a substantive appeal is \n     filed on or after that date.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 1484 would direct the Board to consider \n     evidence submitted by a claimant after a substantive appeal \n     has been filed unless the claimant elects to have the \n     evidence considered first by the AOJ.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 501 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the \n     language of the Senate Bill.\n\n\n AUTHORITY FOR CERTAIN PERSONS TO SIGN CLAIMS FILED WITH SECRETARY OF \n                VETERANS AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF CLAIMANTS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, section 5101 of title 38, U.S.C., VA \n     lacks specific authority to authorize a court-appointed \n     representative or caregiver to sign an application form \n     allowing the adjudication of the claim to proceed.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 704 of S. 914, as reported, would authorize certain \n     individuals to sign claims filed with VA on behalf of \n     claimants who are under age 18, are mentally incompetent, or \n     are physically unable to sign a form.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 502 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate Bill but with the addition of a new section, \n     502(a)(2)(A)(iii), in order to clarify that if a person signs \n     a form on behalf of a claimant, the claimant's social \n     security number must be submitted in addition to the social \n     security number or tax identification number of the \n     individual signing the form on behalf of the claimant.\n\n\n   IMPROVEMENT OF PROCESS FOR FILING JOINTLY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND \n                 DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, section 5105 of title 38, U.S.C., VA and \n     the Social Security Administration (hereinafter, ``SSA'') are \n     required to develop and use joint applications for survivors \n     who apply for both dependency and indemnity compensation DIC \n     and Social Security survivor benefits. Section 5105 further \n     provides that, if such a joint application form is filed with \n     either VA or SSA, it will be deemed an application for both \n     DIC and Social Security benefits.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 705 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     5105 of title 38, U.S.C., to permit--but not require--the \n     development of a joint form for SSA and VA survivor benefits. \n     This provision also would amend section 5105 so that any form \n     indicating an intent to apply for survivor benefits would be \n     deemed an application for both DIC and Social Security \n     benefits. This is intended to codify VA's practice under \n     which any indication of intent to apply for Social Security \n     survivor benefits also is treated as an application for VA \n     DIC benefits.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 503 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\n AUTHORIZATION OF USE OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION TO PROVIDE NOTICE TO \n  CLAIMANTS FOR BENEFITS UNDER LAWS ADMINISTERED BY THE SECRETARY OF \n                            VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 5103 of title 38, U.S.C., requires VA to issue a \n     notice to claimants of further evidence needed to \n     substantiate a claim, referred to as a VCAA notice because of \n     its requirement under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of \n     2000. Section 5103 further requires VA to issue a separate \n     written notice to claimants upon receipt of any subsequent \n     claim, regardless of whether the information contained is \n     different from any prior notices issued. The VCAA notice also \n     outlines VA's duty to assist the claimant in obtaining \n     evidence, including what steps VA will take, and explains the \n     role the claimant can play to ensure all relevant evidence is \n     submitted for consideration. The VCAA notice explains how a \n     disability rating and effective date will be determined, and \n     each VCAA notice contains a VCAA Notice Response Form, which \n     identifies the date of claim and provides a brief explanation \n     regarding the submission of any additional information or \n     evidence.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 4 of H.R. 2349, as amended, would remove the \n     requirement that the VCAA notice be sent only after receipt \n     of a claim, thereby allowing VA to put notice on claims \n     application forms as is currently done with the Department's \n     526-EZ form for Fully Developed Claims (hereinafter, \n     ``FDCs''). VA must ensure that veterans are adequately \n     informed about their right to submit an informal claim for \n     the purpose of establishing an earlier effective date in \n     rewriting new application forms. Such information is \n     currently included on the 526-EZ form for those filing under \n     the FDC program, and it should similarly be included for \n     those submitting standard non-FDC forms to ensure that \n     veterans do not lose any benefit.\n       Section 4 of H.R. 2349, as amended, authorizes VA to use \n     the most effective means available for communication, \n     including electronic or written communication, and removes \n     the requirement that VA send a notice for a subsequent claim \n     if the issue is already covered under a previous claim and \n     notice. However, under this section, VA must still send a \n     notice if over one year has passed since any notice was last \n     sent to the claimant. According to VA, the subsequent \n     reduction in claims processing times by this section can \n     range from 30 to 40 days, which provides a positive step \n     toward reducing the claims backlog.\n       The requirement that VA issue a separate written VCAA \n     notice upon receipt of any subsequent claim presents two \n     issues that contribute to the claims backlog. The first is \n     that, in many cases, VA is forced to take a redundant step of \n     producing the exact same notice it has already provided to \n     the veteran, which increases the processing time without \n     affecting the outcome of the claim. The second issue is that \n     the notices provided by VA must be in writing and mailed \n     through the postal system. Because it is not authorized to do \n     so, VA cannot utilize the speed and efficiency provided by \n     electronic mail, even if that were the claimant's preferred \n     method of communication regarding the claim. This restriction \n     of VA's means of communication prevents it from utilizing a \n     widely-used and accepted form of efficient and timely \n     correspondence. Section 4 of H.R. 2349, as amended, directly \n     addresses those inefficiencies.\n       Section 4 of H.R. 2349, as amended, also authorizes VA to \n     waive the requirements for issuing a VCAA notice when ``the \n     Secretary may award the maximum benefit in accordance with \n     this title based on the evidence of record.'' This provision \n     will eliminate delays that occur when a VCAA notice would be \n     sent in connection with claims for which VA will award a \n     benefit, and when such notice has little likelihood of \n     leading to a higher level of benefit. This section contains \n     no requirement limiting correspondence to electronic mail.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 504 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House's position with a minor change in the language of \n     paragraph (5)(B) of H.R. 2349. The House-passed language in \n     paragraph (5)(B) reads ``For purposes of this paragraph, the \n     term `maximum benefit' means the highest evaluation \n     assignable in accordance with the evidence of record, as long \n     as such evaluation is supported by such evidence of record at \n     the time the decision is rendered.'' Per the Compromise \n     Agreement, this language is changed to ``For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the term `maximum benefit' means the highest \n     evaluation assignable in accordance with the evidence of \n     record, as long as such evidence is adequate for rating \n     purposes and sufficient to grant the earliest possible \n     effective date in accordance with section 5110 of this \n     title.'' This revised definition of ``maximum benefit'' \n     clarifies that VA must have evidence that is sufficient to \n     meet all aspects of the rating schedule for each condition.\n\n\n         DUTY TO ASSIST CLAIMANTS IN OBTAINING PRIVATE RECORDS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 5103A of title 38, U.S.C., outlines VA's duty to \n     assist claimants in obtaining evidence needed to substantiate \n     a claim. Under current law, VA must make ``reasonable \n     efforts'' to obtain private medical records on behalf of a \n     claimant who adequately identifies and authorizes VA to \n     obtain them. What constitutes a ``reasonable effort'' by VA \n     to obtain private medical records on behalf of a claimant is \n     undefined.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 5 of H.R. 2349, as amended, authorizes VA to waive \n     its duty to assist requirement when ``the Secretary may award \n     the maximum benefit in accordance with this title based on \n     the evidence of record.'' The effect of this provision would \n     prevent both the claimant and VA from having to collect \n     further evidence that would have no impact on the claim. \n     Under the revised definition of ``maximum'' benefit, it is \n     clear that before VA can make such an award, it must have \n     evidence that is sufficient to meet all aspects of the rating \n     schedule for each condition.\n       Section 5 of H.R. 2349, as amended, also adds a provision \n     to encourage claimants to take a proactive role in the claims \n     process. By encouraging ``claimants to submit relevant \n     private medical records of the claimant to the Secretary if \n     such submission does not burden the claimant,'' the \n     collection of evidence necessary to render a decision can be \n     greatly facilitated.\n       Section 5 of H.R. 2349, as amended, is intended to reduce \n     the number of situations wherein VA spends unnecessary time \n     and resources to pursue private medical records that may \n     already have been submitted in the claimant's file, may not \n     exist, may not be obtainable, are not relevant to the claim, \n     or even if obtained, are highly unlikely to change the rating \n     that would otherwise be assigned based on the evidence of \n     record. VA would continue to have an obligation to obtain or \n     assist veterans in obtaining relevant medical records, both \n     public and private; however, this provision clarifies that \n     the purpose of the duty to assist should be limited to \n     situations where it will actually assist veterans in \n     substantiating their claims. In addition, a claimant's \n     knowledge of where certain medical records may be located is \n     invaluable to claim development. In many cases a claimant can \n     identify, obtain, and submit that evidence more quickly than \n     if the Department received a claim and subsequently had to \n     locate and request those same records.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 505 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House's position with a minor change in the language of \n     paragraph (2)(B) of H.R. 2349. The House-passed language in \n     paragraph (2)(B) reads ``For purposes of this paragraph, the \n     term `maximum benefit' means the highest evaluation \n     assignable in accordance with the evidence of record, as long \n     as such evaluation is supported by such evidence of record at \n     the time the decision is rendered.'' Per the Compromise \n     Agreement, this language is changed to ``For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the term `maximum benefit' means the highest \n     evaluation assignable in accordance with the evidence of \n     record, as long as such evidence is adequate for rating \n     purposes and sufficient to grant the earliest possible \n     effective date in accordance with section 5110 of this \n     title.'' This revised definition of ``maximum benefit'' \n     clarifies that VA must have evidence that is sufficient to \n     meet all aspects of the rating schedule for each condition.\n\n\n   AUTHORITY FOR RETROACTIVE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR AWARDS OF DISABILITY \n COMPENSATION IN CONNECTION WITH APPLICATIONS THAT ARE FULLY-DEVELOPED \n                              AT SUBMITTAL\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 221 of Public Law 110-389, the Veterans' \n     Benefits Improvement Act of 2008, VA was required to conduct \n     a pilot project to test ``the feasibility and advisability of \n     providing expeditious treatment of fully developed \n     compensation or pension claims.'' After carrying out that \n     pilot at 10 VA regional offices, VA expanded the FDC process \n     to all VA regional offices. Under section 5110(a) of title \n     38, U.S.C., the effective date of an award of disability \n     compensation generally is the date on which VA received the \n     application for those benefits. Although there are exceptions \n     to that general rule, none of the exceptions would allow a \n     retroactive effective date for veterans who file FDCs.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 402 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     5110 of title 38, U.S.C., to provide that the effective date \n     of an award of disability compensation to a veteran who \n     submitted an FDC would be based on the facts found, but would \n     not be earlier than 1 year before the date on which VA \n     received the veteran's application. That change would take \n     effect on the date of enactment and would not be applied to \n     claims filed after September 30, 2012.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 506 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate bill. However, a retroactive effective date will \n     only be available for original claims that are fully-\n     developed upon submittal. The changes will be effective 1 \n     year after the date of enactment, and the changes will not \n     apply with respect\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\n     to claims filed after the date that is three years after the \n     date of enactment.\n\n\n    MODIFICATION OF MONTH OF DEATH BENEFIT FOR SURVIVING SPOUSES OF \n       VETERANS WHO DIE WHILE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION OR PENSION\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, veterans' benefits for a specific month \n     are paid in the month following the month to which they are \n     attributable. No benefits are owed to a veteran for the month \n     in which a veteran dies. However, if the veteran had a \n     surviving spouse, the month of death provision in current \n     law, section 5310 of title 38, U.S.C., provides that the \n     amount of benefits that the veteran would have received had \n     the veteran not died, is payable to the surviving spouse.\n       Section 5310 also provides that, if the benefit payable to \n     a surviving spouse as death compensation, DIC, or death \n     pension is less than the amount that the veteran would have \n     received for that month but for the veteran's death, the \n     greater benefit would be paid for the month of death.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 403 of S. 914, as reported, would amend current law \n     in order to clarify that a surviving spouse of a veteran who \n     is receiving compensation or pension from VA, is due the \n     amount of benefits the veteran would have received for the \n     entire month of the veteran's death, regardless of whether \n     the surviving spouse is otherwise entitled to survivor \n     benefits. Also, if at the time of death, the veteran had a \n     claim pending for compensation or pension that was \n     subsequently granted, the surviving spouse would be eligible \n     for any benefits or additional benefits due as accrued \n     benefits for the month of death.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 507 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n\n   INCREASE IN RATE OF PENSION FOR DISABLED VETERANS MARRIED TO ONE \n      ANOTHER AND BOTH OF WHOM REQUIRE REGULAR AID AND ATTENDANCE\n\n     Current Law\n       Veterans of a period of war who meet income, net worth, and \n     other eligibility criteria are eligible to receive a pension \n     based upon need. The pension amount is based upon the number \n     of veteran dependents. Additional benefits are paid if the \n     veteran has a disability which results in housebound status \n     or a need for aid and attendance. In general, when a veteran \n     is married to another veteran, the pension benefits paid are \n     the same as for a veteran who is married to a non-veteran. \n     However, in cases where one or both members of a veteran \n     couple is housebound and/or in need of aid and attendance, \n     the additional amounts paid are computed separately for each \n     veteran and then added to the basic grant.\n       In 1998, section 8206 of P.L. 105-178, the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century, increased the benefit for a \n     veteran who requires aid and attendance by $600 per year. \n     Because of the way the bill was drafted, the benefit was \n     increased for only one of the veterans in the rare case that \n     a veteran is married to a veteran and both require aid and \n     attendance. The legislative history does not indicate any \n     intent to treat these spouses differently. Therefore, under \n     current law, a veteran who is married to a veteran where both \n     veterans qualify for aid and attendance benefits, the benefit \n     amount for one of the spouses is lower than for the other \n     spouse.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 401 of S. 914, as reported, would increase the \n     benefit paid to married couples where both members of the \n     couple are veterans and both qualify for aid and attendance, \n     so that each member of the married couple receives the full \n     aid and attendance amount.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 508 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate Bill, but with a slight increase in the amount of \n     the benefit paid to married couples where both members of the \n     couple are veterans, and both qualify for aid and attendance. \n     This increased amount of $32,433 reflects the current rate \n     needed to equalize the benefit provided to each veteran \n     spouse as a result of the 2012 cost-of-living adjustment \n     applied to the previous shortfall remedy of $825. This \n     increase was necessary to ensure that the Compromise \n     Agreement adequately reflected the amount necessary to \n     correct the benefit level for each spouse to the amount \n     intended by P.L. 105-178.\n\n\n EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN REIMBURSEMENTS OF EXPENSES FROM DETERMINATION OF \n   ANNUAL INCOME WITH RESPECT TO PENSIONS FOR VETERANS AND SURVIVING \n                    SPOUSES AND CHILDREN OF VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Veterans of a period of war who meet income, net worth, and \n     other eligibility criteria are eligible to receive a pension \n     based upon need. Under current law, section 1503 of title 38, \n     U.S.C., reimbursements for any kind of casualty loss are \n     exempt from income determinations for purposes of determining \n     pension eligibility.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no similar provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 3 of H.R. 2349, as amended, would prevent the \n     offset of pension benefits for veterans, surviving spouses, \n     and children of veterans due to the receipt of payments by \n     insurance, court award, settlement or other means to \n     reimburse expenses incurred after an accident, theft, \n     ordinary loss or casualty loss. Section 3 would also exempt \n     pain and suffering income from pension calculations, but only \n     amounts determined by VA on a case-by-case basis. The House \n     Bill would also extend the authority of VA to verify income \n     information with the Internal Revenue Service (hereinafter, \n     ``IRS'') to November 18, 2013.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 509 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House Bill except it does not exclude payments for \n     medical expenses resulting from any accident, theft, loss, or \n     casualty loss or payments for pain and suffering related to \n     an accident, theft, loss, or casualty loss. The Committees \n     believe payments received for pain and suffering should not \n     be excluded from countable income because such payments are \n     not a reimbursement for expenses and such an exclusion would \n     be inconsistent with a needs based program.\n       The Compromise Agreement does not extend the authority of \n     VA to verify income information with the IRS. This authority \n     was extended until September 30, 2016, by P.L. 112-56.\n\n             Title VI--Memorial, Burial & Cemetery Matters\n\n\nPROHIBITION ON DISRUPTIONS OF FUNERALS OF MEMBERS OR FORMER MEMBERS OF \n                            THE ARMED FORCES\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2413 of title 38, U.S.C., restricts the time, \n     place, and manner of demonstrations at funerals for \n     servicemembers or former servicemembers at National Cemetery \n     Administration (hereinafter, ``NCA'') facilities and \n     Arlington National Cemetery (hereinafter, ``ANC'').\n       Section 1388 of title 18, U.S.C., restricts the time, \n     place, and manner of demonstrations at funerals for \n     servicemembers or former servicemembers that take place in \n     cemeteries other than NCA facilities or ANC.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 501 of S. 914, as reported, increases the space and \n     time restrictions, and liability for those protesting at \n     funerals of servicemembers and former servicemembers in both \n     section 2413 of title 38 and section 1388 of title 18, U.S.C. \n     For a full explanation of section 501 of S. 914 please see \n     Senate Report 112-088, the Veterans Programs Improvement Act \n     of 2011.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 601 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n\n   CODIFICATION OF PROHIBITION AGAINST RESERVATION OF GRAVESITES AT \n                      ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY\n\n     Current Law\n       Army Regulation 290-5, Paragraph 2-5, states that ANC \n     selection of specific gravesites or sections is not \n     authorized. Despite a stated policy against preferential \n     treatment and the reservation of gravesites, the Washington \n     Post reported that in recent years ANC had repeatedly \n     provided preferential treatment to VIPs by setting aside \n     select and prestigious gravesites for their future use. An \n     article dated March 20, 2011, titled ``Arlington Cemetery \n     struggles with old reservations,'' is excerpted in relevant \n     part:\n       ``Although [ANC] stopped formally taking reservations in \n     1962, the practice of reserving choice grave sites continued, \n     if unofficially, under Raymond J. Costanzo, who was \n     superintendent from 1972 to 1990. [John C. Metzler, Jr.], his \n     successor, who ran the cemetery until he was forced to retire \n     last year, also apparently allowed people to pick areas of \n     the cemetery where they wanted to be buried, Army officials \n     said.\n       The Army, which investigated the matter two decades ago and \n     is looking into it again, has a list from 1990 with `senior \n     officials' who have plots that `were de facto reserved in \n     violation of Army policy,' according to a memo obtained by \n     The Post under the Freedom of Information Act. Some of these \n     officials were driven around the cemetery by Costanzo, who \n     told investigators that he had allowed them to pick their \n     spots.\n       `I take the position that if there is anything I can do \n     positively for a person, I will try to do that as long as it \n     is not a serious violation of any rule, regulation, or law,' \n     he told investigators at the time.''\n       Media reports regarding preferential treatment of and \n     reservations for certain people, coupled with a 2010 \n     investigation of ANC by the Army Inspector General, reflect a \n     series of problems with the previous management of ANC. As \n     ANC works to build accountability and transparency in its \n     management and operations, the issue of gravesite \n     reservations remains a paramount concern.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 502 of S. 914, as reported, would codify the Army \n     regulations that ban reserving gravesites and would provide \n     accountability and transparency. The section would amend \n     chapter 24 of title 38, U.S.C., by requiring that not more \n     than one gravesite at ANC be provided to eligible veterans or \n     members of the Armed Forces, unless a waiver is made by the \n     Secretary of the Army as\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\n     considered appropriate. This requirement would apply with \n     respect to all interments at ANC after the date of the \n     enactment of this section.\n       Section 502 would also prohibit the reservation of \n     gravesites at ANC for individuals not yet deceased. This \n     prohibition would not apply with respect to the interment of \n     an individual for whom a request for a reserved gravesite was \n     approved by the Secretary of the Army before January 1, 1962, \n     when ANC formally stopped accepting reservations.\n       A reporting requirement would also be imposed by the \n     section. Not later than 180 days after the enactment of this \n     section, the Army would be required to submit to Congress a \n     report on reservations made for interment at ANC. The report \n     would describe the number of requests for reservations at ANC \n     that were submitted to the Secretary of the Army before \n     January 1, 1962. The report would also describe the number of \n     gravesites at ANC that, on the day before the date of the \n     enactment of this section, were reserved in response to such \n     requests. The number of such gravesites that, on the day \n     before the enactment of this section, were unoccupied would \n     also be included in the report. Additionally, the report \n     would list all reservations for gravesites at ANC that were \n     extended by individuals responsible for the management of ANC \n     in response to requests for such reservations made on or \n     after January 1, 1962.\n     House Bill\n       Section 3 of H.R. 1627 contains a similar provision on \n     burial reservations.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 602 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     and House Bills. The Committees believe that the inclusion of \n     this provision is necessary to ensure that qualified \n     servicemembers and veterans are honored at ANC without regard \n     to rank or status. In light of the extraordinary sacrifices \n     made by America's men and women in uniform, it is paramount \n     that their burials at ANC occur with integrity, in a manner \n     befitting such sacrifice, and in accordance with Army policy \n     and regulation.\n       The Compromise Agreement also permits the President to \n     waive the prohibition on burial reservations at Arlington \n     National Cemetery as the President considers appropriate, and \n     requires the President to notify the Committees and the \n     Senate and House Armed Services Committees of any such waiver \n     decision. The Committees expect that decisions to waive the \n     prohibition will be done only under extraordinary \n     circumstances, i.e., for a Medal of Honor recipient, former \n     President, etc.\n\n\n  EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR PRESIDENTIAL MEMORIAL CERTIFICATES TO \n     PERSONS WHO DIED IN THE ACTIVE MILITARY, NAVAL, OR AIR SERVICE\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, section 112 of title 38, U.S.C., \n     eligibility for presidential memorial certificates is limited \n     to survivors of veterans who were discharged from service \n     under honorable conditions. For purposes of this section, \n     under the section 101, title 38, U.S.C., definition of \n     ``veteran,'' an individual who died in active service, \n     including an individual killed in action, technically is not \n     a veteran because the individual was not ``discharged or \n     released'' from service. Therefore, under current law, the \n     survivors of such an individual are not eligible for a \n     presidential memorial certificate honoring the memory of the \n     deceased.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 503 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section 112 \n     of title 38 by allowing VA to provide presidential memorial \n     certificates to the next of kin, relatives, or friends of a \n     servicemember who died in active military, naval, or air \n     service.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 603 of the Compromise Agreement reflects the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n\n   REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PLACEMENT OF MONUMENTS IN ARLINGTON NATIONAL \n                                CEMETERY\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2409 of title 38, U.S.C., allows the Secretary of \n     the Army to set aside areas in ANC to honor military \n     personnel and veterans who are missing in action or whose \n     remains were not available for various other reasons. Section \n     (b) provides for the erection of appropriate memorials or \n     markers to honor such individuals.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 1627, as amended, would establish clear \n     and objective criteria for the Secretary of the Army in \n     considering and approving monument requests. It would do this \n     by putting in place a requirement that monuments commemorate \n     the military service of an individual, a group of \n     individuals, or a military event that is at least 25 years \n     old. The purpose of the 25-year requirement would be to \n     ensure that a permanent monument truly stands the test of \n     time and is not commemorating events based on the passions of \n     a moment. H.R. 1627, as amended, would also require that \n     monuments be placed in sections of ANC designated by the \n     Secretary of the Army for that explicit purpose and only on \n     land that is not suitable for burial. The bill would further \n     require that monument construction and placement must be \n     funded by a non-governmental entity using funds from private \n     sources. The Secretary of the Army would be required to \n     consult with the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts before \n     approving the monument design, and the sponsoring entity must \n     issue a study on the suitability and availability of other \n     sites (outside of ANC) where the monument could be placed.\n       Recognizing the need for flexibility in monument \n     determinations, H.R. 1627, as amended, would permit the \n     Secretary of the Army to waive the 25-year rule (noted above) \n     in the event a monument proposes to commemorate a group of \n     individuals who have made valuable contributions to the Armed \n     Forces for longer than 25 years and those contributions \n     continue, and are expected to continue indefinitely, and such \n     groups have provided service of such a character that it \n     would present a manifest injustice if approval of the \n     monument was not permitted.\n       Finally, H.R. 1627, as amended, would retain ultimate \n     Congressional oversight of monument placement at ANC by \n     requiring the Secretary of the Army to notify Congress of any \n     decision to approve a monument, along with the stated \n     rationale, before a monument may be placed. Congress would \n     have 60 days to review the decision and, if it chooses, pass \n     a disapproval resolution in order to halt the monument from \n     going forward. If Congress takes no action, the monument \n     would be deemed approved after the 60-day period lapses.\n       H.R. 1627, as amended, therefore, retains elements of the \n     Department of the Army's existing regulatory framework with \n     respect to monument placement at ANC and builds upon that \n     framework by establishing an objective, transparent, \n     rigorous, and flexible criteria for future monument \n     placement.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 604 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House Bill except that it requires that the Advisory \n     Committee on Arlington National Cemetery also be consulted \n     prior to a monument being placed in the Cemetery.\n\n                        Title VII--Other Matters\n\n\n          ASSISTANCE TO VETERANS AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS\n\n     Current Law\n       Laws such as P.L. 93-288, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, provide federal \n     assistance to individuals and families affected by natural \n     disasters. However, current law is not specifically tailored \n     to the needs of veterans, particularly veterans with service-\n     connected disabilities affected by such disasters. This means \n     that under current law, targeted assistance is unavailable to \n     those veterans who are particularly vulnerable and most in \n     need of assistance in the event of a natural disaster.\n       For example, VA adaptive housing assistance grants are \n     available to eligible individuals who have certain service-\n     connected disabilities, to construct an adapted home or to \n     modify an existing home to accommodate their disabilities. \n     However, limitations such as caps on the total amount of \n     assistance available under SAH or SHA grants, may prevent a \n     veteran from receiving additional assistance from VA to \n     repair an adapted home damaged by a natural disaster.\n       Similarly, under current law, section 3903 of title 38, \n     U.S.C., a veteran may receive a grant for the purchase of an \n     automobile. If that vehicle has been destroyed by a natural \n     or other disaster, current statutory limitations would \n     prevent VA from providing another grant to repair or replace \n     the damaged vehicle.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 701 of S. 914, as reported, would provide certain \n     types of assistance to eligible veterans affected by a \n     natural or other disaster.\n       Section 701 of S. 914, as reported, would amend chapter 21 \n     of title 38, U.S.C., by adding a new section which would \n     provide assistance to a veteran whose home is destroyed or \n     substantially damaged in a natural or other disaster, and \n     that was previously adapted with assistance through the SAH \n     or SHA grant program. Such assistance would not be subject to \n     the limitations on assistance under section 2102. However, \n     under this section a grant award would not exceed the lesser \n     of the reasonable cost of repairing or replacing the damaged \n     or destroyed home in excess of the available insurance \n     coverage on such home, or the maximum grant amount to which \n     the veteran would have been entitled under the SAH or SHA \n     grant programs had the veteran not obtained the prior grant.\n       Section 701 would amend section 3108 of title 38, U.S.C., \n     by authorizing VA to extend the payment of a subsistence \n     allowance to qualifying veterans participating in a \n     rehabilitation program under chapter 31 of title 38. The \n     extension would be authorized if the veteran has been \n     displaced as a result of a natural or other disaster while \n     being paid a subsistence allowance. If such circumstances are \n     met, VA would be permitted to extend the payment of a \n     subsistence allowance for up to an additional two months \n     while the veteran is satisfactorily following a program of \n     employment services.\n       Section 701 also would amend section 3120 of title 38, \n     U.S.C., by waiving the limitation on the number of veterans \n     eligible to receive programs of independent living services \n     and assistance, in any case in which VA determines that an \n     eligible veteran has been displaced as the result of, or has \n     otherwise been\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\n     adversely affected in the areas covered by, a storm or other \n     disaster.\n       Section 701 would amend section 3703 of title 38, U.S.C., \n     to allow VA to guarantee a loan, regardless of whether such \n     loan is subordinate to a superior lien created by a public \n     entity that has provided, or will provide, assistance in \n     response to a major disaster.\n       Additionally, section 701 would amend section 3903, of \n     title 38, U.S.C., by authorizing VA to provide, or to assist \n     in providing, an eligible person receiving assistance through \n     the Automobile Assistance Program with a second automobile. \n     This assistance would be permitted only if VA receives \n     satisfactory evidence that the automobile, previously \n     purchased with assistance through this program, was destroyed \n     as a result of a natural or other disaster, the eligible \n     person bore no fault, and the person would not receive \n     compensation for the loss from a property insurer.\n       Finally, section 701 would require VA to submit an annual \n     report to Congress detailing the assistance provided or \n     action taken by VA during the last fiscal year pursuant to \n     the authority of this section. Required report provisions \n     would include: a description for each natural disaster for \n     which assistance was provided, the number of cases or \n     individuals in which, or to whom, VA provided assistance, and \n     for each such case or individual, a description of the \n     assistance provided.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no similar provisions.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 701 of the Compromise Agreement follows the Senate \n     Bill.\n\n\n            EXTENSION OF CERTAIN EXPIRING PROVISIONS OF LAW\n\n     Current Law\n       Under section 3720(h) of title 38, U.S.C., VA has the \n     authority to issue, or approve the issuance of, certificates \n     or other securities evidencing an interest in a pool of \n     mortgage loans VA finances on properties it has acquired and \n     guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on \n     such certificates or other securities. This authority expired \n     on December 31, 2011.\n       Section 3729(b)(2) of title 38, U.S.C., sets forth a loan \n     fee table that lists funding fees to be paid by \n     beneficiaries, expressed as a percentage of the loan amount, \n     for different types of loans guaranteed by VA. Funding fee \n     rates have varied over the years, but with one exception, \n     have remained constant since 2004. All funding fee rates are \n     set to be reduced on October 1, 2016.\n       Finally, P.L. 110-389, the Veterans' Benefits Improvement \n     Act of 2008, authorized VA to temporarily guarantee mortgages \n     with higher loan values in recognition of the high cost of \n     housing in several areas of the country. This authorization \n     expired on December 31, 2011.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 15 of S. 951, as reported, would amend the fee \n     schedule set forth in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38, U.S.C., \n     by extending VA's authority to collect certain fees and by \n     adjusting the amount of the fees. Specifically, the section \n     would amend section 3729(b)(2)(B)(ii) by striking ``January \n     1, 2004, and before October 1, 2011'' and inserting ``October \n     1, 2011, and before October 1, 2014,'' and by striking \n     ``3.30'' both places it appears and inserting ``3.00.''\n       The section also would amend section 3729(b)(2)(B)(i) by \n     striking ``January 1, 2004'' and inserting ``October 1, \n     2011'' and by striking ``3.00'' both places it appears and \n     inserting ``3.30.'' The section would also strike clause \n     (iii) and re-designate clause (iv) as clause (iii). Clause \n     (iii), as re-designated, would be amended by striking \n     ``October 1, 2013'' and inserting ``October 1, 2014.''\n     House Bill\n       Section 501 of H.R. 2433, as amended, would amend section \n     3720(h)(2) to extend VA's pooling authority for mortgages \n     until December 31, 2016. The section also would amend the fee \n     schedule set forth in section 3729(b)(2) of title 38, U.S.C., \n     by extending VA's authority to collect certain fees and by \n     adjusting the amount of the fees. Specifically, the section \n     would amend section 3729(b)(2)(A)(iii) and 3729(b)(2)(A)(iv) \n     by striking ``November 18, 2011'', and inserting ``October 1, \n     2017''.\n       The section also would amend section 3729(b)(2)(B)(i) by \n     striking ``November 18, 2011'' and inserting ``October 1, \n     2017''. The section also would strike clause (ii) and (iii) \n     and re-designate clause (iv) as clause (ii). The section also \n     would amend section 3729(b)(2)(C)(i) and 3729(b)(2)(C)(ii) by \n     striking ``November 18, 2011'' and inserting ``October 1, \n     2017''. The section also would amend section 3729(b)(2)(D)(i) \n     and 3729(b)(2)(D)(ii) by striking ``November 18, 2011'' and \n     inserting ``October 1, 2017''.\n       Finally, this section also would amend section 501 of the \n     Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 to extend the \n     authority to temporarily guarantee mortgages with higher loan \n     values in certain areas of the country until December 31, \n     2014.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 702 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the House Bill.\n\n\n REQUIREMENT FOR PLAN FOR REGULAR ASSESSMENT OF EMPLOYEES OF VETERANS \n      BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION WHO HANDLE PROCESSING OF CLAIMS FOR \n                        COMPENSATION AND PENSION\n\n     Current Law\n       Under current law, section 7732A of title 38, U.S.C., VA \n     shall provide for an examination of appropriate employees and \n     managers of the Veterans Benefits Administration \n     (hereinafter, ``VBA'') who are responsible for processing \n     claims for compensation and pension benefits under the laws \n     administered by VA. In developing the required examination, \n     VA must consult with appropriate individuals or entities, \n     including examination development experts, interested \n     stakeholders, and employee representatives; and consider the \n     data gathered and produced under section 7731(c)(3) of title \n     38, U.S.C., which establishes a quality assurance program \n     within VBA.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 2349, as amended, allows for VA to take a \n     more deliberate approach to the skills assessments required \n     by section 7723A of title 38, U.S.C., by requiring biennial \n     assessments of appropriate employees and managers at five \n     regional offices (hereinafter, ``ROs'') from 2012 through \n     2016. The assessments would be required of appropriate \n     employees and managers responsible for processing claims for \n     compensation and pension benefits. If employees or managers \n     receive a less-than-satisfactory score on the assessment \n     exam, VA would be required to provide appropriate remediation \n     training so that the assessment exam could be taken again. \n     If, after remediation, an employee or manager again gets a \n     less-than-satisfactory score, VA would then be required to \n     take appropriate personnel action. Section 2 would authorize \n     $5 million over five years to carry out the biennial \n     assessments, the results of which VA would be required to \n     report to Congress.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 703 of the Compromise Agreement requires VA to \n     submit a plan to the Committees detailing how VA will \n     regularly asses the skills and competencies of appropriate \n     VBA employees and managers, provide training to remediate \n     deficiencies in skills and competencies, reassess skills and \n     competencies following remediation, and take appropriate \n     personnel action following remediation training and \n     reassessment if skills and competencies remain \n     unsatisfactory.\n       The Committees believe certification testing could be used \n     to more broadly influence the type of training or remediation \n     necessary at the individual employee level in order to \n     improve the accuracy of claims decisions. This Compromise \n     Agreement reflects the Committees' sensitivities to the \n     concerns expressed by VA regarding the cost and management \n     difficulties associated with annual testing and follow-up \n     remediation of every employee. As a result, it allows VA to \n     provide the Committees with a plan to accomplish the intent \n     of the Committees, which is to use certification testing as a \n     way to influence the type of training and remediation \n     necessary for individual employees, in order to improve the \n     accuracy of claims decisions.\n\n\nMODIFICATION OF PROVISION RELATING TO REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR AMBULANCE \n                                SERVICES\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 111(b)(3)(A) of title 38, U.S.C., states that VA \n     shall not reimburse for special modes of travel unless such \n     mode was medically required and authorized in advance by VA \n     or was a medical emergency. Subparagraph (B) states that VA \n     may provide payment to the provider of special transportation \n     and subsequently recover the amount from the beneficiary if \n     they are determined to be ineligible. Subparagraph (C) states \n     that for ambulance services the transportation provider may \n     be paid either the actual charge or the amount determined in \n     the Social Security Act fee schedule, whichever is less.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 704 of the Compromise Agreement amends section \n     111(b)(3)(c) of title 38, U.S.C., by striking ``under \n     subparagraph (B)'' and inserting ``to or from a Department \n     facility.''\n\n\n        CHANGE IN COLLECTION AND VERIFICATION OF VETERAN INCOME\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 1722 of title 38, U.S.C., defines ``attributable \n     income'' as a veteran's income from the previous year and \n     sets out guidelines for determining such income.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     House Bill\n       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 705 of the Compromise Agreement amends section \n     1722(f)(1) of title 38, U.S.C., by striking ``the previous \n     year'' and inserting ``the most recent year for which \n     information is available.''\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\n       DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ENFORCEMENT PENALTIES FOR \n  MISREPRESENTATION OF A BUSINESS CONCERN AS A SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN \n OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY VETERANS OR AS A SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN OWNED \n              AND CONTROLLED BY SERVICE-DISABLED VETERANS\n\n     Current Law\n       Under 38 U.S.C. 8127(g), the Department is directed to \n     debar for a reasonable period of time any business concern \n     determined by VA to have misrepresented its status as a small \n     business concern owned and controlled by veterans, or as a \n     small business concern owned and controlled by service-\n     disabled veterans.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 703 of S. 914, as reported, would amend section \n     8127(g) of title 38, U.S.C., by requiring that the Department \n     debar any firm determined by VA to have deliberately \n     misrepresented its status for a period of not less than five \n     years, and that such debarment also would include all \n     principals of the firm for a period of not less than five \n     years. The section also would require the Department to \n     commence any debarment action within 30 days of its \n     determination that the firm misrepresented its status.\n     House Bill\n       H.R. 1657 would amend section 8127(g) of title 38, U.S.C., \n     to require that VA debar a company and its principals from \n     contracting with VA for a period of not less than five years, \n     if it is determined that the company has misrepresented its \n     status. H.R. 1657 also requires VA to begin a debarment \n     action by not later than 30 days after determining that the \n     firm misrepresented its status, and to complete the debarment \n     process within 90 days after the finding of \n     misrepresentation.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 706 of the Compromise Agreement follows generally \n     both the Senate and House Bills. The Compromise Agreement \n     adopts and clarifies the standard of deliberateness as set \n     forth in section 703 of S. 914, by defining a deliberate \n     misrepresentation as one that is willful and intentional.\n\n\n     QUARTERLY REPORTS TO CONGRESS ON CONFERENCES SPONSORED BY THE \n                               DEPARTMENT\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no provision in current law in regards to \n     reporting to Congress on conferences of VA.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no similar provisions.\n     House Bill\n       Section 1 of H.R. 2302, as amended, amends subchapter I of \n     chapter 5 of title 38, U.S.C., to require VA to provide \n     Congress with information regarding the cost of covered \n     conferences.\n       Subsection (a) would require that VA submit a quarterly \n     report to the Committees detailing the expenses related to \n     conferences hosted or co-hosted by VA. It also requires that \n     VA submit this quarterly report within 30 days of the end of \n     the quarter.\n       Subsection (b) would require that the reports include \n     actual expenses for conferences occurring during the previous \n     quarter related to: transportation and parking; per diem \n     payments; lodging; rentals of halls, auditoriums, or other \n     spaces; rental of equipment; refreshments; entertainment; \n     contractors; and brochures or printed material. It also \n     requires that the report include an estimate of the expected \n     conference expenses for the next quarter.\n       Subsection (c) defines covered conferences that will be \n     included in the report as those that are attended by 50 or \n     more individuals, including one or more employees of VA, or \n     have an estimated cost of at least $20,000.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 707 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     Bill. With a growing deficit, and scarce discretionary \n     funding resources, the Committees are concerned about the \n     significant growth in costs that are not directly related to \n     the mission of providing services and benefits to veterans. \n     While the Committees are concerned with the significant cost \n     of such conferences, this section would not limit VA's travel \n     budget or eliminate any conferences. The Committees \n     understand that it is often advantageous for VA employees to \n     meet face-to-face for training and leadership development, \n     but believe that there must be more transparency and \n     oversight of these meetings.\n\n\n   PUBLICATION OF DATA ON EMPLOYMENT OF CERTAIN VETERANS BY FEDERAL \n                              CONTRACTORS\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 4212 of title 38, U.S.C., requires companies with \n     federal contracts worth $100,000 or more to have an \n     affirmative action plan to hire veterans and to report \n     certain veteran-related employment data annually to the U.S. \n     Department of Labor (hereinafter, ``DoL''). This data is \n     compiled by DoL but there is no requirement to make the data \n     available to the public.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bills contain no similar provisions.\n     House Bill\n       Section 3 of H.R. 2302, as amended, amends section 4212(d) \n     of title 38, U.S.C., to require the Department of Labor \n     (hereinafter, ``DoL'') to publish on an Internet Web site, \n     reports submitted by government contractors on the results of \n     their affirmative action plans to hire veterans.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 708 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     Bill.\n\n\n                         VETSTAR AWARD PROGRAM\n\n     Current Law\n       There is no requirement in current law that VA recognize \n     businesses for their contributions to veterans employment.\n     Senate Bill\n       The Senate Bill contains no similar provisions.\n     House Bill\n       H.R. 802 amends section 532 of title 38, U.S.C., to direct \n     VA to establish a VetStar award program to annually recognize \n     businesses that have made significant contributions to \n     veterans employment.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 709 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     Bill.\n\n\n   EXTENDED PERIOD OF PROTECTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF UNIFORMED SERVICES \n       RELATING TO MORTGAGES, MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE, AND EVICTION\n\n     Current Law\n       Section 2203 of Public Law 110-289, the Housing and \n     Economic Recovery Act of 2008, amended the Servicemembers \n     Civil Relief Act (hereinafter, ``SCRA''), by extending from \n     90 days to 9 months after military service, the period of \n     protection for servicemembers against mortgage foreclosure, \n     and the time period during which a court may stay proceedings \n     or adjust obligations. These protections were scheduled to \n     expire on December 31, 2010. Public Law 111-346, the Helping \n     Heroes Keep Their Homes Act of 2010, extended the enhanced \n     protections through December 31, 2012.\n     Senate Bill\n       Section 302 of S. 914, as reported, would extend from 9 \n     months to 12 months after military service, the period of \n     protection against mortgage foreclosure, and the period in \n     which a court may stay a proceeding or adjust an obligation. \n     It also would require the Comptroller General to report on \n     certain foreclosure protections.\n     House Bill\n       Section 1 of H.R. 1263, as amended, would amend section 303 \n     of the SCRA extend mortgage related protections to surviving \n     spouses of servicemembers who die on active duty, or whose \n     death is service-connected. This protection would preclude a \n     lending institution from foreclosing on property owned by the \n     surviving spouse until at least 12 months following the \n     servicemember's death. This provision would be effective with \n     the enactment of this bill and would sunset five years from \n     the date of enactment.\n       Section 2 of H.R. 1263, as amended, would require all \n     lending institutions covered by the SCRA to designate an \n     employee who is responsible for the institution's compliance \n     with SCRA and who is responsible for providing information to \n     customers covered by the SCRA. Section 2 would require any \n     institution with annual assets of $10 billion in the previous \n     fiscal year to maintain a toll-free telephone number for \n     their customers. It also would require these institutions to \n     publish this toll-free number on their website.\n       Section 3 of H.R. 1263, as amended, would amend section \n     303(b) of the SCRA to extend the protection allowing a court \n     to stay proceedings and adjust obligations related to real or \n     personal property for SCRA covered property from 9 months \n     after the servicemember's period of military service, to 12 \n     months. Section 3 would amend section 303(c) of the SCRA to \n     extend the protection preventing foreclosure or seizure for \n     SCRA covered property from 9 months after the servicemember's \n     period of military service to 12 months. These protections \n     would sunset five years after enactment of the House bill.\n     Compromise Agreement\n       Section 710 of the Compromise Agreement generally follows \n     the Senate's position except the agreement includes an \n     effective date 180 days after enactment, and a provision \n     extending the enhanced protections of this Compromise \n     Agreement through December 31, 2014.\n       It is the Committees' view that inclusion of a sunset \n     provision will continue the enhanced mortgage protections \n     provided by this bill, but also will allow GAO sufficient \n     time to collect information on the impact of these provisions \n     on the financial well-being of servicemembers before allowing \n     the enhanced protections to expire.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Murray \nsubstitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read three times; and the statutory pay-go statement be \nread.\n  The amendment (No. 2559), in the nature of a substitute, was agreed \nto.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under `` Text of \namendments.'')\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
