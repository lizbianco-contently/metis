Madam President, as the Senate gets back to work this \nweek, it is worth noting that a sea change appears to have taken place \nin Washington over the past few weeks. Just 2 months ago, the President \nproposed a vision of government that ignored the fiscal crisis \nvirtually everyone else in the country knows we need to address. And \nDemocrats in Congress proposed that rather than cutting Washington \nspending, we instead raise taxes on oil and gas companies, who, as we \nknow, would pass it along to American consumers in the form of higher \ngas prices, at a time when gas prices are double what they were a mere \n2 years ago.\n  In other words, it wasn't that long ago that both the White House and \nDemocrat leaders in Congress were doing everything they could to ignore \nthe Nation's $14 trillion debt and to preserve the massive growth in \ngovernment that they have presided over the past 2 years. But at some \npoint in the past few weeks, Democrats in Washington finally got the \nmessage. The ground shifted and spending reductions Democrats recently \ndescribed as ``extreme'' and ``draconian,'' they are now calling \n``historic'' and ``commonsense.'' The debate has turned from how much \nto grow government to how much to reduce it.\n  This is a major departure from the standard Democrat position--and it \nsuggests one of two things: either Democrats in Washington are finally \nwaking up to the fact that our only hope of averting the kind of \ndisaster we are seeing unfold in Europe is by forcing Washington to \nlive within its means, or they have made a political calculation that \nAmericans will no longer take them seriously if they continue to \npretend otherwise. But either way, there now appears to be a bipartisan \nagreement in Washington that something serious must be done. Which \nbrings us to an announcement by the\n\n[[Page S2366]]\n\nObama administration's top political advisor over the weekend that the \nPresident will change his position on entitlement reform, the deficit, \nand debt in a speech he will deliver tomorrow afternoon.\n  According to the administration officials, the President will now \npropose an outline of his goals in these areas. Apparently the \nPresident is finally ready to acknowledge problems that the rest of the \ncountry has been waiting for him to address. It is unfortunate that he \nhad to be dragged into this discussion. But those on the left and right \nwho have been clamoring for presidential leadership on these issues \nhave to welcome the President's long-awaited decision to engage on \nthem.\n  We all look forward to hearing what the President has to say, but it \nis my hope that in doing so, he offers more than the outline his \npolitical adviser suggested. As we know, House Republicans have put \nforward a detailed plan that seeks to preserve and protect Medicare for \ncurrent beneficiaries and strengthen Medicaid, in part, by giving \nStates more flexibility to implement it. At a time when thousands of \nbaby boomers are retiring every day, putting even more pressure on our \nalready overburdened finances, creative solutions like these are \nneeded.\n  Hopefully the President will put forward a plan that does not just \npay lipservice to the commitments we have made to seniors and the poor, \nbut which acknowledges the unique problems that this generation and a \nrising generation of Americans face. Too often, it seems, Democrats in \nWashington claim to be interested in helping those in need, when what \nthey really seek is to protect big government. Meanwhile, Republicans \nare developing solutions that will enable us to keep our commitments to \nseniors even as we create new opportunities for the young and middle \nclass with low-tax policies that lead to private sector job growth. \nWhereas Republicans see America growing its way to prosperity, \nDemocrats seem to want to constrict opportunities for everyone, so \neveryone is forced to do with less--except, of course, the politically \nconnected and those who are lucky enough to get a waiver.\n  But at least the President is joining in the conversation. Hopefully \nthat conversation is an adult one, and does not devolve into the kind \nof unhelpful scripted, and frankly juvenile, name-calling that we saw \nin the closing hours of the debate over the continuing resolution last \nweek. We all know that both sides will have to play a part in \naddressing the crises we face, so we would do well to leave all \ndishonest rhetoric aside. Both sides want to preserve what is best \nabout America. If both sides acknowledge that up front, as we move from \na conversation about billions to trillions, we will have much progress \neven though we have much work ahead of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2366-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I am always moved to hear the Pledge of \nAllegiance that marks the beginning of a new legislative day in the \nSenate. On the 150th anniversary of the beginning of the Civil War, the \nwords ``one nation, indivisible'' mean more today than most other days. \nAlong with Chaplain Black's inspired invocation, the pledge motivates \nus and reminds us of the true purpose of our work. Together, they \nrecall our responsibility to our country, to our countrymen, and to our \nconscience.\n  I am particularly pleased to see the Senate open this morning. As we \nall know, last week at this time, even as recently as just a few \nevenings ago, whether the government would stay open was a very real \nquestion. As I said here late on Friday night, I am pleased we reached \nan agreement on a budget in time to keep the country operating.\n  I am pleased that the budget will make historic cuts, saving the \ncountry money so we can lower our deficit and do a better job of living \nwithin our meanings.\n  At the beginning of this debate and throughout the last few weeks, I \nreminded the Senate that in this negotiation, as in any negotiation, \nneither side would get everything they wanted. From the start I also \nexpressed my firm belief that what we cut would always be more \nimportant than how much. That is because our Nation's budget is a \nrepresentation of our values and of what we value. It is one of the \nmany ways we demonstrate as a Congress and a country what matters most \nto us, what is important. This concept is not unique to Democrats.\n  As the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the House Budget \nCommittee have both said, our budget is a moral document.\n  Those following the budget debate have noticed something \nunmistakable. While both parties may agree in principle that a budget \nis more than simply a collection of numbers, our positions couldn't be \nmore different. We stayed true to our values. We value the rights of \nAmericans to afford a healthy life. That is why we passed historic \nhealth reform last year, but Republicans tried to use the budget to \nrepeal those rights. We stayed true to our values, and we didn't let \nthem.\n  We value women's health, but Republicans tried to use the budget to \nmake it harder for women to get contraception that reduces abortions. \nTheir budget also tried to make it harder for women to get cancer \nscreenings, and they even tried to slash funding for cancer research. \nWe stayed true to our values and we didn't let them.\n  We also value seniors' ability to support themselves, but Republicans \ntried to use the budget to slice the Social Security Administration. \nThat would have meant delays for seniors and disabled Americans who \ncount on the benefits they have earned over a lifetime of hard work. \nThey also tried to use the budget to reopen the doughnut hole which \nwould have sent seniors' prescription drugs skyrocketing. We stayed \ntrue to our values; we didn't let them.\n  We value our children's education, but Republicans tried to use the \nbudget to kick little boys and girls out of prekindergarten programs \nand slash Pell grants that help so many students afford college. We \nstayed true to our values and we didn't let them.\n  We value our environment, but Republicans tried to use the budget to \ngive polluters a free pass to poison the air we breathe. We stayed true \nto our values and we didn't let them. We value our economic security, \nbut Republicans tried to repeal the promise we made to taxpayers that \nthey will never again be asked to bail out a big bank when the bank \nloses its risky bets. They tried to use the budget to reverse rules we \nput in place to hold Wall Street accountable. We stayed true to our \nvalues and we didn't let them.\n  Finally, we value our responsibility to create jobs, but Republicans \nalso tried to use the budget to reverse the momentum we have seen in \nrecent months. The policies they tried to jam through the budget would \nhave cost us\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\n700,000 jobs and slammed the breaks on our economic growth. We stayed \ntrue to our values and we didn't let them.\n  There are many more examples in this vast budget, examples of \nprograms Republicans wanted to destroy but Democrats demanded we \nprotect. There are many examples where they wanted to cut recklessly \nand we insisted on cutting responsibly. Throughout this debate, we \nstayed true to our values. The American people noticed, and they are \nglad we did. By clear majorities our constituents are glad we stood up \nfor health reform, women's health, cleaner air, and on and on.\n  This budget battle has once again illustrated for the American people \nthe fundamental differences between the two parties. In some cases our \npriorities are poles apart. That is obvious to the American people, as \nwell it should be. They are the ones who will always decide whether the \nmorals of their representatives more closely match their own.\n  As we work toward finalizing this year's budget, we start the \nconversation about next year's budget, and we engage in the many other \ndebates before us, Democrats will continue to insist on policies that \nreflect and respect our values.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my time be charged against leader time \nand not morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2367-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FREE CHOICE VOUCHERS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in one cruel swoop late last week, more \nthan 300,000 Americans lost the opportunity to buy affordable health \ninsurance for years to come. Specifically, I am talking about the \nremoval behind closed doors by budget negotiators of the free choice \nvoucher provision that would have been a lifeline to hundreds of \nthousands of low-income Americans.\n  One could say: Senator Wyden, everybody has to give a little during \ntough times. Why is this different?\n  The difference is that hundreds of thousands of Americans without \nhealth care options, in a process that doesn't even have any direct \ncost to the Federal budget, are being asked to give up a guarantee of \ncoverage just a year after passage of the Affordable Care Act. They are \ngoing to be forced to make a Hobson's choice between unaffordable \ninsurance and going without health care, directly contradicting the \ntheoretical underpinnings of the Affordable Care Act. Under that \nprovision, those whose income falls below 400 percent of the poverty \nline and whose employer-sponsored health insurance premiums are between \n8 and just under 10 percent would be exempt from having to purchase \nhealth coverage.\n  Unfortunately, now that they do not have access to the exchanges, \nthey will also not qualify for government assistance to insurance. The \nprovision leaves hundreds of thousands of Americans who need health \ncare as a lifeline out in the cold.\n  With free choice, however, folks who fell into this hole and couldn't \nafford the plan they were offered at work could use their employer's \ncontribution. They could have gotten a voucher to choose a more \nappropriate affordable plan in the exchange. The amount of the voucher \nwould be set at the same percentage that employers pay today: 70 \npercent of the cost of a typical plan. The amount would be fixed, \ngiving employers certainty in the cost of doing business. For these \nfamilies, it could mean the difference between being able to buy a \nhealth plan they could afford or going without coverage. If they found \na plan in the exchange that's cheaper that was cheaper than the voucher \namount, but gave them everything they needed, they could have pocketed \nthe difference in cost. This gives that family an incentive to shop for \nlower cost coverage and helps hold down everyone's health care costs.\n  This kind of concept is not only good for the employee, it is good \nfor our businesses, particularly the small businesses that so strongly \nback this provision. When the impact of free choice was proposed during \nthe health reform debate, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimated that more than 300,000 families could \nbenefit from this new approach to choice and competition. That was \nthen.\n  Since passage of the health care reform law, the need for free choice \nvouchers is greater than ever. The Kaiser Family Foundation, in their \nrecent analysis, found that employers, even since the law, are shifting \nmore of the health care cost on to the backs of the workers. In that \nanalysis, The Kaiser Family Foundation reported that the typical \nincrease for family coverage went up three percent on average last \nyear, but the cost for the typical worker went up 14 percent. The \nemployer was paying virtually none of that increase. The worker was \neating almost all of it because costs were being shifted from employers \non to the backs of the workers. So if anything, even more people would \nlikely need free choice vouchers, and would have been eligible to use \nthem, than was originally envisioned when we passed the law.\n  I am of the view that it is not that businesses don't want to provide \naffordable benefits to workers. It is just making less and less sense \nto do so given the way the current system operates. Incentives would \nnot change in 2014, leaving an increasing number of families with a \nchoice between the unaffordable and the unavailable. Up until late last \nweek, in the dark of night, those families had a choice. They had a \nchoice, a third path. The two that I mentioned, unaffordable and \nunavailable, were not very appealing, and free choice vouchers would \nhave created a third option that would have worked for those families. \nThey would have had a chance to take their pretax dollars provided by \ntheir employer to the free market exchange and decide for themselves \nwhich plans they could afford that provide the benefits they need.\n\n  Free choice is good for workers, it is good for business, it is good \nfor our country's bottom line; it offers a way to rein in higher health \ncare costs by putting purchasing power back into the hands of the \nconsumer. Once people know they are paying for their health coverage \nand can shop for a plan that answers their specific needs, costs will \ncome down.\n  We hear often colleagues on both sides of the aisle talk about choice \nand competition and market forces. What this did was provide a chance \nfor both sides to take principles they hold dear, expanding coverage \nwith a market based approach for workers who are hurting, and say: Free \nchoice vouchers can do that. The arguments against free choice didn't \nstart with Democrats or Republicans. The arguments started with the \ninterest groups, the lobbies, the special interests that have a vested \nstake in holding their employees captive and locking them into this \nincredibly inefficient status quo.\n  This provision has no budget impact in the fiscal year. Three hundred \nthousand low-income Americans are being hurt in this budget bill for \nsomething that spends no money in the upcoming year; 300,000 Americans \nwith no acceptable alternative to make sure that when they go to bed at \nnight with their families they can take care of an illness or a medical \nexpense that comes up in the morning.\n  I don't think this had to be. Clearly, if we had had the opportunity \nin an open forum to address this, there would have been a different \nresult because that is how it got into the law in the first place. I \nwant to make sure colleagues know we will have to be back here to get \nsome relief for the 300,000 Americans we put out in the cold as a \nresult of that particular provision. I hope, once again, we can do it \nin a fashion that brings Democrats and Republicans together the way \nfree choice vouchers and the principles it represents did in the first \nplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Since I came to the Senate, I have worked to reform the way \nCongress conducts our own business, reducing the budget of Congress, \nfighting for appropriations project reform, and working to restore our \npay-as-you-go rules and the budget process to ensure we are only \nfunding new programs if outdated or duplicative programs are cut.\n  I was one of a handful who fought for the creation of the fiscal \ncommission, and I have supported efforts by both Republicans and \nDemocrats to responsibly reduce the deficit. We wouldn't have even had \nthe commission that worked all this past year and came up with a report \nthat many people thought would just collect dust on the shelf, but that \nhasn't been the case. That is because a number of Senators last year \nsaid: We are not going to take this anymore. The country can't take \nthis anymore. We will stand up and make sure the deficit commission \ngets started. We are going to make sure we get strong people on the \ncommission, which was achieved, and that they produce something that is \nmeaningful.\n  Right now as we speak, a number of our colleagues, a small group of \nsix, are working on the results from that commission report, and we are \nhopeful they will come together in a bipartisan agreement.\n  Last year, I supported the efforts of my colleagues, Senators \nSessions and McCaskill, to enact discretionary spending caps. While \nthis proposal could not by itself balance the budget, restraining \ndiscretionary spending growth is an important piece of the puzzle and \nwill result in real budget savings.\n  I voted with Senator Coburn to cut hundreds of billions of dollars in \nFederal spending by consolidating duplicative government programs and \nsupported Senator Bennet's successful effort to rescind $180 billion in \nunused TARP funds to pay down the deficit. In the first 4 months of \nthis year, I have supported $12 billion in cuts and have pushed for \nmany more.\n  These are all important steps. What our country needs now is for \nCongress to reach across the aisle and build consensus around a \ncomprehensive, long-term deficit reduction package that will put us on \ntrack to prosperity.\n  Ever since the economic downturn, families across the country have \nhuddled around the kitchen table making tough choices about what they \nhold most dear and what they can learn to live without. They expect and \ndeserve that their leaders do the same. The American people are \ncounting on us to put politics aside, to pull together and not pull \napart, to not go to the opposite corners of the boxing ring and simply \nthrow darts at each other. They expect us to agree on a plan to live \nwithin our means and make America strong for the long haul.\n  If we are going to succeed in this challenge, we will ultimately have \nto accept what we do not necessarily agree with in an effort to develop \na plan that is both balanced and comprehensive. We already know much \nabout what will need to be done. Our failure to act has not been \nbecause we lack solutions but because Congress has lacked the political \nwill to get behind proposals that on their own sometimes are not always \nthat popular. I support the work being done by my colleagues, Senators \nWarner, Chambliss, Durbin, Crapo, Coburn, and Conrad, and look forward \nto working with them to put forward a serious, comprehensive deficit \nproposal.\n  Tomorrow, the President will be laying out his recommendations for a \ncomprehensive deficit reduction package. Much of the recent debate over \ndeficit reduction has been dominated by talk of how best to cut \nprograms that millions of American seniors and the most vulnerable in \nour society rely on every day. While I believe entitlement reforms must \nbe a part of a comprehensive solution, I believe there are also several \nother key steps we can take to address our deficit in a meaningful way.\n  As you know, Madam President, we started down the road of entitlement \nreform with some of the efficiency measures we put in for Medicare. \nThose can be expanded. I know my State has always delivered high-\nquality low-cost health care, and we need to do that in more of the \ncountry when it comes to Medicare.\n  With Social Security, there are some excellent ideas to strengthen \nSocial Security, to make it more solvent. I think we need to look at \nthose, but we have to make very clear we will not be balancing this \nbudget on the backs of seniors but that with any measures we take to \nreform Social Security, those savings will go directly into Social \nSecurity--not to be used to reduce the deficit--to make Social Security \nstronger in the long term.\n  That is what we need to do. I think the rest of the world, when they \nlook at these kinds of ideas and the measures we can take, will say: Do \nyou know what. America is getting it back together. It is not stealing \nfrom other parts of the budget paying for Social Security. It is \nactually making Social Security stronger by finding a way to make it \nlast longer and be there for our seniors today as well as seniors for \nthe future.\n  Now, I want to talk about a few of the steps I think we could take \nand I hope will be included in the President's suggestions and in the \ndeficit commission report.\n  First, we need to get serious about making our government work more \nefficiently by reducing programs that have become duplicative or \noutdated.\n  Last month, the Government Accountability Office released a report \nthat identified 82 different programs with similar descriptions in 10 \ndifferent agencies for roads and trains, 47 for training and \nemployment, and 56 to help people understand finances. The \nrecommendations laid out in this report could save hundreds of billions \nof dollars, not by making Draconian cuts, not by taking drastic \nmeasures, but simply by eliminating waste.\n  There are plenty of other examples of savings we could find right \nhere in Washington, with Congress and with our Federal agencies.\n  To begin, we could eliminate billions of dollars in waste in Federal \ncontracts. How? By ending the practice of giving bonuses to government \ncontractors who overcharge and underperform. By requiring Federal \nagencies to set strong standards for awarding contract bonuses--\nstandards that reward contractors based on the quality of their work \nand their ability to meet deadlines--we could save $8 billion.\n  We could cut back on unnecessary costs in the Federal Government's \nday-to-day spending, such as printing expenses. Civilian Federal \nemployees spend an estimated $1.3 billion on office printing every \nyear, and it is estimated that $440 million of that printing is \n``unnecessary.'' If we could cut that $440 million in waste alone on \nthe unnecessary printing, we could save $4.4 billion over 10 years.\n  Then there is the $4 billion we spend on Federal vehicles every year. \nIf we could cut that budget by 20 percent, we could save $800 million a \nyear and $8 billion over 10 years.\n  Additionally, the Federal Government is the largest property owner in \nthe country, with an inventory of more than 1.2 million buildings and \nstructures--some of it unused. It does not make sense for taxpayers to \ncontinue paying for upkeep of these properties when we could sell them \nor repurpose them to make them more efficient. We could capture $15 \nbillion in savings on our deficit by selling properties that have been \nidentified as excess and eliminating their upkeep costs. Obviously, I \nam not talking about all Federal properties, but these are properties \nthat have been identified as excess.\n  There are also a number of ways to cut waste from our health care \nspending. We should start by ending the giveaway to the pharmaceutical \ncompanies and allow for price negotiations with prescription drugs in \nMedicare Part D.\n  Unfortunately, the ``noninterference'' clause in the Medicare Part D \nprescription drug benefit expressly prohibits Medicare from negotiating \nlower prices from pharmaceutical companies. This prohibition has \nimposed substantial and unnecessary costs on America's taxpayers and \nseniors who are paying excessive prices for prescription drugs. With \nMedicare barred from negotiating discounts, seniors face inflated \nprices for their medications, while the pharmaceutical industry gets a \nfinancial windfall.\n  I am fighting to change that so our seniors can have access to their \nmedicines at the lowest possible prices, and\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\nI have introduced a bill, along with Senators Begich and Blumenthal, \nthat would allow for price negotiations. Allowing Medicare to directly \nnegotiate these prices, as the Veterans' Administration does, could \nsave us $240 billion over the next 10 years.\n  We also need to take a more serious look at Medicare fraud. Law \nenforcement authorities estimate Medicare fraud costs taxpayers more \nthan $60 billion every year. This means as much as 20 percent of total \nMedicare spending is lost to fraud each year.\n  To help combat these types of fraud, I have introduced the IMPROVE \nAct--Improving Medicaid/Medicare Payment Policy for Reimbursement \nthrough Oversight and Efficiency--which would help deter fraud by \nrequiring direct depositing of all payments made to providers under \nMedicaid and Medicare. These criminals scheme the system to rob \nAmerican taxpayers of money that should be used to provide health care \nto those who need it most. We must put a stop to it. Putting an end to \nwaste, fraud, and abuse is a critical step to save taxpayer dollars as \nwe look for ways to make our health care system more efficient. But we \nneed to continue to look for other ways to make our government and the \nway Washington works more efficient as well.\n  I mentioned efforts to reduce duplicative programs in our government, \nbut we should also take a close look at the different agencies. For \nexample, we could cut $75 billion from our defense spending by \nrestructuring our budget and increasing efficiency. Whether it is \nholding civilian workforce levels where they were in fiscal year 2010, \nwhich would save $13 billion, or making targeted changes to Pentagon \nmissions and priorities, which would save $11 billion, or even just \ndoing away with unnecessary studies and internal reports, which would \nsave $1 billion, these cuts all add up.\n  Secretary Gates has proposed and supports these cuts, and I believe \nthey are necessary as we look for ways to streamline our government and \nreduce our deficit. When Secretary Gates says he does not need a \ncertain type of a plane because he has another plane, I think we should \nlisten to that as we look at how we are going to save money in this \ngovernment.\n\n  In addition to cuts in spending and efforts to streamline our \ngovernment, we also need to take a serious look at revenues and ways we \ncan streamline our Tax Code to pay down our debt and ensure that the \nUnited States remains competitive in this global world.\n  Despite the fact that Federal revenue is at the lowest level as a \npercentage of GDP since 1946, our efforts last year to let the tax \nrates for the wealthiest Americans return to what they were under \nPresident Clinton were blocked even though it would save $690 billion \nover the next decade. You have said it, Madam President, for people \nmaking over $1 million--ror those people who make over $1 million a \nyear, if you have their taxes set at the levels during the Clinton \nera--at a time when we were very prosperous--you would save nearly $400 \nbillion in 10 years on the deficit. While not all my colleagues agree \non how or even whether we should raise more revenue, every serious \nbipartisan proposal has made it a clear must.\n  In the quarter century since the last comprehensive tax reform, the \nsystem has been riddled with expenditures that benefit special \ninterests and hurt competitiveness. These expenditures add up quickly, \ncosting us over $1 trillion a year. For example, despite oil and gas \ncompanies reporting record profits in recent years, they will receive \nan estimated $35 billion in tax breaks over the next decade. And there \nare many companies that attempt to evade our tax system altogether. \nClosing these loopholes could save tens of millions of dollars for \nAmerican taxpayers. Expenditures such as these riddle the individual \nincome Tax Code as well.\n  One aspect that is worth looking at--and something near and dear to \nthe heart of every American who owns a home--is the mortgage interest \ndeduction. I have used it. Everyone I know who has bought a house has \nused it. Here is the deal. The deduction is expected to lower tax \nrevenues by nearly $500 billion from 2010 to 2013. However, most of the \nbenefits do not go to the middle class. So one idea--and this came out \nof the fiscal commission--is to make sure those benefits are firmly \nthere for the middle class; that is, to set the credit at equal to 12 \npercent of interest payments on up to $500,000 of mortgage debt on \nprincipal residences. So here is what this means. If you buy a house \nfor $1 million, you still get the mortgage deduction, but it is up to \n$500,000 in the value of the home. If you get a house for $300,000 or \nfor $400,000, it is not going to change the mortgage deduction at all. \nBut what does it do for taxpayers? Well, phased in slowly to protect \nthe housing market, this proposal would save $400 billion or more over \nthe next decade.\n  By taking steps such as these, we can lower tax rates, broaden the \nbase, simplify the Tax Code, and at the same time bring down the \ndeficit. This will benefit working families and make America more \ncompetitive in the global economy.\n  These ideas are just a few of the ideas that I believe warrant a \ncloser look and should be considered as we look to reduce our Nation's \ndeficit. Together, they represent at least $1 trillion in savings that \ncould be included as part of a bipartisan, long-term deficit reduction \nplan, in addition to a lot of the work we have already done this year \nfor spending cuts. We can look at some additional ideas for next year, \nand there are many, many more. These are just simply some I hope the \nPresident includes in his proposal and that the deficit commission \nincludes as well.\n  Tomorrow we will hear from the President, and I hope we hear a plan \nthat reflects the challenges we face as a nation, that builds on the \nwork of the fiscal commission, and that brings both parties to the \ntable for a grownup debate.\n  The sooner we can agree on a long-term package of smart cuts, the \nbetter for our economy and the better for our country. I am hoping we \ncan put partisan differences aside to work on an agenda that \nstrengthens our economy, promotes fiscal responsibility, and increases \nglobal competitiveness because if we refuse to have an honest \nconversation about this, if we insist on just using the debate as a \nvehicle for angry rhetoric and an excuse for taking cheap political \nshots, we will not just be doing ourselves a disservice and this \ninstitution a disservice, we will be cheating our children and our \ngrandchildren out of knowing the America in which we grew up.\n  The deficit is not just going to fix itself. We all know that. We all \nknow we cannot just close our eyes, click our heels, and--poof--the \ndebt goes away. In their report, the National Commission on Fiscal \nResponsibility wrote that ``every modest sacrifice we refuse to make \ntoday only forces far greater sacrifices of hope and opportunity upon \nthe next generation.'' And they are right. The longer we wait, the more \nwrenching the choices become, the more we set ourselves up for becoming \nanother Greece or Ireland and having a potential meltdown in our \nfinancial system. But do you know who is really going to be making the \npainful choices if we do not do anything right now? That is right, it \nis our kids and our kids' kids. Is this really the legacy we want to \nleave them?\n  This is our challenge, and it will be a hard challenge to meet. But I \nam confident we can come together to make these tough choices to do \nwhat is right for our economy and to renew the American promise of \nprogress and opportunity for generations to come.\n\n  Thank you.

Madam President, the American people have high \nexpectations of their leaders. They should\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\nhave, and they should demand it. One of the basic expectations we \nshould have for our President is that he would be honest and forthright \nin discussing the critical issues facing our Nation. He should engage \nin the Nation's most important debates and provide leadership and take \nall appropriate steps to protect our Nation when we face a clear and \npresent danger.\n  Clearly, the dominant issue of our time--I think there is no dispute \nwithin this Chamber--is our fiscal path, the debt course we are on, and \nthe fact that we want to see our country be prosperous and grow, create \nmore jobs, not lose jobs. To do that, we have to confront the large, \nsoaring debt we have. It dwarfs all other issues. The American people \nknow it. They gave a shellacking to the big spenders in the last \nelection. It is what I hear whenever I am at home and what my mail and \ne-mails and phone calls say.\n  People are worried about the future of our country economically, and \nthey are exactly right. The people who are not right are those who say \nchange is not necessary--people who are in denial, including Government \nagencies and departments. People who receive governmental grants and \nprograms think that nothing has changed in their own minds, but things \nhave changed. I wish it weren't so, but it is so.\n  The Congressional Budget Act requires that Congress pass a budget \nevery year by April 15. That is this Friday. A few weeks ago, the \nCongress received from the White House the most irresponsible budget \never submitted by a President to the Congress and to the Nation because \nit did nothing to confront the problems we face. It made no \nrecommendations about entitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid--zero. It increased discretionary spending, increased taxes by \n$1.7 trillion, and, according to the Congressional Budget Office that \nanalyzed the President's budget, it increases the debt, when it is all \nover, more than the debt would have been increased if we hadn't had a \nbudget from the President, even with $1.7 trillion in new taxes. That \nis why it was irresponsible. It did not confront the issues we so \nseriously face today. He said when he announced it, that his budget \nwould cause us to live within our means, that it would not increase the \ndebt, and that we are not going to spend any more money than we are \ntaking in. All fact-check organizations have found that to be false. It \nis plainly false. The lowest single year in which we have a deficit--\nand we have a deficit every year under the present budget--is $740 \nbillion, and it is increasing in the 10th year to $1.2 trillion. The \nhorrible deficit President Bush had was $450 billion. The lowest \nPresident Obama projects in 10 years is $750 billion, and it is going \nup in the outyears to $1.2 trillion.\n  In contrast, the House Budget Committee chairman, Paul Ryan, has made \nthe most serious attempt maybe in history to deal with the systemic \nthreats our country faces to tackle our long-term fiscal challenges. \nThe Bowles and Simpson debt commission cochairmen appointed by \nPresident Obama described Paul Ryan's budget this way: ``A serious, \nhonest, straightforward approach to addressing our Nation's enormous \nfiscal challenges.''\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Going forward, anyone who issues an alternative plan to \n     Chairman Ryan's should be held to the same standard when \n     offering their solutions. We simply cannot back away from \n     these issues.\n\n  Rather than defend the President's budget or offer alternatives, what \nwe have been seeing in this Chamber are just attacks on Congressman \nRyan and attacks on anybody who says change has to occur. They act as \nthough nothing has to change. Many remain in denial. Our Democratic \nchairman, Senator Conrad, who said so many good things about the need \nto challenge the status quo and make changes to put our country on the \nright path, said:\n\n       Representative Ryan's proposal is partisan and ideological. \n     He provides dramatic tax cuts for the wealthiest, financed by \n     Draconian reductions in Medicare and Medicaid. His proposals \n     are unreasonable and unsustainable.\n\n  Is this going to be the nature of our discussion? I thought we were \nsupposed to be trying to reach a bipartisan understanding of the \nchallenges facing us and do something about it. We saw what the \nPresident's own debt commission cochairmen said, respectfully, of the \nRyan proposal, and this is what our leadership said. Others have called \nit extreme. They say it is driven by these evil tea party people who \ndon't know anything. They know something. They know the government is \nspending us into virtual bankruptcy and that Congress has failed in its \nbasic responsibilities to protect the Nation from economic danger. The \nAmerican people are right.\n  I called on the President, before the State of the Union Message, to \nenter into a dialog with the American people, to look them in the eye \nand explain why we are in trouble, why we have to change. Who wants to \ngo and propose any reduction in any spending?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama has 5 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Who wants to do that? We are in a position where we have to make \nthose kinds of tough choices, just as our counties, our cities, our \nmayors, and our State Governors are making every day.\n  So now we are told the President is going to give a speech. He hasn't \nyet even discussed the danger we face. We are told the President is \nplanning this major speech to discuss our long-term fiscal problem. I \nwould say, first of all, it has to be considered a dramatic admission \nthat his previous claims that his budget calls on us to live within our \nmeans, to pay down the debt and not add to the debt, were false. They \nsay the President will support some of the recommendations in the \nfiscal commission, his own Commission, Bowles and Simpson. I hope that \nis true. But I just wish to say this: At this point in history, with \nthe budget supposed to be passed in the Senate Friday and we haven't \neven had a markup to have a hearing on a budget; we have not seen one, \nother than the President's previous budget, which is so utterly \nirresponsible, I think he owes more than a speech.\n  We hear a lot of speeches in this country, a lot from the President. \nWhat we need are numbers. What he needs to do is submit a new budget. \nIf he is going to change his projections for the future and is going to \npropose alterations in our entitlement programs, let's see the numbers. \nHe has around 500 people in the Office of Management and Budget. So if \nthis is serious, let's have a serious proposal. The House has done it. \nThe Republican House has a budget. They are going to move that budget. \nI suspect we will have that budget passed in the House by Friday. It \nhas real numbers, real integrity, real change. It puts us on a path to \nprosperity, not debt and decline.\n  The American people know this is serious. They know we are in a \ndangerous time. All we have to do is rise and make some tough choices, \nas mayors and Governors and families are making around their kitchen \ntable every day. When we get through this exercise, we are not going to \nfind that the government sank into the ocean because we reduced \nagencies 15, 20, 25 percent.\n  The President needs to lay out concrete, specific details about how \nhe intends to solve these challenges we face--not a general speech. The \nHouse and Senate Budget Committees must be able to review what he \nproposes as the Budget Act presumes, in real numbers. The Congressional \nBudget Office needs to be able to analyze it and see how it will \nactually play out in terms of dollars.\n  In 1996, President Clinton produced four budgets. The shutdown \noccurred during that time and they had a big fight during that time. \nBut we know what happened 3 years later. The budget was balanced. Yes, \nit was a messy fight, and people made a lot of mistakes, but the end \nresult was the American people said: You are spending too much. \nCongress rose and said: We are not going to keep doing this, and they \nbalanced the budget. We are in a deeper hole today. It is going to be a \nlot harder, but it can be done again if we meet the challenges.\n  So questions that must be answered by the President and the new \nbudget are some of these:\n  The fiscal commission recommends $1.3 trillion less in discretionary \nspending than proposed in the President's budget. How does the \nPresident plan to\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\nalter his budget to achieve those savings?\n  The fiscal commission recommends finding $600 billion in entitlement \nsavings, but the President's budget would increase entitlement spending \nby $905 billion. That is in the budget he submitted already. How does \nhe intend to achieve these savings in entitlements?\n  The fiscal commission's recommendations would reduce it by $4 \ntrillion, and the Ryan budget plan would reduce it by $5 trillion; but \nthe President's budget would increase the debt by $10 trillion and \nwould not produce any savings. How would the President alter his \noriginal budget to reduce the debt by $4 trillion? I wish to see \nsomething more than a speech. Give me a break. I wish to see some \nnumbers so we can discuss it.\n  Once the President engages, we can have that long overdue national \ndialog about solving the Nation's fiscal problems. But he has to \nacknowledge that we have one. As every witness has told us--and the \ndebt commission chairmen, Simpson and Bowles, said this Nation has \nnever faced a more predictable fiscal financial crisis. They see it \ncoming. We have to change.\n  I hope in his speech the President will discuss entitlements, discuss \nwhether it is good to burden American energy companies with new taxes, \ndiscuss whether we should tax small businesses even more, and discuss \nthe military budget. I think a leading President should talk about \nthat. Rather than trying to drain every cent of tax revenue from the \nAmerican people, Washington should try to drain every cent of waste \nfrom the Federal budget.\n  I hope this doesn't continue the pattern of retreat that is already \nemerging, where the President supports deficit reduction in theory but \nresists it in practice, and he claims credit when he is forced to \naccept reduction. For a President to abdicate his responsibility to \nlead the effort to meet one of the greatest challenges in our Nation's \nhistory would be tantamount to a general leaving the battlefield in a \ntime of war.\n  I hope we have a speech. I hope it is backed up with real numbers, \nand I hope and pray it represents a recognition by the President of the \nUnited States that we have a serious fiscal challenge before us.\n  Business as usual cannot continue. Change is necessary. I hope he \nintends to participate in that and help lead the good change that is \nnecessary.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Twelve of these confirmations were for those \npositions that are termed ``judicial emergencies.''\n  We have reported out of committee a total of 32 judicial nominees. \nThat is 51 percent of the total nominees who have been submitted to the \nSenate by the President of the United States. To date we have held five \nnomination hearings with 21 judicial and executive nominees giving \ntheir testimony. We have another hearing scheduled for tomorrow, with \nfour judicial nominees and one executive nominee on the agenda. With \nthis productive pace, we have taken positive action on 60 percent of \nthe judicial nominations sent to the committee this year by the \nPresident.\n  Today the Senate will consider two nominations: First, Vincent \nBriccetti, nominated to be U.S. District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. He received a B.A. from Columbia University and a \njuris doctorate from Fordham University School of Law. The nominee \nbegan his legal career as a law clerk for the Honorable John M. \nCannella, U.S. District Court for the Southern District New York.\n  After a short term in private practice, he served as an assistant \nU.S. attorney. That was also for the Southern District of New York. \nLater, he became a deputy chief appellate attorney. After working as an \nassociate attorney in a law firm, the nominee started his own firm in \n1992 and, as I report to my colleagues regularly on the ABA standing \ncommittee on the Federal judiciary, that committee has unanimously \nrated this nominee ``well-qualified.''\n  The second nominee is John Kronstadt, nominated to be U.S. District \nJudge, Central District of California. He received his B.A. from \nCornell University and juris doctorate from Yale Law School. He began \nhis legal career as law clerk to the Honorable William P. Gray, U.S. \nDistrict Court, Central District of California. This nominee practiced \nlaw for nearly 24 years, most recently as a partner with Arnold & \nPorter.\n  On November 14, 2002, Gov. Gray Davis appointed Judge Kronstadt to \nthe Los Angeles County Superior Court. There he presided over criminal, \ncivil, and family law matters. Again, reporting on the American Bar \nAssociation rating of this nominee, the nominee had substantial \nmajority ``qualified,'' a minority, ``well qualified.''\n  I support these two nominees and urge my colleagues to support them \nas well. I congratulate each of the nominees for their achievement and, \nmore importantly, for their long period of public service which will \ncontinue after their confirmation by the Senate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nCalifornia Superior Court Judge John A. Kronstadt, as the Senate \nprepares to vote on his confirmation to the U.S. District Court for the \nCentral District of California. Judge Kronstadt was recommended to the \nPresident by my colleague, Senator Feinstein, and will be a great \naddition to the Federal bench.\n  Judge Kronstadt has had a distinguished career. After graduating from \nYale Law School, he served as a Federal law clerk for Judge Gray on the \nCentral District of California. With his\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\nconfirmation, Judge Kronstadt will be returning to the same court where \nhe served as a clerk. Following his clerkship, he was in private \npractice, specializing in complex litigation, antitrust, copyright and \nsecurities. Since 2002, Judge Kronstadt has served as a superior court \njudge in Los Angeles.\n  I congratulate Judge Kronstadt and his family on this important day, \nand urge my colleagues in the Senate to join in voting to confirm this \nhighly qualified nominee to the Federal bench.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that we are \nconsidering the nomination of Judge John Kronstadt to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Central District of California here today.\n  I had the privilege of recommending Judge Kronstadt's nomination to \nPresident Obama.\n  Since 2002, he has served as a judge on the California Superior Court \nfor Los Angeles County.\n  Judge Kronstadt first came to my attention through the Judicial \nAdvisory Committee that I have set up in California. This is a \nbipartisan committee that reviews judicial candidates for me based on \ntheir legal acumen, reputation for skill and professionalism, breadth \nof personal experience, temperament, and overall commitment to \nexcellence in the field of law.\n  Judge Kronstadt stood out from among the candidates for the vacancy \non this court because he has all of these qualities in spades.\n  He has an outstanding academic record, with a bachelor of arts degree \nfrom Cornell University and a law degree from Yale Law School.\n  He started his legal career on the very court to which he is now \nnominated, serving as a law clerk to Judge William Gray of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Central District of California.\n  Judge Kronstadt also brings a distinguished background in private \npractice. Prior to becoming a judge, he spent roughly two dozen years \nas a litigator trying complex civil cases before Federal courts, State \ncourts, and administrative agencies.\n  He started as an associate and then became a partner at the law firm \nof Arnold & Porter--first in Washington, DC, and then in Los Angeles. \nBetween years with that firm, he also spent 15 years managing his own \nfirm with three colleagues. That was the firm of Blanc, Williams, \nJohnston, & Kronstadt.\n  On the Los Angeles County Superior Court, his docket consists \nprimarily of civil cases, ranging from employment litigation to \ncontract disputes to intellectual property and other commercial \nmatters. He has overseen some 250 trials, as well as countless pretrial \nproceedings.\n  He has amassed a stellar in his almost 9 years on the court: only one \nof his decisions has ever been reversed. Within the Los Angeles area, \nJudge Kronstadt is regarded as one of the finest judges on the bench. \nFellow judges, litigants, and local lawyers describe him as \n``incredibly smart,'' ``very fair,'' ``even-tempered,'' and a ``hard \nworker'' who ``cares an incredible amount about the jury system.''\n  He has been a leader on the bench, serving on the court's executive \ncommittee, and chairing its Community Outreach Committee, among other \npositions.\n  Beyond his educational and professional qualifications, Judge \nKronstadt has also shown an impressive dedication to education and the \nteaching of students throughout his career.\n  Since 2002, he has spent roughly 1,500 hours as a volunteer with the \nConstitutional Rights Foundation, including serving as the foundation's \npresident.\n  This is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization in Los Angeles that \nseeks to ``educate young people to become active and responsible \nparticipants in our society'' and to teach them about ``the importance \nof civic participation in a democratic society.''\n  Judge Kronstadt developed a program for the Foundation known as \n``Courtroom to Classroom.'' This program facilitates visits by judges \nto eighth and eleventh grade public school classrooms throughout the \nLos Angeles area.\n  Judges who volunteer provide copies of the Constitution to the \nstudents and organize mock trial activities to allow them to experience \nconstitutional law and the courtroom at a young age.\n  And while in private practice, he developed a training program for \nthe Los Angeles County Bar Association that reached over 1,000 new \nattorneys.\n  I am very pleased to support Judge Kronstadt's nomination. He has \nshown a firm commitment to the rule of law, and a dedication to public \nservice in a variety of ways.\n  I believe he is eminently qualified to serve on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Central District of California. The Judiciary Committee \nunanimously reported his nomination last month, and he is much-needed \non the central district bench--that court has been designated as a \njudicial emergency district by the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts. I thank the leader for bringing his nomination to the floor, \nand I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am proud to support Vincent L. \nBriccetti, a superb lawyer who will be a brilliant and experienced \naddition to the bench of the Southern District of New York.\n  Vince has reached the apex of his profession through sheer hard work \nand raw intelligence. The son and grandson of Italian butchers, Vince \nwas born in Mt. Kisco, NY, and grew up working in the butcher shop \nwhile he went to school, eventually graduating from Columbia University \nand Fordham University School of Law. He spent many of his summers \nworking as a waiter.\n  After graduating from law school, he earned a prestigious clerkship \nwith Judge John M. Cannella in the Southern District of New York, and \nthen entered private practice for 2 years. Vince's dedication to the \nrule of law had already begun, but his public service commenced when he \nentered the U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District of New York \nin 1985. For 4 years, he tried an impressive array of cases, including \na sweeping tax fraud case that earned him too many awards to list here \ntoday. He then became the deputy chief of the Appellate Division of the \nU.S. Attorneys' Office and defended the office's convictions and \npractices on appeal.\n  Following a distinguished career at the prestigious law firm of Paul, \nHastings, Janofsky & Walker, he steered his practice back to White \nPlains and established his own law firm there. For the last 17 years, \nhe has practiced as a criminal defense lawyer in State and Federal \ncourt. He has tried approximately 50 cases to verdict or judgment. I \nhave heard from judges and practitioners alike that Vince is a lawyer \nwhose involvement invariably improves the outcome of any specific case \nwith which he is involved and who has in general been one of the Bar's \ngreat assets. He has treated his duty as a lawyer to dedicate time to \npro bono work--through serving on the local Criminal Justice Act \npanel--not as an obligation, but as a calling. To quote former Federal \ndistrict court Judge Stephen C. Robinson's letter to this committee:\n\n       On at least three separate occasions, when I had some doubt \n     as to whether a party before me was receiving adequate and \n     appropriate counsel, I asked Vince to take up the \n     representation. Vince always stood ready to respond to my \n     requests for assistance in the name of justice. I can tell \n     you that all of the judges in our courthouse held Vince in \n     the highest regard.\n\n  While he ran his own firm and represented clients, Vince also \ncontinued to assist the government by serving as a special prosecutor \nat the behest of the Westchester County District Attorney when he or \nshe was conflicted out of a prosecution. The current district attorney \nin Westchester County has commended him as ``possessed of the highest \nmoral character and integrity.''\n  Everywhere you go in and around New York, you hear superlatives about \nVince Briccetti: That he is the very model of an ethical, fair, \ndedicated lawyer; that while he is a terrific advocate, there is no one \nyou would rather see on the opposite side of a case to ensure a full \nand fair hearing of the issues at stake; and that he is a dedicated \nmember of the New York community. It will be a tribute not just to \nVince but to the bench when we add ``thoughtful and brilliant federal \njudge'' to the encomia. The time has come to confirm Vince for this \njudiciary emergency vacancy that has been open for more than 18 months.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we continue to work to bring down the \nnumber of judicial vacancies that have remained at historically \nalarming levels\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\nfor the last 3 years. One in every nine Federal judgeships remains \nvacant as judicial vacancies stand at 96.\n  I thank the majority leader for scheduling votes on two more judicial \nemergency vacancies. Vincent Briccetti has been nominated to fill a \njudgeship in the Southern District of New York and John Kronstadt to \nfill a judgeship in the Central District of California. I believe they \nboth could be confirmed unanimously. They were reported by the \nJudiciary Committee unanimously more than one month ago.\n  With cooperation from both sides of the aisle, the Senate could \nconsider many more of the 17 judicial nominees currently ready for \nfinal action, and could do so before the Senate takes its Easter recess \nat the end of this week. Doing so would fulfill our responsibility to \nhelp address the vacancies crisis that puts at serious risk the ability \nof Americans to get a fair and timely hearing for their cases in \nFederal court.\n  All 17 of the judicial nominations pending on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar were reported by a majority of the Judiciary Committee after \nmembers had an opportunity to review thoroughly extensive materials \nprovided in response to our questionnaire, to question the nominees at \na hearing, and to send written follow-up questions to the nominees. All \nof them are ready for final Senate action. With Federal judicial \nvacancies continuing to hover around 100, we should act responsibly by \nvoting promptly on these nominations.\n  Two of the nominees currently awaiting a Senate vote have twice been \nconsidered by the Judiciary Committee and twice reported with strong \nbipartisan support, first last year and again in February. They are \nSusan Carney of Connecticut to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and Michael Simon to fill \nan emergency vacancy on the district court in Oregon. Two of the \nnominations have been reported favorably by the committee three times--\nthat of Goodwin Liu to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Ninth \nCircuit and that of Jack McConnell, reported with bipartisan support to \nfill a vacancy on the District of Rhode Island. Another currently \npending nomination has been reported favorably four times, that of \nJudge Edward Chen to a judicial emergency vacancy on the Northern \nDistrict of California. All of these nominations have long been ready \nfor a Senate vote. So are nominations now pending to fill a judicial \nvacancy on the DC Circuit, judicial emergency vacancies in Tennessee, \nFlorida and another in New York, two vacancies in Virginia, two \nvacancies in New Jersey, another vacancy in New York, and a vacancy on \nthe district court for the Northern Mariana Islands.\n  It is actually a sign of progress that we are today proceeding to \nconfirm two judicial nominees reported last month. I hope that we can \nwork to restore regular order in considering judicial nominations and \nthat, at a minimum, the Senate will be allowed to proceed before the \nrecess to confirm those judicial nominations reported with bipartisan \nsupport. All 17 of the pending nominees have a strong commitment to the \nrule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution. All \nshould have an up or down vote after being considered by the Judiciary \nCommittee, and without weeks of needless delay.\n  If we join together we can make real progress by considering all of \nthe judicial nominations now on the Senate's Executive Calendar. If the \nSenate were to take favorable action on the 17 judicial nominations \ncurrently pending and awaiting final Senate consideration, we could \nreduce vacancies to below 90. In fact, we would be able to reduce them \nbelow 80 for the first time since July 2009.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many, \nand they have persisted for too long. Whereas the Democratic majority \nin the Senate reduced vacancies from 110 to 60 in President Bush's \nfirst 2 years, judicial vacancies still number 96 more than 26 months \ninto President Obama's term. By now, judicial vacancies should have \nbeen cut in half, but we have barely kept up with attrition.\n  Regrettably, the Senate has not reduced vacancies dramatically as we \ndid during the Bush administration. In fact, the Senate has reversed \ncourse during the Obama administration, with the slow pace of \nconfirmations keeping judicial vacancies at crisis levels. Over the 8 \nyears of the Bush administration, from 2001 to 2009, we reduced \njudicial vacancies from 110 to a low of 34. That has now been reversed, \nwith vacancies staying above 90 since August 2009. The vacancy rate--\nwhich was reduced from 10 percent at the end of President Clinton's \nterm, to 6 percent by this date in President Bush's third year, and \nultimately to less than 4 percent in 2008--has now swelled to nearly 11 \npercent.\n  The two nominations we consider today demonstrate that there is no \nreason the Senate cannot consider and confirm the President's \nnominations to the Federal bench in a timely manner. Both nominees show \nPresident Obama's commitment to working with home State Senators to \nidentify superbly qualified nominees in districts with vacancies. I \nthank Senators Feinstein, Boxer, Schumer and Gillibrand for working \nwith President Obama on these nominations and congratulate them along \nwith the nominees and their families.\n  Judge John Kronstadt has been nominated to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy in the Central District of California. He currently serves on \nthe Los Angeles County Superior Court and previously spent 24 years in \nprivate practice. Judge Kronstadt earned his B.A. from Cornell \nUniversity and his J.D. from Yale Law School. The Judiciary Committee \nreported his nomination unanimously on March 10.\n  Vincent Briccetti has been nominated to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy in the Southern District of New York. An attorney for the past \n30 years, Mr. Briccetti has spent time in private practice and as a \nFederal prosecutor. He was unanimously rated by the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary as well \nqualified to serve on the district court. Mr. Briccetti earned his B.A. \nfrom Columbia University and his J.D. from Fordham University School of \nLaw. The Judiciary Committee also reported his nomination unanimously \non March 10.\n  I have thanked the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, for his cooperation this year. I see him taking \ncredit for what he calls ``our rapid pace.'' I am glad to see him echo \nmy call to turn the page and end the days of tit for tat on judicial \nnominations. That is what I did from the first days of the Bush \nadministration in spite of how President Clinton's nominees had been \ntreated.\n  We have a long way to go to do as well as we did during President \nBush's first term, when we confirmed 205 of his judicial nominations, \nbringing the vacancy rate down from 10 percent to just over 4 percent. \nWe confirmed 100 of those judicial nominations during the 17 months I \nwas chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office. So far, \nwell into President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only \nbeen allowed to consider 77 of President Obama's Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees. We remain well short of the benchmarks we set \nduring the Bush administration.\n  The Senate must do better. We must work together to ensure that the \nFederal judiciary has the judges it needs to provide justice to \nAmericans in courts throughout the country. Judicial vacancies on \ncourts throughout the country hinder the Federal judiciary's ability to \nfulfill its constitutional role. They create a backlog of cases that \nprevents people from having their day in court. This is \nunacceptable.That is why Chief Justice Roberts, Attorney General \nHolder, White House Counsel Bob Bauer and many others--including the \nPresident of the United States--have spoken out and urged the Senate to \nact. I hope that we will follow their advice and make progress to \nensure that the Federal courts are able to function for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield back time on both sides.\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination of Vincent L. Briccetti, of New York, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Southern District of New York, is \nconfirmed.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof John A. Kronstadt, of California, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Central District of California?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my honor to represent \nthe good people of Wisconsin in the Senate. It is an awesome \nresponsibility--a responsibility I take very seriously.\n  Today it is my distinct privilege to address this historic body for \nthe first time. It is a moment in time when our Nation is in peril. Not \nonly do we continue to face the very real threat of international \nterrorism, but we also face a threat of our own making, one that \nchallenges the very foundation of this Republic.\n  Our Nation was founded on the basis of God-given rights and \nindividual liberty. The genius of our Founding Fathers' vision was \nrooted in their recognition that more often than not government was \nsomething to fear. Government necessarily limited individual freedom \nand, therefore, government itself must be limited--its potential for \ngrowth highly constrained.\n  During America's first century, this vision was largely upheld. The \nlast century, however, has been an entirely different story. In 1902, \nthe Federal Government spent 2 percent of the Nation's gross domestic \nproduct; State and local governments spent 5 percent. Government was \nclose to the governed. The size, scope, and cost of the Federal \nGovernment was constrained by the Constitution's enumerated powers. The \nindividual was preeminent, and government's role was modest and \npedestrian.\n  This body played a key role in limiting Federal Government expansion. \nDebate in the Senate was unlimited. The cloture vote did not exist. As \nGeorge Washington had said, the Senate was the saucer that cooled the \ntea.\n  All that changed in the 20th century's second decade. The Senate \nadopted the cloture vote and America adopted the 16th amendment. The \nFederal Government now had the power to tax income, and the Senate had \nmade it easier for government to grow. And guess what. Government grew.\n  It did grow in reaction to real problems. Trusts had been formed that \nconcentrated power and created monopolies that threatened free markets. \nCapital did exert too much power over labor. Balance was needed. As our \nNation's prosperity grew, the elimination of poverty and retirement \ninsecurity became a public responsibility. Private charity was simply \ndeemed not up to the task. So government acted and government grew.\n  From 2 percent in 1902 to today, where the Federal Government spends \n25 percent of our Nation's economy, and combined all levels of \ngovernment in the United States now consume 39 percent. By comparison, \nthe size of government in Norway is 40 percent; in Greece it is 47 \npercent; and in France, 53 percent. In the end, I don't believe \nAmericans want to be like France or Greece. We haven't reached that \ntipping point yet, but we are extremely close.\n  There is a reason America holds 5 percent of the world's population \nand yet accounts for 24 percent of the world's GDP. It is because of \nfreedom, the free market system and the American people. America became \na land of unlimited opportunity because we were a nation of self-\nreliant people. Hard work was valued, personal responsibility expected, \nand success was celebrated, not demonized. I grew up in that America.\n  I am very sad to say what I have witnessed during my lifetime is a \nslow but steady drift and, I would argue, over the last 2 years a lurch \ntoward a culture of entitlement and dependency. This is not an America \nI recognize. It is not an America that will work.\n  Even worse, we have granted entitlements and encouraged dependency \nwith little thought as to how we would pay for it. We have racked up \nenormous debt, and now the bill is coming due. Time is running out.\n  Last week, the government almost shut down because we were arguing \nover a few billion dollars, but our debt and deficits are measured in \nthe trillions. Our problem is a thousand times larger than the current \ndebate. Most of us recognize this is simply unsustainable. Most of us \nknow what programs need to be reformed. Most of us want to fix the \nproblem. So let's start addressing these issues now before it is too \nlate.\n  These are enormous problems and it is easy to become pessimistic, but\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\nthere is reason to be hopeful. I have done a fair amount of traveling \nthroughout Wisconsin over the last year, speaking to all kinds of \npeople--Republicans, Democrats, union members, tea party folks. I \ntalked about America, about how incredibly precious and exceptional it \nis, and how I fear we may be losing it.\n  What I will never forget is how many people came up to me after my \nspeeches with tears in their eyes or tears running down their cheeks--\nnot because I am a great public speaker but because people love this \ncountry. Their political affiliation makes absolutely no difference. \nAmericans want this Nation preserved, and they are counting on us to do \njust that.\n  The good news is they will support us if we make the hard choices \ntogether. So together let's roll up our sleeves and do what needs to be \ndone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I congratulate our new Senator from \nWisconsin, a very important addition to our caucus and to the Senate--a \nman who has actually run a business, actually employed people and \ncreated wealth in his State and our country. Having someone in the \nSenate who knows how to do that at this critical moment is absolutely \nessential, and I congratulate the new junior Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the other \naccountant in the Senate. It is nice to have additional help with \nnumbers. It will make a tremendous difference.\n  He has had both the business experience and the accounting \nexperience, and he understands a lot of things that to us in the Senate \nare pretty simple but to the person working on the ground it is very \ndifficult. He is good at expressing himself and, as I said, \nparticularly good with numbers. So I congratulate him on his maiden \nspeech.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2375-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2375-S2378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we are at an extraordinary crossroads in \nAmerican history, both from a moral perspective as well as an economic \nperspective.\n  The reality today, as I think most Americans understand, is that the \nmiddle class of our country is collapsing. Over the last 10 years, \nmedian family income has gone down by $2,500. Millions of Americans who \nhave lost their jobs secured new jobs at substantially lower pay. \nYounger workers are finding it very hard to get a job at a livable \nwage.\n  Furthermore, what we don't talk about terribly often here on the \nfloor of the Senate or certainly in the corporate media is the rather \nunfortunate reality that in the United States, we have the most unequal \ndistribution of income and of wealth of any major country on Earth. \nToday, the top 1 percent of earners make 23 percent of all income. The \ntop 1 percent earn 23 percent of every dollar, and that is more than \nthe bottom 50 percent. The top 1 percent make more money than the \nbottom 50 percent. The percentage of income going to the top 1 percent \nhas nearly tripled--nearly tripled--since the 1970s. Between 1980 and \n2005, 80 percent--80 percent--of all new income in America went to the \ntop 1 percent.\n  Today, when we talk about distribution of wealth--not income--the \nnumbers are, frankly, beyond belief. Today in America, if my colleagues \ncan believe it, the wealthiest 400 Americans--400 Americans, a very \nsmall number out of a nation of over 300 million people--own more \nwealth than the bottom 150 million Americans. So 400 on one side, 150 \nmillion on the other, and that gap between the very, very rich and \neverybody else is growing wider.\n  I don't have to describe economically what is going on in this \ncountry because almost everybody understands it. Real unemployment \ntoday is not 8.9 percent; it is closer to 16 percent. Today in America, \n50 million people have no health insurance. Today in America, seniors \nand disabled vets understand they have not received a Social Security \nCOLA in 3 years.\n  So what we start with when we look at America today is a middle class \nwhich is disappearing, poverty which is increasing, and the people on \ntop doing phenomenally well. Given that reality, one might think the \nCongress would be actively involved in trying to protect the middle \nclass and working families and lower income people, but if one believed \nthat, one would be sorely mistaken.\n  Just last December, 4 months ago, Congress passed legislation to \nprovide huge tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires by extending \nthe Bush tax cuts to the top 2 percent and by even more by lowering the \nestate tax for the top three-tenths of 1 percent. So at a time when the \npeople on top are already doing phenomenally well, what Congress did \nagainst my vote in December was make the wealthiest people even \nwealthier.\n  Four months ago, after giving huge tax breaks to millionaires and \nbillionaires and growing the deficit, our Republican friends and some \nDemocrats come back and they say: Well, now we have a real deficit \nproblem. We made the problem worse in December, so now we really have \nto deal with the deficit, and we are going to do it by making \ndevastating cuts to programs that low- and moderate-income Americans \ndesperately depend upon.\n  What we are looking at is the Robin Hood principle in reverse: We are \ntaking from working families who are struggling to survive--taking \nhundreds of billions of dollars and giving it to millionaires and \nbillionaires. In my view, this is grossly immoral, and it is also very \nbad economics.\n  Let me touch on some of the cuts that are coming down the pike in \nthis, the 2011 budget. At a time of soaring fuel prices--in the State \nof Vermont and I am sure in Minnesota, a lot of people heat with oil--\nthe cost is going up. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nLIHEAP, would be cut by $390 million. In Vermont, many of the people \nwho use the LIHEAP program are low-income senior citizens. So we give \ntax breaks to billionaires, and we go after low-income senior citizens \nand say: Sorry, you may have to go cold.\n  At a time when the cost of college education is getting unaffordable \nfor many low- and moderate-income families in this country--hundreds of \nthousands of young people have given up their college dream because of \nthe high cost of college--Pell grants would be reduced by an estimated \n$35 billion over 10 years, including a nearly $500 million cut this \nyear, and Pell grants are the major source of Federal funding to help \nlow- and moderate-income college students go to school.\n  At a time when 50 million Americans have no health insurance, \ncommunity health centers would be cut by $600 million. This is an issue \non which I have worked very, very hard. Community health centers \nprovide access to primary health care, dental care, low-cost \nprescription drugs, and mental health counseling for some 20 million \nAmericans right now. Our hope was to expand that to 40 million \nAmericans. When we do that, we save money because people do not end up \nin the emergency room; they do not end up in the hospital sicker than \nthey should have been. So $600 million for community health centers was \ncut. The Children's Health Insurance Program was cut by $3.5 billion.\n  At a time when poverty is increasing, the WIC Program--women, \ninfants, and children--a nutrition program for pregnant women and \nchildren, will be cut by $500 million.\n  At a time when we have such high unemployment rates and we want to \nput Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, \nincluding our rail system, which is now far behind Europe, Japan, and \neven China, Federal funding for high-speed rail will be eliminated in \nthe budget we are going to be voting on very soon, representing a cut \nof $2.9 billion. Public\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\ntransportation would be cut by nearly $1 billion--a 20-percent \nreduction.\n  I know in Vermont, and I expect all over this country, local \ncommunities are struggling with their budgets. Police departments are \nnot getting the budgets and the manpower they need. Yet, in this budget \nwe will be voting on, local law enforcement funding would be cut by \n$296 million.\n  At a time when homelessness is increasing, when we need more low-\nincome housing, public housing would be cut by $605 million.\n  That is the 2011 budget agreement that was just reached a few days \nago. What is absolutely incredible about that budget is that deficit \nreduction falls totally on the backs of low-and moderate-income \nfamilies, on people who will not be able to get health care at \ncommunity health centers, young people who will not be able to go to \ncollege, and senior citizens who will not be able to heat their homes \nin the wintertime. That is where this budget is balanced--on the backs \nof the weak, the vulnerable, the children, the elderly, and the poor. \nYet, at the same time as the wealthiest people are becoming wealthier, \nthis budget does not ask for one penny--not one penny--from \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  At a time when major corporation after major corporation enjoys huge \ntax loopholes--so not only do they avoid paying any Federal income \ntaxes, but in many cases, such as General Electric, they actually get a \nrebate from the IRS--this budget does not ask corporate America to pay \none penny more in corporate income taxes.\n  That is where we are with the 2011 budget, and now we are looking in \na short period of time at the 2012 budget. If my colleagues think this \n2011 budget is a moral and economic disgrace, wait until we hear what \nthis 2012 budget, the so-called Paul Ryan tea party budget, which, as I \nunderstand it, will be voted upon in the House, likely passing later \nthis week--that budget will slash trillions of dollars from Medicare, \nconverting Medicare into a voucher program, meaning that seniors will \nhave to pay substantially more for their health care than they \ncurrently do. The interesting question that has not yet been answered \nabout this is, if you will be--when this Ryan budget would go into \neffect--a senior citizen living on $14,000 or $15,000 a year, which \nmillions of seniors currently live on, how are you going to be able to \ncome up with thousands and thousands of dollars to pay for your cancer \ntreatment or the other problems senior citizens have? There is no money \navailable for you to do it.\n\n  What Ryan's budget does is demand that low-income seniors pay with \nmoney they don't have. I am not sure I have heard the answer to the \nquestion: If you are a low-income citizen and you are asked to come up \nwith thousands of dollars, and you don't have that money, what do you \ndo? The Ryan budget would savage Medicaid, education, the environment, \ninfrastructure, and other programs that tens of millions of Americans \ndepend upon.\n  Here is the kicker. We savage Medicare, Medicaid, education, and many \nother programs that moderate and middle-class families depend upon in \norder to give even more tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry and the largest corporations. After savaging health care in \nAmerica for middle and low-income families, the Ryan budget would \nreduce the tax rates for the wealthiest people in this country from 35 \nto 25 percent, and it would cut corporate income taxes to the same \nlevel, from 35 to 25 percent.\n  I suspect there are people listening to me who don't believe that: \nCome on, you are not serious; at a time when the middle class is \ncollapsing and the rich are getting richer, you are not telling me that \nthe House is about to vote on a budget that will give huge tax breaks \nto millionaires and billionaires and throw millions more off of health \ncare--you are not serious. Check it out. I am serious. This is what the \nRyan tea party budget, which will likely pass the House, will do.\n  As I began saying, we are at a pivotal moment in the modern history \nof this country. That question is whether we move, in a sense, into an \noligarchic form of society, where a few people on top have incredible \namounts of wealth and incredible amounts of political power, while the \nmiddle class disappears and poverty increases. That is where we are \nright now.\n  I hope very much the American people engage in this debate and tell \nMembers of the Senate and the House that it is morally wrong and very \npoor economics to cut back on programs that are desperately needed by \nworking families, while giving huge tax breaks to people who absolutely \ndon't need them.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the issue of our \nbudget. Later this week, the House will vote on its fiscal year 2012 \nbudget resolution. Congressman Paul Ryan, the author of that blueprint, \ncalls it a path to prosperity.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be glad to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was scheduled to be speak at 4 o'clock. At the \nconclusion of the Senator's remarks, would the Senator request that I \nbe recognized as in morning business for up to 30 minutes?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I move that immediately after I finish \nspeaking, the Senator--well, we had a Member who was going to go speak \nafter you did. Could the Senator limit his speech to 15 minutes or----\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, sir, I could not. I have to have 30 minutes. The \nfloor has been pretty empty today.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. OK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately after I finish, Senator Inhofe be recognized for up to 30 \nminutes, and then Senator Franken be recognized immediately after \nSenator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. So Mr. President, resuming my remarks, Paul Ryan, the \nauthor of that blueprint, called it the path to prosperity. It may be a \npath to austerity, but it is hardly a path to prosperity.\n  Nonetheless, with the negotiations finished just days ago on last \nyear's budget, Congressman Ryan has succeeded in jump-starting the \ndebate about next year's. The President himself will join this \nconversation about how to do long-term deficit reduction in a major \naddress tomorrow at GWU--George Washington University. This is a debate \nwe must have, and the President's entrance into it comes not a moment \ntoo soon. It will make for a powerful contrast with the Republicans' \nplan.\n  The contrast we will hear from our President tomorrow will likely not \nbe in the commitment to deficit reduction. Paul Ryan's goal in his \nbudget is to trim the deficit by $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. \nHe does not succeed in meeting this target, according to CBO. In fact, \nbudget experts say his proposal only achieves $155 billion in net \ndeficit reduction. But the number itself is not the issue. Without a \ndoubt, we must be ambitious in setting a target for deficit reduction. \nWe cannot be gun-shy about achieving fiscal discipline. So, no, the \ncontrast will not be in how much we seek to reduce the deficit, it will \nbe in how we go about doing so.\n  The Republicans would like the looming debate to be one about \nnumbers, but, instead, it will be about priorities. The Ryan budget has \nall the wrong priorities.\n  The House Republican budget puts the entire burden of reducing the \ndeficit on senior citizens, students, and middle-class families. At the \nsame time, it protects corporate subsidies for oil companies, let's \nwaste at the Pentagon go untouched, and would give even more tax breaks \nto the millionaires amongst us. In short, the Ryan budget puts the \nmiddle class last instead of first. As a result, it will never pass the \nSenate.\n  In the days since he first rolled out his budget proposal, \nCongressman Ryan has been hailed for taking on the tough challenges, \nand we certainly salute him for putting out a plan. But a closer look \nat his proposal shows that\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\nit is not bold at all. In leaving Pentagon spending and revenues \ncompletely untouched, Ryan's budget hews exactly to his party's \northodoxy.\n  Some of the columns I read say it takes courage. Well, maybe it takes \ncourage for someone who has a different political philosophy to say \nwhat he said but not for a conservative Republican to say what he said. \nIt does not gore a single Republican ox. It is a rigid ideological \ndocument.\n  Consider what Congressman Ryan wants to do on Medicare. In the name \nof ideology, Paul Ryan's budget proposes getting rid of Medicare as it \nexists today and replacing it with a private system that would cut \nbenefits. We have seen this movie before. Five years ago, President \nBush tried to sell the country on a plan to privatize Social Security. \nThe public rejected it. If they didn't like what President Bush tried \nto do to Social Security, just wait until they see what Paul Ryan and \nthe House Republicans want to do to Medicare. Their budget plan \nproposes putting the Medicare system into the hands of private \ninsurance companies. That is a recipe for disaster. It would mean an \nend to Medicare as we know it.\n  Beginning in 2022, Americans turning 65 would no longer be enrolled \nin Medicare but, instead, would receive a voucher to go shopping for \ntheir own health insurance on the open market. Insurance companies, \nhowever, would not be required to honor that voucher, which would \naverage about $8,000. Many private insurance plans for seniors far \nexceed that price already today. Under the Ryan plan, seniors who \ncannot find an affordable plan at the value of their voucher will \nsimply have to make up the difference themselves out of their own \npockets.\n  This problem would only worsen over time as health care costs rise. \nRyan caps Medicare spending at the level of inflation, even though \nhealth care costs rise higher than that historically. As Ryan's voucher \ncovers a smaller and smaller fraction of actual health care costs, \nseniors would have to cover the gap out of pocket.\n  That is why Alice Rivlin, a Democrat and President Clinton's former \nOMB Director who worked with Congressman Ryan on his approach for a \ntime, has distanced herself from this final product. She told the \nWashington Post she opposes the Ryan plan:\n\n       In the Ryan version he has lowered the rate of growth and I \n     don't think that's defensible. It pushed too much of the \n     costs onto the beneficiaries.\n\n  Let me repeat that last part of the statement of Alice Rivlin, \nCongressman Ryan's partner for a time in this proposal. She writes:\n\n       It pushed too much of the cost onto the beneficiaries.\n\n  Other Medicare experts agree with Rivlin. Stephen Zuckerman, a health \ncare economist at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, said:\n\n       The most serious flaw is that the focus of that approach is \n     on limiting Federal spending on Medicare without concern \n     about the potential of this change to shift costs to Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n\n  A better way to rein in Medicare spending would be to trim the waste \nand inefficiency out of the delivery system. Anyone who has gone \nthrough the health care system knows all the waste and inefficiencies--\nthe legendary stories of a doctor waving as you go into the emergency \nroom and you never see him again, and then there is a $4,000 charge, \nthese kinds of things. But it turns out that Ryan's plan does nothing \nto reduce overall health care costs. It increases them. We have to \npreserve the benefits to people but make the cost of delivering them \nless expensive. That is what every other country in the world does. \nThat is what we have to do.\n  The Ryan plan does not do that. The Ryan plan not only does not try \nto eliminate the waste and inefficiency out of the delivery system, it \ndoes nothing to reduce overall health care costs. It actually increases \nthem.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, in 2030 \ntraditional Medicare insurance would cost just 60 percent of a private \npolicy purchased with Ryan's voucher. In other words, the Ryan health \ncare plan would cost two-thirds more than traditional Medicare. Not \nonly would the Ryan plan increase insurance costs, it would force \nseniors to shoulder a higher share of these costs.\n  CBO said--this is CBO not Chuck Schumer, the nonpartisan CBO:\n\n       Under the proposal, most elderly people who would be \n     entitled to premium support payments would pay more for their \n     health care than they would pay under the current Medicare \n     system.\n\n  How much more? It is staggering when you look at the numbers. Here \nthey are, the seniors' share of health care costs. We know even with \nMedicare seniors have to pay some of it themselves, but now they pay 25 \npercent; under the Ryan budget, 68 percent. So there is this voucher, \nand it goes to the insurance companies, health care costs more, and \nseniors pay more. Why the heck would we do that?\n  This is a crippling burden that would drive the average Medicare \nrecipient into poverty. It is not only too much to ask for our seniors, \nit destroys the foundation of our health care system.\n  Madam President, just to check on the time, I believe I said after I \nfinished I asked unanimous consent that Senator Inhofe would follow me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes. \nDid the Senator wish for more than 10 minutes?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I did, and that was the intention of my unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The bottom line is the House Republican budget would \ncause the cost of health insurance to rise and then would make seniors \npay a greater share of that higher cost. It is a cut in benefits plans, \nplain and simple. If we are serious about reining in Medicare spending, \nthere is a far better starting place than the Ryan budget. It is the \nhealth care law passed by Congress last year. Republicans are patting \nthemselves on the back lately for leading on entitlement reform. When \nit comes to reining in the runaway costs of Medicare, the truth is the \nPresident did it first, and he did it better.\n  In the health care law, we certainly did not complete the job, but we \nmade a good start on reducing waste and inefficiency and duplication in \nthe system. We started down the path of making delivery system reforms. \nWe set up a system for studying the effectiveness of different methods \nand treatments so that care could be delivered more efficiently. We \nmade a downpayment on shifting the larger health care system away from \na fee-for-service model toward a system that pays providers for \nepisodes of care.\n  The Ryan proposal adopts none of these cost-saving approaches. In \nfact, his budget calls for the repeal of the health care law \naltogether. Left unsaid is that this would have the side effect of \nreopening the doughnut hole, another hit to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  If the Ryan budget's only goal was to end Medicare, that would be \nample cause to work tooth and nail to defeat it, but the Ryan budget \ndoesn't even put most of its savings from ending Medicare toward \ndeficit reduction. Amazingly, it cuts Medicare, ends Medicare as we \nknow it, and takes whatever savings it produces and gives more tax \nbreaks to the wealthiest Americans. That is right. Ryan's budget not \nonly seeks to permanently extend President Bush's tax cuts for \nmillionaires, he wants to cut their taxes even lower than the Bush \nlevels.\n\n  In fact, under the Ryan proposal millionaires would pay a rate so low \nthat it was last seen in the days of Herbert Hoover. What about shared \nsacrifice? As unbelievable as it sounds, Congressman Ryan wants to give \nmillionaires and billionaires an extra tax break. Ryan's budget \nproposal would bring down the top rate from 35 percent to 25 percent \nfor those who are very wealthy. This would make for the lowest level of \ntaxing the wealthiest among us since 1931 when the Great Depression was \nraging and Herbert Hoover was President. This is the trade Congressman \nRyan proposes we make: Cut Medicare benefits for seniors so we can \nafford to give millionaires an extra tax break.\n  This is exactly the opposite of what the public wants. They don't \nthink the millionaires and billionaires should even be getting George \nBush's tax cut, let alone an extra one on top of that. I have nothing \nagainst millionaires and billionaires, God bless them. Many of them \nmade their money the good old-fashioned way, but they don't need a tax \nbreak when we are cutting health\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\ncare and everything else. Most Americans agree with me.\n  In last month's NBC Wall Street Journal poll that asked Americans \nwhat proposals they most support to reduce the deficit, 81 percent of \nAmericans, including a majority of Republicans, as I recall, said they \nwould support a tax on millionaires, the highest polling answer. One of \nthe lowest polling answers was--you guessed it--cutting Medicare \nbenefits. So the Ryan budget has its priorities completely upside-down.\n  You may ask, if Congressman Ryan puts all his savings from Medicare \ninto millionaire tax breaks, how does he propose to achieve any deficit \nreduction? The answer is, by targeting the programs most important to \nthe middle class.\n  It turns out that the Republican plan to end Medicare is also a plan \nto end other important programs. For example, the Republican plan to \nend Medicare is, additionally, also a plan to cut tens of thousands of \nteachers. The Republican plan to end Medicare is, additionally, also a \nplan to cut Head Start for kids. The Republican plan to end Medicare \nis, additionally, also a plan to cut medical research on diseases such \nas cancer. The Republican plan to end Medicare is, additionally, also a \nplan to cut clean energy projects that create jobs and help us become \nenergy independent.\n  In all, the Ryan plan assumes a steady squeezing of government until, \nby 2050, the total cost of everything, save for Social Security and \nhealth care, is shrunk from 12 percent of the GDP to just 3 percent. \nBut he doesn't spell out a single detail of how to achieve those cuts. \nHe has a number but no specifics. That is the definition of a meat ax \napproach as opposed to an approach that uses a smart, sharp scalpel.\n  Even though the Ryan plan doesn't spell out where the cuts would come \nfrom to meet his goal, it isn't a total mystery. We can fill in the \nblanks. The just completed debate on the 2011 fiscal budget offers \nplenty of hints on the Republican approach to cutting spending. In the \ndebate we just had, Republicans wanted to cut the very programs that \ncreate good-paying jobs and help the middle class. They targeted \neverything from cancer research to financial aid to college. We fended \noff many of their worst cuts by successfully pushing Republicans to \ninclude $17 billion in cuts from the mandatory side. We also got them \nto agree to reduce Pentagon spending by nearly $3 billion compared to \ntheir original budget. This was not the Republican's preferred way to \nreduce the deficit. Because of ideology, they disproportionately \ntargeted the domestic discretionary part of the budget for cutting.\n  But our deficit problems weren't caused by Head Start and cancer \nresearch, and we won't fix them by going after Head Start and cancer \nresearch. In the budget debates to come, we need to broaden the playing \nfield beyond domestic discretionary spending. We should include, for \ninstance, waste in the Defense Department. The Pentagon makes up half \nof the discretionary side of the budget, but Republicans continue to \ntreat it as off limits. Ryan himself leaves it virtually untouched save \nfor a symbolic trim. To say there isn't waste at the Pentagon like \nthere is waste everywhere else in the budget is absurd.\n  The bottom line is, any budget that leaves defense and revenues off \nthe table is ultimately not serious. We need an all-of-the-above \napproach that puts all parts of the budget on the table. A dollar cut \nfrom mandatory spending or the Pentagon is just as good as a dollar cut \nfrom nondefense discretionary spending.\n  Deficit reduction is an important goal, but the sacrifice must be \nshared. The Ryan budget fails that test. The Democratic Senate will not \nstand for any proposals that seek to balance the budget on the backs of \nthe middle class and seniors. I look forward to hearing the President's \nremarks tomorrow. As for Congressman Ryan, I encourage him to go back \nto the drawing board and come up with a fairer, more balanced plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me thank my good friend from New \nYork for allowing me to have this time. I do appreciate his generosity. \nI have to say, I don't agree with what he said, but that comes as no \nsurprise to my friend from New York. I will only make one comment. One \nstatement I heard him say toward the end of his remarks was that every \nother country in the world would do it this way. That is the whole crux \nof it right there. I often wonder if you look at the other countries, \nthey are all trying to get to our system. They all envy America for its \nsystem of freedom, of health delivery. We wonder sometimes if \ngovernment-run health care is bad--and that is what this is; that is \nwhat the Obama administration is trying to do--if it is better, then \nwhy doesn't it work anywhere? I have often looked at this. It doesn't \nwork in Canada, Denmark, the UK. It doesn't work in any of the other \nplaces. Yet they always say: It will work here. A lot of my liberal \nfriends say: If I were running it, it would work. We have a great \nsystem.\n  I guess a little class warfare is healthy now and then, and we had a \nlittle bit of that in the last few minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2378-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2378-S2381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am going to be very offensive right \nnow to a lot of people, certainly to the Ouattara group, the rebels \ntaking over in Cote d'Ivoire. I am going to be offensive to the United \nNations. I am going to be offensive to the French and to our own State \nDepartment.\n  This little girl is named Zegita Marie Rapert. Zegita is an Ethiopian \nname. It means God's grace. This little girl we found. She is only 2 \ndays old. I happened to be in Ethiopia. She was an orphan. And my \ndaughter Molly--in fact, I should hold this up. These are my 20 kids \nand grandkids. My daughter Molly had nothing but boys. So she adopted \nZegita Marie. She came up to me the other day, that little girl--she \nwas 2 days old when we first saw her. She is now 10 years old. She \nreads at a college level. She is a brilliant little girl. She came up \nto me the other day and Pappi--let me explain that. I is for Inhofe. \nThat is me. So it is Momma and Pappi. She said: Pappi, why do you \nthings nobody else would do. I said: That is why I do it.\n  Zegita Marie got her answer, and that is the reason I am talking \ntoday. I happen to be familiar with Africa. I have been for quite some \ntime. I am on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I think they \nconsider me the point man for Africa. We started working with Africa \nback at 9/11. At 9/11 we made a decision that while the squeeze in \nterrorism in the Middle East is going down through Djibouti and the \nHorn of Africa, we need to help the Africans build African brigades, \nsupply them, help send their officers to the United States to train. It \nwas a good program. I sometimes kind of joked around by saying, since I \nwas the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who knew \nwhere Africa was, I took it on.\n  Anyway, I do have a background in Africa. For that reason, I am going \nto speak for the fifth time on the crisis. Cote d'Ivoire is a West \nAfrican country. We have been reading about it. It is sub-Sahara \nAfrica. Nobody cares about sub-Sahara Africa. They do care about Libya \nbut not sub-Sahara Africa. Anyway, the news is reporting that President \nGbagbo and his wife Simone were captured yesterday by the French \nmilitary forces acting with the rebel forces of Alassane Ouattara. \nThere is a videotape of both the President and First Lady in custody. \nAccording to the BBC and Reuters, after the U.N. and the French \nhelicopters repeatedly attacked the Presidential palace, French special \nforces stormed the building with up to 20 French tanks and armored \nvehicles. They took them both from the Presidential palace to the Golf \nHotel, killing untold hundreds or thousands of people.\n  This right here is a picture that was taken. This is a helicopter, a \nUnited Nations helicopter. It was encouraged to be used by the French. \nThe French said: We authorize you. We are going to send our troops in \nthere with you. We are going to do whatever they are doing. This is the \ncapital of Cote d'Ivoire, where they are hitting targets. That is an \narea where they have a lot of their ordinance. I have been there. I \nhave seen it. They are all scattered. You have little huts with \ngalvanized steel roofs over them with countless, hundreds and hundreds \nof people.\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\nThey are all dead. They have to be. They can't live. There it is. That \nis a picture of it. To give you an idea of what is happening, there it \nis. They were peppering the entire town.\n  I don't know why. Here I am a Member of the Senate, and I can't get \neven our State Department to look into how many people they murdered \nthat night. That was Monday night. A week ago tonight is when that \nhappened. We don't know. But they were murdered. I am thankful that \nboth the President and the First Lady are still alive, but they have \nbeen brutally mutilated. I condemn, however, the use of so-called \npeacekeeping forces, made up of United Nations and French forces, in \nthe attacks on Abidjan and the Presidential palace. These forces have \ncaused countless deaths in the densely populated city of Abidjan, a \ncity of 4 million people. I hope every President of sub-Sahara Africa \nis watching right now. What happened there could happen to any country \nin sub-Sahara Africa.\n  Africa has 52 countries. I think 41 of those are sub-Sahara Africa. \nThe multiple firings of United Nations and French missiles into \ndowntown Abidjan are like firing missiles into downtown New York City. \nYou don't know how many people are dead and won't know for a long time. \nWho knows how many hundreds if not thousands of innocent people were \nkilled as a result of the U.N. and the French bombing a week ago \ntonight. This is not peacekeeping. This is war making. This is not the \nrole of the United Nations. I question why the French are participating \nin this battle.\n  The African Union has also condemned this foreign military \nintervention. Why don't we listen to Africa. Africa for many years was \nused. They were abused. They were abused by colonialism. Certainly no \none was worse or more offensive than the French. But they don't listen \nto Africa.\n  I called up a good friend, President Museveni of Uganda, and asked \nhim what he thought. He had the courage to put something down in \nwriting which I will read. This is from President Museveni, an east \nAfrican country, not West Africa like Cote d'Ivoire.\n  He said:\n\n       I have not been happy with the way the United Nations and \n     International Community, especially the French, have \n     responded to the events of the post election Ivory Coast. I \n     desired that it would have been ideal for a thorough \n     Investigation into the alleged election rigging and it be \n     done by a credible and independent body under the African \n     Union leadership and guidance instead of violently forcing \n     the Laurent Gbagbo out of power without a hearing. I am not \n     pleased with the way the international community can sanction \n     a situation of blood bath in the domestic affairs of African \n     Countries.\n\n  I am halfway through reading what he said here. Why aren't we \nlistening to Africans. He is not the only one. I think every African \nPresident would agree with what I am reading right now.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I would prefer a peaceful intervention by an African Union \n     committee that would investigate into the matter, give the \n     parties a fair hearing and come out with a workable \n     recommendation that can promote peace and stability in the \n     region. The recommendation would include the possibility of a \n     peaceful and conciliatory settlement toward a power-sharing \n     deal as was done in the case of Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\n  We all know about that.\n\n       At this point, I believe he would be happy to have a team \n     of capable African leaders chosen under the auspices of the \n     African Union to work on a peaceful end to the conflict in \n     the Ivory Coast. I believe that the African Union must be \n     given the opportunity to handle the matter in-house. I am of \n     course not pleased with the way the U.N. and International \n     Community has directly thrown their weight in support of \n     Alassane Ouattara and now recognizing him as president.\n\n  This is the from the President of Uganda. I have talked personally to \nmany other presidents. I could be quoting all of them right now, but \nessentially that is a statement to which they all agree.\n  I have been informed that this reflects the current sentiment of the \nAfrican Union too, actually including the current AU Chairman Obiang, \nwho condemned the foreign military intervention in Cote d'Ivoire saying \nthat ``Africa does not need external influence. Africa must manage its \nown affairs.''\n  That is what the Africans said. That is President Obiang. President \nObiang is the President of the African Union.\n  The Kenyan Prime Minister Odinga, who happens to be here, and I will \nbe meeting with him in a few minutes, was quoted yesterday as saying \nPresident Gbagbo:\n\n     has been captured and I say that he should not be hurt. I \n     have actually already sent word to Mr. Ouattara saying that \n     Gbagbo should not be hurt. If he wants to go out into exile \n     he should be allowed to go into exile but he needs to be \n     treated humanely.\n\n  That is all I am asking our State Department and the United Nations \nto do. And they won't do it.\n  I have warned the U.N. and the French on the floor four times in the \npast week that they would have blood on their hands if they continued \nsupporting the rebel forces of Alassane Ouattara and continued the \nbombing of the capital of Cote d'Ivoire, Abidjan and did not agree to \nan immediate cease-fire.\n  That is what has happened over the last the week, 10 days. I said on \nApril 4--I am quoting myself now. On the floor, standing right here at \nthis podium I said:\n\n       I think we can avert a real tragedy, something maybe \n     comparable to what happened in 1994 in Rwanda with that \n     genocide.\n\n  We all remember that. We also remember that we were warned--we \nweren't warned but the United Nations was, the Secretary General, we \nnow know, was warned that the genocide was going to take place in 1994 \nin Rwanda, where 800,000 people were hacked to death with machetes. The \nworld stood idly by. That is sub-Sahara Africa. Nobody cared.\n  I called for a cease-fire in Abidjan. No one responded. This was 8 \ndays ago.\n  I wonder sometimes why is it nobody cares about sub-Sahara Africa. I \nremember back in 1998, when, under President Clinton, they were going \nto send troops into Kosovo and the excuse they were using at that time \nwas ethnic cleansing. I said on this Senate floor, why is it we are all \nconcerned about ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. For every one person in \nKosovo who has been ethnically cleansed on a given day, 100 in any one \ncountry in sub-Sahara Africa have. But nobody cares about sub-Sahara \nAfrica. Why is there no outcry for these millions of people who are \nbeing brutally murdered in other places in the world?\n  I have to say this--and I know I am repeating what I said in 1998 on \nthe floor--and I know it is very unpopular, but I will quote a guy \nwhose name is Roger Wilkens, professor of history and American culture \nat George Mason University. He said:\n\n       I think it is pretty clear U.S. foreign policy is geared to \n     the European American sensibility which takes the lives of \n     white people much more seriously than the lives of people who \n     are not white.\n\n  What is he saying there? I think I know what he is saying.\n\n       But no one mobilized on behalf of perhaps 500 people who \n     were shot, hacked and burned to death in a village in eastern \n     Congo, in central Africa, around the same time. No outrage \n     was expressed on behalf of many other innocents who had the \n     misfortune to be slain. . . .\n\n  I read this because I knew this was going to happen. It was only 5 \ndays ago when I warned this was going to happen. So anyway, on April 5, \nI said Ouattara has tried to deny his involvement in the slaughter of \nup to 1,000 innocent people. This was on April 5, a little over 1 week \nago. There it is, folks, as shown in this picture. That town is called \nDuekoue. It is in Cote d'Ivoire. It is a small community: the western \ntown of Duekoue. His forces took the town earlier last week after the \nGbagbo forces had gone. They were already gone--they had to be--the \nGbagbo forces. We know now these people were shot, macheted, and burned \nto death by the Ouattara forces.\n  You may remember me quoting on the floor just a few days ago a BBC \nreport back last week that quoted a BBC reporter, Andrew Harding, who \nsaid of the Duekoue massacre--this is it now, folks, just a little over \n1 week ago--he said:\n\n       I spot four pigs eating something dark in a charred \n     courtyard. Standing by a newly dug mass grave, a UN soldier \n     from Morocco is choking with rage and grief. I ask him if any \n     of the dead [that the hogs are eating] are children. He nods \n     and begins to sob, quietly, into his facemask.\n\n  I pointed out that the Guardian, a British newspaper, quoted the U.N. \nmission which said that ``traditional hunters, known as Dozos, fought \nalongside Ouattara's forces and took part in killing 330 people in the \nwestern town of Duekoue, and that Guillaume Ngefa,\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\ndeputy head of the human rights division of the UN mission in Ivory \nCoast, blamed at least 220 of the deaths on pro-Ouattara forces.''\n  I repeat, this massacre was not caused by Gbagbo forces but by \nOuattara forces that had taken the town. The Gbagbo forces had left 1 \nweek earlier. There they are. Look at them: mutilated bodies, chewed \nup, burned. That was in Duekoue, a very small community in the western \npart of Cote d'Ivoire.\n  I repeat, this massacre was not caused by Gbagbo forces. I think we \nall know that. I, again, called--this was last week--for a cease-fire, \nand no one responded. That was just 1 week ago.\n  On April 7 and 8, I pointed out that the United Nations and the \nFrench were bombing downtown Abidjan, near the Presidential palace, \nwhere hundreds of young supporters of President Gbagbo had circled the \nPresidential palace making a human shield from the bombing. This is \nwhat they did--all these kids. All they had were baseball bats and 2 by \n4s in a circle surrounding the palace to protect their President, \nPresident Gbagbo, and his family of about 17 who were there and his \nwife Simone.\n  You saw, 1 minute ago, in this one picture right here, that--do you \nthink there is anything left of those kids who were surrounding the \npalace? No. They were all mowed down.\n  That was on the 7th and the 8th. Who knows how many of them were \nkilled. I cannot imagine any of them lived through it.\n  I also pointed out, on April 8, there were roving death squads--there \nthey are right there, folks; they are Ouattara people--roving deaths \nsquads who are disappearing--this is the word they use: \n``disappearing''--supporters of President Gbagbo. That means they are \nkilling them.\n  I called again for an immediate cease-fire, and no one responded, not \nour State Department, not the United Nations, certainly not the French.\n  I also pointed out that I believe massive vote fraud occurred in the \nNovember 28, 2010, Cote d'Ivoire Presidential election between \nPresident Gbagbo and the rebel leader, Alassane Ouattara, from up \nnorth. That is the Muslim part of Cote d'Ivoire.\n  I submitted evidence in two letters to the State Department that \nshowed that massive voter fraud allowed Ouattara to steal the election. \nIn one instance, it showed that in the first round--here we would call \nthis a primary and then a primary runoff. In the first round, in one of \nthe five districts in the north, they miscounted, they tabulated them, \nand just added 95,000 additional votes. I documented all this. If we \nhad 95,000 additional votes in each one of the five northern districts, \nthen clearly President Gbagbo won reelection.\n  In another case, if you look at what they had in what we call \nprimaries, in the first round President Gbagbo got thousands of votes--\nthousands of votes--in the northern five districts. When they did the \nrunoff, he got zero--zero--votes. That is a statistical impossibility.\n  What did our State Department do? Nothing. I did not receive--I \nfinally received a response to my two letters saying they think this is \nall fraudulent. They have not changed their minds. This is Sub-Saharan \nAfrica. Do they truly care? I can only conclude that our State \nDepartment is engaging in a whitewash of any credible investigation \ninto my allegations.\n  So I call again on the U.N., French, and Ouattara forces to halt all \nthe violence, including that being done against President Gbagbo and \nthe First Lady. They will be held responsible if any more harm comes to \nthem. I call for an independent investigation--this is what the \nAfricans want--into all the atrocities committed by all military forces \ninvolved in the fighting in Cote d'Ivoire. I call on the U.N., French, \nand Ouattara forces to halt immediately the death squads roving around \nthe streets of Abidjan ``disappearing'' supporters of President Gbagbo.\n  I had a call from one friend down there whom I certainly would not \nidentify. They would murder him overnight. He was talking about how he \ncould not go out. He could see bodies, corpses in the street. This was \n2 days ago. They could not go out there because they had snipers and \nthey would mow them down.\n  They are led by soldiers of Ouattara's rebel army, supported by the \nFrench and the United Nations, and have already killed more than 400 \npeople, in addition to, perhaps, the thousands killed in the bombing we \nhave already looked at.\n  Right now, I have several friends who give me these reports. They are \nsaying: Isn't there anything you can do now--just, if they go in now, \nafter they have killed all these people? I call upon, again, the United \nNations, the French--which I know are not going to do it--and certainly \nthe Ouattara rebels and our State Department to go in and stop it. We \ncould do it in no time at all.\n  There is all this concern about Libya and all these things going on. \nThis is just as bad, but nobody cares. Keep in mind, this is Sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n  So the streets are filled with the stench of rotting bodies.\n  I renew my call for hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee into the bombings and killings by the U.N., the French and \nthe Ouattara rebels and the strong evidence of massive voter fraud in \nthe November Presidential election.\n  I appreciate chairman John Kerry's willingness to hold such hearings, \nand I look forward to setting a date--the sooner the better.\n  I have talked to the chairman of the subcommittee--that is Chairman \nCoons and Ranking Member Isakson--and they have agreed to have these \nhearings.\n  I am anxious to get into this so all the world can see it. Maybe we \ncan stop this from happening again. I do not know.\n  I also suggest that the United States step in to help and examine the \npossibility of seeking a place of exile for the Gbagbos outside of Cote \nd'Ivoire. The United States has performed such a role before when, in \n1986, under the Reagan administration, Haiti's ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier \nwas sent into exile in France. So it has happened before. There is \nnothing wrong. The American Government did this before. I am asking \nthem to do it again: take these people, who are being maybe murdered at \nthis moment--we don't know; we know they are being tortured--and allow \nthem to go into exile.\n\n  This could be an important step toward beginning a process of \nreconciliation that the people of Cote d'Ivoire so dearly deserve. This \nis not about the Gbagbos. It is about the modern day return to French \ncolonial imperialism, and this time, with the help of the United \nNations, they were doing this.\n  Here is what my concern is: Cote d'Ivoire has had a hard enough time \ntrying to break free from the yoke of French colonialism. From the days \nof President Houphouet-Boigny in 1960 through Bedie in 2000--then \nGbagbo was elected in the year 2000--up to that time, the French had \nactually owned all the Presidents. They were all right there with \nFrance.\n  All you have to do is go through the streets of Abidjan--what streets \nmight be left now; I doubt there are many--and you will see that is \nhappening. It is not just the Gbagbos. Any President on the African \nContinent in Sub-Saharan Africa should know this could just as well \nhappen to them and their Ministers and their friends. That is what is \nhappening right now.\n  I am going to show you something that I hesitated doing, but this is \nthe happy face of President Gbagbo, as shown in this picture. This is \nthe face I know. This is the President who has been President since \n2000. He has gone through a lot of these same problems, but he stood up \nagainst the French and against the Ouattara in the north. Now he has \nbeen captured, and I will show you what he looks like today. This is 3 \ndays ago.\n  This is today. His face is beat in from the side. He is there. He is \nbeing held on this side by someone while they are mashing his face.\n  Then there is Simone, his wife. I happen to know her very well. I \nwill now show you a picture of her.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, we had--he is not there anymore--a great \nCongressman named J.C. Watts. He is an African American. I just talked \nto him today. He was at a hearing I testified in today. J.C. Watts is \nan African American who served in the House.\n  When Simone came over one time--this is Simone Gbagbos--she said: \nWould you try to let me get introduced to J.C. Watts, Congressman \nWatts. I\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\nsaid: Yes, I would be glad to do it. I did not know why. I went over \nand took her to the House of Representatives. We are in the Senate. \nThat was in the House. He was in a hearing. He came out, and I said: I \nwant to introduce you to someone who is the First Lady of Cote \nd'Ivoire. She then put her arms around him and started crying. He did \nnot know why she was crying. She said to him: Will you forgive us? J.C. \nWatts said: Forgive you for what? She said: Because we are the ones who \nsold your brothers into slavery.\n  In the United States of America, people walk around guilty--and they \nshould be--about the slavery we had. But in Africa, and particularly \nSub-Saharan Africa and west Africa, where most of the slave trade came \nfrom, such as Cote d'Ivoire, they realize they are the ones who sold \ntheir brothers into slavery. Here is Simone begging J.C. Watts to \nforgive her for selling them into slavery.\n  She was an elected member of Parliament from her district. She was \nleading the way for developing a center to care for orphans in her \ndistrict. At the national level, Simone Gbagbo, the First Lady, worked \nto have a nationwide program for women to get their products to market. \nNo name for that program is yet found, but that is what the program is. \nOn a continental level, she was the head of the Organization of African \nFirst Ladies against HIV/AIDS, a forum created to establish a role for \nAfrican First Ladies in dealing with the HIV needs of women and \nchildren. That is who Simone is. Isn't she pretty? That was 1 week ago.\n  Let's see what she looks like today. You cannot see it now. They have \nheld her and pulled her hair out by the roots. They went out into the \nstreets and said: This is the hair of Simone Gbagbos. I don't know what \nelse they did to her. Use your own imagination--brutally murdered.\n  Who are these people? They are the Ouattara forces. Do you think we \nmade that up? Here is another picture. There they are. All of these are \nidentified leaders of the Ouattara forces holding her. See what that \nthey are doing to her, beating her and pulling her hair out. That is \nwhat is happening today.\n  So I only will say--I will conclude with this--our State Department \nhas to wake up. You cannot assume the United Nations is doing something \nthat is right. We have to understand there is this half of a continent \ncalled Sub-Saharan Africa, and those people--their lives are worth just \nas much as they are worth in Kosovo or Bosnia or the United States or \nany of the other places we go and try to save lives.\n  Again, I would say to any of our friends and any of the Presidents of \nany of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, what has happened right \nthere could very well happen to the Presidents or First Ladies of your \ncountries.\n  I only ask three things. No. 1, stop this. Stop the firing that is \ngoing on right now. People are being murdered as we speak. Stop it. We \ncan do it. We have the power to do it. Our State Department can ask the \nUnited Nations to make it happen in spite of what the French might \nwant.\n  No. 2, send them into exile. Give them the dignity of living \nsomeplace else in Sub-Saharan Africa so these people, so the people of \nAfrica will know--can you imagine what the people of Cote d'Ivoire will \nbe thinking and doing in the near future if they allow this to go \nunanswered? That is my appeal to the U.S. State Department, to the \nUnited Nations, and to the French.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, there is no one else in the Chamber now. \nThey said they had other speakers lined up, and when they come in, I \nwill be glad to yield the floor to them. In the meantime, let me make a \ncouple of comments about the discussion today that everyone is \naddressing, Democrats and Republicans.\n  I have been here for a number of years. I have seen different \nadministrations come through. I think this is the first time the \nAmerican people have finally awoken to the fact that we have finally \ngotten to a point where we can't continue to do what we have been \ndoing.\n  When President Obama came into office, he came out with his first \nbudget and then his second budget and then his third budget. If we add \nup these budgets, what he has done successfully, since he had total \ncontrol of the House and the Senate, is passed these budgets. He has \nadded more to our national debt in 2 years than every President \nthroughout--in the history of this country, every President from George \nWashington to George W. Bush.\n  I can remember coming to this floor and I was outraged back in 1995 \nwhen then-President Clinton came up with a budget, and that budget was \na $1.5 trillion budget. This budget President Obama has come out with \nis not just $1 trillion, not $1.5 trillion, it is $3.5 trillion, and \nthe deficit alone for this 1 year is greater than the budget was for \nthe entire year of fiscal year 1996. It can't happen. We can't continue \nto do that.\n  Consequently--and I criticized some of my Republican friends when a \nlot of them voted for the $700 billion bailout back in October of 2008. \nOf course, none of the Republicans voted for the $800 billion stimulus \npackage. Right now, we are quibbling over, well, can we really cut $60 \nbillion from the budget. Yet they passed an $800 billion stimulus \npackage--spending. It had never been done before in the history of this \ncountry. It has to stop now.\n  I watched what Paul Ryan is doing over there. That is heavy lifting, \nthat is tough, and he is talking about something that is very real.\n  I see my good friend from Utah has come in.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleague.\n  Sometimes it amazes me how quickly debates change here in Washington. \nAt this time in 2009, President Obama was riding high. Heralded as the \nsecond coming of Franklin Roosevelt, the conventional wisdom was that \nhis election represented a sea change in the attitudes of American \ntaxpayers. Where his Democratic predecessor came to Congress and \nannounced that the era of big government was over, President Obama came \nto Washington convinced that the era of big government was just \nbeginning.\n  With historic majorities in both Houses of Congress, he and his \nCapitol Hill allies set about the business of transforming the Nation's \neconomy with massive jolts of new government spending and regulation. \nThey cultivated an unholy alliance of big labor, big business, and big \ngovernment, and the hoped-for result was a corporatist state where \ngovernment bureaucrats would calculate the fair share that business \nwould contribute to finance the administration's redistributionist \npolicies. They exploded the growth of the Federal Government through \nordinary appropriations and the stimulus. Democrats hiked up nondefense \ndiscretionary appropriations by 24 percent over the last 2 years and by \n84 percent if you count the stimulus bill.\n  But, as an American songwriter once put it, the times they are a-\nchanging.\n  Later this week, we will be considering the continuing resolution \nthat gets us to the end of fiscal year 2011. To hear the left talk, one \nwould think this proposal was shutting down agencies left and right. \nThey say we have cut discretionary spending to the bone. This, of \ncourse, is a little bit melodramatic. Before the Republicans won in \nNovember, the Federal Government was on pace to spend $3.8 trillion. \nThat is $3,800 billion. The continuing resolution we will vote on \nreduces spending by $38 billion. And $38 billion in spending reductions \nfrom spending of $3,800 billion or $3.8 trillion--whichever you like--\nis not exactly cutting to the bone.\n  I agree with my colleagues who say we need to reduce spending by even \nmore. Facing our third consecutive\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nyear with more than a $1 trillion projected deficit, these cuts barely \nscratch the surface of what needs to be done. But make no mistake about \nit--even these cuts would have been impossible if not for the \nRepublicans taking back the House and making gains in the Senate last \nNovember. When Republicans won, they changed the debate in Washington.\n  Even the press has been forced to acknowledge the depth of our fiscal \ncrisis, though old habits die hard. Just this morning, we witnessed a \nrelapse in the mainstream media as it did its best to enable excessive \nspending. The headline on the front page of today's Washington Post \nscreamed ``Cuts Will Affect Vast Spectrum of Priorities.'' This made me \nthink of the old joke about the likely reporting at the New York Times \non the outbreak of a nuclear conflict: ``Nuclear War Breaks Out: Women \nand Minorities Hardest Hit.'' But I should not be too hard on the \npress. They seem to be getting it. There is certainly no denying it. We \nare spending way more than we are taking in, and, absent real \nreductions in spending and meaningful reforms to entitlements, this \ncountry is cruising toward a legitimate debt crisis that will adversely \nimpact every American family.\n  This desire to reduce spending and restore the Constitution's limits \non the size of government is the new normal for taxpayers. The Obama \nadministration's salad days when they dreamed of permanently expanding \nthe size of the Federal Government are way back in the rearview \nmirror. Because of the undeniable seriousness of our debt and deficits \nand the commitment of Republicans to taking it on, the debate has \nshifted from how do we enlarge the size of government to how can we \nscale it back. The administration was slow to recognize this. When \ngiven his first opportunity to weigh in on this crisis, the President \nvoted ``present.'' His fiscal year 2012 budget was laughable for its \nfailure to take on our deficits and growing debt.\n\n  Even Ezra Klein, the liberal Washington Post reporter, could not \ncarry the President's water on this one. Even he couldn't carry the \nPresident's water on this one. He wrote that when reading the budget, \nit is almost like the fiscal commission never happened.\n  The President's fiscal commission recommended over $4 trillion in \nspending reductions, including adjustments to entitlements. I can't say \nI agree with everything in the commission's proposal, but it was a \nserious effort to get our Nation's finances back in order. But the \nPresident chose to pretend this report did not exist.\n  Well, since then, they must have done some polling over at the White \nHouse. They must have realized that on the most critical issue facing \nthe country, American taxpayers and American families want something \nmore from their President--they want leadership. The President of the \nUnited States can't just subcontract out these issues to other people. \nThe President of the United States has to lead, and in these areas it \ntakes the President. He has to be bold. He has to take a stand. For all \nof the elegiac comparisons of President Obama to Abraham Lincoln, \nFranklin Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan, those were not passive \nPresidents. On the big issues, they took big risks and they led the \ncountry. It seems as though the President's advisers have finally \nfigured this out. They need to get involved in a serious way on the \nissue of Federal spending.\n  Sitting back and adding nothing, while your allies demagogue \nreasonable solutions to pressing problems, is simply not acceptable to \nthe American people. Democrats tried this tired line of attack last \nweek, alleging that Republicans were out to hurt the poor, the \ndisabled, and the elderly. These smears really are beneath the dignity \nof our elected officials, and they show a total disregard for the \ncommon sense of American citizens and the good faith and charity of \nthose who support Republicans. A good first step for the President \nwould be to disavow these statements. He has a chance to do so \ntomorrow.\n  The President is giving a much-hyped speech tomorrow on the issue of \nspending and getting our deficits and debt under control. I can only \nsay I hope he comes through. The people of my home State of Utah and \nthe people of every State are demanding that Washington tackle out-of-\ncontrol spending. Vague outlines or statements of principle are not \ngoing to do it. The President needs to take a stand, or should I say \nstance.\n  I would add that the American people don't want solutions to a \nspending crisis that involve higher taxes. The solution to a spending \ncrisis is not higher taxes that will give the government more money to \nspend. Our problem is not that citizens are taxed too little; our \nproblem is that government spends too much.\n  So the President needs to come forward with serious, concrete \nproposals and commit to working with Congressman Ryan, Speaker Boehner, \nand Senate Republicans to solve this problem.\n  I am willing to give the President a mulligan on his first budget \nproposal. The President, like Members of Congress, represents the \npeople. As representatives of the people, we must acknowledge those \ntimes when we get it wrong. When the people make it clear that they \nwant their elected officials to go in a different direction, in a \ndemocratic republic it is only right that the President and the \nCongress give voice to those concerns. The President seems to \nunderstand that he got it wrong with this first budget.\n  Taxpayers and families want Washington to take on spending, but the \npeople will not be fooled. If the President comes out tomorrow and \nspeaks in vague generalities, if he comes out and simply defers to \nCongress, he will have satisfied no one. Being the President of the \nUnited States is not like being a law professor. Your job is not merely \nto facilitate dialog. Your job is to lead.\n  I look forward to the President's remarks tomorrow. I guess we could \ncall it the President's budget, part deux. My hope is that the sequel \nwill be better than the original.\n  With that, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2382-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2382-S2383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             STEM EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a matter that is \nvery important to our country, to Minnesota, and to me, which is \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics education or STEM \neducation for short.\n  As I have traveled around Minnesota, I have heard from many of our \nhigh-tech businesses. They fear our students will not be ready to take \non the jobs waiting for them when they graduate and, as a result, these \njobs will go unfilled and our economy will founder. This is not just \ntrue in Minnesota, of course, but across the country--in Pennsylvania, \nthe State of the Presiding Officer, and everywhere in our Nation.\n  That is why I am addressing our need for a well-trained STEM \nworkforce through the STEM Master Teacher Corps Act, which has been \ncosponsored by my colleagues, Senators Lieberman and Shaheen.\n  We have been hearing concern about the state of STEM education in our \ncountry for over a decade now. In 2000, a 25-member commission, headed \nby former Senator John Glenn, published a report called ``Before It's \nToo Late,'' which addressed the pressing need for high-quality math and \nscience teaching.\n  Five years later, another report--``Rising Above the Gathering \nStorm''--presented the findings and recommendations of a National \nAcademies commission, chaired by former Lockheed Martin CEO Norm \nAugustine, concerning the deteriorating condition of STEM education and \nbasic research.\n  Last year, a followup report, dramatically entitled ``Rapidly \nApproaching Category 5 Hurricane,'' warned us that the ``gathering \nstorm'' is now threatening to wipe out U.S. leadership in global \nscience and technology if we don't act fast--and said so with good \nreason.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly every one of the \ntop 30 fastest growing professions requires\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\nSTEM skills. These include jobs in some of the fields that are most \ncritical to the future of our country--health care, energy, climate \nchange, and national security. Yet too few kids are graduating from \nhigh school with the interest or the preparation to successfully pursue \nSTEM degrees in college. Well over half of college students in China \nand Japan major in STEM fields, compared with only one-third of U.S. \nstudents.\n  International standardized tests show that we rank only average or \nbelow average in students' math and science performance. The 2009 \nProgram for International Student Assessment placed American 15-year-\nolds 25th in math and 17th in science out of 34 OECD countries--the \ndeveloped countries. What is worse is, we are spending more on \neducation per student than any other OECD country in the world, except \nfor Luxembourg.\n  As Congress works to reform No Child Left Behind this year--and the \nPresiding Officer is working with me on that on the HELP Committee--I \nurge my colleagues to consider strongly the importance of STEM \neducation and how to spend our limited resources most effectively. \nPresident Obama has proposed recruiting and training 100,000 new STEM \nteachers in the next decade and has requested $100 million to advance \nthis worthy goal.\n  However, many STEM teachers leave the profession within their first \nfew years of teaching, often drawn by far more lucrative salaries \nelsewhere in science and technology fields. Those talents are valued in \nthe market. So if we are going to invest in recruiting and training new \nteachers, we also need to invest in retaining and best utilizing those \nindividuals.\n  The STEM Master Teacher Corps Act is based on a proposal brought \nforth by President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and \nTechnology. It will provide the top K-12 STEM teachers in a \nparticipating area with additional professional development, so they \ncan become leaders in their schools and in their communities.\n  Master teachers will mentor their younger or less-effective peers, \ngiving them guidance and inspiring them to stay in teaching. Master \nteachers will also network with one another, sharing best practices and \nresources. Together, these measures will improve the quality and the \nability of all teachers to impart strong STEM skills and an eagerness \nto learn and pass it on to their students.\n  Providing career advancement opportunities to effective STEM teachers \nand support to beginning teachers will help increase retention, so our \ninvestments in recruitment and training will have an even greater \npayoff.\n  In recognition of their excellent work and new leadership \nresponsibilities, it is only fair that these master teachers should be \ncompensated, so my legislation also gives them a salary bump. Our \nteachers work just as hard as other STEM professionals, and it is time \nwe recognize that and pay them accordingly. According to the National \nAssociation of Colleges and Employers, the median salary offered to \nrecent college graduates in certain STEM-related fields, including \nphysics, computer science, accounting, and engineering, is $24,000 \nhigher than that offered to a new secondary school teacher and $30,000 \nhigher than that offered to a new elementary school teacher.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by more than 60 national and \nregional groups, ranging from educational organizations such as the \nNational Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, \nthe College Board, and Education Minnesota, to business groups such as \nLifeScience Alley, the BioBusiness Alliance of Minnesota, and the \nMinnesota High Tech Association. The bill is also supported by rural \ngroups, such as the National Rural Education Association and the Rural \nSchool and Community Trust and numerous science and math societies.\n\n  I am particularly pleased to have the endorsement of two leading \nnational businesses that also happened to be headquartered in my State, \nMedtronic and 3M. Both of these companies recognize and support the \nimportance of acting now to ensure a well-trained workforce for the \nfuture, and they have already shown a proactive interest in supporting \nand engaging students in STEM activities.\n  I was recently at a first robotics event at the University of \nMinnesota that was astounding. They had two huge auditoriums of these \nover-130 teams competing in Minnesota in this robotics competition. So \nI am very grateful for the support of 3M and of Medtronic.\n  Mr. President, I have a very impressive list of the number of \nendorsers to the bill, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the full list of endorsers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nOrganizations Endorsing Senator Franken's STEM Master Teacher Corps Act \n                                of 2011\n\n       3M; Alliance for Excellent Education; American Association \n     for the Advancement of Science; American Association of \n     Physicists in Medicine; American Association of Physics \n     Teachers; American Federation of Teachers (AFT); American \n     Institute of Physics; American Mathematical Society; American \n     Physical Society; American Society for Engineering Education; \n     American Society of Civil Engineers; America's Promise \n     Alliance; Arlington, MA STEM Coalition; ASME Center for \n     Public Awareness; Association of Science Materials Centers; \n     Biobusiness Alliance of Minnesota; Campaign for Environmental \n     Literacy; Central Jersey Modeling Institute; College Board; \n     College of Education at Purdue University; Council of State \n     Science Supervisors.\n       ECOCAD DESIGN GROUP, LLC; Education Development Center; \n     Education Minnesota; Engaged Education Now; For Inspiration \n     and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST); HMC \n     Architects; IEEE-USA; International Renewable Energy \n     Technology Institute; Iowa Mathematics and Science Education \n     Partnership; LearnOnLine, Inc.; LifeScience Alley; Materials \n     Research Society; Math for America; Medtronic; Minnesota \n     Center for Engineering and Manufacturing Excellence; \n     Minnesota Council of Teachers of Mathematics; Minnesota High \n     Tech Association; Minnesota Intermediate District 287.\n       National Association of Secondary School Principals; \n     National Association of State Boards of Education; National \n     Board for Professional Teaching Standards; National Council \n     of Teachers of Mathematics; National Education Association \n     (NEA); National Institute of Building Sciences; National \n     Institute for Excellence in Teaching; National Rural \n     Education Association; National Science Center; National \n     Science Teachers Association; New Teacher Center; Ohio \n     Technology and Engineering Educators Association; Ohio \n     Technology Education Advisory Council; The Optical Society; \n     NV STEM Education Coalition; Project Lead The Way; Rural \n     School and Community Trust; School Science and Mathematics \n     Association (SSMA); South Carolina's Coalition for \n     Mathematics and Science; SPIE, the International Society for \n     Optics and Photonics; STARBASE Minnesota; STEM Education \n     Coalition; TIAX LLC; Triangle Coalition for Science and \n     Technology Education.\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, the Master Teacher Corps Program \naddresses the recommendations presented in the President's Council of \nAdvisers on Science and Technology's 2010 K-12 STEM education report \nand tracks the priorities laid out more than 10 years ago in the Glenn \nCommission report.\n  Specifically, it would establish an ongoing system to improve the \nquality of mathematics and science teaching in grades K-12, and it \nwould improve the working environment and make the teaching profession \nmore attractive for K-12 mathematics and science teachers.\n  With the planned reform and reauthorization of No Child Left Behind \nthis year, we have a rare and, indeed, ideal opportunity to implement \nreal change in K-12 STEM education in this country. So let's act now, \nbefore it is too late, before the storm has fully gathered, and before \nthat rapidly approaching category 5 hurricane destroys the competitive \ntechnological edge and the prosperity our country has worked so hard to \nbuild and maintain.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Lieberman, Shaheen, and me in \nsupporting a sustained investment in K-12 STEM teacher quality and in \nraising the standards of the teaching profession through the STEM \nMaster Teacher Corps Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2383-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2383-S2384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA-\n                DULUTH'S MEN'S HOCKEY TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment to \ncongratulate the University of Minnesota-Duluth's men's hockey team for \ncapturing their first ever NCAA Division I Championship. The UMD \nBulldogs faced off against the Michigan\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\nWolverines in St. Paul this past Saturday and, wow, it was an amazing \ngame.\n  Over 19,000 fans packed the Xcel Energy Center to watch a nail-biter, \nreally, is what it was. Goaltenders Shawn Hunwick of Michigan and UMD's \nKenny Reiter kept the game close, neither allowing a goal in the third \nperiod and sending the game into overtime.\n  Stuck at 2-2 Bulldog Travis Oleksuk gathered the puck behind the \nMichigan goal just 3 minutes into the extra period. With the puck on \nhis backhand, Oleksuk slid a pass in front of the net to hard-charging \nteammate Kyle Schmidt, Hermantown, MN.\n  Kyle, only 10 days removed from hand surgery, buried the puck from \njust outside the crease. In a moment of pure exuberance, he skated to \nthe half-line and dove onto his back, performing what I believe was a \nsnow angel, as he slid on the ice. It was something to see. It was one \nof the most thrilling finishes in college hockey history.\n  After 50 long years, Kyle's overtime goal gave the Minnesota-Duluth \nBulldogs their first ever men's hockey NCAA Championship. In his tenth \nyear at the helm, Coach Scott Sandelin led a tenacious and skilled \nBulldog team that dominated on the power play and got timely \ngoaltending throughout the tournament.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't commend the Michigan Wolverines, who \nplayed fiercely and deserve congratulations for an excellent final \ngame. I know everyone at the University of Minnesota-Duluth must still \nhave smiles on their face after their victory, and I congratulate the \nplayers and coaches and the fans on a triumphant season.\n  I would also be remiss if I didn't say that last year the women's \nhockey team, the Bulldogs also, won the women's NCAA Division I hockey \ntournament. So kudos to the University of Minnesota-Duluth and the \nBulldogs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Mr. President, last week in Chicago, we announced tax \nfreedom day--the day that marks the time when Illinois residents have \npaid their Federal and State tax burdens. The Tax Foundation, a \nnonpartisan organization that determines tax freedom day, found that \nthis year Americans will pay more on their tax burden than they do on \nfood, shelter, and clothing combined. Tax freedom day falls on April 15 \nin Illinois and on April 12 nationwide.\n  Yet tax freedom day underestimates how heavy the government's burden \nis by only reflecting the size of the bills we actually pay to the \ngovernment, not the spending we are pushing off on future generations \nin the form of higher deficits and debt. If we paid all of our bills to \nthe government, the way it spends money, tax freedom day would not come \nuntil May 23.\n  With a government that consumes so much, it is fair to ask: Is the \ngovernment spending as efficiently as possible on programs it is \nfunding? Sadly, it is very clear that waste, fraud, and duplication \nstill exist widely in the Federal Government.\n  To call attention to these issues, I introduced the ``silver fleece \naward'' in homage of Senator William Proxmire's ``golden fleece,'' but \nthis one is made of silver, not gold, because we are headed for more \naustere times. In the month of February, this award was voted by \nFacebook users on ``waste book'' and was given to a program awarding $1 \nmillion to provide signs displaying poetry in zoos.\n  I rise today to announce the nominees for the month of March and to \nannounce the winner. The second runner up was a grant related to the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA, and Safe, \nAccountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act, or SAFETEA-\nLU, which was awarded $150,000 to create special tunnels for \nsalamanders to pass under a Vermont road. The first runner up was a \nvideo game, funded by the Federal Government, called ``WolfQuest,'' \nwhich was developed using a National Science Foundation grant of \n$609,160 to the Minnesota Zoo.\n  However, the March winner of the ``silver fleece award,'' with a 63-\npercent vote, is a grant of $460,000 funding a study on why people lie \non text messages, instant messaging services, social networking Web \nsites, and other modern communication systems. Yes, we spent over \n$460,000 of hard-earned taxpayer dollars to tell you why people lie \nwhen they are communicating electronically.\n  There are new nominees for the April ``silver fleece award.'' This \nmonth's nominees were put forward by a leader on the issues of fighting \npork and government waste in the House, Congressman Jeff Flake of \nArizona. He nominated $450,000 in grants from the State Department for \nart shows in Venice, Italy, $130,276 in National Health Foundation \nfunds to sponsor the creation and distribution of a cookbook, and \n$328,835 spent on an Air Force photo op in New York City.\n  We invite your votes and your feedback on ``wastebook on Facebook'' \nto decide what next month's ``silver fleece award'' winner will be.\n  The sad thing in all of this is that the only current loser is the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2384-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2384-S2385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BILL SAMUELS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when most people think about Kentucky, \nthree things usually spring to mind immediately: horses, college \nbasketball, and bourbon. What few people realize, however, is that it \nis only in the past few decades that premium bourbon has had much of a \npresence outside Kentucky at all. Just 30 years ago, bourbon was one of \nthe fastest-declining spirits in America. And yet today, the industry \nsupports 10,000 jobs in Kentucky; more than 1.5 million people have \nvisited the Kentucky Bourbon Trail in the last 5 years; and every \ndistiller in the State is adding capacity. So bourbon's come a long \nway, and if you ask folks in Kentucky, most of the credit goes to one \nman, whose 35-year run at the helm of the world's most famous bourbon \ndistillery comes to an end this week.\n  I am referring, of course, to Mr. Bill Samuels, Jr., the longtime \npresident of Makers Mark. Bill's dad may have come up with the formula \nfor premium bourbon, but it is because of Bill's vision and tenacity \nthat the rest of the world knows about it today.\n  The first thing you could say about Bill Samuels is that rarely in \nthe history of American commerce has there been a better marriage \nbetween a man and a product than the one between him and Makers Mark. \nTo many Kentuckians, he is an instantly recognizable figure. You could \nsay that what Colonel Sanders was to chicken, Bill is to bourbon. And \nso it is appropriate that the first job he ever had, at the age of 16, \nwas driving the colonel around. You couldn't ask for a better teacher \nthan Harlan Sanders if you wanted to learn how to promote a product, \nand, if that product was bourbon, you couldn't ask for a better \nhometown than Bardstown, KY. Bill's godfather and next-door neighbor \nwas Jim Beam, and Bill can trace his family's tradition of bourbon \nmaking in Bardstown back seven generations to 1844.\n  A dramatic change in the family business came in 1953, when Bill's \nfather, Bill Samuels, Sr., decided to abandon the old family recipe, \nbought the smallest distillery in the State, just outside of Loretto, \nand got to work on a more premium product. Bill, Sr. never really \nthought of the family business as much more than a hobby, so Bill, Jr. \nwent off to college where he studied engineering and earned a law \ndegree. But the family business retained a certain attraction, and soon \nthe younger of the two Bills had to make a choice: practice law, or \naccept his father's offer to work with him for half the money. The \nother terms of employment weren't much better. Bill's dad told him that \nthey did three things and three things only at the family's distillery: \n``We make whiskey, we\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\ncount money, and we sell whiskey''--and that his dad was in charge of \nthe first two.\n  Bill knew the family's bourbon had a future beyond its small but \nloyal customer base, and over the next several years he would put \ntogether the strategy to prove it. Where most businesses focused on \ntelling people why they should buy their product, Bill would let the \npeople who already liked Makers Mark do the talking. Bill's view was \nthat if he focused on maintaining quality, the demand would grow on its \nown, one happy customer at a time. The real turning point came in 1980, \nwhen a reporter from the Wall Street Journal started making inquiries \nabout this distillery outside Loretto, KY, that seemed to be in high \ndemand. The front-page story that followed called Makers Mark a model \nof inefficiency by choice. It noted that the Samuels' produced only 19 \nbarrels of bourbon a day compared to an industry average in the \nhundreds, and described a cadre of loyal fans who liked it so much they \nwould pay a premium to get it.\n  The response was overwhelming. Bill, Jr. followed up with a series of \nclever ads that underscored just how small the distillery was, and how \ndifficult it had become to keep up with demand, which of course only \nincreased it. Soon, Makers Mark exploded onto the national and \ninternational stage as a premium brand, and an entire premium industry \nemerged for Kentucky, which today produces more than 95 percent of all \nbourbon produced in the U.S.\n  Bill's genius for marketing and his love for Kentucky has always \nextended well beyond the family business. Over the years, he chaired an \nastonishing 27 different boards, including those at the University of \nLouisville, Bellarmine University, and the Kentucky Chamber of \nCommerce. To the amusement of his friends, he rcently signed up for \nLeadership Kentucky, a program typically reserved for young businessmen \nor women or newcomers to the Sate who want to learn more about \nKentucky.\n  For a guy who is about as well known in Kentucky business as Colonel \nSanders, it doesn't make much sense. But it makes perfect sense to \npeople who know Bill. And whether he is showing up unexpectedly at some \nbar in Dallas or Chicago and buying a round of drinks, greeting \nvisitors at the distillery in Loretto, or showing up at an event in a \n12-button suit, Bill is one of those rare businessmen who has always \nbeen great at getting attention without showing a trace of ego. He has \ndone it by focusing on the needs of his community, insisting on \nquality, and sticking to the winning formula that made Makers Mark a \nsuccess. Those who have worked with Bill will tell you he is prone to \nself-deprecation, but this week Kentuckians across the State will have \nan opportunity to commend him on a job well done. And on behalf of all \nwho have benefited from the vision and creativity of Bill Samuels, Jr., \nI would like to thank him for his dedicated service to the \nCommonwealth, and to wish him well in all his future endeavors. Knowing \nBill, he is probably just getting started.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2385-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO CAILLEY AND MEMORABLE FACTOR\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Le Grand Concours French \ncompetition consists of oral and written portions and is given by the \nAmerican Association of Teachers of French to over 100,000 students \nlearning French in all 50 States and abroad.\n  The MathFest was created in 2001 to provide an extended math \ninitiative that would motivate students, parents, and teachers to raise \nthe standards and expectations in math. This year the South Carolina \nMathFest was held in Columbia, and 4,000 math students from around the \nState participated in the competition.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize and honor Cailley Factor \nof Charleston County for winning first place in the second division at \nthe State MathFest competition and for being named a national champion \nof Le Grand Concours 2010 French competition. Additionally, I would \nlike to recognize Memorable ``Mem'' Factor of Charleston County for \nwinning first place in the first grade division at the State MathFest \ncompetition and for being named a national champion of Le Grand \nConcours 2010 French competition. This is the first time in the history \nof the competition that siblings have been named winners in the same \nyear.\n  The achievements of both Cailley and Memorable Factor serve as an \nexample which all students should strive towards. I applaud them both \nin their accomplishments and look forward to their future \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2385-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 9, 2011, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has agreed to the amendment of the Senate to \nthe bill (H.R. 1363) making appropriations for the Department of \nDefense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  The message also announced that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1363.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, \nrace, or national origin, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today Americans observe Equal Pay Day--the \ndate that marks the extra days that women must work into 2011 in order \nto equal what men earned in 2010. On this day, I am proud to introduce \nthe Fair Pay Act of 2011, a bill I have introduced every Congress since \n1996.\n  In 1963, Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act to end unfair \ndiscrimination against women in the workforce. While we have made \nprogress toward this important goal, nearly half a century later, too \nmany women still do not get paid what men do for the same or nearly the \nsame work. On average, a woman makes only 77 cents for every dollar \nthat a man makes. That translates into an average of $400,000 over her \nlifetime that a woman loses because of unequal pay practices. The \ncircumstances are even worse for Latinas and women of color.\n  This is wrong, it is unjust, and it threatens the economic security \nof our families. The fact is millions of Americans are dependent on a \nwoman's pay-check just to get by, to put food on the table, pay for \nchild care, and deal with rising health care bills. Two-thirds of \nmothers bring home at least a quarter of their family's earnings. In \nmany families, a woman is the sole breadwinner.\n  The evidence shows that discrimination accounts for much of the pay \ngap, and our laws have not done enough to prevent this discrimination \nfrom occurring. That is why passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nwas a critical first step, and why it is important to pass the Paycheck \nFairness Act, introduced today by Senator Mikulski and Representative \nDeLauro, of which I am a proud original cosponsor. There are too many \nloopholes and barriers to effective enforcement of our existing laws. \nWe need to strengthen penalties and give women the tools they need to \nconfront discrimination.\n  At the same time, we must recognize that the problem of unequal pay \ngoes beyond insidious discrimination. As a nation, we unjustly devalue \njobs traditionally performed by women, even when they require \ncomparable skills to jobs traditionally performed by men.\n  Today, millions of female-dominated jobs--for example, social \nworkers, teachers, child care workers and nurses--are equivalent in \nskills, effort, responsibility and working conditions to similar jobs \ndominated by men. But, the female-dominated jobs pay significantly \nless. This is inexplicable. Why is a housekeeper worth less than a \njanitor? Why is a parking meter reader worth less than an electrical \nmeter reader? Why is a social worker worth less than a probation \nofficer?\n  To address this more subtle, deep-rooted discrimination, today I am \njoining with Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton to introduce the Fair \nPay Act, which will ensure that employers provide equal pay for jobs \nthat are equivalent in skill, effort, responsibility and working \nconditions.\n  This important legislation would also require employers to publicly \ndisclose their job categories and their pay scales, without requiring \nspecific information on individual employees. If we give women \ninformation about what their male colleagues are earning, they can \nnegotiate a better deal for themselves in the workplace.\n  Right now, women who believe they are the victim of pay \ndiscrimination must file a lawsuit and endure a drawn-out legal \ndiscovery process to find out whether they make less than the man \nworking beside them. With pay statistics readily available, this \nexpensive process could be avoided.\n  The number of lawsuits would surely go down if employees could see up \nfront whether they are being treated fairly. In fact, I once asked \nLilly Ledbetter: if the Fair Pay Act had been law, would it have \naverted her wage discrimination case? She said that with the \ninformation about pay scales that the bill provides, she would have \nknown that she was a victim of discrimination and could have tried to \naddress the problem sooner, rather than suffering a lifelong drop in \nher earnings and a trip all the way to the Supreme Court to try to make \nthings right.\n  On this Equal Pay Day, let us make sure that what happened to Lilly \nnever happens again by recommitting to eliminate discrimination in the \nworkplace and make equal pay for equal work a reality. America's \nworking women and the families that rely on them deserve fairness on \nthe job. Hopefully, soon, we can achieve true equality in the workplace \nso there is no need to commemorate equal pay day any more.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\n                                 S. 788\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Pay \n     Act of 2011''.\n       (b) Reference.--Except as provided in section 8, whenever \n     in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of \n     an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, \n     the reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \n     other provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 201 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Wage rate differentials exist between equivalent jobs \n     segregated by sex, race, and national origin in Government \n     employment and in industries engaged in commerce or in the \n     production of goods for commerce.\n       (2) The existence of such wage rate differentials--\n       (A) depresses wages and living standards for employees \n     necessary for their health and efficiency;\n       (B) prevents the maximum utilization of the available labor \n     resources;\n       (C) tends to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, \n     affecting, and obstructing commerce;\n       (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n     commerce; and\n       (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition.\n       (3) Discrimination in hiring and promotion has played a \n     role in maintaining a segregated work force.\n       (4) Many women and people of color work in occupations \n     dominated by individuals of their same sex, race, and \n     national origin.\n       (5)(A) In 2009, a woman in the United States working in a \n     full-time, year-round job earned 77 cents for every dollar \n     earned by a man working in a full-time, year-round job.\n       (B) A 2007 study found that - even when accounting for key \n     factors generally known to influence earnings such as race, \n     educational attainment, and experience - nearly half (49.3 \n     percent) of the pay gap can be explained by differences in \n     the industries and occupations that men and women work in, \n     and 41 percent of the pay gap cannot be accounted for but may \n     be partially explained by discrimination in the workplace.\n       (6) Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     prohibits discrimination in compensation for ``equal work'' \n     on the basis of sex.\n       (7) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n     discrimination in compensation based upon sex, race, and \n     national origin continue to exist more than 4 decades after \n     the passage of section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938, the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.). Elimination of such \n     barriers would have positive effects, including--\n       (A) providing a solution to problems in the economy created \n     by discrimination through wage rate differentials;\n       (B) substantially reducing the number of working women and \n     people of color earning low wages, thereby reducing the \n     dependence on public assistance; and\n       (C) promoting stable families by enabling working family \n     members to earn a fair rate of pay.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for mandatory training for Federal \nGovernment supervisors and the assessment of management competencies; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Federal \nSupervisor Training Act.\n  Properly trained supervisors are critical to the federal government's \nability to efficiently and effectively provide essential services to \nthe American people. First-level supervisors have close contact and \nfrequent interaction with our Federal employees and thus have the most \nsignificant impact on employee performance.\n  Investing in first-level supervision could yield enormous positive \nreturns. Research has shown that supervisory skills strongly predict \nagency performance and that improving the quality of first-level \nsupervision is one of the most effective ways to improve an agency's \nperformance. According to a 2010 Merit Systems Protection Board report \nentitled ``A Call to Action: Improving First-Level Supervision of \nFederal Employees,'' the fastest and most direct way to strengthen \nFederal workforce performance is to improve the supervision employees \nreceive.\n  For managers and supervisors in the Federal Government, few things \nare more important than training. Supervisor training programs improve \ncommunication, promote stronger manager-employee relationships, reduce \nconflict, and cultivate efficiency.\n  Conversely, poor supervision can damage agency performance and \nemployee morale, which undermines agency performance and wastes money. \nThe National Academy of Public Administration reported that while it is \ndifficult to quantify the precise cost of supervisory deficiencies, \neven a small deficiency could result in a loss of billions of dollars, \nand that without solid programs for developing first level supervisors, \nagencies pay an enormous price. Simply stated, investing in supervisory \ntraining in the Federal Government now will save us money later.\n  The need for effective supervisor training is becoming even more \npressing given the large number of Federal employees who are expected \nto retire in the next few years. The Office of Personnel Management \nestimates that by the year 2014, approximately 53 percent of permanent \nfull-time Federal employees will be eligible to retire, and the \nmajority of those eligible will retire. Because supervisors tend to be \nolder and have more years of service than non-supervisors, supervisors \nare likely to retire at faster rates than non-supervisors. In light of \nthe expected retirement wave, training a new\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\ngeneration of federal supervisors is a matter of national urgency.\n  The Federal Supervisor Training Act will require that new supervisors \nreceive training on specified topics, including whistleblower and anti-\ndiscrimination rights, during their initial 12 months on the job, \nunless the Office of Personnel Management grants an extension to their \nemploying agency. Supervisors will be required to update their training \nonce every three years. Current supervisors will have three years to \nobtain their initial training. This bill will also require agencies to \nimplement a program whereby experienced supervisors mentor new \nsupervisors.\n  In addition, the Federal Supervisor Training Act will require the \nOffice of Personnel Management to issue guidance to agencies on \ncompetencies supervisors are expected to meet in order to effectively \nsupervise employees. Based on this guidance, or any additional \ncompetencies established by employing agencies, each agency will be \nrequired to assess the performance of its supervisors.\n  This bill builds upon supervisor training requirements under the \nFederal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, which directs agencies to \nestablish training programs that develop supervisors, and to establish \nprograms to provide additional training to supervisors in three areas--\ndealing with poor performers, mentoring employees and improving their \nperformance, and conducting performance appraisals.\n  I am delighted that this bill has received support from the \nGovernment Managers Coalition, which represents members of the Senior \nExecutives Association, the Federal Managers Association, the \nProfessional Managers Association, the Federal Aviation Administration \nManagers Association, and the National Council of Social Security \nManagement Associations. Additionally, it is supported by some of the \nlargest federal sector labor organizations, including the American \nFederation of Government Employees, the National Treasury Employees \nUnion, the National Federation of Federal Employees, and the \nInternational Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers. \nFinally, this bill is supported by the Partnership for Public Service, \na non-profit, non-partisan organization which works to find ways to \nimprove the government's ability to provide services to citizens. I \nbelieve the broad support from management associations, labor \norganizations, and outside good government groups demonstrates the need \nfor this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 790\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to \nimprove compensation for workers involved in uranium mining, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2011. The Radiation \nExposure Compensation Act, known as RECA, was first passed in 1990 \nafter years of work and litigation. The act was later improved in 2000 \nthrough amendments made by Congress, and today I am joined by my \ncolleagues, Senators Bingaman, Bennet, Crapo, Mark Udall, and Risch, to \nonce again improve the act through introduction of this legislation.\n  This bill honors the individuals who unwittingly gave their health \nand even their lives to national efforts to develop uranium and a Cold \nWar nuclear arsenal during the mid-20th century. Some Americans were \nsickened through exposure to aboveground atomic weapons tests, and \nothers were exposed to heavy doses of radiation from working in the \nuranium mining industry. All the while, the government was slow to \nimplement Federal protections. As a result, a generation of Americans \nwho worked in the mines and lived near testing sites became sick with \nserious diseases like lung cancer and kidney disease.\n  Much of the United States' uranium development and weapons testing \noccurred in New Mexico and the West. Mines and mills drew workers into \nrural communities. These workers, and much of the country, were unaware \nof the dangers of radiation exposure. As mining and milling continued \nand our national understanding of the dangers of radiation exposure \ndeveloped, the Federal Government continued to fail to ensure that \nuranium workers and their families were safe from the hazards of \nexposure to radioactive materials. As a result, numerous illnesses and \ncancers began to emerge in the men and women who worked in the uranium \nmining industry and lived downwind of weapons testing sites.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, the Pueblo of Laguna was home to the \nnation's largest open pit uranium mine. Additionally, many large and \nsmall mines and mill sites were opened within the Navajo Nation. In \nfact, much of the State's northwestern area is spackled with hundreds \nof abandoned uranium mines. Workers from across the State came to these \nmines and mills, especially from the economically struggling \ncommunities of rural New Mexico.\n  In the late '70s, my father, Stewart Udall, took up the fight for \nthese workers. In 1979, my father filed 32 claims against the \nDepartment of Energy on behalf of widows of deceased Navajo uranium \nminers. In many ways, this marked the beginning of the fight for \ncompensation for all uranium workers. I remember working those years \nwith my whole family to collect information and push for recognition. \nIt was a family effort to fight injustice, and for me, it continues to \nbe a family priority. Ten years later, the original RECA legislation \nwas passed in the United States Congress, giving a level of restitution \nto sick miners and millers, as well as individuals downwind of nuclear \ntests. The RECA legislation was later expanded upon through an \namendment adopted in 2000.\n\n  The legislation we introduce today takes the next step to address the \nremaining shortfalls of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act.\n  Specifically, the bill would include post-1971 uranium workers as \nqualified claimants. While the Federal Government ceased purchase of \ndomestic uranium in 1971, implementation of Federal work safety \nstandards was slow and regulation of mines was poor. As a result, \nthousands of miners and millers were never made aware of the dangers of \nthe yellow cake they handled on a regular basis. In recently conducted \nsurveys, the majority of uranium workers from this time period report \nthat they did not have showers or washbasins in the mines where they \nworked. They often took contaminated clothing home for laundering, \nunaware of the hazards and with no other option for cleaning. Many also \nreport that ventilation to prevent unnecessary exposure was not \nprovided in their work areas.\n  Today, these workers continue to suffer and die from illnesses \nrelated to radiation exposure. But because their employment dates began \nafter 1971, the cut-off included in the original RECA legislation, they \nhave no opportunity for compensation. Our bill changes that. If the \nmeasure passes, individuals working between 1971 and 1990 will qualify \nto claim compensation for exposure-related diseases.\n  The bill we're introducing today would also expand the geographic \nareas that qualify for downwind compensation to include New Mexico, \nIdaho, Montana, Colorado, and Guam. And for the first time, the bill \nrecognizes downwind exposure from the original atomic weapons test \nsite--the Trinity Site in New Mexico.\n  Those exposed as a result of aboveground weapons tests would receive \nincreased compensation as a result of passage of the bill being \nintroduced today. This would make their compensation consistent with \ntheir counterparts who worked in mines and mills.\n  Comprehensive epidemiological research on the impacts of uranium \ndevelopment on communities and families of uranium workers is long \noverdue. Our legislation would authorize funding for the National \nInstitute of Environmental Health Sciences to award grants to \nuniversities and non-profits to carry out such research.\n  Many who have suffered as a result of cold war uranium and weapons \ndevelopment do not have the documentation to prove their exposure. \nOften, mines and mills did not keep proper documentation of their \nworkers, and many communities impacted do not have a tradition of \nkeeping birth and marriage certification. The RECA Amendments of 2011 \nwould broaden the use of affidavits to substantiate employment history \nand residence in an affected downwind area.\n  Employees would also be able to combine their time worked in multiple \npositions to meet the work-time requirements for compensation in the \noriginal RECA legislation if today's legislation is adopted.\n  Finally, this legislation would allow miners to be compensated for \nkidney disease. And it would allow core drillers to join miners, \nmillers, and ore transporters on the current list of uranium workers \nwho qualify for compensation under the Act.\n  For more than two decades now, the United States has tried to \ncompensate in some way for the sickness and loss of life that came as a \nresult of cold war era uranium and weapons development. Much has been \naccomplished, but today we are taking the next step to close\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\nthis sad chapter in history and to improve the reach of compassionate \ncompensation to those Americans who have suffered, but have not \nqualified under RECA in its current form.\n  Thousands continue to suffer from deadly illnesses as a result of \nradiation exposure, but many do not qualify for compensation because \nthey began employment after 1971, or because they worked for a short \ntime in several different mines and mills. Others qualify for a level \nof compensation, but still struggle to pay the expensive medical bills \nassociated with their illnesses.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to recognize these \nindividuals and expand RECA to include all who are justified in \nreceiving radiation exposure compensation, and I urge the Judiciary \nCommittee, the committee of jurisdiction, to expedite hearing on this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRYOR:\n  S. 792. A bill to authorize the waiver of certain debts relating to \nassistance provided to individuals and households since 2005; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I want to talk just for a few minutes about \nan incident that is unfolding in Arkansas, and that I am sure is \nunfolding in other States as well.\n  Less than 2 weeks ago, a 73-year-old woman and her husband received a \nletter from FEMA, where FEMA demanded that this couple pay back $27,000 \nin FEMA assistance they had received 3 years earlier, and that they do \nso within 30 days or face penalties, interest, et cetera. Well, this \nwas devastating news for her. These are Social Security recipients. \nThey lost everything in a flood.\n  But let me back up and tell the full story, and then tell the rest of \nthe story. Three years ago, Arkansas had some floods on the White \nRiver, and the folks in the Mountain View area, some of them, \nexperienced very severe flooding. FEMA actually came to this couple's \nhouse, walked around, and told them on the spot they were eligible to \nreceive FEMA assistance for the flooding. The maximum you can receive \nis $30,000. So they filled out the paperwork.\n  In fact, FEMA helped them do some of that, like I said, on the spot, \nwhile FEMA was visiting their home and looking at their property. FEMA \nassured her they would qualify for this assistance. So they filled out \nthe paperwork and they went through the process.\n  Apparently, at some point, there was even an appeal or some sort of \nclarification. So it went through the proper channels at FEMA. \nRemember, FEMA was there, they took pictures, and the whole deal. They \nverified the damage. So this couple received $27,000 in FEMA \nassistance.\n  They put every dime back into their home. This is a couple who \nbasically lost almost all their worldly possessions in this flood. I \ntalked to her a week or so ago, and she told me they were able to save \na few items of glassware and a few keepsakes from the family, but \nbasically everything was either washed away in the water or so caked \nwith mud it was ruined during the flood. The $27,000 helped repair \ntheir home and make it habitable, but it didn't restore their home \nanywhere close to the condition it was before the flood. This was their \ndream home--their retirement home. They live right there on the White \nRiver. It is a beautiful part of the State.\n  So they got this letter a couple of weeks ago. Now, bear in mind this \nflood happened 3 years ago--the flood happened 3 years ago--and they \nare now required, under the rules and regs and the law that FEMA works \nwith, to pay all this money back. As I said before, this is a terrible \nhardship.\n  As it turns out, what happened is these folks, although they were \nassured by FEMA they were eligible, they were actually never qualified \nto receive this money. They didn't know that. They had FEMA in their \nliving room telling them they were qualified and they should receive \nthe money; that they met all the tests and standards and that is what \nthis program was for, to help people like them. However, there was one \ntechnicality, and that was that the county in which they lived had not \npassed an ordinance to go into the FEMA flood insurance program. Here, \nagain, FEMA should have known this.\n  FEMA apparently went to some of the county meetings where it was \ndiscussed and voted down. But, nonetheless, FEMA assured these people \nthey would be covered under this program.\n  The irony of all this is that the couple, when they bought their home \non the White River, one of the preconditions or requirements they set \nfor themselves was they would purchase flood insurance. They had it for \na number of years. They paid premiums for a number of years. They never \nexperienced a flood, but they paid premiums for a number of years.\n  Finally, the insurance company that offered the flood insurance got \nout of the business, and so they even went to the extent of going \nthrough Lloyds of London to get flood insurance. They paid a lot of \nmoney for a premium, but they, nonetheless, carried that as long as it \nwas offered. Finally, it wasn't offered any longer, and the only thing \nleft was the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program. But because the \ncounty had not done what they were supposed to do, this couple, \ntherefore, was not eligible to receive the FEMA flood money--again, no \nfault of their own. They had done everything anybody could do. They had \npaid their premiums out of their pockets as long as they could, as long \nas they could find insurance, and as that was canceled over the years, \nthe county hadn't come through. But, apparently, FEMA was actually \nthere at the county meetings and knew, or should have known, this \ncouple wasn't eligible. Yet they gave her this money, and now they want \nit all back with penalties and interest, et cetera.\n  So I have filed the Disaster Assistance Recoupment Fairness Act, and \nwe actually have it in two forms. We have it as a stand-alone measure, \nand we also have it as an amendment to the bill that is pending on the \nfloor right now.\n  The important point of this story is that all of the mistakes that \nwere made were on FEMA's side of the equation. The couple in Arkansas \nmade no mistakes. They followed the rules, went through the process, \nwent through the hearings. There is no allegation of fraud or that the \ncouple in any way misled anyone. They gave them the documents and did \neverything they were supposed to do. It was textbook. They did \neverything they were supposed to do, but FEMA is now coming back and \nasking for recoupment.\n  So our bill will not give a blanket exception, but what it will do is \ngive the FEMA Administrator the authority, under circumstances he deems \nfit, to waive the debt that is owed to the United States in cases where \nfunds were distributed by a FEMA error, as in this case. Also, it gives \nthem the discretion that they do not have under current Federal law.\n\n  I met with Director Fugate on this a week or two ago, and actually we \nhad a very constructive meeting. I think probably on a personal level \nhe understands this. He feels bad about this. But he believes his hands \nare tied under the statute. I am not 100 percent sure they are but he \nsays they are. He tried to be very helpful, very accommodating. I think \nhe does want to work with all the parties involved to try to clean this \nup. But he says he does not have the authority.\n  That is where this bill comes in. We wish to give the FEMA Director \nthe authority to have some discretion on some of these hardship type \ncases, especially where the person who received the benefit did it \npurely by a FEMA error. Again, in their case, they put every dime of \ntheir recovery back into their home to have it livable. Otherwise they \nprobably would have had to abandon their home or sell the property or \nwhatever the case may have been.\n  That is what we are asking of the Senate, if they would consider this \nat the proper time. I ask my colleagues to take a look at it. My guess \nis, since we have 35 households in our State that are receiving these \ntypes of letters from FEMA, these demand letters where they are giving \na notice of debt to folks who have received money, my guess is if we \nhave 35 in our State there are hundreds and maybe thousands around the \ncountry in a similar situation.\n  Again, our bill is just for FEMA's mistakes. This is probably an \nexample\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\nof the cleanup from the previous FEMA administration. I think Director \nFugate had nothing to do with this. It took them 3 years because there \nwas a lawsuit in the meantime.\n  What this is doing is creating a hardship for folks who had been \nplaying by the rules. It gives FEMA the flexibility to do some of the \ncleanup in a way that doesn't harm ordinary citizens here in the United \nStates. I ask my colleagues to take a look at it. I would be pleased to \nanswer any questions. If anyone has those, they can always contact me \nin my office. What I wish to do is not call it up at this point or \nanything like that but maybe be in the queue and be available at \nsometime in the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 794. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to disallow \nany deduction for punitive damages, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill stop businesses from deducting costs that result from their \nmisconduct as a cost of doing business under our tax laws. Under \ncurrent law, a corporation or individual business owner may deduct the \ncost of a punitive damage award paid to a victim as an ``ordinary'' \nbusiness expense. This is wrong. It undermines one of the primary \ndeterrent functions of our civil justice system, and American taxpayers \nshould not subsidize this misconduct.\n  Punitive damage awards serve in part to correct dangerous or unfair \npractices. These awards are reserved for the most extreme and harmful \nmisconduct. Our legal history contains prominent examples of corporate \nmisconduct that resulted in the deaths of Americans, and by virtue of \nour civil justice system was not only punished, but led to broad \nchanges to improve the safety and security of American consumers. The \njustice system has and will continue to encourage the positive changes \nthat cannot be brought about by regulation alone. But our current tax \nlaws work against the well-established role of the justice system as a \nbackstop to health and safety regulation.\n  One year ago, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded, killing 11 \nAmericans and leading to the worst oil spill in American history. Just \nover a year ago, an explosion in the Upper Big Branch Mine in West \nVirginia claimed the lives of 29 miners. In both of these cases, I \nexpect that all Americans, and particularly the family members of the \nvictims, would be shocked to learn that any punitive damages that may \nresult from these events will amount to a tax break for the \ncorporations responsible.\n  I was disgusted to learn that Transocean, the owner of the Deepwater \nHorizon, recently announced that it was giving ``safety bonuses'' to \nits executives. Maybe that company believes that the American people \nhave forgotten about this tragedy. I have met with the families of the \n11 men killed, and I will never forget them. The tax treatment that the \nresponsible companies will receive if we do not act will just add \ninsult to injury.\n  Let us also not forget Exxon's misconduct in 1989. I have chaired \nseveral hearings on Exxon's misconduct, which led to an ecological and \nhuman disaster that affects Alaskans even today. A jury awarded $5 \nbillion in punitive damages against Exxon for its actions, which \ndevastated an entire region, the livelihoods of its people, and \ndestroyed a way of life. For more than a decade Exxon fought this \nmeasure of accountability all the way to the United States Supreme \nCourt. A divided Supreme Court invented a novel rule and held that in \nmaritime cases, punitive damage awards could not exceed twice the \namount of compensatory damages. I support Senator Whitehouse's wise \nlegislation to overturn that Supreme Court decision, but some in \nCongress do not want corporate accountability. If we cannot muster the \nvotes to make corporations that engage in such extreme misconduct \naccountable, we need to at least stop subsidizing it through our tax \nlaws.\n  Like so many Americans, I am weary of the preferential treatment that \nlarge corporations obtain at virtually every turn. It is disheartening \nto hear reports about enormously profitable corporations paying lower \nincome tax rates than middle class American workers by exploiting \nloopholes or sheltering profits in foreign countries. It is \nunconscionable that big oil companies continue to be subsidized by \ntaxpayers to the tune of billions of dollars each year, especially when \nAmericans are facing increasingly high gasoline prices. I share the \nfrustration of so many Americans who are making great sacrifices, yet \nwho are not seeing their sacrifices shared by the most powerful in our \nsociety. As we approach the national tax filing deadline, I expect most \nAmericans would agree that this punitive damages tax deduction is not \nonly bad tax policy, but offensive to our basic notions of justice and \nfair play.\n  In his fiscal year 2012 budget recommendations, President Obama and \nhis administration requested an end to this deduction in the tax code. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that doing so will result \nin increased revenues of $315 million over 10 years. As we collectively \nwork to reduce the Federal deficit, it is important to recognize that \nincreasing revenues will play an important part in this effort; \nparticularly when those revenues are lost to a policy that is without \nany defensible justification.\n  I hope all Senators will join me to protect American taxpayers. This \nlegislation should be part of our bipartisan fight to reduce the \nnational debt. When corporate wrongdoers can write off a significant \nportion of the financial impact of punitive damages, the incentives in \nour justice system that promote responsible business practices lose \ntheir force. These difficult financial times require us to close \nirresponsible tax loopholes. We can start with this one, which treats \ncorporate misconduct as a cost of doing business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 794\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend qualified \nschool construction bonds and qualified zone academy bonds, to treat \nqualified zone academy bonds as specified tax\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\ncredit bonds, and to modify the private business contribution \nrequirement for qualified zone academy bonds; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator Harkin of Iowa, Senator Begich \nof Alaska, and Senator Johnson of South Dakota, I am introducing \nlegislation to extend and improve two important programs that create \ngood jobs and help our nation's schools. In order for America to out-\ninnovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world, we must \nbegin with our schools, and this legislation will make it easier to \ncreate spaces where 21st century learning can occur. The Qualified \nSchool Construction Bond, QSCB, and Qualified Zone Academy Bond, QZAB, \nprograms have helped schools begin to address their construction and \nrenovation needs, as well as creating construction jobs in their \ncommunities. Because of the tax credit associated with these bonds, the \nschools essentially do not have to pay interest which makes it much \neasier for them to fund their significant construction and renovation \nneeds.\n  The Qualified School Construction Bond program was created in 2009, \nand bond proceeds can be used for construction, rehabilitation, or \nrepair of a public school or for land for a facility. The total amount \nof bonds allowed was $11 billion in 2009 and $11 billion in 2010. This \nnational allocation is distributed by formula to the states and larger \nschool districts. West Virginia, for example, was able to issue its \nfull allocation of $72.3 million in bonds in 2010. Construction workers \nin West Virginia are building schools for their children. West Virginia \nis rightfully paying for the construction, but this bond program means \ntheir dollars go further. My legislation extends this important program \nthrough 2015 with the same $11 billion per year total national \nallocation of bonds.\n  The Qualified Zone Academy Bond, QZAB, program was created in 1997. \nWhile it also helps schools issue bonds by providing favorable tax \nstatus, participating schools must be located in an empowerment zone or \nenterprise community or expect that at least 35 percent of the students \nwill be eligible for free or reduced-cost lunches. Bonds cannot be used \nfor new construction, but can be used for the rehabilitation or repair \nof schools, equipment, course development, and teacher training. The \nnational limitation for bonds issued under this program was $1.4 \nbillion for 2009 and 2010 and my legislation extends that annual limit \nthrough 2015. This program has historically required a 10 percent match \nfrom private entities, and this requirement has proven a significant \nbarrier to its use in some communities. My legislation provides an \noption to waive this match in some cases. It also allows the bond \nissuer to receive the tax credit as a payment. The Hiring Incentives to \nRestore Employment--HIRE--Act which became law last spring made this \nchange for both bond programs and it resulted in greater use of the \nbonds. The huge Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2010 which we passed in \nDecember repealed this change for QZABs, and my legislation makes the \ncredit once again refundable. We know this helps schools utilize this \nprogram, and we need to give our schools every incentive to invest in \neducation.\n  It is important that we continue both of these important programs. \nThe school infrastructure needs of our country are immense. A recent \nreport estimated the total school infrastructure needs across the 50 \nStates was over $250 billion. We won't meet that need in a year, or in \n2 years, but we need to commit ourselves to keep at it. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Coons, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Klobuchar, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mrs. McCaskill, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Merkley, and Mrs. Hagan):\n  S. 797. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in the \npayment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Paycheck \nFairness Act, an important piece of legislation that is even more \npoignant today, Equal Pay Day, which is the day in 2011 where women \nearn as much as men did in 2010. It is also unfortunately marked by \nfamilies doing more with less, and making tough decisions to make ends \nmeet. I thank the 24 of my colleagues that have joined me as original \ncosponsors of this important legislation today.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I am fighting for jobs today and jobs tomorrow. I \nam on the side of a fair economy and I am on the side of good-guy \nbusinesses. We need an economy that works for everyone, and works for \nthe American family. But that means equal pay for equal work, and that \nindividuals are judged solely by their individual skills, competence, \nunique talents and nothing else. The Paycheck Fairness Act gives us the \nmuch needed tools to make this happen.\n  Women make this country run--we are business leaders, entrepreneurs, \npoliticians, mothers and more. We also bring home a growing share of \nthe family pocketbook, as evidenced by a recent White House report, \n``Women In America''. But we earn just 77 cents for every dollar our \nmale counterpart makes, and women of color get even less. Inexplicably, \nthese disparities exist across all levels of education and occupation. \nIn my home State of Maryland, the average woman has to receive a \nbachelor's degree before she earns as much as the average male high \nschool graduate. This is unacceptable.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act picks up where we left off with the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act last Congress. Enactment of this legislation \nwill mean real progress in the fight to eliminate the gender wage gap \nand help families. It has the teeth that are needed to keep \ndiscrimination from happening in the first place, and makes the \nconsequences tougher. The Act ensures that employers who try to justify \npaying a man more than a woman for the same job must show the disparity \nis not sex-based; but job related and necessary. It prohibits employers \nfrom retaliating against employees who discuss or disclose salary \ninformation with their coworkers. The bill would also make it easier \nfor women to file class-action lawsuits against employers they accuse \nof sex-based pay discrimination. And it strengthens the available \nremedies to include punitive and compensatory damages, thus bringing \nequal pay law into line with all other civil rights law. The bottom \nline is that this bill ensures that women are treated fairly in the \nworkplace, something that is a matter of basic equality and civil \nrights.\n  So this Equal Pay Day, let's recommit to closing the wage gap. It is \nmy hope that one day, there is no need for an Equal Pay Day--that every \nyear, women earn the same as men. Until then, we link up, press on, and \npush for passage of this important legislation, so that for all victims \nof pay discrimination, there is a new day ahead.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Nation commemorates Equal Pay \nDay, an annual occasion that celebrates the gains that women have made \nin the workplace over the last century, but which also reminds us all \nthat pay discrimination still exists in the United States. In today's \neconomy, a troubling constant remains: women continue to earn less than \nmen. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, on \naverage, women working full-time still make only 78 cents for every \ndollar working men receive. For minority women, this statistic becomes \neven more sobering.\n  The U.S. Department of Labor also reports an increasing number of \nfamilies where women are the head of the household, and \ncorrespondingly, the primary source of income. Despite the signs of \neconomic recovery, many women and families continue to struggle to make \nends meet. This issue is not one that just impacts one individual; it \ncreates additional economic hardship for entire families. Vermont is a \nleader in the Nation on fair pay practices, and 8 years ago, the State \nacted to pass an equal pay act, which prohibits compensating women and\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nmen differently for equal work that requires equal skill, effort, and \nresponsibility under similar working conditions. Now in Vermont, \nemployers cannot require wage nondisclosure agreements, and employees \nare protected from retaliation for disclosing their own wage. Still, \nthere is room for improvement. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports \nthat Vermont women working full-time earn wages amounting to 81.9 \npercent of what men earn. We must work harder to ensure that women are \npaid equal wages for equal work, across the country.\n  The 1963 Equal Pay Act was enacted to protect employees against \ndiscrimination with respect to compensation because of an individual's \nrace, color, religion, sex or national origin. While we have made \nprogress, our work is not done. Hardworking women--and the American \npeople--earned a long fought victory in early 2009, when President \nObama signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to reverse the \nU.S. Supreme Court's devastating decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear \nTire, a decision that rolled back years of progress to eliminate \nworkplace discrimination. But the efforts to achieve parity for women \nin the workplace continues.\n  Two bills introduced today will help the United States reach that \ngoal. These bills include provisions similar to those enacted in \nVermont. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which was introduced by Senator \nMikulski and which I am proud to cosponsor, creates stronger incentives \nfor employers to follow the law; strengthens penalties for equal pay \nviolations; and prohibits retaliation against workers for disclosing \ntheir own wage information. This bill passed the House of \nRepresentatives with bipartisan support over a year ago, and deserves \naction in the Senate. The Fair Pay Act, which was introduced by Senator \nHarkin and which I am also proud to cosponsor, requires employers to \npay equally for jobs of comparable skill, efforts and working \nconditions, and to disclose pay scales and rates for all job categories \nat a given company. To effectively close the wage gap we must address \nthe systemic problems that are resulting in pay disparities. I believe \nboth these bills are essential steps to closing the wage gap.\n  Equal pay for equal work is neither a Democratic nor Republican \nissue; it is an American value. It is neither a private sector nor a \npublic sector issue; it is a fundamental issue of fairness. Sadly, wage \ndiscrimination affects women of every generation and every \nsocioeconomic background. It is not limited to one career path or level \nof education. The Senate should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and the \nFair Pay Act, and work toward other solutions to ensure our daughters \nand granddaughters, and all future generations of Americans, are not \nsubject to the same discrimination that has plagued women for decades.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Brown of Massachusetts):\n  S. 801. A bill to amend chapter 113 of title 40, United States Code, \nto require executive agency participation in real-time transparency of \ninvestment projects, to require performance and governance reviews of \nall cost overruns on Federal information technology investment \nprojects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to join Senators Carper, \nLieberman, and Brown in introducing a bill that would bring more \nmanagement and oversight of major information technology, IT, \ninvestments across the federal government.\n  In fiscal year 2011 alone, the federal government plans to spend \nnearly $80 billion on IT investments, about half of which is for major \nIT investments. According to the Government Accountability Office, \nnearly 40 percent of those major IT investments, totaling nearly $20 \nbillion, are at risk for significant cost overruns, schedule delays, \nand performance problems.\n  Rampant cost and performance problems in IT investments occur across \nthe government. Most recently, we have seen a total breakdown in the \nNational Archives and Records Administration's, NARA, Electronic \nRecords Archive initiative.\n  Since 2001, NARA has tried to develop a system to preserve and \nprovide access to a massive volume of electronic records. Originally \nslated for a 2012 rollout at a cost of $317 million, NARA has had to \nrepeatedly revise the plan and cost estimate and finally decided to \nproduce a scaled-down system this year. Last month GAO estimated the \nproject would cost between $762 million and $1 billion--three times \nmore than originally planned.\n  We see time and time again with these big IT contracts that \nrequirements are not clear up front, leading to chaos down the road \nthat wastes hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Such was the case with the 2010 Decennial Census handheld devices. \nAfter spending eight years developing a completely new approach to \ncensus-taking, the Census Bureau scrapped plans for using handheld \ncomputers and reverted instead back to paper and pencil.\n  Problems managing the contractor, major flaws in the Bureau's cost-\nestimates, and kicking the can down the road added about $3 billion to \nthe census price tag. Three billion!\n  The problems keep coming. DHS has tried twice--since 2004--to \nintegrate its many-siloed financial management systems. The Department \nspent approximately $52 million on one failed attempt before abandoning \nthe project nearly two years later. DHS tried again only to encounter \nsevere schedule delays. The Department is now planning to roll out the \nproject incrementally, which is of course how they should have started \nyears ago, and is what is recommended under the OMB guidance for \nmanaging large IT projects.\n  Large IT project failures have cost U.S. taxpayers literally billions \nof dollars in wasted expenditures. While never acceptable, especially \nnow given our current fiscal crisis, we just cannot afford to accept \nthis type of incompetence and mismanagement one more day. Perhaps even \nmore troubling is the fact that, when federal IT projects fail, they \ncan undermine the government's ability to defend the nation, enforce \nits laws, or deliver critical services to citizens.\n  Again and again, we have seen IT project failures grounded in poor \nplanning, ill-defined and shifting requirements, undisclosed \ndifficulties, poor risk management, and lax monitoring of performance.\n  For the last several years, Senator Carper and I have pushed the \nOffice of Management and Budget to improve the management and oversight \nof these IT investments. To help address the concerns we have raised, \nOMB has instituted several new initiatives over the last year and a \nhalf.\n  For example, in June 2009, OMB announced the creation of the ``IT \nDashboard,'' which is a website that displays cost and schedule \ninformation about major IT investments, as well as the agency Chief \nInformation Officer's, CIO, evaluation of the status of each project. \nOMB has also instituted comprehensive face-to-face reviews of these \ninvestments, known as ``TechStat'' sessions.\n  As a result, OMB has reported reducing the life-cycle costs of 15 \ninvestments by approximately $3 billion by narrowing the scope of some \nprojects and even shutting down others and cutting the losses. Added \ntransparency from the IT Dashboard, as well as comprehensive reviews \nvia TechStat sessions, should improve agency management and \nCongressional oversight of the projects.\n  The bill Senator Carper and I introduce today would require agencies \nto use the Dashboard in a standardized way. It would also expand inputs \nto include cost, schedule, and performance data, using a metric called \nEarned Value Management, EVM. EVM prevents the kind of ``hide the \nball'' game that agencies often play to cover up performance \nshortfalls, cost overruns, or schedule slips.\n  The bill institutes triggers so that, if an investment deviates more \nthan 20 percent from its original cost, schedule, and performance \ntargets, CIOs would be required to conduct the type of comprehensive \nTechStat sessions currently taking place at OMB on a more limited \nscale. These sessions would generate information for Congress as well \nas the public, by requiring agencies to post the results of the \nTechStat sessions on the IT Dashboard. These reports would have to \ndescribe in detail how the failures occurred, naming names, and \ndescribing how exactly the shortcomings are going to be fixed.\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\n  If an investment deviates more than 40 percent, the TechStat session \nwould get bumped up to the OMB level, to be run by the Federal Chief \nInformation Officer. In addition to information about how to improve \nthe performance of the project, OMB would be required to provide to \nCongress a recommendation of whether the project should be pared back \nor cancelled if it cannot be overhauled.\n  On top of this aggressive oversight ramp-up, the bill would require \nagencies to identify and heighten the planning and management for a \nhandful of top priority, most expensive projects. For these ``core'' \ninvestments, agencies would submit additional data on performance, key \nmilestones, and lifecycle costs.\n  Because of their scope and importance to agency missions, these core \nprojects would have lower thresholds for oversight triggers and would \nget bumped up to OMB TechStat review with a deviation of 20 percent. \nThe ``get-well'' plan would then be sent to Congress and published on \nthe Dashboard for maximum accountability. This early intervention at \nthe highest level would ensure that these critical projects are either \nsaved or scrapped long before they can threaten to waste billions of \ndollars or endanger agency missions.\n  If an agency fails to comply with the requirements in the bill for \nany given project, that would be the end of taxpayer support for the \nproject until it is brought into compliance.\n  If this bill had been law during the past decade, early warning signs \nwould have alerted Congress and possibly saved some of the billions \nwasted on so many IT projects currently crowding various high-risk \nlists.\n  I urge every Senator to support this much-needed and bipartisan bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2398-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2398-S2399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 140--COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BAY OF \n  PIGS OPERATION AND COMMENDING THE MEMBERS OF BRIGADA DE ASALTO 2506 \n                         (ASSAULT BRIGADE 2506)\n\n  Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, on April 17, 1961, 1,500 individuals from \nthe United States and Cuba valiantly volunteered in the Bay of Pigs \nmission to liberate Cuba from Fidel Castro's grip. They were a diverse \ngroup from all backgrounds of Cuban society, all united by the ideal \nthat freedom is a God-given, inalienable right.\n  Having lost their country a couple of years earlier, these brave men \ntook up arms on the beaches of Playa Giron. Over the course of 4 days \nand facing daunting odds against a better-armed and trained Cuban \nmilitary, nearly 100 members of the Brigada de Asalto 2506, Assault \nBrigade 2506, lost their lives, including 4 American pilots. Five \nothers were captured and executed. The majority were captured and \nimprisoned for many months and years in inhumane conditions.\n  Many of the captured men were fortunate to be eventually released and \nexiled to the United States, where they restarted their lives, raised \nfamilies and made it their life's ambition to give their children the \nopportunities they would not have.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues in the U.S. Senate in paying tribute \nto the survivors of that mission--several of whom made the journey to \nWashington this week--and honoring the memories of the deceased.\n  As the son of Cuban exiles, I am proud to represent an entire \ncommunity of people who lost everything to an accident of history, but \ncame to cherish the freedoms they found in America. The story of the \nBrigade 2506 veterans, in particular, is worthy of special recognition.\n  To some, the Bay of Pigs battle is just one episode in the long \nannals of the cold war. But to those involved, the mission was a \ndefining moment in their lives that, for others, illuminated the \nrighteousness of the cause to free Cuba. It is a heartbreaking story of \nmen who fought so valiantly for their beloved homeland's freedom, only \nto come up short. But it is also an inspiring story--one that says as \nmuch about their resilience as it does about America.\n  Having endured a traumatic life experience 50 years ago at the Bay of \nPigs, many of them came back to the U.S. with nothing--not a penny and \noften without any English skills. They went to work and embraced \nAmerica's blessings, but they never forgot their beloved homeland.\n  Some made it their life's work to promote the cause of a free Cuba. \nOthers went to work on other endeavors to provide for their families, \nbut dedicated countless hours as faithful volunteers of the cause. In \ndoing so, they served as teachers to an entire community. Today in \nMiami, for example, a Brigade 2506 monument and museum now exist as \nmuch to commemorate these heroes as it does to educate others.\n  Like so many Cuban exiles, their stories taught us that human rights \nand liberty are not conditional on where someone is born, but are \ninstead the birthrights of every single one of God's children. They \ntaught us why the Cuban condition, like everywhere else in the world \nwhere human rights are trampled, is inhumane an unnatural. They \ninstilled in us a deep sense of why the Cuban government, and others \nlike it, is fundamentally defective and illegitimate, as it is \nsustained by violence against its people and operates without the \nconsent of the governed.\n  Over the past 50 years, these lessons have given us moral clarity \nabout the rights of man and reminded us of our responsibility to defend \nthe persecuted among us.\n  Far from being forgotten, their example has inspired others to carry \non their work. Their legacy lives on among those of us who have \nfollowed in their footsteps by making their cause of a free Cuba our \ncause.\n  Today, the torch they lit 50 years ago on a Cuban beach, is now \ncarried not only by their children and grandchildren, but also by a new \nand growing generation of Cubans on the island. Every day, thousands of \ncourageous patriots are demanding their freedoms and steadily chipping \naway at the farce of the Castro regime. Together, we are all united by \nthe moral responsibility to highlight the Cuban regime's continued \nabuses, to apply change-inducing pressure, and to support the Cuban \npeople's right to freely shape their destinies.\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\n  Courageous and principled leaders like these give us hope that a free \nCuba is an inevitable destiny. They also give us hope that soon we will \nbe able to achieve President John F. Kennedy's December 1962 promise to \nsurviving Bay of Pigs veterans that their battle flag ``will be \nreturned to this brigade in a free Havana.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2399-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 141--RECOGNIZING THE EFFORTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF \n THE GOD'S CHILD PROJECT AND CONGRATULATING THE GOD'S CHILD PROJECT ON \n                          ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Hoeven) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, there is one point on which every Senator \nagrees, Democrats and Republicans alike: The economic recovery is \nstarting to gain strength, and it is time to focus our attention on \nreducing deficits and restoring fiscal discipline. The current deficits \nare unsustainable and present a very real danger to our Nation's future \neconomic prosperity; however, there is sharp disagreement as to how \nbest to achieve that shared goal.\n  Along with other Democratic Senators, I advocate a balanced approach \nthat includes spending cuts and necessary revenue increases while \ncontinuing to make crucial investments in education, infrastructure, \nand research, the investments that are absolutely essential if we are \ngoing to stay competitive in a global economy. We know this approach \ncan work because it is what we did under President Clinton's leadership \nin the 1990s. That budget at that time created large surpluses and put \nus on the track to completely eliminating the national debt within a \ndecade. It also created a brief era of shared prosperity with 22 \nmillion new jobs and 116 consecutive months of economic expansion.\n  By contrast most Republican Senators favor an approach that I \nconsider to be unbalanced, unfair, and highly unlikely to succeed. We \nhave now had nearly a week to evaluate the House Republicans' budget \nproposal for 2012 and beyond--the so-called Ryan budget. Let's look at \nwhat this truly radical budget plan would do.\n  It completely dismantles Medicare and Medicaid.\n  It concentrates two-thirds of its spending cuts on programs serving \nthe most disadvantaged people in our society, including seniors and \npeople with disabilities, even as it preserves huge subsidies for \nspecial interests.\n  It exempts corporations and wealthy individuals from shared sacrifice \nin order to bring deficits under control. To the contrary, this \nRepublican tea party plan locks in the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy--\ntax cuts that were passed 10 years ago when we were looking at budget \nsurpluses as far as the eye could see.\n  Well, under our present circumstances, the wealthy don't need these \ntax breaks, and we can't afford them. This budget of Mr. Ryan's and \nRepublicans slashes the tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. That is \nthe lowest level since 1931. Indeed, this so-called deficit reduction \nplan includes tax cuts that would cost $2.9 trillion over the next 10 \nyears compared to the CBO baseline, and that is according to the \nnonpartisan Tax Policy Institute.\n  This tea party budget plan repeals the new health reform law, \nstripping 34 million nonelderly Americans of health coverage and \neliminating all the consumer protections in the law, including the ban \non discrimination based on preexisting conditions.\n  This budget of the Republicans repeals the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nreform law, allowing financial manipulators to return to the same \nreckless practices that led to the financial collapse, to the great \nrecession, and to much of our current huge budget deficits.\n  This budget cuts the maximum Pell grant award even as more students \nare enrolling in higher education to give themselves the skills they \nneed for the modern economy.\n  How bizarre that several pundits have called this Republican tea \nparty budget plan ``courageous.'' There is nothing courageous about \ntargeting the most vulnerable people in our society for the \noverwhelming share of cuts. There is nothing courageous about giving \nanother huge tax cut bonanza to those who have seen their incomes \nskyrocket in recent years. There is nothing courageous about destroying \nthe retirement security of tens of millions of American seniors, \nincluding dismantling Medicare and hacking away at Social Security. \nThere is nothing courageous about gutting Medicaid, the program that \nmillions of seniors and people with disabilities depend on to pay for \ncare such as nursing home care or home health aids.\n  Let's be clear. There is nothing courageous in this Republican tea \nparty budget. To the contrary, I suggest it is a cowardly budget. It is \na bully's budget. In this budget the powerful and the privilege attack \nthe weak and the vulnerable.\n  We all understand what is going on. Republicans are seizing on the \nbudget crisis as a pretext for ramming through a longstanding \nideological wish list. At the State level--in Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, \nand elsewhere--Republicans are using the budget crisis as a pretext for \nan assault on public workers, including teachers and firefighters and \nothers. On Capitol Hill they are using it to try\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\nto, as I said, defund health care reform, to destroy Medicare and \nMedicaid, Social Security, and, yes, to cut tax rates even more deeply \nfor corporations and the wealthiest in our society.\n  This tea party budget is an unprecedented assault on middle-class and \nworking Americans. It would drive down Americans' standard of living, \nshred the economic safety net, reduce access to health care and higher \neducation, and do grave damage to our public schools and their ability \nto prepare the next generation for the jobs of the future.\n  Make no mistake. It is not about reducing budget deficits. Republican \nGovernors and Republicans in Congress are demanding budget cuts to \nprograms on which the middle class rely at the same time they continue \nto push for tax cuts for large corporations and the wealthy.\n  Call this what it is: Republicans have openly declared class warfare. \nRepublican Governors have the gall to attack teachers, firefighters, \npolice officers, and other public employees as--in the words of Indiana \nGov. Mitch Daniels--``the privileged elite''--the privileged elite.\n  Our police, our firefighters, our public employees are the privileged \nelite? Why? Well, I suppose because they actually have pensions. They \nhave decent jobs, decent wages, access to health care. For heaven's \nsake, we shouldn't be dragging people down because they have a middle-\nclass life. We should be working day and night to give every American a \ndecent standard of living, to shore up the middle class rather than \ntearing it down.\n  I suppose, to Governor Daniels and others, if the middle class are \nthe privileged elite, then I guess the middle class today are those who \nare making minimum wage, working at dead-end jobs. Is that the new \nmiddle class?\n  Meanwhile, as Republicans at the State and national level go after \nthe health care and retirement security of middle-class Americans--\nagain, they are going all out to pass new tax breaks for those who have \nalready been showered with tremendous breaks in the past. The tax cuts \nthe congressional Republicans secured in December--that is what was \npassed in December--will add a whopping $354 billion to the deficit \nthis year and even more next year. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the tax cuts in the new House budget would cost the \nTreasury $2.9 trillion over 10 years. Yet now these very same \nRepublicans claim they are worried about the deficit.\n  Well, they are not fooling anyone. This is not about deficit \nreduction, it is about ideology. Republicans are taking a meat ax to \nprograms for the middle class--everything from cancer research to \neducation to transportation to health care--and they are gutting the \nsafety net for the elderly, the poor, and people with disabilities.\n  It is the same old GOP game plan: Give huge, unaffordable tax cuts to \ncorporations and the wealthy while enacting budget cuts that assist the \nmiddle class and the most vulnerable.\n  This new tea party Republican budget gives new meaning to the word \n``extreme.'' Let's look at what they have proposed. This budget \ndismantles Medicare, creating a new private voucher program so future \nseniors would have to pay out of pocket for many lifesaving health care \ncosts. It does nothing to control health care costs. It simply shifts \nthe costs to the elderly individuals.\n  Get this: The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2030, \nunder the Republican budget plan, seniors would have to pay two-thirds \nof the cost of their health coverage.\n  Future seniors would see their out-of-pocket costs more than double \nto $12,500 a year. At the same time, the benefits would be cut in \nhalf--in just 20 years. Think about that. People who are now in their \nforties, looking to when they get on Medicare, will have their benefits \ncut in half, but they will pay twice as much for it under the voucher \nsystem.\n  This tea party Republican budget reopens the prescription drug \ndoughnut hole which we have set in motion to close under the affordable \ncare act. That would require seniors to pay $3,600 a year more for \nprescription drugs.\n  The Republican tea party block grants Medicaid and cuts $1 trillion \nin health care services, which would end vital services disabled \nAmericans depend on, such as coverage for home health aides, assistance \nservices so they can get a job, or going to a nursing home if that is \nthe only option. By shifting costs to the States, this would worsen our \nState budget deficits.\n  The Republican budget proposal doesn't stop at dismantling the safety \nnet and programs seniors rely on for a secure retirement. This budget \nplan makes profound and destructive cuts to the entire range of \nprograms that underpin the American middle-class standard of living, \neverything from education, student grants and loans, law enforcement, \nclean air and clean water, food safety, biomedical research, highways, \nbridges, and infrastructure--in short, all of the programs and services \nmiddle-class Americans rely on for a decent way of life and the promise \nthat enhances the ability of the private sector to grow and provide \nmore jobs.\n  The Republican assault on the middle class is breathtaking both in \nscope and depth. It could not come at a worse time for working \nAmericans, who are already under enormous strain. It is no secret that \npeople are working harder and longer than ever before, but they still \ncan't seem to meet the cost of basic, everyday needs such as education, \ntransportation, and housing, let alone save enough to support \nthemselves in their old age. Even before the great recession, working \npeople weren't sharing in our Nation's prosperity.\n  The shared prosperity of the years after World War II created an \nexpanding middle class, a soaring standard of living. But these wages--\nreal wages--peaked in the 1970s, and they have been stagnant ever \nsince. Think about that. They peaked in about 1979. Since 1979, real \nwages have not gone up. You wonder why middle-class Americans are so \nupset about what is going on. They realize this. They may not be able \nto put it in exact language, but I can tell you that middle-class \nfamilies know what has happened to them. They know they have lost their \nearning power.\n  Middle-class jobs are also being shipped overseas--a trend actually \nencouraged by our Tax Code. Income inequality in America is reaching \nThird-World levels. Job security, savings, and pensions are \ndisappearing, along with the American dream.\n  Now, with working Americans barely making ends meet, just barely \nholding on to a decent way of life, the Republicans have proposed a \nbudget--make no mistake--that will destroy what is left of the middle \nclass in this country. I could not disagree more strenuously with this \napproach. The future of our Nation depends on our ability to ensure \nthat everybody benefits from economic growth. It means putting policies \ninto place that build a strong and vibrant middle class with good jobs, \nfair wages, and good benefits. That is the America I want to see--one \nwhere people who work hard and play by the rules can live a decent \nlife. Tragically, the tea party budget plan would take us in exactly \nthe opposite direction. It would gut the whole range of programs that \nsupport the middle class in this country. It would dismantle the safety \nnet for those with disabilities and for the poor--a safety net that has \nbeen painstakingly created over the last 80 years.\n  This Republican budget plan not only turns the clock back to before \nthe Great Society programs of Pell grants, housing, and support for \npeople in the middle class, it would turn it back to even before the \nNew Deal. It would gut all Federal support that is basic for education. \nIt would all but eliminate Federal support for infrastructure, which \nmeans we will fall even further behind China and the European Union, \nwhich are investing massively in everything from ultramodern ports, to \nhigh-speed rail, to state-of-the-art roads and bridges. Right now, \nChina is investing between 8 and 10 percent of its GDP in \ninfrastructure. We are at 2 percent and going down.\n  Indeed, this tea party budget aims to dismantle the Federal \nGovernment as we know it. It proposes to shrink discretionary \nspending--including defense--and other minor mandatory program spending \nfrom 12 percent of GDP last year to 6 percent of GDP in 2022 and to \njust 3.5 percent of GDP per year in the long run. Think about that. It \nwould shrink discretionary spending and other mandatory spending from \n12 percent of the budget last year to about 3.5 percent of the budget \nover the\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\nlong run. Well, that is about the same level of Federal spending during \nthe Presidency of Calvin Coolidge, nearly a century ago, when defense \nspending was very small and there was very little, if any, support for \neducation and the infrastructure of our country. We don't live in the \nera of Calvin Coolidge any longer, but this budget would take us back \nto that time.\n  Adding insult to injury, this budget plan makes a mockery of the \nconcept of shared sacrifice to reduce deficits. Apparently, it wasn't \nenough to bail out the Wall Street bankers whose reckless gambling and \nrisk-taking created the great recession; now we are being asked to cut \nprograms for working Americans so that Wall Street can get another \ngiant tax cut.\n  This Republican tea party budget is built on bad priorities, bad \npolicy, and just plain bad values. As columnist E.J. Dionne points out, \nAmericans can see ``how radical the new conservatives in Washington \nare, and the extent to which some politicians would transfer even more \nresources from the have-nots and the have-a-littles to the have-a-\nlots.''\n  Going back to the 1930s, the American people have supported and \nstrengthened an unwritten social contract. That social contract says \nthat we will prepare our young, care for our elderly, and build a \nsafety net for those who fall, who become disabled or sick. That \nunwritten social contract says that if you work hard and play by the \nrules, you will be able to rise to the middle class or even beyond. \nThat social contract says that if you start at the bottom, you will \nhave a ladder of opportunity to the middle class. It says that a \ncardinal rule of government is to provide a ladder of opportunity so \nthat every American can realistically aspire to the American dream.\n  But in one fell swoop, this Republican budget rips up that social \ncontract. It replaces it with a winner-takes-all philosophy that tells \nstruggling, aspiring people and communities across America: You are on \nyour own.\n  If you are a low-income high school student who can only afford \ncollege with the help of a generous Pell grant, this budget says: Tough \nluck. You are on your own.\n  If you are a working couple with two kids who can't scrape together \nenough money to purchase decent health insurance, this budget says: \nTough luck. You are on your own.\n  If you are a poor rural community that needs assistance to pay for a \nnew sewer system or a flood control project, this budget says: Tough \nluck. You are on your own.\n  If you are a poor, urban community struggling to find funding to \ncreate high-quality K-12 public schools for your children, this budget \nsays: Tough luck. You are on your own.\n  If you are a retiree with serious health problems and can't afford \nthe big out-of-pocket costs in this Republican plan to do away with \nMedicare or if your health insurance company abruptly cancels your \npolicy, this budget says: Tough luck. You are on your own.\n  If you are a low-income family who counts on Federal nutrition \nassistance and you are trying to decide whether to spend scarce dollars \non food or medicine, this budget says: Tough luck. You are on your own.\n  Mr. President, this would not be the America we have come to know and \nlove. It is not the kind of America my grandparents and your \ngrandparents or our fathers and mothers built for us and for future \ngenerations. It is not the America that built the best middle class \nhistory has ever seen. This budget is not the kind of America my \nfriends and neighbors in Iowa would find acceptable.\n\n  So, mark my words, this budget is not a courageous budget. As I said, \nit is a cowardly budget, a bully budget. And the American people will \nnot stand for this unwise, unbalanced, unfair assault on their economic \nsecurity, their way of life, and the America our grandparents and our \nparents built for us and for future generations.\n  Mr. President, I will oppose with every fiber of my being these \ngrossly, misguided proposals in every way I can. And I can assure you, \nMr. President, the American people will not stand for this tea party \nRepublican budget either.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/12/senate-section/article/S2405-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.J.
