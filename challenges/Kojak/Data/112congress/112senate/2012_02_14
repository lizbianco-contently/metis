Mr. President, we all know the inconvenience of a few \npotholes as we drive down the street. It is an inconvenience. But for \ncompanies that ship $10 trillion worth of goods across the country \nevery year, these disintegrating roads are more than an inconvenience \nor more than a nuisance.\n  A crowded train ride to an office or a broken escalator at a station \nwhere someone is trying to pick up a subway--or what we call here \nMetro--may be a hassle, but for 51 million Americans who have \ndisabilities, most of whom rely on some type of public transportation \nto get around, outdated stations and overcrowded trains are more than a \nminor inconvenience.\n  Mr. President, this country's deteriorating infrastructure is \nsomething we should be very concerned about. This great Nation of ours \nhas an infrastructure that is falling apart. Our highways, our \nroadways, our bridges, our dams, and railways are more than an \ninconvenience; they are a drain on our economy. Twenty percent of \nAmerica's roads don't meet safety standards.\n  As the Chair heard me say yesterday when I talked about some of these \nissues, 70,000 bridges need to be replaced or overhauled. We have \nbridges in America, I am told, where schoolbuses stop when they get to \nthe bridge, have the kids walk across the bridge, then the bus comes \nacross without the kids in it, and then off they go. They do this \nbecause they are afraid the bridge will collapse.\n  Our public transportation system simply can't keep up with the pace \nof growing ridership. Nine out of ten Americans say rebuilding our \ncrumbling roads and bridges is important--90 percent. Democrats in the \nSenate agree. Modernizing our transit system--rebuilding the roads \nAmerican families and businesses depend upon--will help fuel our \neconomy.\n  The legislation now before the Senate is too important to be bogged \ndown with unrelated ideological amendments. Senate Republicans should \nnot divert this bill to try to take away women's access to health care \nservices such as contraception--something we have been dealing with \nover the last week--or mammograms and other cancer screenings.\n  Late last night we were told one of the Republican Senators wants to \noffer an amendment that deals with something totally unrelated to this \nbill, dealing with the country of Egypt. A debate on Egypt may be the \nright thing to do, but shouldn't we maybe start in the Foreign \nRelations Committee? Maybe we should start there. TV cameras can be \nthere, and then it would not hold up this Transportation bill that is \nso important.\n  This bill will create or save 2 million jobs. It has broad bipartisan \nsupport. I have said here before, and I say it again, I so admire and \nrespect and appreciate the work done by Senator Boxer and Senator \nInhofe on this bipartisan bill. Unfortunately, our Republican House \ncolleagues have gone in the direct opposite direction. They\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\nhave a bill that is a love note to the tea party. The House bill didn't \nget a single Democratic vote in committee, for reasons that are very \nclear, obviously. The Senate bill, on the other hand, passed out of \ncommittee unanimously. Even some Republicans don't support the House \nbill and the way it is paid for--drilling in ANWR. Mr. President, that \nissue has a beard that has turned white it is so outdated--drilling in \nANWR.\n  Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood--although a Member of President \nObama's Cabinet, he was a long-time Republican Congressman from \nIllinois--said the House legislation is the worst Transportation bill \nhe has seen in the 35 years he has been in public service. That is our \nSecretary of Transportation, a Republican.\n  There are lots of reasons, but here are a few: The House legislation \nwould gut public health and environmental protections, and that is a \ngross understatement. It would ax funding for pedestrian safety even \nthough a pedestrian is injured or killed by a car in this country every \n7 minutes. It would starve our Nation's public transportation system. \nThe House bill reverses 30 years of good policy of dedicating funding \neach year for mass transit--a policy enacted in 1982 by the \nultraliberal Ronald Reagan. There are ads on radio and television where \nwe see President Reagan speaking, as he did so well, on one of his \nsignature issues, which was doing something about the transportation \nsystem in this country. Maybe someone had read something to him or told \nhim about General Eisenhower and how much he believed the \ntransportation system should keep moving forward.\n\n  Many House Republicans don't support the plan to shortchange millions \nof Americans. I don't understand why seniors and people with \ndisabilities, who count on public transportation, should be hurt by \nwhat the House has done in the bill they have over there.\n  The Chamber of Commerce and AARP have come out against the drastic \napproach taken by the House bill. On the other hand, the U.S. Chamber \nand hundreds of other organizations support the Boxer-Inhofe bill. I am \ndisappointed House Republicans have once again chosen this very \npartisan path. Rebuilding a transportation system our economy can rely \non shouldn't be divisive. Given the choice between working with \nDemocrats to create good-paying jobs for American workers and playing \npolitics, House Republicans chose politics, and that is too bad. The \nbill before the Senate is a good bill; we need to pass it. I am very \ndisappointed the House has taken the road that has recently been well \ntraveled. That is what we get from the House--the same old stuff--and \nwe have to change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S586-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we have had a little more time now to \nlook at the President's budget, and I have to say the more one looks at \nit, the harder it is to believe this is the President's considered \nresponse to the crisis we face.\n  President Obama knows better than anyone in this country that \ngovernment spending and debt is completely out of control and that \nAmerica is headed down the same road as Europe. This budget was his \nchance to show it. Instead, he decided to basically pretend these \nproblems don't even exist, and to the extent he does acknowledge them, \nto propose solutions that are either gimmicks or that he knows will \nnever come to pass.\n  Just to take two examples, he says he will bank savings by not \nfighting a war he already declared we wouldn't be fighting. He will \ntake credit for saving money on a war that he has already declared we \nare not going to be fighting--a gimmick--and he would raise money with \ntax hikes that have been rejected eight times by both parties. And, by \nthe way, forget the fact that government spends $1 trillion a year more \nthan it takes in. The President says government spending should be even \nhigher. He significantly increases government spending at a time when \nwe have a $15 trillion debt, a debt that is as big as our economy.\n  This is what passes for leadership down at the White House. The \nPresident looks at our fiscal crisis, throws together a plan he knows \nis completely deceptive, and then goes on the road to sell it to \ncaptive audiences at high schools and colleges across the country. The \nfailure of leadership is truly breathtaking. The President knows how \ngrave our Nation's fiscal condition is. When he thinks it helps him, he \nadmits it.\n  A year ago tomorrow, when debt and spending were in the news, he used \nhis budget announcement to reiterate a pledge to cut the deficit in \nhalf. Here is what he said just a year ago tomorrow:\n\n       The only way we can make these investments in our future is \n     if our government starts living within its means, if we start \n     taking responsibility for our deficits. That's why, when I \n     was sworn in as President, I pledged to cut the deficit in \n     half by the end of my first term. The budget I'm proposing \n     today meets that pledge.\n\n  That was the President 1 year ago tomorrow. Here we are 1 year later \nand he hasn't even come close--not even close.\n  Last month, the President said he wanted an economy ``that is built \nto last.'' What he has given us instead is a blueprint for deficits \nthat are built to last, and he hasn't done a thing to live up to his \npledge to get our Nation's fiscal house in order. In fact, he has made \nit worse. Last year's budget wasn't worth the paper it was printed on \nand neither is this one. It is not worth the paper it was printed on.\n  The President's job isn't to tell people what he thinks they want to \nhear. It is to explain the problems we have, unite people around a \nsolution, and get the job done. This President is truly failing the \nAmerican people. The only question is how long it will take for that \nfailure to catch up with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S586-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened carefully to the statement made \nby the Republican minority leader about deficits, and I think it is \nworthy to note that history suggests an opposite conclusion from what \nhe just said.\n  Remember this: The last time the Federal Government ever balanced its \nbudget and generated a surplus was in the closing years of the \nPresidency of William Jefferson Clinton, a Democrat.\n  When President Clinton left office, the national debt accumulated \nover the history of the United States of America was $5 trillion. When \nClinton left office and handed the keys to President George W. Bush and \nsaid: Incidentally, next year's budget--welcome to Washington--another \nsurplus, a $120 billion surplus. The economy has created 23 million \njobs in my 8 years, and I wish you the best. He left, turned the keys \nover to President George W. Bush, and gave him control for 8 years.\n\n[[Page S587]]\n\n  Eight years later, another snapshot. The national debt was no longer \n$5 trillion; it was $11 trillion, more than doubled under President \nGeorge W. Bush. We had dramatically lost jobs in America, unlike \nPresident Clinton.\n  When George W. Bush handed the keys over to President Barack Obama, \nhe said: Welcome to Washington. Incidentally, next year's budget is a \ndeficit of $1.2 trillion.\n  It is quite a different story; isn't it? We wouldn't know that from \nthe speech just given. The suggestion is that Democrats just don't get \nit right when it comes to deficits but Republicans do. History tells us \notherwise.\n  President Barack Obama inherited one of the weakest economies since \nthe Great Depression. In fact, we were teetering on another depression. \nThe month he took the oath of office, putting his hand on Abraham \nLincoln's Bible, we lost over 750,000 jobs in America. That is what \nPresident Obama inherited. We didn't hear that from the Republican \nminority leader.\n  I wish to show one chart that tells the story and tells it \ngraphically. It is a chart which those who follow the floor debates \nwill see over and over.\n  The red reflects job losses under President George W. Bush. The blue \nlines reflect employment under President Obama.\n  This was the month President Obama was sworn into office. Almost 800 \nthousand jobs were lost in America. That is what he saw as he came to \nthe Presidency, and then look what happened. The job losses started \nreducing and finally turned the corner on the positive side.\n  There, we have a graphic presentation of two views of the economy, \nthe views of the Republicans and George W. Bush, with all this job \nloss, and the views of President Obama. That is the debate in which we \nare currently engaged. The Republicans want us to return to these \npolicies, policies which call for tax breaks and cuts for the \nwealthiest in America, and basically ignore the investments we need to \nput people back to work.\n  I served on the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission. I understand this \nissue a little bit, maybe more than some. I don't profess to be an \nexpert. The deficits have to be brought under control. We can't borrow \n40 cents for every $1 we spend in Washington and sustain economic \ngrowth in America, period. But I also know this: With 10, 11 or 12 \nmillion Americans out of work, we cannot balance this budget. We have \nto get America back to work. These workers have to start earning a good \nwage, paying their fair share of taxes, and creating growth in this \neconomy and also growth in revenue which allows us to balance our \nbudget.\n  The President has two accelerators; he has to push them both at the \nsame time: fiscal responsibility on one side and economic growth on the \nother. And we have to move forward in a straight path. That is what his \nbudget does. There are those who say ignore economic growth, ignore \ncreating jobs. Just cut spending, just cut the deficit. If we did that \nalone, I am afraid the result would be disastrous. The President \nunderstands, and we all should.\n  There are three basic pillars to economic growth in America, and they \nare obvious: training and education. Is there a single Senator, \nCongressman or anyone here who doesn't understand they wouldn't be here \nwithout an education? We value education in America. It is the ladder \nof opportunity, and President Obama in his budget focuses on educating \nand training the next generation of skilled workers and leaders in the \nAmerican economy. When we walk away from that commitment to education, \nwe walk away from our future.\n  The second thing the President's budget focuses on is innovation, \nfinding those new technologies, those new discoveries which make our \nlives less burdensome and create more economic opportunity. It may be \nthe next medical device, a diagnostic tool which saves a life. It may \nbe the next pharmaceutical breakthrough at the National Institutes of \nHealth. It may be a new process for developing clean energy in America \nthat puts us back in the race to be the world leader in that field. \nThose investments by our Federal Government pay off in good businesses, \ngood jobs, and a better life for all of us.\n  Education, innovation, and the third piece is one that is on the \nfloor today, infrastructure. It is kind of a sterile word, but what it \ngets down to is it represents the highways, the bridges, the airports, \nthe mass transit, and the ports of America that are literally the \narteries through which our economic blood will flow. When they are not \nas good as they should be or as efficient as they should be, our \neconomy struggles. Let me give one example.\n\n  I live in Illinois and am proud of it. My family came to that State, \nmy mother as an immigrant to this country, my father off a farm in \nsouthern Illinois, to work in East St. Louis at a railroad. We almost \nequate Illinois with railroads. We are in the center of America and \nmost railroads pass through the State. There are railroads in every \ndirection.\n  Right now, it takes as long to take a freight shipment through the \ncity of Chicago as it does from the west coast to Chicago or from \nChicago to the east coast. Why? Our railroad infrastructure hasn't kept \nup with the growing need for rail freight transportation. We need to \ninvest in that. We have an opportunity to invest in it. When we do, \nwhen goods move more quickly, there is more profitability, businesses \ndo better, and they hire more people. The same is true with our highway \nsystem, with mass transit, with passenger rail. Look at what the \nRepublican view is, how they view this issue.\n  Currently, we are considering a bill coming over from the House of \nRepresentatives which would be a disaster for America's infrastructure \nand for the State of Illinois, an unqualified disaster. Instead of \ninvesting in building the infrastructure so America's economy can grow, \nthis bill, sadly, cuts the Federal investment in transportation by 15 \nor 20 percent over the next 5 years. It cuts the investment in mass \ntransit dramatically by eliminating the transfer of money from the \nhighway trust fund to mass transit, something that has gone on for 30 \nyears, and it makes a 25-percent cut in Amtrak. At a time when Amtrak \nis growing and proving itself, they want to basically start shutting it \ndown, closing it down, eliminating trains. That is no vision for the \nfuture. That is betting on failure. That is what the House Republican \nTransportation bill will do. We can do better.\n  We have a bipartisan bill--a word we don't hear that often in this \nChamber but a bipartisan bill--with Senator Barbara Boxer of California \nand Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma. They have agreed on a transportation \nbill which moves us forward for 2 years. We need to make that \ninvestment. The President understands that in his budget. We should \nunderstand it in the Senate, and we should make it happen.\n  The last point I will make is this: There was a breakthrough \nyesterday. Some people will be critical perhaps of the House Speaker \nfor reversing field and changing his position. It is a question of \nwhether the payroll tax cut which President Obama put in place is going \nto be continued beyond the end of this month.\n  Many may remember the flap that occurred in December when we were \nquestioning whether to extend it for 2 additional months. I went back \nto my State and talked about it county by county as to how much it \nmeant to working families. The Republicans relented in the House and \nagreed to extend it to the end of February. Unfortunately, just a short \ntime ago, the Speaker said:\n\n       If we're going to extend the payroll tax credit, \n     unemployment benefits, with reforms, and take care of the so-\n     called doc fix, we're going to have to offset the spending.\n\n  That is what the Speaker said. That was just a few days ago. \nYesterday, there was a different announcement. The Speaker of the \nHouse, Mr. Boehner of Ohio, said:\n\n       We are prepared to act to protect small businesses and our \n     economy from the consequences of Washington Democrats' \n     political games.\n\n  In other words, now the Republicans are prepared to extend the \npayroll tax cut without paying for it.\n  It would be easy to take a shot at the Speaker because he changed his \nposition, but I will not. I remember this, the week of celebrating \nAbraham Lincoln's birth, the 203rd anniversary of his birth, Lincoln \nwas much criticized for changing his position on an issue.\n  Lincoln said: Yes, I did change my position. But I would rather be \nright\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\nsome of the time than wrong all of the time. I think Speaker Boehner is \nright.\n  The last point I will make is this: Let us extend the payroll tax \ncut. The extension of unemployment benefits is of equal value to the \neconomy and immeasurable benefit value to those out of work who are \nstruggling to find a job. Make sure, if we get this done on a payroll \ntax cut, we don't give up on extending unemployment benefits, benefits \nthat will allow people to get back to work. I wish to see these blue \nlines growing. I wish to see us moving in the right direction, creating \njobs in America.\n  President Obama's payroll tax cut and the unemployment benefits which \nwe have pushed for have pushed us over the line in creating jobs. Let's \nnot end this record of success. Let's build on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, before the Senator from \nIllinois departs the floor, I wish to associate myself with his \nremarks--the standpoint the majority leader has pointed out in order to \nbuild an economy, built to last, we have to invest in our people and in \nour infrastructure and research and development. We can't cut our way \nto prosperity. Every business man and woman knows that. Every economist \nknows that. As our economy grows, then we can meet the challenge that \nis presented to us when it comes to our deficits and long-term debt. \nThat is how we are going to get a handle on that particular problem. I \nwish to thank the Senator from Illinois for his compelling remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S588-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S588-S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HARDROCK MINE CLEANUP\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to \ntalk about an environmental problem that affects many parts of Colorado \nas well as other western States; that is, abandoned hardrock mines.\n  These mines pollute thousands of miles of streams and rivers in \nAmerica with truly a toxic soup of heavy metals, including arsenic, \nlead, and mercury. That pollution impairs drinking water and kills \naquatic and plant life for miles downstream.\n  This is a problem that doesn't get enough attention in the Congress, \nand it is my hope that by speaking, I can spur all of us in this body \nand the administration to take greater steps to help solve this \nproblem. I would, in that spirit, invite my colleagues to join me in \nthis effort.\n  If I might first, a little background: Starting in the 1800s, miners \nflocked to the West in search of fortune following the discovery of \nprecious metals, such as gold, lead, copper, and silver. They settled \nin places with romantic names such as Leadville, Silverton, and Gypsum. \nMining became an important part of our history, of our settlement, and \nof our development in Colorado. But it also left a very dirty and \ndeadly legacy.\n  When a claim was mined for all its worth, the miner frequently packed \nup and left without a thought about the lasting problems the mine would \ncause. And this was an era before modern mining laws that hold miners \naccountable for their impact on the land.\n\n  Then, as a followup, in many cases it became impossible to identify \nthe persons responsible for the vast majority of these abandoned mines. \nThe Government Accountability Office estimates that there are over \n160,000 such abandoned hard rock mines in the West; 7,300 are in \nColorado, 47,000 are in California, and another 50,000 are in Arizona.\n  Today, highly acidic water still drains from these mines, polluting \nentire watersheds. I want to follow the logic that a picture is worth a \nthousand words. I want to show my colleagues what an acid mine drainage \nlooks like. This is the Red and Bonita Mine in San Juan County, CO, \nwhich is near Silverton. For scale, I want viewers to note the pickup \ntruck on the left side of this photograph. You can see a couple of \nindividuals up there as well. Over 300 gallons of water drains from \nthis mine every minute, and the water is contaminated with all kinds of \nheavy metals that produce the orange and the red streaks you see in \nthis photograph. Highly acidic water flows into the Cement Creek and \neventually into the Animas River, impairing water quality and aquatic \nlife. For a region of Colorado that thrives on tourism, including \nangling, this situation is extremely harmful.\n  From EPA data, we can conservatively estimate that over 10,000 miles \nof streams and rivers and nearly 350,000 acres of lakes are impaired in \nthis country as a result of acid mine drainage. With that backdrop, \nwhat is being done? For one, at those sites where a responsible party \ncan be identified, the Federal Government has the tools at its disposal \nto hold them accountable. Also, the Federal Land Management agencies \nhave a variety of programs that mitigate abandoned hard rock mine \npollution.\n  However, the efforts I want to focus on today are those undertaken by \na third category of people: entities that had no role in creating the \npollution at an abandoned mine site yet want to make the situation \nbetter. Appropriately enough, we refer to these entities as Good \nSamaritans. One such Good Samaritan is the Animas River Stakeholders \nGroup in southwestern Colorado. They are working to find solutions to \nclean up the Red and Bonita Mine. Often, Good Samaritans are nonprofits \nwith a mission to restore the natural environment. Sometimes they are \ncommunity groups that want to improve their cities and their towns. \nSometimes they are mining companies looking to be good stewards in the \ncommunities in which they operate. Sometimes they are State and local \ngovernments.\n  For example, take the Tiger Mine near Leadville, CO. The picture I \nwant to show you was taken before any remediation activities took \nplace. You can see the piles of mine waste and drainage coming from the \nmines beside it. At peak flows, as much as 150 gallons of water per \nminute contaminated with cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, and iron flows \nout of the Tiger Mine.\n  As you can see in the second picture, some remediation work has been \ndone. The mine waste was moved out of the way, capped, and revegetated, \nand the ditches were put in above the mine to divert surface water \nrunoff and to further reduce contamination.\n  You can also see in this picture that four pits have been dug below \nthe mine, and this represents the next phase of cleanup being lead by \nTrout Unlimited, another Good Samaritan. Eventually these pits will \nbecome what is known as a sulfate-reducing bioreactor. Now, the \nPresiding Officer knows I was not a chemistry major, so I won't attempt \nto describe how this works. But the end result is a good thing, I can \ntell you that. The acid mine drainage flows in and cleaner water flows \nout. However, Trout Unlimited has run into a problem that has \nfrustrated many Good Samaritans. The bioreactor counts as a point \nsource of pollution; therefore, before Trout Unlimited can turn the \nbioreactor on, they must obtain a clean water permit. Trout Unlimited \ncannot meet the stringent permit requirements without investing in far \nmore expensive water treatment options, nor can they afford to assume \nthe liability that comes with the permit. As a result, the bioreactor \nsits unused.\n  Federal law is, in effect, sidelining some of the best hopes for \nremediation. I have tried for several years--I said several years, but \nit feels like a lifetime--I think at least a decade to give Good \nSamaritans some relief. I have introduced legislation to every Congress \nsince 2002 that creates a unique permit specifically for this kind of \nwork. Unfortunately, I have not been able to convince enough of my \ncolleagues just how good of an idea this is, but I am going to keep \ntrying.\n  In addition, I have been working with Senator Boxer to encourage the \nEPA to better use the administrative tools it has at its disposal. Good \nSamaritans report to me that administrative tools have been cumbersome \nto use so far, and they don't offer the full Clean Water Act protection \nthey need.\n  Senator Boxer, along with Senator Bennet, has asked the EPA to make \nthis tool more accessible to Good Samaritans. Last week we asked the \nagency to provide Good Samaritans with assurances that they would not \nbe subject to enforcement for appropriate actions to clean up acid mine \npollution.\n  I am grateful for the work the EPA has done to focus on these issues \nand for Senator Boxer's leadership. Good Samaritans are too valuable a \nresource to keep on the sidelines. Congress\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\nshould do what is necessary to bring their efforts to bear on the \ncleanup of abandoned mine pollution. Good Samaritans cannot solve all \nof our abandoned mine pollution problems, but we cannot afford to turn \naway those willing to help any longer.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your interest on this important topic \nto those of us in the West.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we rise today to talk about the budget \nthat was submitted by the President of the United States, actually \nwithin the last 24 hours. Despite a 2009 promise to literally cut the \ndeficit in half by the end of his first term, President Obama released \na budget that, for the fourth year in a row, calls for a deficit in \nexcess of $1 trillion. Unfortunately, this proposal is one more year of \nthe same old story: more taxes, more spending, more borrowing, and yet \nanother punt on the tough issues we as a Nation must face.\n  As a former Governor, I understand what it takes to balance a budget. \nDifficult choices do have to be made, even with programs that are \npopular. In 2001, when I was Governor of Nebraska, I closed a $220 \nmillion budget shortfall and didn't raise taxes. But $220 million is \nmerely a drop in the bucket for the Federal budget that amounted to \nmore than 7 percent in Nebraska. By comparison, if the President had \nsubmitted a budget that cut spending by 7 percent, he would be cutting \nmore than $260 billion this year. That wasn't the last thing we had to \ndo. With the post-9/11 economy, we called special session after special \nsession to cut spending.\n  But instead of that, the President is projected to increase spending. \nLeadership is necessary and, sadly, this budget does not display it. \nInstead, America's balance sheet continues to drown in a sea of red ink \nfor yet another year, driving our 2012 deficit to nearly $1.4 trillion. \nInstead of making tough choices about priorities, the President appears \nto be doubling down on more stimulus spending.\n  Let me give a few examples, and then I will invite my colleagues to \njoin me: $2 billion in new tax credits for the production of advanced \ntechnology vehicles; $4 billion to extend and modify ``certain energy \nincentives which could include clean renewable energy bonds;'' $3 \nbillion to encourage investments in advanced energy manufacturing \nprojects; $4.7 billion for new spending to strengthen the teaching \nprofession despite GAO finding 82 duplicative and wasteful teacher \nquality programs. When we add it all, we are presented with yet another \nbudget that contains the largest tax increase in U.S. history. It \nraises taxes by more than $1.8 trillion. I could go on and on. This is \nsimply a situation where we have seen this budget before, and it \ndoesn't improve.\n  I will turn to my colleague Senator Blunt, from the State of \nMissouri, who has worked on these budgets before, and I will ask him to \noffer some insights of what he sees in this budget and where it is \nleading our country, in his opinion.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend for putting this discussion together \nthis morning. I think it is a serious discussion, unlike this budget, \nwhich is clearly not a serious budget. The President doesn't expect it \nto be voted on. The majority leader in the Senate said it wouldn't be \nvoted on. When the White House spokesman was asked if they had a \nposition on the fact that the Senate wasn't going to produce a budget--\nthis budget could be voted on but it won't be debated and there won't \nbe a companion Senate budget apparently that goes along with it--the \nWhite House spokesman said no, they didn't have a position on the fact \nthat the majority leader said there would be no Senate budget this \nyear. Remember, this is the budget that is required by law to be passed \nby April 15 of every year, and I guess this will be the fourth straight \ntime that April 15 will be missed without having passed a budget.\n  What we have here, unlike a budget document that does what the \nSenator from Nebraska did as Governor or what my son Matt did as \nGovernor of Missouri--he had a $1 billion deficit, and they had to make \nup for that, and they did. The Senator from Nebraska made up for the \ndeficit in his State. Governor and now Senator Risch was responsible to \nsee that the numbers added up. These numbers don't add up. This is a \nbudget that spends too much and taxes too much and it borrows too much. \nSpending goes up in this budget. In this budget year we are spending \n$3.8 trillion, fiscal year 2013, the budget year we are talking about \nnow. Seven years from now, fiscal year 2022--9 years from now--we are \nspending almost $6 trillion, from $3.8 trillion to $5.8 trillion.\n  Clearly, the spending problem isn't solved by this budget. This \nbudget makes the spending problem worse. This budget adds almost $2 \ntrillion in new taxes. So it spends too much, it taxes too much, and \nthen it borrows too much. We are going to increase the debt again. We \nhave a deficit of almost $1 trillion in each of the Obama years of \nresponsibility during this first term. It cannot be allowed to \ncontinue. But when we look at this budget document--the 10-year \nprojections--there is no indication that we change any of these trends.\n  We all understand these trends are unacceptable. The Federal \nGovernment's total debt has now surpassed the size of the economy. The \npotential of our economy to produce goods and services, the so-called \nGDP number, is now exceeded by our debt. We know what happened in \nGreece when their debt exceeded the capacity of their economy to \nproduce goods and services. We know what happened in Italy. We know \nwhat happened in Ireland. We know what happened in Portugal. Why don't \nwe think that is going to happen to us? Because it will, and we have to \nmake these numbers add up.\n  The Senator from Nebraska as a Governor had to produce a budget. \nGovernor Risch produced a budget. I will turn to him in a second to \ntalk about the responsibility of the Executive to lead and then, \nfrankly, the responsibility of the Senate to do its job.\n  I am continually surprised that we can miss this absolute deadline in \nthe law year after year after year and there is not a press outcry. \nThere is more of a public outcry than a press outcry. My sense is that \nif when I was in the House of Representatives we had missed this \ndeadline once as opposed to over and over and over, there would have \nbeen a marshaling of people around the country to come and stand on the \nsteps of the Capitol to say, Why isn't the majority in the House doing \nits job? This is something the current majority in the Senate has \nwalked away from in ways I can't understand.\n  When we talk to Americans, getting people back to work and getting \ncontrol of Federal spending are the No. 1 and No. 2 domestic \npriorities, but I don't see those priorities in this budget.\n  I turn to my friend from Idaho to see what he has thought of, as we \nhave now had a few hours to look at the specifics of the President's \nbudget.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. Like \neveryone, I have been perusing the numbers to try to figure out whether \nthis gets us somewhere and whether it will actually come to fruition.\n\n  A quick look at history. As the Senator points out, this will be the \nfourth year, if we don't adopt a budget, where we haven't had one. \nThere isn't an entity in the world that operates without a budget. We \nhave to have a budget if we are going to do anything responsibly. \nBudgeting is not that difficult; it\n\n[[Page S590]]\n\nis merely a way of taking the money we have coming in and allocating it \non a priority basis for what we think money should be spent for. There \nis never enough money. There isn't an enterprise in the world that has \nenough money. Everyone has to make decisions as to what are the \npriorities and do the best they can with the money they have.\n  As I said, over 1,000 days have passed since the Senate has adopted a \nbudget. Last year, a similar budget the President produced was actually \nput on the floor here of the Senate for a vote. It failed, with zero \n``yea'' votes to 97 ``no'' votes. That is not a party-line vote.\n  This budget, one can only conclude, just like the budget produced by \nthe President last year, spends too much, taxes too much, and it \nborrows too much.\n  The budgeting process is something that is extremely important. The \nAmerican people demand it. Common sense demands it. Anyone who has ever \noperated a government or a business enterprise knows we must budget. \nEvery Governor in the United States does it--all 50 States. Every \nlegislature does it. As was pointed out by Senator Johanns, when he was \nGovernor he had to cut 7 percent.\n  Let me tell my colleagues about the state of play in Idaho. When I \nwas Governor, the budget was $3.5 billion when I left. The current \nGovernor is operating with a $2.5 billion budget. He cut $1 billion out \nof a $3.5 billion budget. If it can be done at the State level, it can \nbe done at the national level, and, indeed, it has to be done at the \nnational level. We are going to have to cut.\n  The proposed budget spends about $10.4 billion every day, and I put \nit on a daily basis because when we start talking about trillions, \npeople's eyes glaze over. There is no possible way--there is no human \nbeing on the face of this planet who can determine what $1 trillion is, \nlet alone the $3.8 trillion this budget spends. But if we put it on a \ndaily basis, it is $10.4 billion every day. Remember, in the State of \nIdaho, for a year, the State spends $2.5 billion. This government \nspends $10.4 billion every day. That comes down to about $7.2 million \nevery minute.\n  One wouldn't have a whole lot of argument about that if indeed the \ngovernment had $10.4 billion to spend every day or $7.2 million to \nspend every minute. But, indeed, every day, under this budget, the \nFederal Government will borrow $2.4 billion--every single day. The \nborrowing comes down to about $1.7 million every minute.\n  When we put it in terms of how much it is a day and how much it is a \nminute, it becomes staggering. Right now, because we have been dealing \nwith this, every time I see nationally a business engaged in a huge \ndeal at $5 billion or something such as that, we can put it in \nperspective of how the Federal Government is doing its business. This \nborrowing that is being done every day by the Federal Government has \nyielded us now a $15 trillion debt. Again, I don't know what that is; \nnobody knows what that is. But what I do know is we will never pay it \noff in our lifetime. It will be our kids and our grandkids who are \nsaddled with that particular amount. That is the real deal.\n  I wish everybody could have the experience I had, and a number of \nSenators have done this. Every day, the Federal Government has to pay \nits bills at the end of the day. They are not like businesses; they \ndon't pay every month. They pay at the end of the day. How do they do \nthis? When I first got here, I thought: This is staggering, and what \nhave you. But I went and watched them do it. The Treasury has a \ncheckbook, like everyone else does, and at the end of the day it has a \nbalance, like everybody else. How does it balance it? It balances it by \ngoing out and borrowing the money. I watched them borrow. This is \nindeed borrowing. About a fourth of it comes from China, about a fourth \ncomes from other countries, and about half comes from wealthy \ninstitutions including banks and trusts and individuals around the \nworld. But it is real borrowing and it has to be paid back. Indeed, \nthey not only borrow the amount of money they need every day for the \ndaily deficit, but they borrow enough money to pay back the people \nwhose debts are coming due that day.\n  After you walk out of there and watch them actually do that, you \ncan't help but walk away from it feeling sick. Because when we look at \nthese kinds of numbers, the government can't pay its bills at the end \nof the day. The only way it can pay its bills is if it borrows.\n  We need systemic change. Everything has to be reformed. If I were in \ncharge of everything, the first thing I would reform is this ridiculous \nidea that we budget on a 10-year basis. That is outrageous.\n\n  Mr. President, 10-year budgeting allows smoke and mirrors and allows \ngimmicks and games so you can stand up and say: Why, this budget saves \n$4 trillion. It does not save a dime next year. All this alleged \nsavings is 10 years out, and, indeed, on this 10-year cycle they use to \nbudget, the second year never comes.\n  We need an annual budget. We need to look in the mirror and talk \nabout how much we are spending next year versus how much is coming in. \nForget this 10-year basis. It is absolute nonsense.\n  Senator Blunt talked about Greece. Greece is going through what we \nare going to have to go through at some time; that is, cutting back. \nThey lived happy for decades. Well, they spent their children's and \ntheir grandchildren's money, and all of a sudden what happened to them? \nNobody would loan them money anymore. If that happens to us, we are out \nof business. If nobody will loan us any money on a daily basis, we are \nout of business.\n  So what do we need? We need compromise. It is compromise that got us \ninto the position we are in. Compromise every year caused us to take \neach budget item, where the Democrats wanted to spend more, the \nRepublicans wanted to spend less, so they compromised somewhere in the \nmiddle. Now we are operating, even under this budget, at a trillion-\ndollar deficit for the year.\n  It is time to compromise again. But we need to go in the other \ndirection. We need to compromise on: How much are we going to cut this \nyear? The Republicans are going to want to cut more. The Democrats, I \nhope, will agree that we need to do some cutting and we need to wind up \nsomewhere in the middle. That is the only way we are going to get this \nback on track. This budget does not cut it. This budget does not even \ncome close to it. We are going to bankrupt America if we do not start \ndoing things differently.\n  I see Senator Isakson has joined us on the floor.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for laying out what \nthis budget is all about and the problems we are seeing.\n  Senator Isakson has been a leader in trying to reform the budget \nprocess.\n  I say to Senator Isakson, I would like you to offer thoughts on what \nyou see in this budget and some ideas on how we can improve this \nsituation we find ourselves in with the President's budget wanting more \ntaxing, more borrowing, more spending.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the opportunity.\n  I commend Senator Risch for his remarks. I want to make a little \naddition to those remarks in a second. But specifically, in answer to \nSenator Johanns' question, the only thing you can do with this budget \nis start over.\n  Senator Risch has very importantly recognized the 10-year fiasco we \nlook at every year by pushing savings out into years 8, 9, and 10, when \nthis President will not be here and another Congress will be here.\n  In talking about compromise, one of the things Senator Shaheen from \nNew Hampshire and I have pushed for 2 years is a process 40 States \noperate under, including the Senator's, if I am not mistaken, I say to \nMr. Johanns, and that is a biennial budget process. So instead of \ntalking about 10 years, you are talking about 2 years. Instead of \ntalking about appropriating every year, you appropriate in 1 year for 2 \nyears, and in the second year--which happens to be the election year, \nor the even unnumbered year--your total obligation is to look for \nsavings, efficiencies, and the fine functioning of the government.\n  We do not ever do in this Congress what our families do and our \nchildren do every year at home. We do not ever sit around our kitchen \ntable, reprioritize our expenditures based on our needs, and find out \nhow to live within our means. The American people do not get the luxury \nof printing\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\nmoney. Japan does not come in and buy notes to fund their money. They \nhave to figure out how they themselves can manage their budget in such \na way as to live within the income they have and not go into big debt. \nThe United States of America ought to do the same.\n  One of the things Senator Risch hit on that I want to hammer on for a \nsecond--because there is a big part of our problem that is solvable; \nand it is solvable if good people would be willing to talk about it \nrather than politic about it--is known as entitlements.\n  Entitlements are Social Security, welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, \nretirement disabilities, et cetera. But two of them are not \nentitlements. Two of them are obligations of the United States of \nAmerica. That is not an entitlement. That is something somebody has \npaid for. America's people pay 6.2 percent of their payroll normally--\nexcept for the recent holiday we have had--to go into a Social Security \ntrust fund to pay them a benefit. They pay 1.35 percent of their income \nevery month--from day one, since 1968--to pay for Medicare. Those are \nnot entitlements they are entitled to. Those are obligations we have \ncommitted them to from moneys they have paid.\n  This document we are looking at in this budget does not portend a \nsingle change in benefits or in obligations for Medicare and Medicaid \nand Social Security, which simply means the day they go broke comes \nthat much faster. We are defaulting on the obligation we have to the \nAmerican people. Whereas, if we sat down honestly, put those programs \non the table, looked at the outyears, when my grandchildren and \nchildren may be beneficiaries, and modify the obligation, pushing out \nthe eligibility, we can save the obligation we owe the American people \nfor Social Security and Medicare. But if we do not do it, it will be \ngone. That is something they paid for that we took out of the trust \nfund and used for something else--not the least of which was the $500 \nbillion the President took out of the trust fund for Medicare to help \npay for the affordable health care bill, which has not even gone into \neffect yet.\n  I think it is time we ask of ourselves what the American people have \nto ask of themselves: Sit around our kitchen table, decide what our \npriorities are, live within our means, and budget for the future. Do \nnot budget for failure. This is budgeting for failure.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by Senator \nIsakson. I wish to take a moment to follow up on his comments relative \nto Medicare and Social Security. Then I would ask Senator Blunt to \noffer a few words on where we go from here, what do we anticipate we \nhave to do to set the ship of state on the right course, if you will.\n  But let me speak to the issue of Medicare and Social Security. \nSenator Isakson could not be more right. When you get paid, you can \nliterally go to your paycheck stub and you can see the amount of money \nthat is being withheld out of your paycheck--throughout your life--for \nSocial Security benefits and for Medicare benefits.\n\n  When these programs were set up, thereabouts, a group was put \ntogether--they were referred to as trustees--and they basically did a \nfair analysis of where these programs were and where they were headed. \nEvery year, they put out a report, and we will be getting another \nannual report in the not too distant future. But I think we all know \nwhat the report is going to say. The report is going to say that in the \nvicinity of about 2024, if not a bit sooner, Social Security literally \nis going to be insolvent. It is also going to say Medicare is literally \nin a position where it will be upside down financially sooner than \nthat. The greatest challenge between the two, obviously, is Medicare.\n  What does that mean to people who are currently beneficiaries or \nabout to retire and planning on these items being there for them? Well, \nwhat it means is, that plan could be in serious jeopardy.\n  It is not because Mike Johanns woke up last night and said that or \ndreamt it or thought about it. It is because people who are empowered \nto look at Social Security and Medicare have studied it very closely, \nhave looked at the financial pieces of this, and have come to this \nconclusion.\n  Now let's examine the President's budget. What plan does he have to \nprotect Medicare or Social Security? Well, he does not have a plan. \nThese are not easy issues. I am not arguing here today this is easy to \ntake on. But what I am saying to the American people is, if you study \nthis budget or any other budget submitted by this President, he is \ndoing nothing to arrest literally our progress toward these very \nimportant programs becoming insolvent. If there was ever an area in \nthis budget where we need Presidential leadership, it is right here.\n  I would ask Senator Blunt for his thoughts. The Senator has studied \nthese issues over the years and has offered great insight. Where do we \ngo from here? What are the Senator's thoughts in terms of this budget \nand how we get back on track?\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I think my first \nthought is, the insight is not that difficult; it is just that we need \nto do our job. We cannot expect to solve these problems if the Senate \ndoes not do the job it is supposed to do. And we cannot expect to solve \nthese problems if we keep letting the size of our government get out of \nproportion to the capacity of our economy.\n  In 2008--the year before the administration started--the deficit was \nhigher than I thought it should be by a lot. It was $459 billion. That \nwas 3 percent of GDP, and I thought that was unacceptable. The very \nnext year--the first year of this administration--it went to 10 percent \nof GDP, $1.4 trillion. Then after that, it has been a trillion, a \ntrillion, a trillion--$1.4 trillion, $1.3 trillion, $1.3 trillion--$1.3 \ntrillion in the year we are in now. This does not change that \ntrajectory at all. And in the budget the President submitted, for the \nfirst time any President has said this, the President says the Social \nSecurity trust fund, during this 10-year window, will run out of \nmoney--that the money coming in, for the first time ever, will not \nequal the money going out--but proposes nothing to do anything about \nthat.\n  This is a commitment the Federal Government has made to Americans. \nSocial Security can continue to work if you periodically look at the \nfacts, the demographics, and adjust it.\n  We have about worn out the Tip O'Neill-Ronald Reagan example on \nSocial Security. But I say to the Senators, that was in 1983. On the \nsupposed third rail of politics that a President will not touch, in the \nvery next year, Ronald Reagan carried 49 States. This would have been a \ngreat year in divided government to solve this problem because one side \ncould not spend the rest of the time blaming the other.\n  I do not think the changes in Social Security, made in 1983, to my \nknowledge, have ever been an issue in any political campaign anywhere. \nBecause they were made in a way that anticipated people's needs to \nadjust, we are just now, 30 years later, getting to the final phase-in \nof the new retirement age--30 years later. But if you do not get that \nstarted, you will never get there, whether it is Social Security or the \nSocial Security insurance fund, which gets into trouble even quicker, \naccording to the President, in 2018, and there is no proposal to do \nanything about that.\n  For people who are absolutely dependent on that safety net--family \nmembers, dependent children--if something happens to the worker who is \npaying into Social Security, 5 years from now the President says that \nis in big trouble. But you go through all of these papers, and you see \nno indication anywhere of what we should do about that.\n  These are issues that have to be dealt with, and I suggest the most \nfundamental way to deal with them is for the Senate to do its job, for \nthe Senate to produce a budget, for the Senate to get focused--as \nSenator Risch suggested we need to focus--not on some phony pay-for 10 \nyears out that never materializes, but what are we going to do this \nyear to change the course of the country, to change the trajectory.\n  One thing you learn in artillery is, you do not have to change the \ntrajectory, you do not have to change the level of the artillery piece \nvery much to make a big difference out there in the distance. But if \nyou do not change it at all, you keep landing at exactly the same \nplace. And this is a budget that actually lands in even a worse\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\nplace because it spends more money, it spends too much, it taxes too \nmuch, it borrows too much, and the American people know we cannot \ncontinue to do that, as was the case made very well by Senator Risch.\n  I ask the Senator, does he have any other thoughts on what we need to \nbe doing and how we need to be doing it?\n  Mr. RISCH. First of all, one of the things people have to accept--and \nit does not happen around here--is we do not have an income problem. We \nhave a spending problem. All the money in the world would not get us to \nwhere you are able to solve every problem that comes down the pike and \npeople want to resolve.\n  The President is urging that somebody is not paying their fair share. \nI wish he would hang more details on that. I wish some media person \nwould ask him: Identify these groups for us, please. I think he is \ntrying to create a national dialog as to who is or who is not paying \ntheir fair share. I think that might be appropriate.\n  I think when the American people started on this, they took the \nnumbers and said: OK, if you take the first half of income earners from \nthe lowest to the median, they are paying zero percent in taxes; the \ntop 10 percent is paying 70 percent of all the money the government \ntakes in, so let's have a dialog as to which of those two groups is \npaying their fair share.\n  There are some very good sociological reasons why the upper income \npays more than the lower income, and I do not think anyone is going to \nargue with that.\n  But there is only so much we can do. I am not here defending the \nrich. The rich take care of themselves. They can move their capital \nwherever they want to move it. Indeed, we all know a good deal of it is \nmoved offshore. There is $2 trillion offshore right now that \nAmericans--American businesses--want to bring back, but they will not \nbring it back because there is a war on capital in this country with \nthe government trying to take the capital. We need to have a national \ndialogue about that. We need to land in the middle someplace.\n  Again, no one is going to defend the rich. They do not have to; the \nrich can take care of themselves. But the fact is, we have to come to \nthe conclusion at some point that the resources of the American people \nare finite. Be it the rich, be it the poor, be it the middle class, \ntheir ability to pay for government is finite. There is a point at \nwhich we have to say wait instead of saying we are going to bring in \nmore. We have to say we are going to have to prioritize the money we \nhave and how we are going to spend it.\n  I think that is the way we get out of this situation, having an \nacceptance that there is a finite amount of money. It is too easy for \nus to borrow money. We have seen that in our own lives. We have seen \nfriends of ours who have gone down to the bank and borrowed money. If \nthe money is too easy to borrow, they get into trouble, and they get \ninto trouble relatively quickly.\n  Well, we have gotten into trouble because it is so easy for us to \nborrow. People still want to loan us money. People are still loaning us \nmoney every day. They lend us billions and billions. Indeed, if they \ndid not, we would be out of business. So it is time for this national \ndialogue on where we are going to go.\n  As I said, the only way this is going to be resolved is if we \ncompromise. Instead of talking about how much more we are going to \nspend, we need to do something we have not done since World War II; \nthat is, compromise on how much we are going to cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, our Nation is more than $15 trillion in \ndebt. The President's budget will increase government spending by $47 \ntrillion over the next decade. Included is the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history, while our national debt increases to $25.9 trillion \nover the next 10 years.\n  That is right. This budget proposes a massive tax increase, not as a \nplan to address the national debt but to fuel more reckless big \ngovernment spending. Our Nation cannot afford to continue down this \npath. This reckless budget will not only saddle our children and \ngrandchildren with massive government debt, but it proposes to raise \ntaxes on the very businesses we need to create jobs.\n  How can this President and the majority party claim to be projobs \nwhen everything they are doing is antibusiness? This budget threatens \nour long-term economic security and places a greater burden on our \nchildren and grandchildren who will be forced to live and pay for \nWashington's inability to solve this problem.\n  While I believe the President's budget spends too much, borrows too \nmuch, and taxes too much, in the Senate the majority party has chosen \nto go to the other extreme. They have now refused to pass a budget for \nmore than 1,000 days. It is our responsibility as legislators to \ndevelop a real, workable budget that will put our Nation back on the \npath of economic prosperity. Unfortunately, the majority simply has not \ntaken this responsibility seriously.\n  Now, there are some who claim that spending caps established in the \nBudget Control Act constitute a budget. Quite frankly, I disagree. At a \ntime when millions of Americans are out of work, this behavior in \nWashington continues to create great uncertainty and stifles economic \ngrowth.\n  No State has felt the failures of Washington more than the State of \nNevada. My State continues to lead the Nation in unemployment, with \nmore than 150,000 Nevadans looking for a job. With the so-called \nstimulus plans, Cash for Clunkers, and bailouts, Washington's response \nto our economic problems has been woefully inadequate and, in Nevada, a \ncomplete failure.\n  Here is the kind of story I hear all too often from my fellow \nNevadans:\n\n       You may recall that my wife Pam and I own Straw Hat Pizza \n     here in Carson. Pam has owned and operated the restaurant \n     since May of 1985. Unfortunately, after 25 years of \n     operation, today is our last day of being in business. We are \n     forced to close our doors and likely file for bankruptcy due \n     to the horrible economic situation in our state, and Carson \n     City in particular. It's a true tragedy that a lifelong \n     endeavor ends this way, and Pam feels that she is a failure.\n       I keep reminding her that the failure was not hers, but \n     rather a failure of liberal elected officials to do what's \n     right for our country and get out of the way, let free \n     enterprise work its magic, and in turn let individuals \n     flourish.\n\n  Members of Congress are willfully refusing to put our Nation on a \npath of long-term fiscal responsibility, creating greater uncertainty, \nand contributing to an anemic economy that is forcing small businesses \nto close their doors. As long as this is the case, Americans will \ncontinue to be frustrated and angry with Washington's inability to \nproduce real results.\n\n  Our Nation's Capitol remains the only place in the country where \ndifficult decisions are not made. Congress continually kicks the can \ndown the road leaving tough fiscal decisions for future Congresses, \nfuture administrations, and worse, the next generation.\n  In light of these facts, is it any mystery why Congress is currently \nexperiencing its worst approval ratings in history. I introduced the No \nBudget,\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nNo Pay Act to force Congress to face reality, to take responsibility \nfor running this country. This bipartisan legislation requires that the \nSenate and House of Representatives pass a budget and all \nappropriations bills by the beginning of each fiscal year. Failure to \ndo so would result in the loss of pay until Congress takes its job \nseriously.\n  If Congress does not complete its constitutional duties, then its \nMembers should not be paid. It is that simple. If we do not do our job, \nthen we should not be paid. This concept resonates with the American \npeople. I know this because I asked Nevadans during a series of \ntelephone townhall meetings last year whether they supported a bill \nthat would hold the pay of Members of Congress if they failed to pass a \nbudget. More than 4,000 Nevadans participated in this poll, and 84 \npercent of them supported the No Budget, No Pay concept.\n  The budget is not a trivial piece of legislation or a campaign \ndocument. It is a roadmap that identifies goals, priorities, and \nestablishes a multiyear fiscal course for the Nation. If done right it \ncan provide stability and set expectations for where we want to take \nour Nation.\n  Budgeting is not a strange concept. It is something that is done at \nall levels of government, businesses large and small, and at every \nkitchen table across the country. It is past time for Congress to \nactually implement policies that would encourage the economic growth we \nneed to ensure that workers can have good jobs and provide for their \nfamilies.\n  While the No Budget, No Pay Act will not solve every problem in \nWashington, I sincerely believe it would be a step in the right \ndirection. These essential functions of Congress are vital to fiscal \nresponsibility and creating greater certainty so our job creators can \nflourish.\n  I was pleased to see reports of growth--small growth--in our economy. \nBut lack of clarity provided by Washington continues to hamper economic \ngrowth. Back home, Nevadans continue to struggle. Small businesses are \ntrying to survive while gridlock in Washington is making it harder for \nemployers to know what to expect in the coming years. Establishing a \nresponsible budget would be a good first step toward placing our Nation \non a path for a more prosperous future.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Egypt\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, some Senators are concerned that I may be \ndelaying a vote in the Senate. This is not true. I offered yesterday to \nvote on my amendment with 10 minutes of discussion. I have offered to \nvote immediately at any point in time.\n  I do think it is worth 10 minutes of our time and 10 minutes of \nAmerica's time to discuss the plight of U.S. citizens in Egypt. I don't \nthink 10 minutes is too much to ask to discuss, debate, and vote on \nwhether Egypt should continue to get aid from us while detaining our \ncitizens. Egypt is unlawfully preventing U.S. citizens from leaving \nthat country. I don't think 10 minutes is too much to ask. We have sent \nover $60 billion in aid to Egypt over the years, and they now hold 19 \nU.S. citizens virtually hostage.\n  Will we ever learn? Will we ever learn we can't buy friendship? \nNineteen U.S. citizens who traveled to Egypt to help Egypt embrace \ndemocracy, to help Egypt to have an elective government, to enjoy the \nfreedoms we enjoy and the success we enjoy having a democratic \ngovernment, those Americans are now being prevented from leaving Egypt. \nSome of the prodemocracy workers are, in fact, seeking refuge in the \nU.S. Embassy.\n  This is a tragedy and something we should make a clear and \nunequivocal statement about. Does Egypt wish to be part of the \ncivilized world or do they wish to descend into the lawlessness of the \nThird World? Some have argued we don't need these provisions, that \nthere are already provisions in place to prevent Egypt from getting \naid. Apparently, the Egyptians aren't listening, and they need to \nlisten very clearly.\n  The amendment I proposed will end all aid to Egypt--economic and \nmilitary. We give over $1.5 billion to Egypt every year, and we cannot \ncontinue to give aid to a country that is illegally detaining our U.S. \ncitizens.\n  Some have said the provisions we already have will take care of this. \nThere are a couple problems. The Egyptians aren't hearing that message, \nso the message needs to be louder and more firm. We will not tolerate \nany country holding U.S. citizens as hostages or lawlessly. I think \nEgypt needs to know America means business, and that is what this \ndebate is all about.\n  I don't think it is too much to ask the Senate to consider this \nproposal on Egypt; let's spend 10 minutes and let's have a vote to send \na message to Egypt.\n  The question is, Will we ever learn? Will we ever learn we cannot buy \nfriendship? Will we ever learn we cannot create Democrats out of \nauthoritarians simply by buying them off? We have tried it. We have \nsent billions of dollars to Africa and asked authoritarians who rape \nand pillage and torture their own people, and we give them more money \ntrying to convince them to be democratic. It doesn't work.\n  We need to have a firmer hand and say there will be no more aid to \ncountries that detain U.S. citizens, that don't allow their citizens to \nvote, and to countries that torture and rape and pillage their \npopulation.\n  We have sent billions of dollars to Afghanistan, and it is an insult \nto Americans--particularly to American soldiers--that the President of \nAfghanistan has said if there were a war, he would side with Pakistan \nagainst the United States.\n  Will we ever learn? We send money--billions of dollars--to these \ncountries, and apparently they still dislike us, disrespect us, and say \nthey will side with our enemies.\n  There are now officials in Pakistan, which has gotten billions of \ndollars from us, saying Pakistan will side with Iran. Afghanistan is \ntelling us they will side with Pakistan. So Pakistan will side with \nIran, and what does the chump, the U.S. taxpayer, get? Send more money. \nNo. 1, we don't even have the money. We are borrowing the money from \nChina, and we are asked to send more money to people who disrespect us. \nI think that is an insult that should end.\n  Will we ever learn? Will we ever learn we can't buy friendship? Will \nwe ever learn authoritarians, no matter how much money we give them, \nwill not become democratic? Egypt must be put on notice.\n  The President is not leading on this issue. Just a few weeks ago, the \nPresident's Under Secretary of State, Robert Hormats, stated he wanted \nto make sure the administration assured the Egyptians that we want to \nprovide them ``more immediate benefits.''\n  Do you think that maybe the President is sending the wrong message to \nthe Egyptians? They are detaining 19 U.S. citizens and preventing them \nfrom coming home and U.S. citizens are holed up in our Embassy and the \nadministration says we need to make sure the benefits get there \nimmediately. The administration is bragging about sending more aid to \nEgypt.\n  Just yesterday, the President came out with a new budget. Guess what. \nThere is $1.5 billion of taxpayer money to be sent to Egypt. What kind \nof message are we sending them? I think the President is not leading \nthe country and is not exemplifying what most Americans would want; \nthat is, to send a clear and unequivocal message to Egypt that we will \nnot tolerate this behavior or subsidize this behavior.\n  Think of it. The American taxpayer is being asked to subsidize a \ngovernment that is detaining U.S. citizens. The American taxpayer is \nbeing asked to subsidize Pakistan, that says they would side with Iran. \nThe American citizen, the American taxpayer, is being asked to \nsubsidize Afghanistan, that said they would side with Pakistan against \nus. All the while we are running trillion-dollar deficits, borrowing \nthis money, and bankrupting our country.\n  The Egyptians need to be sent a clear and unequivocal message. I \nthink it is worth 10 minutes of the Senate's time to have a vote. I \nthink it is worth it for the 19 U.S. citizens. If it were my child in \nEgypt working there for a prodemocracy group, I would want to think the\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\nSenate had 10 minutes of time. I would want to think the Senate can \nspare 10 minutes of time to send the Egyptians a signal that we will \nnot tolerate this and they must let our citizens come home.\n  The United States will not and should not stand for the detention of \nAmerican citizens. The United States will not stand for imprisonment or \ntravel restrictions on its citizens, and the United States should not \nsend aid to a government that so casually accuses American citizens of \npolitical crimes.\n  So while some will say I am holding up the business of the Senate, I \nargue this is the business of the Senate; that foreign policy was \ndelegated--much of it--to the Senate, that we are abdicating our role, \nand that we as the Senate should send a clear and unequivocal message \nto Egypt. So I will continue to argue, despite much opposition, to have \na vote to send a signal to Egypt that we will not tolerate the \ndetention of U.S. citizens.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be allowed to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous \nconsent that following my statement, the Banking Committee's ranking \nmember be recognized, followed by Senator Menendez of New Jersey, and \nthat all time they consume be counted toward the postcloture time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I am pleased to present \nthe Banking Committee's public transportation bill to the Senate as an \namendment to the surface and transportation legislation now before us. \nThe transit bill was reported by our committee unanimously. Maintaining \ninvestment in our Nation's transportation infrastructure is a priority \nof mine and of our committee.\n  I wish to thank our committee's ranking member, Senator Shelby, who \nhas worked for a long time on this bill. Without his support, this \nbipartisan legislation would not be possible. I also wish to thank our \ncommittee chairman, Senator Menendez, and all the other members of the \ncommittee who offered their contributions.\n  With this bill, we have the opportunity to preserve public \ntransportation funding for 2 years at current levels and deliver \ncritical investments in the Nation's aging transportation \ninfrastructure. In addition, the bill will institute much needed \nreforms, such as eliminating earmarks and speeding the construction of \npublic transportation projects. The bill also includes transit safety \nprovisions that have been stalled for 2 years. These are important \nreforms that many Senators have worked on. Now is the time to move them \nforward.\n  Finally, our bill increases formula funding for all types of transit: \nadditional urban and rural funds, new money for every State to address \nthe state of good repair needs and more money for tribal transit. Our \nNation's transit systems need more than $77 billion to address \nbacklogged repairs. This bill cannot address all those needs, but it \ncan ensure that our transit systems don't fall further behind, and \ntransit funding will support more than 386,000 jobs.\n  Americans make 35 million trips on public transit every weekday. Many \nof these trips are in our cities, but in places such as South Dakota \nrural transit service connects seniors with their doctors and helps the \nworkers travel long distances to get to jobs. Everyone benefits from \npublic transportation, and I urge Senators to support this bipartisan \nbill.\n  I yield the floor for the ranking member of the Banking Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation to \nreauthorize the surface transportation bill, and, in particular, the \nFederal Public Transportation Act of 2012, which is the transit \namendment before us today.\n  While we are nearly 3 years beyond the September 2009 expiration date \nof SAFETEA, I am pleased we are finally moving one step closer to \nlegislation that would allow infrastructure investments to move \nforward.\n  Chairman Johnson and I worked together to produce bipartisan \nlegislation that eliminates outdated, inefficient programs and promotes \ngreater efficiency and effectiveness in public transportation systems \nall across America. The Federal Public Transportation Act passed the \nBanking Committee with unanimous support. This legislation before us \nreflected in the amendment currently under consideration maintains \nfunding for public transportation programs at $10.5 billion a year. \nUnlike previous reauthorization bills, the committee was unable to \nprovide an increase in the baseline funding amount for public \ntransportation. We were, however, able to provide a substantial \nincrease to existing programs by eliminating the bus discretionary \nprogram which previously contained earmarks totaling $984 million.\n  In fact, we did not just eliminate one account that included \nearmarks, we eliminated all earmarks that were previously included in \nthe reauthorization bill. These reforms have allowed us to provide \npublic transportation systems with an increase in their guaranteed \nformula funding over the next 2 years. In addition to providing a \nstable source of funding, I believe we must institute a system that \nensures greater accountability and encourages real investment in \nmaintaining our aging public transportation infrastructure all over \nAmerica.\n  This issue, also known as state of good repair, is extremely \nimportant for public transportation, and our amendment makes it an \nintegral part of the transit programs. The new starts process has \nundergone significant reforms in order to streamline and to improve \ndelivery of capital investment projects. It also includes a new pilot \nproject with the sole purpose of expediting project approval and \nattracting private investment.\n  Setting aside, for a moment, the specific issues related to this \namendment, I wish to speak briefly to what I believe is the most \nsignificant issue surrounding the reauthorization of SAFETEA--the \nsolvency of the highway trust fund. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the mass transit account of the highway trust fund will \nend in 2013 with $2.8 billion--$6 billion short of what it will need to \ncontinue to meet its obligations resulting from this reauthorization \nbill before us. While the Senate is considering a 2-year authorization \nbill, others have advocated a longer term reauthorization. The length \nof the reauthorization is not as important, however, as the need to pay \nfor all this spending before us.\n  I believe most Americans would agree that a reauthorization bill that \nleaves the program insolvent or near insolvency upon its expiration \nwould be irresponsible. I hope this is not what we are doing with this \nbill. Infrastructure spending is essential to our long-term economic \nstability and growth in this country. Nevertheless, this country cannot \ncontinue to deficit spend its way out of its problems for \ninfrastructure or anything else. Therefore, I think we must begin this \ndiscussion with the realization that difficult decisions are going to \nhave to be made, and for our part I believe the Banking Committee has \nbegun to make some of these difficult decisions by providing level \nfunding and eliminating unnecessary earmarks from the program \nstructures.\n  I look forward to continuing this debate and moving one step closer \nto completing a responsible and paid-for reauthorization bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me begin by recognizing the hard \nwork and dedication of my friend from South Dakota, Chairman Johnson, \nand for his tireless leadership on this legislation\n\n[[Page S595]]\n\nthat made this possible. Let me also recognize the ranking member, \nSenator Shelby, for his efforts to work in an incredibly positive, \ncooperative, and bipartisan manner that, in fact, created the ultimate \nresult of a unanimous bipartisan vote, something we would love to see \nmore of these days. It was his work, along with the chairman's, that \ngot us to that point. I am glad to have been added to that as the \nsubcommittee chair as well.\n  Millions of Americans take over 10 billion transit trips a year. It \nhas taken over 2 years of hard work, and it is part of an overall bill \nthat creates or saves 2 million jobs, but those trips and the jobs that \nget created by it and the opportunity of people to get to employment, \nto get to a hospital, to go see family and friends are incredibly \nimportant in the context of our national economy. At a time when job \ncreation is essential, it invests in every State to keep us competitive \nas a nation in the global marketplace.\n  Under this legislation, for example, my home State of New Jersey \nstands to receive about $519 million in Federal transit funding without \nany increase in Federal spending. This bill cuts waste and eliminates \nearmarks so New Jersey will see benefits from a $63 million increase in \ntransit funding, more transit funding than in any previous year. This \nbill invests in our infrastructure and improves public transportation \nwithout increasing the Federal budget, and it provides more funds to \nmake the improvements they need to ease congestion and mitigate \ntransportation delays. It is good for America because it will help \ncommunities concentrate on smart growth around transit hubs that mirror \nmy Livable Communities Act and my State's Transit Village Program that \nwill help make New Jersey attractive to businesses and a model job \ncreation hub. It can do that for other communities throughout the \nNation.\n  It is good because it is energy smart and increases competitive \nfunding for clean fuel transit vehicles to help agencies to switch from \ndirty, expensive fuels to cleaner, cheaper fuels. It not only \nstreamlines the process for Federal approval of new transit projects, \nbut it will help upgrade older systems by adding a new station or \nanother track or a bigger train car to increase capacity rather than \nhaving to build new systems from scratch.\n  It also includes a provision establishing a program to allow public \ntransportation providers temporary flexibility during periods of high \nunemployment to use a limited portion of their Federal funds for up to \n2 years, provided they meet the established criteria for operating \nexpenses.\n  One last but perhaps most important thing the bill accomplishes is to \nprovide for a strong Federal role in transit safety oversight by \nestablishing a national public transportation safety plan to improve \nthe safety of all public transportation systems that receive Federal \nfunding.\n  Under this legislation, the Secretary will develop minimum \nperformance standards for vehicles used in public transportation and \nestablish a training program for Federal and State employees who \nconduct safety audits of public transportation systems. Fundamentally, \nthis bill improves the effectiveness of State safety oversight \nagencies, increases Federal funding for safety, and provides new \nenforcement authority over public transportation safety to the \nSecretary of Transportation.\n  At the end of the day, making our transit system as safe as humanly \npossible in every State, from coast to coast, must be a national \npriority.\n  So let me conclude by saying, once again, thanks to Senators Johnson \nand Shelby for their leadership over the last 2 years. I think the bill \nis a victory for every American community. It is a commonsense \ninvestment that will create jobs, keep this Nation competitive, and \nmake our communities more productive, accessible, and livable. It is a \nvictory for those who believe we can create jobs, get people back to \nwork, and keep us on the cutting edge of the global economy.\n  So now we need to make sure we continue to reach across the aisle, as \nthe chairman and the ranking member and I have done during this \nprocess, and get this investment in America's future to the President's \ndesk and signed into law as soon as possible.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S595-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                    Arizona's Centennial Celebration\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an important \nmilestone in our Nation's history.\n  On February 14, 1912, Arizona officially became the 48th member of \nthese 50 United States. I am proud to salute my home State on this her \ncentennial celebration.\n  Yes, we were the last of the contiguous 48 States to join, but we \nwere certainly not the least of them. Today I would like to tell you \njust a little bit about why I say that is so.\n  Arizona is not the largest or the oldest member of the Union. It did \nnot participate in the Revolutionary War. It does not border an ocean \nor one of the Great Lakes. The Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution do not bear a single Arizonan signature. Yet there is \nsomething about Arizona that is great, something that truly sets the \nGrand Canyon State apart from the rest. The Grand Canyon, of course, \ncomes to mind.\n  I would like to quote one of America's most famous explorers, John \nWesley Powell, who once said:\n\n       The wonders of the Grand Canyon cannot be adequately \n     represented in symbols of speech, nor by speech itself. The \n     resources of the graphic art are taxed beyond their powers in \n     attempting to portray its features. Language and illustration \n     combined must fail.\n\n  I agree. I have hiked the Grand Canyon. I have seen it from above, \nand I have seen it from below. Words literally cannot describe its \npower or its beauty. That is why every year millions of tourists come \nfrom all corners of our Nation and from across the Atlantic and the \nPacific to experience the majesty we are fortunate enough to have right \nthere in our own backyard.\n  But as big as it is, the Grand Canyon is just a small part of the \nArizona story. There are the Sedona Red Rocks, the beautiful White \nMountains, the Painted Desert, the Petrified Forest, Monument Valley, \nSaguaro National Park, the 12,000-foot San Francisco Peaks, and \ncountless other natural wonders that span across our deserts and \nthrough our forests. There are almost 4,000 peaks and summits in our \nState alone.\n  Arizona is also home to manmade marvels, including innovative \nprojects that have allowed much needed freshwater to flow to our \ncommunities. These include the Hoover Dam, the Glen Canyon Dam, the \nCentral Arizona Project, the Salt River Project and its keystone \nelement, and the Theodore Roosevelt Dam.\n  Arizonans share the land with owls, ocelots, and eagles, jaguars, \nlots of rattlesnakes, and falcons. Our landscape is foliated not just \nwith agave and cacti but with majestic aspen, fir, and spruce and the \nlargest Ponderosa pine forest in the world.\n  We are rich in natural resources. From an early age, all Arizonans \nlearn about the State's five Cs: copper, cattle, cotton, citrus, and \nclimate.\n  Copper. The mineral that attracted many Arizonans to our State in the \nfirst place has been used by American Indians in tool and weaponmaking \nfor centuries. Today, Arizona produces more copper than every other \nState combined, and it is now being used to develop the alternative \nenergy technologies and vehicles of tomorrow.\n  Cattle. Along with sheep and hogs, the ranching of cattle is deeply \nimprinted on our State's cowboy culture and continues to help drive our \neconomy today.\n  Cotton. One of our most important cash crops at the turn of the last \ncentury, cotton is still an important industry in our State. This crop, \nincluding our very own Pima long-staple variety, is used to produce the \nclothing, fertilizer, fuel, and cooking oil used by millions of \nAmericans every day.\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\n  Citrus. The harvesting of fruits such as lemons and oranges is one of \nthe important elements of Arizona's agricultural industry, with a \nhistory that runs deep in our State. We now export about $40 million in \nfruits and preparations every year.\n  Climate. Arizona mornings are warm and filled with sunshine, and our \nsunsets are the best anywhere. We may not always have a white \nChristmas, but we do have a booming tourism industry that attracts \nnearly 37 million--we call them snowbirds, conservationists, and \nadventurers--every year.\n  These five Cs, along with the natural treasures I mentioned earlier, \nare the physical expression of our State motto: ``Ditat Deus'' or ``God \nEnriches.'' Because of this, Arizonans are fiercely protective of the \necological riches that exist around them.\n  We honor nature for its beauty, but we also respect it for its power. \nI do not need to tell you about Arizona's heat. Some of my colleagues \nin this Chamber are known to complain when it reaches 80 degrees in \nWashington. Well, we Arizonans start to get warm when the mercury hits \n120. It gets cold at night too. In fact, Arizona can yield the Nation's \nhighest and lowest temperatures in the very same day.\n\n  There are forest fires. Last summer, we saw the largest such fire in \nour history, the Wallow megafire, burn more than 840 square miles of \nour treasured landscape. But we have picked ourselves up, and we are \nrebuilding--just like we always do. The lessons we have learned from \nthe Wallow fire will help us defend against similar megafires in the \nfuture.\n  Some of Arizona's forebears were the prospectors and the ranchers who \ngave up everything for a chance at a better life. Some were the \nadventurers and cowboys who thrived on freedom and danger. Some of us \ncan trace our history directly back to the Spanish missionaries or to \nour longstanding dynamic Hispanic community that has so greatly \ninfluenced our distinctive culture and cuisine. Many of us are direct \ndescendants of the very first Arizonans--the 21 great American Indian \ntribes who continue to teach us important lessons about working with \nrather than against the expansive natural beauty and danger that \nsurrounds us.\n  These are Arizona's founding fathers. While each has influenced our \nState in a unique way, all share these common traits: a strong sense of \nindependence and a willingness to persevere against the odds.\n  That is, I believe, one of the reasons Arizona has such outsized \nnational influence compared to its relatively small size and \npopulation. Indeed, the fierce wind of independence that rolls across \nour desert landscape has propelled not one but two of our leaders to \nnational political prominence in just the past few decades. We may not \nhave had an Arizonan in the White House--yet--but there are few States \nthat can boast a single 20th or 21st century major party Presidential \nnominee, let alone two in our Barry Goldwater and John McCain.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle will no doubt recall their \nvery able Senate majority leader from Arizona, Ernest McFarland. They \nwill also remember Representative Mo Udall and Senator Carl Hayden, who \nserved an amazing 57 years in Congress, 42 of them in this Chamber \nalone. To put that into perspective, that is longer than Arizona's \nsenior Senator and I have served in the Congress combined.\n  Our State has both nurtured and welcomed respected jurists such as \nWilliam Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor, world-renowned architects \nsuch as Frank Lloyd Wright, entertainers such as Waylon Jennings, Linda \nRonstadt, and Glen Campbell--even Stephenie Meyer, author of the \nTwilight series. Also, of course, I would be remiss if I neglected \nSteven Spielberg. He, too, embraced Arizona's adventurous, \nentrepreneurial spirit, turning his teenage moviemaking hobby in \nScottsdale and Phoenix into a multimillion-dollar Hollywood empire. Had \nhe been raised in another State, one without our Arizona spirit, would \nthe world have known classics today such as ``ET'' and ``Jaws''? We may \nnever know.\n  One thing we do know is that Arizona also gave rise to the Navajo \nCode Talkers. It is a shame more Americans are not aware of the \ntalkers' incredible story. Their official Web site puts it this way:\n\n       It is a great American story that is still largely \n     unknown--the story of a group of young Navajo men who \n     answered the call of duty, who performed a service no one \n     else could, and in the process became great warriors and \n     patriots. Their unbreakable code saved thousands of lives and \n     helped end World War II.\n\n  Their code, of course, was the Navajo language.\n  Some of those young men were simple sheepherders on Arizona's great \nNavajo reservation until our Nation called them to serve. They did so \nwith honor. They became American heroes in the process. Without them, \nwe may never have achieved victory in the Pacific theater, and I am \nproud to pay tribute to these warriors today. Arizona honors them, and \nevery American owes the Code Talkers a debt of gratitude.\n  These are just some of the many reasons I am proud to call myself an \nArizonian. I was not born in Arizona. I became one by choice, and it \nwas one of the most consequential decisions I ever made. I came as a \nyoung man to attend the University of Arizona. There I met my wife \nCarol, and together we raised two children, both of whom I am proud to \nsay learned their five Cs from a very early age. I have not left \nArizona since my days at the University of Arizona, nor do I think I \never would or could. There is something about the beauty that \nsurrounds, the spirit that encompasses, the Sun that paints the \nlandscape every morning. There is something different about Arizona, \nand I am proud of that difference. We are a special people with a \ndistinctive place in the American mosaic.\n  I offer my congratulations to our Governor Jan Brewer, to my Arizona \ncolleagues in the House and Senate, and to my constituents throughout \nour State on this historic centennial anniversary.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my distinct privilege to join with \nmy beloved friend Jon Kyl to speak in honor of the centennial \nanniversary of Arizona statehood. One hundred years ago, on February \n14, 1912, the State of Arizona was officially admitted to the Union, \neffectively completing the contiguous lower 48 States. Americans today \nrecognize Arizona as the thriving center of the Sunbelt, known for its \nability to attract businesses, manufacturing, and tourists from around \nthe world. The Valley of the Sun alone supports about 4 million people, \nand our State capital--Phoenix--is the Nation's sixth largest city.\n  Compared to its humble beginnings, Arizona has enjoyed tremendous \ngrowth and productivity, but this was not always so. Arizona's history \nbegan over 10,000 years ago with the migration of early Native American \ntribes to the region. For centuries, the Anasazi, Hohokam, and other \npeoples flourished in the forested highlands and Sonoran Desert \nlowlands. Many of the Indian tribes in Arizona today are the proud \ndescendants of those ancient peoples.\n  It was not until 1528, with the arrival of Spanish missionaries and \nconquistadors in the towns of Tubac and Tucson, that the land and \npeople were first reshaped. Spanish colonization eventually gave way to \nMexican independence in 1821.\n  In 1848 the Mexican-American War concluded, with Mexico ceding much \nof Arizona to the United States.\n  In 1853 President Franklin Pierce saw an opportunity to build a \ntranscontinental railroad connecting the South with southern California \nand purchased the remaining bottom half of the Arizona Territory from \nMexico for $10 million--what today would be the equivalent of $244 \nmillion. It was around this time that American pioneers began to settle \nthe towns of Prescott, Flagstaff, picturesque Sedona and Yuma, the \ngateway to gold-rich California.\n  During the Civil War, Arizona became a short-lived strategic interest\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\nfor the Confederacy. The war's western-most battle was fought in \nArizona at Picacho Peak, about 50 miles north of Tucson. It reportedly \nlasted 90 minutes and involved about 25 solders.\n  In the years that followed, cattlemen and mining speculators flocked \nto develop Arizona's natural resources in towns such as Tombstone, \nBisbee, Show Low, and St. John's, the birthplace of our late and \nbeloved Morris Udall. The boundaries of the State soon began to take \nshape thanks to explorers such as John Wesley Powell, whose famous 3-\nmonth expedition down the mighty Colorado charted the first known \npassage through the Grand Canyon.\n  Efforts in Congress to pass statehood began around the turn of the \n20th century. One proposal sought to combine the territories of Arizona \nand New Mexico into one massive State. But Arizona settlers would have \nnone of it, and it is unlikely that the people of New Mexico were all \ntoo excited about the plan either.\n  At the time, many outsiders did not fully appreciate Arizona's \nuntapped potential. They considered it nothing more than a desert \nwasteland, economically desolate and virtually uninhabitable. One of \nArizona's first territorial representatives, Henry Ashurst, is known to \nhave risen in Congress to argue that ``all that Arizona needs to \nflourish is good people and water,'' to which an east cost Member \nsupposedly retorted, ``You could say the same about hell.''\n  Arizonans eventually succeeded in convincing Congress to grant \nstatehood. This was partially due to the construction of the Theodore \nRoosevelt Dam in 1903, as part of the Salt River project in Phoenix, \none of the Nation's first Federal reclamation projects. The Roosevelt \nDam channeled lifegiving water from the Salt River into a series of \nirrigation canals that overlay a canal network dug by the Hohokam \nIndians more than 1,000 years prior. Fueled by irrigation water and \nhydroelectric power, the small community of Phoenix, which started as a \ncavalry hay camp at Fort McDowell, began its rise to national \nprominence.\n  My predecessor in the Senate, the late Senator Barry Goldwater, is \namong Arizona's most celebrated statesmen, having served five terms in \nthis body. He was born in Phoenix when Arizona was still a territory \nand witnessed remarkable changes to the Grand Canyon State throughout \nhis lifetime.\n  The Smithsonian magazine recently republished an op-ed Goldwater \nwrote in 1962 called ``Arizona's Next Fifty years'' where he imagines \nwhat Arizona would look like by 2012. Keep in mind that Arizona had \nbarely 1 million people living across the entire State in the 1960s. \nModern air-conditioning technology was relatively new, and the 1,500 \nmiles of interstate crisscrossing the State today was still on the \ndrawing board. Yet Goldwater correctly predicted a rapid population \ngrowth, comparing Phoenix to other major U.S. cities. I would like to \nshare some of his predictions. He wrote:\n\n       It will be the deserts that will support the majority of \n     the new homes. Phoenix will have a population of about three \n     million and Tucson will grow to about one and one-half \n     million. Phoenix and Tucson will remain the two largest \n     cities in the state, with Phoenix being either the fourth or \n     sixth largest city in the United States. The growth of \n     Glendale, Peoria and Avondale will parallel that of Phoenix \n     proper, so that 50 years from now, all of these cities will \n     be contiguous with each other and with Phoenix, and will form \n     a city complex not unlike the present city of Los Angeles.\n\n  Anyone who has flown into Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport \ncan see from the sky, day or night, the infinite grid-like layout of \nthe metro Phoenix area. Senator Goldwater understood that this kind of \ndevelopment would fundamentally alter how Arizonans relate to the \ndesert, writing:\n\n       The man of 2012 would not be able to walk from his doorstep \n     into this pastel paradise with its saguaro, the mesquite, the \n     leap of a jackrabbit . . . or the smell of freshly wet \n     greasewood, because people will have transgressed on the \n     desert for homesites to accommodate a population of slightly \n     over 10 million people. The forests will be protected, as \n     well as our parks and monuments. But even they will have as \n     neighbors the people who today enjoy hardships to visit them.\n\n  Despite the challenges of increased demand on our natural resources, \nSenator Goldwater correctly believed that the State would mature into a \nmodern, industrious economy with global connections. He said:\n\n       Arizona's principal economic growth will be in the \n     industrial field, with emphasis being on items of a \n     technological nature. It will not be many years before \n     industry will become an important part of the economies of \n     most Arizona cities, whereas today it is more or less \n     confined to a few. Arizona will continue to be the haven for \n     people who seek an outlet for initiative and a reward for \n     work. The frontier challenges will exist then as they do \n     today, for man's progress never stops unless man stops it. \n     Fortunately for our State, our men have always and will \n     always want to go forward, not backward.\n\n  So what is Arizona today? Arizona's open skies and fair climate offer \nthe U.S. military an ideal training environment for our soldiers and \nhigh-tech combat systems. Luke Air Force Base outside of Phoenix will \nbe home to the F-35 fighter jet, the most advanced fighter in the \nworld. The U.S. Army Intelligence Center is located at Fort Huachuca in \nsouthern Arizona, where UAV training serves a unique and irreplaceable \nnational security mission. Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, \nthe Nation's premier A-10 Warthog base, hosts an array of special \noperations aircraft and will hopefully continue to grow in support of \nour military's drone fleet. Across the highway, Arizonans in the Air \nNational Guard fly the newest F-16s to train foreign pilots from over \n20 countries, and virtually every Marine Corps fixed-wing squadron that \nparticipated in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm underwent \npredeployment training at Yuma Marine Corps Station. Arizona is also \nhome to nearly 600,000 veterans, many of whom have returned to their \nfamilies and loved ones from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  More copper is mined in Arizona than all of the other States \ncombined, and the Morenci Mine is the largest copper producer in all of \nNorth America.\n  Two of the country's largest manmade lakes are in Arizona, Lake \nPowell and Lake Mead--the result of Hoover Dam--which supply drinking \nwater to over 25 million people in Arizona, Nevada, and California.\n  Yuma, AZ, an agricultural powerhouse, produces about 90 percent of \nthe country's winter vegetables. The lettuce in your salad this month \nalmost certainly came from Arizona.\n  We operate the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, located about \n55 miles west of Phoenix, which generates more electricity than any \nother powerplant in the Nation.\n  It is home to three major State universities: Arizona State \nUniversity, the University of Arizona, and Northern Arizona University, \nwith an undergraduate and graduate population of over 130,000.\n  Arizona is a leader in manufacturing information, medical, and \ndefense technologies. We are headquarters to TGen, the Translational \nGenomics Research Institute, which conducts cutting-edge genetic \nresearch with the goal of curing Alzheimer's, autism, Parkinson's, and \nnumerous forms of cancer.\n  We support critical scientific endeavors to discover our place in the \nuniverse: Arizona's unique landscapes, such as Meteor Crater and the \nPainted Desert, once played a key role in the NASA Apollo training \nmissions. The world's largest solar telescope is located at Kitt Peak \nNational Observatory in Sells, AZ. The University of Arizona is \nactively involved in the Cassini, Mars Lander, and Mars Rover missions, \nas well as NASA's Osiris-Rex mission, which will be the first \nspacecraft to land on an asteroid and return a sample to Earth.\n  It is also believed that the chimichanga has its origins in Arizona, \nalthough its exact hometown is still a matter of vigorous historical \ndebate among locals.\n  I am immensely proud of Arizona's rich history, and I am humbled to \nrepresent a State that has earned a special place in the American \nconsciousness. Even when I travel overseas, it is seldom I meet an \nindividual who doesn't know where the Grand Canyon is or isn't \ncaptivated by the tales of the Old West or doesn't admire the rugged \nindividualism of Arizona's frontiersmen. I cannot presume to exercise \nthe kind of predictive abilities that Senator Goldwater displayed in \nhis article. All I can say is that Arizona's future is perhaps best \nprophesized by reflecting on our legacy--judging our achievements \nagainst our intrepid beginnings. For as\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\nlong as Arizona stays true to the pioneer spirit, I believe her best \ndays are yet to come.\n  If I might ask the indulgence to read a short piece that I put in a \nforward to a book by Lisa Schnebly Heidinger, ``Arizona: 100 Years \nGrand,'' the official book of Arizona's Centennial:\n\n       Near the end of his life, Barry Goldwater tried to describe \n     to an interviewer his affection for Arizona. He started to \n     identify some of the many natural wonders so beloved by \n     Arizonans when he became emotional. `Arizona,' he proclaimed, \n     `is 113,400 square miles of heaven that God cut out.' \n     Fighting back tears, and unable to continue at length, he \n     managed only to add, `I love it so much.'\n       For much of my life I had been rootless. My father was a \n     naval officer and my childhood was an itinerant one as we \n     moved from one base to another more times than I can \n     enumerate. Following in his footsteps, I, too, made my home \n     in the United States Navy, and the only place I lived for \n     more than a year or two was an unexpectedly lengthy stay in a \n     foreign country that would not let me leave and would have \n     preferred I had never come.\n       Except for that period of involuntary residence, I had \n     always lived my life on the move, part of a tradition that \n     compensated me in other ways for the hometown it denied me. I \n     had no connection to one place; no safe harbor where I could \n     rest without care. Landscapes and characters all passed too \n     quickly to form the attachments of shared history and love \n     that calm your heart when age finally cages your \n     restlessness.\n       I was nearly forty-five years old before I could claim a \n     hometown. My ambitions brought me to Arizona, and my work \n     keeps me away from here for more than half my time. But \n     Arizona has given me a home, and in the thirty years that \n     have passed since I moved here, it has worked its magic on me \n     and enchanted me and claimed me.\n       In those thirty years I've been to almost every community \n     that Arizonans carved from the wilderness and made thrive: \n     places that have never stopped growing; and places where \n     opportunities were exhausted and were abandoned to history; \n     and places that rose and declined and were re-imagined and \n     made to prosper again by the hard working, self starting \n     dreamers Arizona attracts in such large numbers. I've \n     marveled at the resourcefulness and vision of generations of \n     Arizonans in Yuma and Page, Jerome and Kingman, Bisbee and \n     Flagstaff, who knew success and failure, who struggled, \n     achieved, lost and struggled again to build from their \n     freedom and opportunities in the challenging and beautiful \n     places that had won their hearts, strong, prospering and \n     decent communities.\n       At the end of every election, I've stood on the courthouse \n     steps in Prescott, our old territorial capital, and thought \n     of the pioneering families whose names still resonate in \n     contemporary public affairs like Udall and Goldwater. I look \n     at the Bucky O'Neill monument, that memorial to the Rough \n     Riders of whom he was among the roughest and bravest, and \n     remember the names of Arizonans, of every station and walk of \n     life, who risked everything so that the freedom Arizonans \n     cherish so dearly and make such good use of would be \n     birthright of all; names like Frank Luke and Ira Hayes, Lori \n     Piestewa and Pat Tillman.\n       I've experienced every scene of spectacular beauty this \n     blessed, bountiful, beautiful state possesses. I've hiked \n     Canyon de Chelly, Chiricahua, and rim to rim in the greatest \n     of our natural wonders, the Grand Canyon. I've rafted down \n     the Colorado. I've walked the trails of Saguaro National \n     Park; been struck mute by the awe-inspiring landscape of \n     Monument Valley; and spent countless happy hours following \n     hidden paths in our wilderness areas. I've houseboated on \n     Lake Powell. Many times, I've driven through the desert in \n     spring after a wet winter and felt myself become emotional as \n     I marveled at the profusion of vivid colors, the mesmerizing \n     beauty of desert wildflowers in bloom.\n       We have a home between Cottonwood and Sedona, to where my \n     family escapes whenever we have the chance. It's on a bend of \n     Oak Creek, surrounded by hills, a ghost ranch and Indian \n     caves, adorned by fruit orchards and roses, and shaded by \n     tall cottonwoods and sycamores. So many species of birds make \n     their home there I have lost count of them. Common black \n     hawks return annually to their nest in the sycamore beneath \n     which I drink my morning coffee and give thanks for the \n     blessing of living in such natural splendor. I have never in \n     my life loved a place more. And when my public life is over, \n     I will spend the remainder of my days there giving thanks, \n     and enjoying the happiness of belonging to someplace so \n     beautiful, smaller and more intimate than a nation that spans \n     a continent.\n       The State of Arizona is approaching its centennial. A \n     hundred years of audacious and difficult undertakings, of \n     dreams won and lost and sought again, of progress and \n     struggle and resilience. It's a rough and tumble history; \n     colorful, heroic, bold and inspiring, like the character of \n     the people who made it. You'll see it celebrated \n     appropriately in this splendid book. And you'll glimpse the \n     future that today's Arizonans, the dreamers and risk takers, \n     lovers of freedom, captivated by the stunning landscapes and \n     resilient, enterprising communities that have worked their \n     magic on them, will build. It will be a future worthy of our \n     predecessors' achievements and legacies; a future of \n     adversity overcome and opportunities for all. We will change, \n     as all places do. Others will come, as I once came, to make a \n     new home or find the only home they ever really had in towns \n     and cities and rural communities that will be better for \n     their presence and contributions. They will face the \n     challenges of their time and experience unexpected setbacks \n     but they will stick with it, work harder, dream bigger and \n     prevail. And a hundred years from now, their history, \n     character and accomplishments will inspire their fortunate \n     descendents and the newcomers who will come here to live in \n     beauty and make the most of their lives.\n       We will change, but the values and beauty we treasure will \n     remain intact. Arizona is 113,400 square miles of heaven that \n     God cut out and Arizonans mean to keep it so. We love it that \n     much.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Rockefeller \npertaining to the introduction of S. 2105 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Republican Senators delayed a final vote on \nthe nomination of Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida even though the \nSenate voted 89-5 last night to end a Republican filibuster that has \nalready prevented a vote for 4 months. This is a consensus nominee who \nSenator Nelson has been strongly supporting and who Senator Rubio also \nsupports. He should have been confirmed 4 months ago. He should have \nbeen confirmed last night after the overwhelming cloture vote. Instead, \nobstruction needlessly delayed the Senate acting to fill the emergency \njudicial vacancy on the Eleventh Circuit.\n  Senator Nelson has worked hard for this nomination, working to get \nJudge Jordan's nomination cleared by every Democratic Senator in \nOctober immediately after it was reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee. We were ready to vote in October. We were ready to vote in \nNovember. We were ready to vote before the end of the last session of \nCongress in December. It is hard to believe that it is now the middle \nof February, over 4 months after Judge Jordan's nomination was reported \nwith the support of every Democrat and every Republican on the \nJudiciary Committee, and the Senate still has not voted to fill this \njudicial emergency vacancy affecting the people of Florida, Georgia and \nAlabama. I appreciate why Senator Nelson is frustrated. I understand \nwhy Hispanics for a Fair Judiciary and the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation are, too.\n  Let me refer to some of the reporting on this. One post begins:\n\n       So, here's the absurdity of our judicial confirmation \n     process--the full Senate voted 89-5 to invoke cloture, \n     meaning that Judge Jordan's nomination to the 11th Circuit \n     would finally come to a vote. But then Senator Nelson said \n     that one Senator is holding up the merits vote by demanding \n     30 more hours of `debate' post-cloture. Senators Leahy and \n     Boxer both then commented how ridiculous such a request was, \n     but that's the way it is. It looks like we'll have [to] wait \n     another 30 hours for Judge Jordan to move up to the 11th. \n     Silliness in our Congress . . . .\n\n  The article in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports:\n\n       South Florida lawyers praise him. Both of Florida's U.S. \n     senators have recommended him. And the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee voted unanimously to approve his nomination.\n       But U.S. District Judge Adalberto Jordan of South Florida \n     has been blocked for four months from rising to the 11th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, the latest sign of a polarized and \n     dysfunctional Senate.\n       A Senate filibuster that has kept Jordan waiting and the \n     appellate court undermanned fizzled on Monday when the Senate \n     voted 89-5 to move toward a final confirmation vote.\n       But Jordan is still waiting because one senator . . . \n     objected to attempts to complete action on Monday . . . .\n\n  I have not heard from any Republican Senators objecting to this Judge \nexplaining what they find wrong with this highly-qualified Cuban \nAmerican. I am at a loss as to why Republican Senators continue to \ndelay a vote on this outstanding nominee. This nominee is beyond \nreproach. This is another nomination battle that has nothing to do with \nthe nominee and his qualifications. This is another example of \nobstruction based on a collateral objective. The people of Florida, \nGeorgia and Alabama should not be made to suffer a judicial emergency \nvacancy\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\nwhen this highly-qualified nominee should be confirmed without further \ndelay. Nor did anyone come forward to explain the Senate Republicans' \ndelay for the last 4 months. Cloture has been invoked by the Senate and \nthe filibuster will be ended. There was no good reason to continue to \nhold up a vote that has already been delayed for 4 months.\n  When I first became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2001, I \nfollowed a time when Senate Republicans, who had been in the majority, \nhad pocket filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial \nnominations, blocking them with secret holds in backrooms and \ncloakrooms, obstructing more with winks and nods, but with little to no \npublic explanation or accountability. I worked hard to change that and \nto open up the process. I sought to bring daylight to the process by \nmaking the consultation with home State Senators public so that the \nSenate Republicans' abuses during the Clinton years would not be \nrepeated.\n  When Senate Democrats opposed some of President Bush's most \nideological nominees, we did so openly, saying why we opposed them. And \nwhen there were consensus nominees--nominees with the support of both \nDemocrats and Republicans--we moved them quickly so they could begin \nserving the American people. That is how we reduced vacancies in the \nPresidential election years of 2004 and 2008 to the lowest levels in \ndecades. That is how we confirmed 205 of President Bush's judicial \nnominees in his first term.\n  Now we see the reverse of how we treated President Bush's nominees. \nSenate Republicans do not move quickly to consider consensus nominees, \nlike the 15 still on the Senate calendar that were reported unanimously \nlast year and should have had a Senate vote last year. Instead, as we \nare seeing today and have seen all too often, Senate Republicans \nobstruct and delay even consensus nominees, leaving us 45 judicial \nnominees behind the pace we set for confirming President Bush's \njudicial nominees. That is why vacancies remain so high, at 86, over 3 \nyears into President Obama's first term. Vacancies are nearly double \nwhat they were at this point in President Bush's third year. That is \nwhy half of all Americans--nearly 160 million--live in circuits or \ndistricts with a judicial vacancy that could have a judge if Senate \nRepublicans would only consent to vote on judicial nominees that have \nbeen favorably voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee and have been \non the Senate executive calendar since last year.\n  This is an area where we should be working for the American people, \nand putting their needs first. This is a nomination that has the strong \nand committed support of the senior Senator from Florida, Senator \nNelson, as well as that of Senator Rubio, Florida's Republican Senator. \nJudge Jordan had the unanimous support of every Republican and every \nDemocrat on the Judiciary Committee when we voted last October, \nalthough one Republican switched his vote last night to support the \nfilibuster of Judge Jordan's nomination. This is the nomination of a \njudge, Judge Jordan, who was confirmed to the district court by a vote \nof 93 to one in 1999, even while Senate Republicans were pocket \nfilibustering more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees.\n  I regret that Republican Senators chose to delay a final vote on \nJudge Jordan's confirmation. He is a fine man who, after emigrating \nfrom Havana, Cuba at the age of 6 went on to graduate summa cum laude \nfrom the University of Miami law school and clerk for Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. He served as Federal prosecutor \nand Federal judge. The needless delay of Judge Jordan's confirmation is \nan example of the harmful tactics that have all but paralyzed the \nSenate confirmation process and are damaging our Federal courts.\n  It should not take 4 months and require a cloture motion to proceed \nto a nomination such as that of Judge Jordan to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the Eleventh Circuit. It should not take more \nmonths and more cloture motions before the Senate finally votes on the \nnearly 20 other superbly-qualified judicial nominees who have been \nstalled by Senate Republicans for months while vacancies continue to \nplague our Federal courts and delay justice for the American people. \nThe American people need and deserve Federal courts ready to serve \nthem, not empty benches and long delays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S599-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S599-S609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly to comments of \nthe junior Senator from Kentucky earlier today regarding his amendment \nto cut off all U.S. aid for Egypt.\n  First, let's take a step back. The new conditions on military aid for \nEgypt, which I wrote with Senator Lindsey Graham and were signed into \nlaw just 2 months ago, require a certification by the Secretary of \nState that the Egyptian military is supporting the transition to \ncivilian government and protecting fundamental freedoms and due \nprocess. If the crisis involving the nongovernmental organizations \nwhose offices were raided and are now facing criminal charges is not \nresolved satisfactorily, there is no way the certification can be made \nand Egypt will not receive $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid. But the \nLeahy-Graham conditions give the Administration flexibility to respond \nto this crisis. If we take a leap into the lurch and adopt the Paul \nAmendment, we risk causing a backlash and the opposite reaction of what \nwe want.\n  It is ironic that the junior Senator from Kentucky, who is now \ninsisting on a vote on his amendment to cut off all aid--not just \nmilitary aid but also economic aid--did not even vote for the Omnibus \nbill that contained the Leahy-Graham certification requirement. For him \nit is all or nothing, but the real world is not so black and white.\n  No one disagrees with the goals of the Paul Amendment. Its purpose is \nno different than the Leahy-Graham provision in current law that has \ncaused the suspension of military aid. We are all outraged by the \ncrackdown against the NGOs. We want the charges dropped and their \nproperty returned so they can resume their pro-democracy work. But the \nscope of the Paul Amendment is so sweeping that it could backfire and \nmake the situation immeasurably worse: The amendment cuts off all U.S. \naid to Egypt--current and prior year--including hundreds of millions of \ndollars in economic aid and funding for anti-terrorism and \nnonproliferation programs. Aid that supports the Government of Egypt's \nability to interdict arms shipments to Gaza would be cut off.\n  There is much at stake: the fate of the 19 American citizens facing \ncriminal charges in Egypt; Egypt's continued adherence to the Israeli-\nEgyptian Peace Agreement could be jeopardized; over-flights for U.S. \nmilitary aircraft; access to the Suez Canal; and the potential for \nfurther crackdowns against Egyptian civil society organizations.\n  If the Administration were ignoring the certification requirement in \ncurrent law I might vote for this amendment, but they are not. In fact, \nthe NGOs have repeatedly praised the Administration's efforts on their \nbehalf. They have applauded the new leverage provided by the Leahy-\nGraham conditions. Both the State Department and the Pentagon are \nintensely focused on trying to resolve this. General Dempsey was just \nin Egypt meeting with top military officials about it.\n  If, over the coming days or weeks the situation continues to \ndeteriorate, we can revisit this. But I would urge the junior Senator \nfrom Kentucky to withdraw his amendment until such time and to refrain \nfrom obstructing other business of the Senate. Let us see how things \nplay out. Hopefully cooler heads will prevail. The Egyptian military \nwill recognize that these NGOs were doing nothing more than supporting \nthe transition to democracy in an appropriate and transparent manner, \nand the Egyptian military will agree that it is in Egypt's best \ninterest to preserve close relations with the United States.\n  I see other Senators on the floor, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this morning we had the Budget Committee \nhearing and the testimony of Mr. Zients, OMB Director, who works for \nthe President and prepared, under the President's direction, the budget \nthey submitted to Congress for the United States for fiscal year 2013 \nbeginning\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\nOctober 1. It is an important document. It is important because in it \nthe President lays out his plan for what this Nation needs to do not \njust this year but for 10 years, during a time in which our debt crisis \nremains the No. 1 threat to America. That is what the experts from the \nPresident's own debt commission told us--we have never faced a more \npredictable economic crisis if we don't change our course of borrowing. \nWe are now spending $3,700 billion a year and taking in $2,200 billion, \nborrowing 40 percent of what we spend. So it was an important hearing.\n  I was deeply disappointed that our new Director, Mr. Zients, seemed \nto be focused on one thing; that is, regurgitating the talking points \nhe had been provided and steadfastly avoiding answering simple, \nimportant questions put to him by members of the committee.\n  We have two members of the committee here who I think will be sharing \nremarks about what we talked about today and how we need to address our \ndebt crisis--Senator John Thune and Senator Kelly Ayotte. They were \nthere and participated and asked questions.\n  I think we all agree it was one of the worst witness performances in \nterms of being responsive to the questions that we have seen in our \ntime in the Senate. I hate to say that. I know he was told not to say \nanything, just to keep repeating the talking points. But when America \nis facing a financial crisis and you are asking the budget director \nfundamental, simple questions, you expect and have a right to expect \nanswers, not for me but for the American people. He does not work for \nthe Obama political campaign; Mr. Zients works for the American people. \nHe is a man who has access to the foot-thick, four-volume budget that \nwas sent out, and he helped write it. It was written under his \nsupervision. So we should be able to get straight answers immediately \nfrom this gentleman.\n  For example, I asked a simple question right off the bat: Does the \nPresident's budget spend more money than the agreement we reached last \nAugust over raising the debt limit for America? Does it spend more or \nless? And it went on for 4 minutes, and I kept repeating again and \nagain: Well, is it more or less? Finally, at some point he said the \nPresident's budget would spend less, and that is not accurate. It \nspends at least $1.5 trillion more. So the budget director can't get \nstraight whether or not the President's budget spends more and is $1.5 \ntrillion off? A trillion dollars is a lot of money. I felt strongly \nabout it.\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy \nwith my Republican colleagues for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see Senator Thune is here, and he has \nbeen through a lot of these matters and a lot of hearings during his \ntime as part of the leadership here in the Senate, and I would ask him \nhow he felt about the hearing this morning and the issues our country \nfaces.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member on \nthe Budget Committee for engaging in this discussion, and I am anxious \nto hear from our colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Ayotte. She was \nthere this morning and was able to ask questions of the witness, the \npanel we had in front of the Budget Committee.\n  I guess what struck me about listening to that discussion was just \nthe evasiveness we had from Mr. Zients and, in fact, as the Senator \nfrom Alabama has mentioned, his failure to respond to very direct \nquestions--not questions that are trick questions, questions that are \njust a matter of the facts.\n  I think what I was struck by too is that when he was asked about \nwhether the administration wanted Majority Leader Reid to bring the \nPresident's budget to the floor, he could not give a direct answer, and \nhis comments indicated that they would not be calling on the majority \nleader to bring the President's budget before the Senate. The other \nthing I was struck by is that the President's own budget chief could \nnot confirm or verify that the President has added already about $5 \ntrillion to the debt since taking office. Those were both things that \nseemed like very straightforward questions and should have been very \nstraightforward answers.\n  The fact is it is very difficult for him or any other official in \nthis administration to defend this budget. This budget is not a serious \nbudget, and even people on the other side, people in the media have all \npassed judgment and basically said that this is not the kind of budget \nthat takes on the challenges the country faces.\n  I would say to my colleagues that it is hard to take this seriously \nwhen they aren't serious about it, but they ought to be because these \nare serious times. We live in a time where we are running a $15 \ntrillion debt. This budget would add another $11 trillion to that debt \nover the next 10 years. We are living in a time when we have European \ncountries that are on the verge of fiscal collapse with regard to their \neconomic and fiscal situations, much of which we are watching on a \ndaily basis unfold in front of us and what that might mean for our \ncountry, and hopefully there is something instructive about that \nbecause clearly we need to be taking a page out of what is happening \nthere and getting our house in order now.\n  We have made promises to the American people that we can't keep. We \nneed to reform our entitlement programs. And that probably more than \nanything else was the biggest disappointment in the President's budget \nbecause it is the fourth year in a row where he has proposed a budget \nthat doesn't do anything to address the fundamental drivers of Federal \nspending, and by that I mean the mandatory part of the budget; that is, \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP. All of those different \nprograms represent today, with interest on the debt, about 64 percent \nof all Federal spending. At the end of the 10-year period, they would \nrepresent 78 percent of all Federal spending. So this budget is a \ndramatic increase in the amount we are spending on various programs. \nThat is what is driving Federal spending today, that is what will drive \nFederal spending into the future, and that is why a failure and a lack \nof leadership when it comes to the issue of entitlement reform is so \ndisturbing, and it really is a missed opportunity.\n  I understand that this is an election year. Everybody says this is a \ncampaign document, this is a political document. That does not absolve \nthe President or us of the responsibility we have to the American \npeople to start making some decisions around here that will get this \ncountry back on the right fiscal track.\n  When you propose a budget that spends literally $47 trillion over the \nnext 10 years, which is basically what we are talking about here, then \nyou have not done much to bend the spending curve in the right \ndirection. So I would strongly disagree with Mr. Zients' statement \ntoday that this is a ``very tight budget''--that is how I think he \ndescribed it.\n  We have Governors around the country who are making some tough \ndecisions to balance their State budget. The Federal Government ought \nto do the same. South Dakota is a good example of that. We made some \ndifficult decisions this last year, and as a consequence of that, our \nbudget situation is much better this year, but it is because they had \nthe courage to step forward and do some things that needed to be done.\n  The budget proposed by the President fails to rein in government \nspending and balance the budget. As I said, it adds $11 trillion to the \nnational debt, which will reach--if my colleagues can believe this--\nnearly $26 trillion by the end of the decade under the proposal the \nPresident put forward.\n  I could go on, but I would say to my colleague from Alabama and to my \ncolleague from New Hampshire that based upon what we heard this \nmorning, I guess I don't feel very reassured that this administration \ngets it. The President's budget submission clearly was an example that \nthey don't get it, and the defense of it this morning that we heard in \nfront of the Budget Committee certainly reinforced that impression with \nme. But I would be interested in knowing what the Senator from New \nHampshire, who was there and able to question the panelists, including \nthe OMB Director, thought based on the testimony we heard this morning.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleague from South Dakota as well as my \ncolleague from Alabama, the ranking\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\nmember of the Budget Committee. I was deeply troubled this morning, \nbecause I asked Mr. Zients about the President's budget and my concern \nthat under the trajectory of the President's budget we would be \nreaching $26 trillion of debt in the next 10 years, and I was shocked \nwhen he described the President's budget as a milestone, as leadership. \nThis to me is not leadership. If it is a milestone for anything, this \nbudget is a milestone for bankruptcy and what we see happening in \nEurope and other areas of the world that we don't want to happen to our \ncountry.\n  When I think about it--I am the mother of two children--how could we \npossibly ask our children to pay back $26 trillion in debt? It is \noutrageous.\n  I was surprised that Mr. Zients couldn't answer a basic question such \nas how much debt has been added under this President. As the Senator \nfrom South Dakota mentioned, it is close to $5 trillion in debt.\n  Also our entitlement programs. I know my grandparents are relying on \nMedicare and Social Security. I asked Mr. Zients--the Medicare trustees \nhave said that Medicare is going bankrupt in 2024. We know Medicare is \na huge driver of our unsustainable debt and that if we don't act to \npreserve these programs, then the people who are relying on them are \ngoing to be put in a horrible position very soon--2024 is coming very \nquickly. I asked Mr. Zients the question: What is the President's plan \nto preserve Medicare? What I got was a completely insufficient answer. \nThat is because in this budget there is no plan to preserve Medicare \nfor my grandparents and for everyone who is relying on Medicare right \nnow.\n  When I reviewed the President's budget, it reminded me of a \ndiscussion I have had with my kids recently. In the last couple of \nweeks we have been talking about Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog who \ncomes out and looks at his shadow to see if we are going to have more \nwinter. Well, Punxsutawney has already come out of his hole, but in \nWashington it is Groundhog Day all over again when it comes to the \nPresident's budget, because every year this President has been in \noffice, his proposed budgets have left us with trillion-dollar \ndeficits, increased gross debt as a percentage of the share of our \neconomy, continued massive spending, racking up enormous debt to where \nwe will reach $26 trillion in 10 years. There is no plan to reform \nSocial Security and Medicare, to preserve these programs, and they are \nmandatory spending and, as Senator Thune mentioned, the largest driver \nof our debt, and massive tax increases. It is staggering when we think \nabout a budget that offers close to the largest--if not the largest--\ntax increase in the history of our country, yet still runs a $1.3 \ntrillion deficit this year and at least a $900 billion deficit in 2013. \nIt is the worst of all worlds. We are going to increase taxes on small \nbusinesses in this country that we are asking to generate revenue and \ncreate jobs, yet we are still going to run trillion-dollar deficits.\n  This is a very irresponsible budget. We cannot afford a campaign \ndocument. We need a budget for this country. Because when I think about \nwhere we are, when I think about what is happening in other countries \naround the world--in Europe--and the future of our country, and not \nonly all of us here today, but what we will be passing on to my \nchildren and your children because they can't repay $26 trillion in \ndebt--how is that going to happen? And how fair is that? They didn't \nincur this debt. We did. We have a responsibility to address this now.\n  I have been deeply disappointed by this President and his failure of \nleadership on this issue. Think about it: My colleague Senator Gregg \nserved on the President's fiscal commission. The President convenes a \nfiscal commission and ignores his own fiscal commission. In fact, since \nthat time, we have incurred $1.5 trillion of debt since the fiscal \ncommission issued a report. Last year the President's budget came up \nfor a vote in this body. It was so fiscally irresponsible that not one \nMember of this Chamber, from either party or the Independents, voted \nfor the budget. That says it all. Yet, again, we have a similar budget \nbeing proposed by this President. That is why I say, unfortunately, it \nis Groundhog Day in Washington all over again.\n  It is unfortunate, because the American people have seen this over \nand over again, and they are very tired because they understand at home \nthey have to balance their budgets. They understand that at home, they \nare making the difficult calls that need to be made to prioritize. Yet, \nhere in Washington, with this President's budget and the trajectory our \ncountry is on because of the failure of leadership, we are in a \nposition where we are hurting our country, and I am very concerned \nabout what we are passing on to the next generation. I hope my \ncolleagues on the Senate Budget Committee will actually do the work \nthat needs to be done and put together a responsible budget for this \ncountry, because it has been over 1,000 days since the Democratic-\ncontrolled Senate has actually done the work that needs to be done for \nthis country. If the President is not going to do it, then I hope that \nin this body, the Senate, we will put together a responsible budget \nthat gets our fiscal house in order for the future of our country.\n  I hope this Acting Budget Director, Mr. Zients, the next time he \ncomes before the Senate Budget Committee, will answer the questions he \nis asked. This is simple math. When Senator Sessions asked him whether \nwe are spending more money, one would hope to get a straight answer. \nThat is the least the American people deserve. I am hoping that is what \nthey will receive going forward.\n  I wish to ask my colleague, Senator Sessions, the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee, what his impression of the President's budget is \nin terms of where it leaves our country going forward and what he hopes \nthe Senate Budget Committee will do to address this fiscal crisis.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank my colleague. I know Senator Ayotte wanted to \nbe on the Budget Committee. We had a host of fabulous new Senators who \nwanted to be on it. We got four, but many more wanted to be on it. \nSenator Portman, Senator Toomey, Senator Johnson, and Senator Ayotte \nwere selected.\n  I would say I know how disappointing it was because we talked about \nhow we didn't even mark up a budget last year. So the people who wanted \nto be on there to participate in the great issue of our time--the debt \nthis Nation is facing--got no ability or option or opportunity to \nparticipate in the debate because the majority party in the Senate \ndecided that was not what they wanted to do. The majority leader said \nit would be foolish to have a budget. It is very sad.\n  The President's budget represents an opportunity and a responsibility \nto guide this Nation for the future. The President has no higher duty, \nno higher responsibility than to help the Nation avoid an obvious \ncrisis. Mr. Bowles and Senator Simpson, who chaired President Obama's \ndebt commission, looked us in the eye and issued a joint statement on \nthe Budget Committee last year about this time that said the Nation has \nnever faced a more predictable economic crisis. What they were saying \nwas if we don't change what we are doing, we are headed to a crisis. \nMr. Bowles, President Clinton's Chief of Staff, said to us that this \ncrisis could happen within 2 years.\n\n  I saw yesterday on the television, ``Morning Joe,'' Mr. Haass of the \nCouncil on Foreign Relations talk about Greece. He is internationally \nrecognized. He said the United States could be having this next year. I \nwould say what is stunning to me is that when we look at this budget, \nit does not change the debt trajectory. We have looked at those \nnumbers. We have looked at those numbers and it does not change the \ndebt trajectory. It increases spending. It increases taxes. And, at the \nend of the day, based on current law that we achieved last year--\nminimum steps, but they were achieved--the Budget Control Act numbers \nthat would allow the debt to increase to $11.5 trillion next year, \nunder the President's budget that he asserts reduces the deficit by $4 \ntrillion, the deficit would increase by $11.2 trillion--almost no \nchange at all. We need big change. He took away some of the spending \nreductions and replaced them with more tax increases--the reductions we \npainfully agreed to last August.\n  I am disappointed in the President's leadership on that. The Senator \nfrom South Dakota has been here and dealt with these issues. Maybe he \nhas comments about it. I will yield to him.\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to the Senator from Alabama that it was \ninteresting to me because at the White House Fiscal Responsibility \nSummit in February of 2009--this is in the context of discussing our \nunsustainable budget deficits--President Obama said the following:\n\n       Contrary to the prevailing wisdom in Washington these past \n     few years, we cannot simply spend as we please and defer the \n     consequences to the next budget of the next administration or \n     the next generation.\n\n  That is exactly what he has been doing now for 4 years, literally--\nevery budget, every year. We think, OK, maybe this year the President \nis going to get serious because we have serious problems and these are \nserious times in which we are living and we have to get the situation \nturned around or we are headed for certain disaster. Yet, last year, as \nwas noted, the President's budget when it was put on the floor of the \nSenate did not garner a single vote here--not a single vote. It was 97 \nto 0. It was unanimously rejected by the Senate, Members on both sides \nvoting against it.\n  This year one would think, OK, the situation has gotten much worse. \nOur fiscal situation has deteriorated even more. The amount of debt we \nhave racked up is continuing to accumulate. We thought perhaps this \nyear we would see a budget that actually did address these problems, \nbut, no, we have a budget that is filled with more spending, more debt, \nand higher taxes at a time literally when we need to be tackling \nspending, we need to be taking on saving Social Security and Medicare \nfor the next generation, and doing something to create economic growth \nand get jobs created for American workers.\n  What is disappointing is not just the fact that the spending and debt \nsituation is out of control but also the impact it has on the economy. \nThe Senator from Alabama knows full well, because we both have studied \nthis subject, that when we look at the research that has been done with \nregard to the impact of spending on debt and economic job creation, \nwhen we achieve a certain level or arrive at a certain level of debt as \na percentage of the economy--90 percent is the threshold and it costs \nabout a percentage point of economic growth every year, which means \nfewer jobs, and in this case about a million fewer jobs, in our \neconomy. So the high, sustained levels, chronic high levels of debt and \nspending are directly impacting our economy's ability to get out of \nthis cycle we are in and to start growing and expanding again and \ncreating jobs.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from South Dakota says ``directly impact.'' \nThe way I read the Reinhart-Rogoff study and what I think I hear the \nSenator saying is that this isn't just that a debt crisis might \nhappen--and those can happen quickly, as they warn in their book, that \na crisis can happen when we are at this debt level out of the blue, \nthings we never expected, and we are in serious financial trouble, like \nour 2006-2007 financial crisis that nobody predicted.\n  But I guess what I am saying to you is, they also indicate that huge \ndebt can impact economic growth today. And they say, when your debt \nreaches 90 percent of GDP, your debt is that much that it will slow \ngrowth by 1 to 2 percent.\n  We are already at 100 percent of GDP. Does the Senator think it is \npossible their study, based on empirical data, might be telling us that \nthe debt, right now--because it weakens confidence and drains \ninvestment capital--that our debt now could be slowing our economy?\n  Mr. THUNE. I think it is very clear. I think if you look at, as the \nSenator said, the debt as a percent of GDP--now over 100 percent; think \nabout that--this is the highest level of debt, highest level of \nspending as a percentage of our GDP that we have seen literally since \nthe end of World War II. We have not seen anything that rivals it. We \nhave seen now 4 years in a row where we have run trillion-dollar-plus \ndeficits, and we have added, as was said earlier, nearly $5 trillion to \nthe debt since this President took office. But when you get that kind \nof debt level sustained over time, it does have a direct impact on jobs \nand the economy, and I believe we are paying a price for that right \nnow. You can look at what is happening, obviously, with the high levels \nof debt and the impact it is having on countries in Europe.\n  So this whole idea with the President producing his budget and not \ntaking that issue on, not doing anything substantial or meaningful with \nregard to spending or debt, and then adding to it, and making matters \neven worse, raising taxes by almost $2 trillion--it seems like a most \nnatural instinct. It is just in their DNA. Everything has to be about \nraising taxes. And, clearly, that is not the solution. We all know \nthat. In fact, we need to create policies that will be conducive to \neconomic growth and job creation in this country.\n  Raising taxes on investment, which is what this budget does--by the \nway, it would raise capital gains tax rates from 15 percent to 20 \npercent right away, and then if you are hit by the Buffett rule, it \nwould go up to 30 percent. It would raise the dividend tax rates from \n15 percent to up over 39 percent--almost triple the tax on dividends in \nthis country, which, incidentally, have already been taxed at the \ncorporate business level. So you are talking about almost tripling the \ntax rate that Americans are going to have to pay on investment income. \nThen you look at the ObamaCare taxes that would kick in, the 3.8 \npercent on investment income, you add that and you start getting to a \nmarginal income tax rate that is up in the 43, 44-percent range. It is \nvery hard to argue that can be anything but awful when it comes to \njobs.\n  The entire budget--from the failure to address spending and debt, the \nfailure to take on saving Social Security and Medicare by reforming our \nentitlement programs; and it seems as though the constant reliance on \ntaxes is their answer to everything--could not be a worse budget for \nthe American people. It could not be a worse budget for the economy. It \ncould not be a worse budget for jobs. And it certainly could not be a \nworse budget for seniors, as we continue to watch Medicare and Social \nSecurity cascade further and further toward bankruptcy. It is a bust as \nfar as I am concerned. I think that is why people on both sides and \npeople in the media and the American people get it.\n  It is time for this administration to get serious because these are \nserious times. When you are going to do big things, you need \nPresidential leadership. There are 100 Senators, 435 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, 535 of us in all. There is only one \nPresident, one person who can sign a bill into law, one person who can \nengage the American public and the Congress in a way that will help us \nsolve these big problems and tackle the challenges we face as a Nation \nright now. This budget does none of that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for his comments and his leadership \non all these matters that relate fundamentally to job creation and \neconomic growth. Tax increases do not facilitate economic growth. And \nwhen you surge debt, it increases more and more pressure to raise \ntaxes. A lot of people in my State say: Jeff, the debt is being run up \nso you will have to raise taxes. That is what they planned all along. \nWhether it is true or not, we are finding that. So we need to take \nsteps today to put this country on a sound financial course.\n  To demonstrate how impactful the debt is, this year the interest on \nthe debt we will pay--of the entire $3,700 billion we spend, $225 \nbillion will be spent on paying the interest on the money we borrowed. \nA lot of people do not understand, when you borrow money, you pay \ninterest on it. And the interest rates at this point in history are \nsome of the lowest in history for a developed economy. But the \nPresident's own budget--the tables he has in his own budget, the \nassumptions he has about the expenses we will have to pay--assumes that \n10 years from today we will not be paying $230 billion but $850 \nbillion. That is more than Social Security. That is more than Medicare. \nThat is more than the Defense Department. That is 10 times what we \nspend on food stamps. It is multiple times what we spend on education \nand highways--maybe 20 times what we spend on highways. And we are \ntalking about a highway bill today and trying to find the money to keep \nit on a basic level of funding, to find the money for that, and this \ninterest is going to be hammering us every year because we are running \nextraordinary deficits every year.\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\n  The American people are not happy with us because they know there can \nbe no excuse for spending $3,700 billion and taking in only $2,200 \nbillion and borrowing 40 cents of every dollar, having to have interest \nbe the fastest growing item in the entire budget of America, and soon \nto dwarf the Defense Department, even Social Security and Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  This is not right. This is bad policy. There can be no excuses. The \nPresident--the man who is captain of the ship--is having lunch \nsomewhere while the ship is heading to the shoals and not providing any \nleadership to get us off this path. In fact, worse, I would say, the \nPresident attacks people who propose serious solutions. Paul Ryan in \nthe House worked hard on a budget. They laid out some good proposals \nthat would have changed the debt course of America. It was a historic \nbudget, do you not think, I say to Senator Thune.\n  We can disagree about parts of it, but he was attacked by the \nPresident, who himself proposes nothing. And the leadership in this \nbody will not even bring up a budget. He said it was foolish. Why is it \nfoolish? Because if we have a budget debate on the floor of the Senate, \npeople get to offer amendments, and they get to debate the honest depth \nof the danger this country faces, honestly, openly, and you have to \nvote on it, and the majority leader does not want to have to have his \nMembers vote on it because he wants to avoid responsibility for facing \nthe greatest crisis this Nation is facing.\n\n  Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appointed \nby President Obama, said: The greatest threat to our national security \nis the debt. That is true. It is out there. If we do not deal with it, \nwe are going to have a crisis.\n  I am disappointed at this whole process. I was disappointed at the \nhearing today. I thought we got irresponsible answers. I think the \nbudget is irresponsible. It in no way deals with the main drivers, as \nSenator Thune has said: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, food \nstamps--all entitlements. Those are not even touched in any serious \nway. Increasing at 8 percent, the highest growth rate predicted by the \nPresident in their 10-year budget is 4 percent. So these programs are \nincreasing twice the rate of GDP. That is unsustainable. It is \nunsustainable. We need some leadership around here to confront it, and \nwe do not need a President who attacks people who have the courage to \nactually lay out some plans to fix it.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator would yield on that point, in closing, I do \nthink there will be a vote probably at some point. The House is going \nto pass a budget. We know that. I suspect what will happen is what \nhappened last year. If the Senate fails to produce, if the Democratic \nmajority does not produce a budget here, we will end up voting on the \nHouse budget, perhaps on the President's budget. But the regrettable \nthing about all that is we are not doing our job as Senators. It has \nbeen over 1,000 days now, and this will be the fourth year in a row in \nwhich this body has not adopted a budget. What we have gotten from the \nPresident, of course, is not a serious one. All they want to do is get \nout and demagog and attack people who are serious about solving this \nproblem.\n  Last year, as was the case with the House-passed budget, when it came \nover here, it was routinely attacked and demagoged. But nothing was \never put forward that would represent an alternative because they do \nnot want to deal with these issues. It is unfortunate for the American \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. We yield our time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I want to talk about another subject; \nthat is, five of the executive branch nominations that are pending \nbefore the Senate today.\n  To put this in context, every day when the Senate is in session, one \nof the documents that is put on every desk here in the Senate Chamber \nis what is called the Executive Calendar. The Executive Calendar is a \nlisting of all the nominations that have been reported by the various \ncommittees of the Senate for consideration by the full Senate. These \nare, of course, nominations that the President has made and asks the \nSenate to agree with. So there is usually a list of these executive \nnominations.\n  I have become particularly concerned in recent weeks that this list \nhas grown and grown and grown. In fact, there are now 79 appointments \nthat the President has made, nominations that the President has made, \nthat have been approved by the various committees of the Senate but \nhave not been brought up and voted on here in the Senate itself.\n  That, to me, is an unfortunate result and one with which we need to \nconcern ourselves.\n  I want to particularly talk about five of these nominations for \nimportant offices in the Department of Energy. We have Secretary of \nEnergy Steven Chu coming before the Energy Committee on Thursday to \ntalk about the President's proposed budget as it affects the Department \nof Energy in the upcoming year. These are nominations for management \npositions in his Department, he is very much in favor of us moving \nahead.\n  Each of these offices--these five I am talking about here--has \nimportant responsibilities. Together, the five of them make up a large \npart of the management structure of the Department of Energy.\n  A frequent observation I hear on the Senate floor about energy policy \nin our country is that the United States needs to have an ``all of the \nabove'' approach to energy. I do not know how we can execute an ``all \nof the above'' strategy for energy when we have vacancies in the key \ngovernment offices that oversee fossil energy, nuclear energy, \nrenewable energy, energy efficiency, small and minority business access \nto energy programs, and we have a vacancy in the legal counsel office \nfor the Department of Energy as well.\n  The President has nominated five outstanding individuals to fill \nthese ``all of the above'' energy posts. Our committee, the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, held hearings on each of the nominees, has \nexamined their qualifications, and I am pleased to report that the \ncommittee reported all five of these nominees unanimously, recommending \nto the full Senate that we approve them.\n  The most senior of the five positions is the office of the Under \nSecretary of Energy. The Under Secretary's responsibilities include \nenergy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil energy, nuclear energy, and \nelectricity. This position has been vacant for nearly a year and a \nhalf. The President has nominated Dr. Arun Majumdar to this important \npost. Dr. Majumdar is currently the Director of ARPA-E, the Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency located at the Department of Energy.\n  The Senate confirmed Dr. Majumdar to the position he now holds at \nARPA-E as the Director of ARPA-E in October of 2009. He is currently \nserving as the Under Secretary on an acting basis, and serving as \nSecretary Chu's senior adviser.\n  Dr. Majumdar is a highly distinguished scientist and engineer. Before \nhe came to Washington, he was the associate laboratory director for \nEnergy and Environment at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He was \na professor of mechanical engineering and materials sciences and \nengineering at The University of California at Berkeley. He holds a \ndozen patents. He has authored close to 200 scientific papers. He has \nserved as an adviser to both the National Science Foundation and the \nPresident's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, as well as \nstartup companies and venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. He holds \na doctorate from UC Berkeley, and he is a member of the National \nAcademy of Engineering.\n  So it is clear to anyone who looks at his qualifications that he is \nan eminently qualified scientist, and, frankly, we are very fortunate \nto have someone of his caliber willing to serve as the Under Secretary \nof Energy.\n  The second nomination I want to talk about is for the general \ncounsel's position at the Department. This is, of course, the \nDepartment's top legal officer. This position has been vacant since \nlast March--nearly a year. The President has nominated Gregory Woods to \nbe the general counsel. Mr. Woods is currently the deputy general\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\ncounsel in the Department of Transportation. He was previously a \npartner in a New York law firm. He was a trial lawyer in the Department \nof Justice before that.\n  The third office I want to speak about is the Assistant Secretary for \nFossil Energy. This important office is responsible for research and \ndevelopment programs that cover coal, oil, and natural gas. It is a \nposition that has been vacant for over a year.\n  The President has nominated Charles McConnell to be the next \nAssistant Secretary for Fossil Energy. Mr. McConnell is currently the \nChief Operating Officer of the Office of Fossil Energy. Before coming \nto the Department of Energy, he spent 2 years as a vice president at \nBattelle Energy Technology and 31 years before that at Praxair, Inc., a \nFortune 500 company that produces industrial gases.\n  The fourth vacant office I want to speak briefly about is that of the \nAssistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. This \noffice is responsible for programs designed to increase the production \nand use of solar and wind and geothermal and biomass and hydrogen and \nethanol fuels, for improving energy efficiency in the transportation \nand building and industrial and utility sectors, and for administering \nprograms that provide financial assistance to State energy programs and \nweatherization for low-income housing.\n  For this position, the President has nominated Dr. David Danielson. \nDr. Danielson is currently a program director at ARPA-E. Before that he \nwas a clean energy venture capitalist specializing in financing of \nsolar and wind and biofuels and carbon capture and storage and advanced \nlighting projects. He holds a doctorate in material science and \nengineering from MIT.\n  The fifth and final office I want to mention is that of the Director \nof Minority Economic Impact, which is responsible for advising the \nSecretary on the effects of energy policies on minority business \nenterprises and educational institutions and communities and on ways to \nensure that minorities are afforded an opportunity to participate fully \nin the Department's programs. This position has been vacant for nearly \n2 years.\n  The President has nominated LaDoris Harris to head the office. Ms. \nHarris is currently the president and chief executive officer of Jabo \nIndustries, a minority-woman-owned management consulting firm that \nspecializes in energy and information technology and the health care \nindustry. She has previously been an executive with General Electric \nand has held executive and management positions at ABB and at \nWestinghouse before that.\n  All five of these nominees are outstanding individuals who are \nespecially well-qualified for the positions for which they have been \nnominated. These are important positions. They need to be filled. All \nfive nominations were unanimously reported, as I indicated before, by \nour Energy and Natural Resources Committee this last fall. Four of them \nhave been on the calendar--the Senate's Executive Calendar--since \nNovember 10. The fifth was added on December 15.\n  I am not aware of a single objection that has been raised--any \nobjection on any substantive basis for any one of these. In my view, \nthey all deserve to be confirmed, and Secretary Chu deserves to have \nthem confirmed so that he can implement the policies and the laws we \nare enacting in a responsible way.\n  I will ask consent now to go ahead and approve these nominees and see \nif we can get at least these 5 out of the 79 who are on the Executive \nCalendar approved. Hopefully, that will allow Senators to see that \nthere is a way to get some of these executive nominees approved as \nwell.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 493, 494, 495, \n496, and 527; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc; the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \ninterviewing action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nany of the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the \nRecord; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to accommodate the President and these nominees. I think the \nchairman, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, has made very good \npoints about their qualifications. But I would be remiss if I did not \nrise in support of 1,200 jobs in Paducah, KY, which are threatened to \nbe lost because the Department of Energy is refusing to address the \nsituation.\n  We have a company that has 1,200 jobs in Paducah, KY, which enriches \nuranium. For 50 years uranium has been accumulating, and it sits on the \nground as a waste product. We could recycle this. It is a green \nproject. It costs no taxes. In fact, it will actually bring back money \nto the Treasury.\n  What I would like is help from the chairman as well as the President \nas well as Secretary Chu on this issue. I have written to Secretary \nChu, and we have not heard back. This is very important to us. We are \nin the midst of a great recession, and 1,200 people are destined to \nlose their jobs. Once again, this does not cause any spending. It does \nnot cost any taxes. Actually, if you would allow us to reenrich this \nuranium, it would bring money back to the Treasury. That is my reason \nfor holding this. I would hope that we could find some reason and means \nto accommodate each other.\n\n  Until that time, I would continue to object to these nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, maybe if I could just be clear as to \nexactly what action the Senator from Kentucky is requesting of the \nSecretary--I know he indicated that he had contacted the Secretary or \nwritten to the Secretary and had not heard back. But is there some \nspecific action that the Secretary is being asked to take that we can \nclarify so that we would know whether this is a request that could be \naccommodated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, in response to that question, yes. The \ngovernment owns the uranium. It has been sitting there for 50 years. It \nis my understanding that the Department of Energy or the President \ncould at any time sign a statement saying that uranium can be enriched.\n  It is completely under his prerogative and 1,200 jobs could be saved. \nThese are good-paying jobs. Many of these are union jobs. These are \npeople I would like to help in my State. It does not cost the \ngovernment anything. It does not cost the taxpayers anything. In fact, \nit uses a waste product that is sitting on the ground. We had an \nagreement. We have worked with United Uranium Mine Workers. We have \nworked with Senators and Congressmen from different States to try to \nget this figured out. But all it takes is a signature from the \nDepartment of Energy to allow them to enrich this uranium.\n  The Defense Department has written statements saying they could use \nthis uranium. The GAO has said this is the best use of this waste \nproduct. But I believe the Secretary of Energy, through a stroke of the \npen, could save these 1,200 jobs. That is what I am asking for help \nwith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me just indicate to my colleague \nfrom Kentucky that I am encouraged to hear that this is an action that \ncould be taken without any cost to the taxpayer. I think that is \nobviously important.\n  I do not know all of the arguments for and against the action the \nSenator is advocating or requesting. But we certainly will look into \nthat.\n  Let me ask one additional question, if I could. If we are able to \naccommodate the Senator from Kentucky with regard to this request he \nhas made to the Secretary of Energy, is that the only objection he is \naware of to the approval of these five nominees or are we going to have \nadditional Senators coming to the floor raising additional objections \nin the future, even if this action is taken?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S605]]\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, this is my only objection. If the Senator \nwere to help me save these 1,200 jobs, we would erect a monument to him \nin Kentucky. This is a big deal for us. It does not cost anything. I \nwould do everything within my power to make sure there is no objection \non our side. I think it is the President's prerogative. I will help \nfacilitate this process as soon as possible. This would be huge for us \nin Kentucky if we could save these jobs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, obviously, I do not want a monument \nerected to me in Kentucky. But I do appreciate the Senator from \nKentucky indicating his commitment to help get these nominees approved \nif some accommodation could be found for his concerns. As I say, I have \nno knowledge of this particular issue. I do not know whether the \nrequest the Senator from Kentucky is making is within the realm of \npossibility.\n  We will certainly go as far as to investigate the issue and try to \nget a response back to the Senator as to the Department of Energy view \non this issue. That much I can certainly commit to the Senator from \nKentucky. But I appreciate his willingness to discuss this issue on the \nSenate floor. I also very much, as I said before, appreciate his \ncommitment to help us get these nominees approved if some accommodation \nof his concerns can be agreed upon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak on the issue of energy \nsecurity for our Nation. I have filed legislation which would approve \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. I filed our bill as an amendment to the \nhighway bill. That bill is the Hoeven-Lugar-Vitter-McConnell-Johanns-\nHatch bill. But it actually includes 45 Senators as cosponsors of the \nlegislation. As I said, I filed it now as an amendment to the highway \nbill.\n  The fact is Congress needs to act. The administration, after more \nthan 3 years, has decided not to act--evidently will not act on this \nimportant issue. So we in Congress need to.\n  This highway bill provides a tremendous opportunity. The highway bill \nis about infrastructure, vital infrastructure for our country. That is \nexactly what the Keystone XL Pipeline is. It is vital infrastructure \nthat is very much needed by our country.\n  Look at gas prices today. According to the Lundberg Survey or AAA, \ngas prices are now more than $3.50 a gallon. That is the highest they \nhave been at this time of year ever--more than $3.50 a gallon.\n  Since President Obama took office, gas prices are up 88 percent. They \nare up 88 percent. That is even though demand is down. We are using \nless. Demand in the United States for gasoline is down by 5 percent. \nYet we are seeing record high gas prices. AAA is now projecting that \ngasoline will go to $4 a gallon by Memorial Day.\n  Some are saying we could see $5 gasoline this year--$5 a gallon. Why \nis that? All we have to do is look to the Middle East to understand \nwhat is going on. With the turmoil there, Iran is threatening to \nblockade the Strait of Hormuz. Something like between one-fifth and \none-sixth of all the seaborne oil in the world goes through the Strait \nof Hormuz. So we can imagine what would happen if Iran blockaded that \nstrait.\n  Why are we continuing to get oil from the Middle East and places such \nas Venezuela? Nearly 30 percent of the crude we use comes from places \nsuch as the Middle East and Venezuela. Why? Why are we doing that when \nwe don't have to? We don't have to. Why not produce that oil in this \ncountry and get it from our closest friend and our strongest trading \npartner, Canada?\n  The reality is, we can have North American energy independence. We \nabsolutely can do it. I believe we can do it within the next 5 years. \nIn my home State of North Dakota, we now produce 535,000 barrels a day \nof light sweet Bakken crude oil. But the problem we have is we cannot \nget it to market. In the last 5 years, we have increased production \nfrom about 100,000 barrels a day to more than 500,000 barrels a day, \nand it is continuing to grow. But we need pipelines to get that product \nto refineries in the United States. That is what the Keystone XL would \ndo. More than 100,000 barrels a day of our oil would go into the \nKeystone Pipeline to get it to refineries.\n  From Canada, 700,000 barrels a day would go into the Keystone XL \nPipeline. So we are talking about 830,000 barrels a day that would go \nthrough the Keystone XL Pipeline, which we would not need to get from \nthe Middle East.\n  Between the United States and Canada, and some from Mexico, building \ninfrastructure such as the Keystone XL Pipeline, we can produce more \nthan 75 percent of the crude oil we need in our country, and that is \ngrowing. When I talk about North American oil independence or North \nAmerican energy independence, that is very attainable. It is something \nwe can absolutely do, but we need the infrastructure to do it.\n  Today, in North Dakota, light sweet Bakken crude is suffering a \ndiscount of $27 a barrel. Our oil is suffering a discount of $27 a \nbarrel because we are constrained by pipeline capacity. In Canada, \nSyncrude is suffering a discount of $21 a barrel because of that \npipeline capacity. Even in Cushing, OK, a hub for oil in this country, \noil has been discounted because it cannot move to the refineries \nbecause we lack the pipeline capacity.\n  But even with these bottlenecks, as I have pointed out, these \ndiscounts at the pump, consumers and businesses are paying more than \n$3.50 a gallon. The bottlenecks create those constraints. Think of the \nimpact on our economy and to our consumers. There are other impacts as \nwell. For example, in North Dakota, we have more truck traffic on our \nwestern highways than ever before. That means more fatalities, more \ntraffic accidents. It also means a lot more wear and tear on our \ninfrastructure. So we are talking about a highway bill to maintain and \nimprove our highway infrastructure throughout the country, and in my \nState our roads are getting worn out by all that truck traffic. The \nKeystone XL Pipeline alone would reduce the truck traffic on our \nhighways just in North Dakota by 17 million truck miles a year. Again, \nthat is 17 million truck miles a year--all that without one penny of \ngovernment spending, not one penny of Federal Government spending. So \nit is a $7 billion private investment in enhancing our infrastructure \nthat would not cost us a penny.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline will create needed infrastructure, tens of \nthousands of jobs, more energy security for our Nation, and millions in \ntax revenues, all with no government spending. The U.S. Department of \nEnergy said the Keystone XL Pipeline will lower gas prices--not ``may'' \nbut ``will''--for the east coast, the gulf coast and the Midwest. But \nthe Obama administration says no.\n  So the Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, goes to China last \nweek. While there, he met with President Hu Jintao of China about \nselling Canadian oil to China. Prime Minister Harper said this in The \nGazette:\n\n       We are an emerging energy superpower. . . . We have \n     abundant supplies of virtually every form of energy. And you \n     know, we want to sell our energy to people who want to buy \n     our energy. It's that simple.\n\n  He also spoke of ``a new era in a strategic Canada-China energy \npartnership.'' To the United States, he said:\n\n       If you don't want Canadian oil sand crude, China is a \n     waiting customer.\n\n  To back it up, he returned with a memorandum of understanding from \nChina to develop energy sales from Canada to China.\n  To those who don't think the Canadian oil sands are going to be \nproduced, that is wrong. They are going to be produced. This oil will \nbe produced. The issue is whether it is going to go to China or come to \nthe United States. The reality is, if it goes to China, it will be \nworse environmental stewardship. If it comes to the United States, \nthere will be better environmental stewardship.\n  Let's talk about that for a minute. First off, if it comes from the \nUnited States in a pipeline instead of going to China, we don't have to \nhaul it in tankers across the ocean, which produces greenhouse gas. The \noil going to China creates more greenhouse gas because we have to haul \nit to China.\n  Second, if we are not getting it in the pipeline, we are going to \nhave to continue to have tanker loads coming here from the Middle East \nand Venezuela--again, producing more greenhouse gas.\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\n  Third, we have the best refineries in the world. We have the highest \nstandards and the lowest emissions in our refineries. Instead, this oil \nwill go to China, where they have more emissions and more greenhouse \ngas. That is worse environmental stewardship by sending it to China, \nnot better.\n  Another point. Eighty percent of new production in the Canadian oil \nsands is in situ. That means drilling down to bring up the oil, as we \ndo with conventional oil, not excavating, as they have done \nhistorically but drilling or in situ, which has the same impact on \ngreenhouse emissions as conventional drilling. So 80 percent of the new \ndevelopment is in situ, with the same impact as conventional drilling.\n  That is the real solution. The real solution is using better \ntechnology to not only produce more energy but with better \nenvironmental stewardship. That is the real solution, and it means jobs \nand energy independence for North America.\n\n  Finally, on the issue of reexporting the oil, the issue has been \nbrought up that, OK, if we bring the oil in from Canada, it will just \nget exported to some other country and not be utilized in the United \nStates. But 99 percent of the crude in the United States is refined \nhere; 97 percent of the gasoline refined in the United States is used \nin the United States; 90 percent of the transportation fuel refined in \nthe United States is used in the United States. We need this oil. We \nneed the refined product.\n  The reality is, for the small amount exported--think about that. For \nthat, we get jobs, and we get dollars for our economy. Think about it \nlike manufacturing for just a minute. Refining is a process. We take \ncrude oil, refine it, and we have a finished product, a refined \nproduct. Similar to manufacturing, we take inputs and manufacture and \nwe have a finished good. Would anybody, for a minute, argue that we \ndon't want to manufacture products in the United States and send them \noverseas? Of course we do because we get jobs and wealth from that, \ndon't we? In other words, we want to manufacture and process goods in \nthe United States, and when we export them, we get value, we get jobs, \nand we get a growing economy.\n  What is going on with this argument? If we think about this argument \nin the simplest form--for those who say we don't want to build the \npipeline because some product might get exported, stop and think for a \nminute. If we don't build the pipeline, all the oil goes to China; none \nof it comes here. So we are worried that some might get exported? That \nmakes no sense. None.\n  I will wrap up. The reality is this: Whether we measure it by jobs or \nwhether we measure it by energy security for this Nation--national \nsecurity with what is going on in the Middle East--or whether we \nmeasure it from an environmental stewardship standpoint, it absolutely \nmakes sense to develop this infrastructure. This is an important step \nin the right direction toward North American energy security. There is \na lot more we need to do, but the reality is we can get there with this \nkind of private investment by creating the right environment for that. \nWith the infrastructure and steps we need to take, we can get to energy \nsecurity. It is time for Congress to step forward and act.\n  This is vitally important infrastructure for our country. This is a \nvitally important step in terms of national security for the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kyl pertaining to the introduction of S. 2109 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                             The SUGAR Act\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I know this comes as no surprise to you, \nbut today is Valentine's Day. Today millions of Americans are buying \nflowers and candy for their loved ones to celebrate Valentine's Day. \nThis is an important day for American businesses, especially candy \nmanufacturers. Consumers will purchase over 36 million heart-shaped \nboxes of chocolates for Valentine's Day.\n  Unfortunately, the price American candy manufacturers must pay for \nthis sugar leaves a very bitter taste in their mouths. Why, you ask. \nWell, because these companies face artificially high prices for sugar, \nabout twice the world average. That is because there is an outdated and \nunnecessary government program that keeps sugar prices significantly \nhigher than they should be.\n  It is programs such as these sugar subsidies that reflect people's \nfrustration with what is going on here in Washington because the sugar \nprogram, like too many other subsidies, protects special interests at \nthe expense of regular businesses and consumers. That is why I joined \nwith Senator Mark Kirk on Valentine's Day last year to encourage our \ncolleagues to join us in supporting our bipartisan SUGAR Act.\n  The SUGAR Act would phase out the U.S. sugar program, which costs \nbusinesses and consumers about $4 billion a year. This is a big concern \nfor us in New Hampshire as we are the American home of Lindt chocolate \nas well as a number of other smaller candy companies that use a lot of \nsugar. I know it is a concern for the President, who has Hershey's \nchocolate in his home State of Pennsylvania, and it is a big concern \nfor Illinois, where Senator Kirk is from, because they have so many \ncandy companies.\n  This legislation isn't about Democrats or Republicans. This \nlegislation is about ending a bad deal for businesses and consumers. \nSenator Kirk and I sponsored this legislation because we need to end \nthe sweetheart deal for the sugar industry. There is simply no reason \nto continue a program that makes candy makers, bakers, and other food \nmanufacturers in our States pay double the world average price for \nsugar.\n  One of the other fallouts from these high sugar prices is that it \ncosts jobs. For every one job we save in the sugar industry because of \nthese subsidies, we are losing three manufacturing jobs.\n  Today, as we celebrate Valentine's Day, my thoughts are with Senator \nKirk, who continues to recover from a serious illness. While Senator \nKirk couldn't be with us this Valentine's Day, I do wish him well, and \nI look forward to his speedy return to the Senate. I know he is focused \non getting better so that he will be able to get back here to work for \nhis constituents from Illinois.\n  It has been my pleasure to work with Senator Kirk on this bipartisan \nlegislation. I look forward to our continued work in the future on the \nSUGAR Act and on other matters that help our constituents in New \nHampshire and Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Claire Griffin\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the dedicated \nservice of one of my team members, Claire Griffin. Claire retired this \nJanuary after a long and eventful career. She stuck with me through \nthick and thin, from when I was a newly elected State representative to \nthe speakership of the Oregon House, to my service here in the Senate.\n  I first met Claire in 1998 at a candidate training event when I was \nrunning for the Oregon House. Claire came as the campaign manager for \nanother candidate who was running in a tough race for an open seat. \nClaire and her candidate kept making key points, responding to all the \nquestions being\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\nasked about how one would run their campaign. I just kept thinking: I \nam in so much trouble. I wish I had it together--like the two of them.\n  They were enormously outspent in their race and did not win but \nfinished respectably. It was just after the election that the candidate \ncalled me and encouraged me to hire Claire for my team, so I did. Thus \nbegan a wonderful 13-year partnership.\n  One of the first things I got to know about Claire was that, while \nshe had moved to Oregon, she was steeped in California politics. Her \nface would light up with stories from her California days. Jesse Unruh, \nformer California assemblyman, treasurer, and speaker figured \nprominently in these stories. The underlying theme of these stories \nwas, if I had just a fraction of Speaker Unruh's political smarts, we \ncould get a lot more done.\n  Fortunately, Claire did what she could to help provide those \npolitical smarts for me. During these years I was working full time for \nthe World Affairs Council of Oregon, in addition to serving as a \nlegislator in the citizen legislator system in Oregon. This greatly \nincreased Claire's workload and, on pretty much a daily basis, it \nincreased her blood pressure. I don't know how I would have gotten \nthrough those years without her extraordinary diligence.\n  I kept hearing from constituents how promptly Claire responded when \nthey called my legislative office. In fact, I think a good share of the \nfolks in my Oregon House district thought Claire was the State \nrepresentative and I was assisting her.\n  Then, in 2003, our collective experience took a big turn. The good \nnews for Claire was that I resigned from my day job as director of the \nWorld Affairs Council of Oregon, and I could finally devote myself \nfully to my responsibilities as a State legislator. The bad news for \nher blood pressure was that I also decided to make a long-shot bid to \nbe House Democratic leader.\n  Claire always said she was sure I would win. I, on the other hand, \nwas equally sure I would not win. But as so often has proved the case \nover time, Claire was right and I was wrong.\n  When the first day of voting arrived, it became clear after the first \nballot that the race was going to be a close three-way contest, and in \nthe next two rounds of voting one of us won and the other two tied and \nnobody was out of the race, so the voting continued. I finally won on \nthe fifth ballot, bringing a new challenge for Claire, developing a \nstrong working relationship with the entire House Democratic \nleadership.\n  Over the next 3 years, Claire had to hear me obsess over the \nchallenge of recruiting candidates in 60 districts, raising funds, \ndeveloping a policy agenda, and overcoming the sometimes dramatic ups \nand downs of a State legislature. But together we soldiered on.\n  Starting in the 2005 session, Claire took on a new duty, the \nessential task of training and mentoring the Democratic legislative \nassistants. Just as she had impressed me in that first fortuitous \nmeeting in 1998, she impressed her new trainees. Many of the LAs would \nstop me in the halls of the capitol in Salem, OR, and give thanks for \nher down-to-earth training and support.\n  In 2007, our world changed again when I became speaker of the house. \nAs always, Claire was the rock of our operation, even as I assumed my \nnew duties and then, shortly after the 2007 session, took on the long-\nshot race of running for the U.S. Senate.\n  When I was elected to the Senate in 2008, Claire applied her enormous \nskills to lead my casework team. She and her team have done an amazing \njob. If you would like to see proof, just visit her office in Portland. \nThe wall is covered in multitudes of thank-you notes.\n  Recently, I received this letter from a constituent:\n\n       Senator, you hardly need one of your constituents to tell \n     you how great your staff operates but I must try. I recently \n     had a problem with government bureaucracy and I was beyond \n     frustration. Then, 2 years ago, I contacted your office and \n     was put in contact with Claire Griffin. I may have found my \n     government to be unresponsive before this, but from that day \n     forward I had been amazed. . . . My issue did not even affect \n     very many people, but Claire did not let those facts guide \n     her efforts. . . .\n       From the very beginning, she made me feel that my problem \n     was worthy of her total effort. . . . In the end, Claire \n     brought the ``mountain to me'' and a large part of my problem \n     was resolved. . . . The frustration that I experienced for so \n     many years with an unresponsive government has been lifted \n     through [her] actions.\n\n  Like so many other letters through the years, it closed by thanking \nClaire.\n  For the past 13 years I have always appreciated Claire's dedication \nas a staff member, but I have been equally blessed to know her as a \nperson. If anyone should doubt, I can testify that Claire has been the \nfunniest person in Oregon politics. She wields her wit like a sword, \nand sometimes it stings. But you can't help but smile even when her \ncomments make you smart.\n  She made it, in part, her job to make sure the various offices did \nnot go to my head, and she was very good at this. When she trained \nlegislative assistants in Salem, she made sure they were trained in how \nto keep their bosses from taking their offices too much to their \nheadbands.\n  Claire has been a full member of my and Mary's extended family. She \njoined the team when my son Jonathan was 2 years old and my daughter \nBrynn was a newborn. She has stepped in to cut down the mountains and \nfill in the valleys, all along this 13-year journey. She gave my son \nJonathan the best gift he ever had, a box of eight classic adventure \nnovels rewritten for a little tyke to read. He enjoyed them immensely. \nShe rescued me when I forgot my I.D. card and could not get through \nairport security. As you can imagine, over the years she has been there \nthrough one crisis, one challenge after another.\n  Claire, I couldn't have done it without you. My family could not have \ndone it without you. Thank you for joining our team and our family and \nworking so hard to make this journey a success.\n  Claire, you have carried on the fight to build a better world, and \nyou have carried on that fight with heart and humor. Thank you. We will \nmiss you. Please enjoy your well-earned retirement and, of course, keep \nin touch. You will always be a valued member of Team Merkley.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                                Adoption\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, that was a beautiful tribute by my \ncolleague.\n  I come to the floor to just speak for a few minutes while we are \ntrying to figure a way forward on a very important piece of legislation \nhaving to do with the transportation infrastructure for our Nation. I \nknow it is a bill that Senator Boxer, as the chair of the EPW \nCommittee, has worked on tirelessly for years along with Senator \nInhofe. It is a very important piece of legislation authorizing \nbillions of dollars of programs and projects. I really want to say that \nI appreciate her leadership so much.\n  I was so hoping the Republican leadership and the Democratic \nleadership could come together so sometime in the next few days we \ncould have some votes relative to this important legislation and move \nforward because I know for the people I represent in Louisiana, this is \none of our most important infrastructure bills.\n  I am sure, Mr. President, you have many people in Pennsylvania \ntalking with you about the importance of getting these road projects \nauthorized. At a time when people are looking for jobs and looking for \nwork, this would be one of the bills we would like to pass. Let's all \nbe patient but not too patient, to get this through because it is very \nimportant.\n  While we are waiting for that, I thought I would come to the floor on \nthis very special day, Valentines Day, to talk about a very special \nkind of love that happens between children and parents. Mr. President, \nyou know because you have been a wonderful leader, along with many \nothers here on the Senate floor, for the idea that every child deserves \na protective family and that children do not do a very good job of \nraising themselves. Governments do not do a good job of raising \nchildren. Children need to be raised in a family. Children should be \nwith their siblings whenever possible, raised in the protective arms \nand under the watchful eye of parents--at least one responsible adult.\n  Mr. President, you know how heartbreaking it is on every day, but \nparticularly a day like today when we are sending cards to our loved \nones. I know the first call I made this morning was\n\n[[Page S608]]\n\nto my husband and to my children to wish them a Happy Valentines--\npeople are doing that all over the world today. In fact, I was given \nsome very interesting information.\n  I had no idea that 180 million Valentine cards were purchased today--\nthat is pretty amazing--200 million roses were sold today, and 36 \nmillion heart-shaped boxes of chocolate will be eaten today. I have not \ngotten my box of chocolate; I don't know if you have. I am still \nlooking for mine.\n  But the sad thing is, there are millions of children who are not \ngoing to receive a phone call today. They are not going to receive a \ncard. They will not receive a box of chocolates, and they may not even \nreceive a pat on the head or a hug or a word of encouragement because \nthey are orphans.\n  These are children who live all over the world and in our own \ncountry, sad to say. We have about 100,000 children in our foster care \nsystem whose parents have had their biological rights terminated \nbecause of either gross neglect or abuse, children who are waiting for \nanother family to step up. The Presiding Officer has been very active \nand successful in passing the adoption tax credit provision that \nprovides some financial assistance to families who are stepping forward \nto adopt children in need in our own country and around the world.\n  There are 100,000 children waiting for that Valentines card or that \nbox of chocolate or a hug or just to belong to a family. Around the \nworld, we don't even know what those numbers are. They are \noverwhelming. We know that in countries that have a high incidence of \nAIDS, for instance, that causes the death of a parent, particularly a \nmom--a dad as well--really that leaves sometimes families of eight \nchildren, nine children, six children abandoned. Even if a grandmother \nsteps in to try to do that work and she dies within a few years, what \nhappens to these children?\n  Well, the Presiding Officer, along with many of my colleagues here, I \nam proud to say, has introduced a resolution today. I wish to thank my \ncosponsors, particularly Senator Lugar, who has been a terrific \nadvocate as the former chair and now ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee; Senator Klobuchar; Senator Grassley, who is my \ncochair on the foster care caucus; Senator Gillibrand; Senator Inhofe, \nwho has probably traveled to more countries--more times to Africa than \nany Senator in the history of our country, and he should be commended \nfor the work he is doing on that continent; and Senator Blumenthal and \nSenator Boozman, who have been outstanding advocates in their own right \nfor different aspects of family policy. We are proud to submit a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. Of course, this does not have the force of \nlaw, but it most certainly expresses our views as a body and does have \nimpact on policymakers around the world, nonprofits, the faith-based \ncommunity, the private sector, and, most importantly, governments \naround the world.\n  People would say: What does the Senate think about this, Senator? You \nsay this, but what do the other Senators think about the fact of \nadoption or international adoption? Do they agree with you that \nchildren belong in a family? Because it is sad to say that there are \nsome places in this world that think children can grow up fine in an \ninstitution or they can grow up fine without parents. Now, we don't \nthink that in the United States. Not only do our hearts and our minds \nand our faith tell us otherwise, but the science also says that \nchildren who grow up in a family of loving nurturing, particularly in \nthe early years--we know this is true raising our own children; I know \nthis as a mother--every year but particularly those early years get the \nconfidence and the affirmation of kindness and gentleness from a \nparent.\n  I have been learning more about this lately, not only how important \nit is, but what I have been learning about is what the science says \nwhen children don't get that. The term that the American Academy of \nPediatrics just released calls it toxic stress--toxic stress on the \nbrain of an infant. They underline how even one caring and supportive \nrelationship with an adult in those early years is so important that it \ncan offset the damaging neurological and physiological affects of \nstress on children. I know adults have stress because I have it myself. \nWhat I didn't realize was that infants--the tiniest little infants--can \nhave toxic stress that affects the development of their brain and their \nability to function.\n  I hope our country will realize how important it is for us to do a \nbetter job of connecting orphans and abandoned infants and neglected \nchildren of all ages--not to put them in an institution, not to turn \nthem out on the street, not to allow them to be trafficked by drug \ncartels or sex traders or people who will exploit them for other \npurposes, but to put them in the arms of a loving family, connecting \nthem to a loving and responsible adult.\n  Of course, we try to keep children in their own biological families \nwhen possible, but if war or disease or death separates them, why don't \nwe think that it is the most important thing in the world--because it \nis--to connect those children to a loving family?\n  That is what this resolution says. It is just as simple as we can say \nit on Valentines Day: For kids who will never get a kiss or a box of \nchocolates or who haven't yet, there is still hope that we can give \nthem a protective family, that we can protect these sibling groups. If \ngovernment would work just a little bit smarter, not even necessarily \nthrowing that much more money at it, although I find we can always use \na little extra, but just working smarter and better and working with \nthe churches, working with faith-based communities around the world, we \ncan connect children to families. That is all this resolution says. It \nexpresses the sense of the Senate. I hope we can pass this by unanimous \nconsent.\n  So when I travel around the world, as I do often, when I am in \nGuatemala or when I am in Uganda or when I have been in places such as \nRussia and in China, and the Senators there or the members or the \npeople, the leaders, ask me, ``What do the other Senators say? Do they \nbelieve this as well?'' I can say, ``Absolutely.'' I am going to carry \nthis resolution with me, and I will show it to them because all this \nresolution says is that every child in the world deserves a protective \nand loving family.\n  So I don't know if Valentines Day will be perfect for many children. \nI hope my children have had a wonderful day today. But we can work a \nlittle harder to try to do our best to make sure they have at least one \ncaring, nurturing, loving adult in their life. It would make a world of \ndifference in our school systems, in our health care systems, in our \ncriminal justice system. It will make our communities stronger. It will \nmake our States and our Nation stronger and ultimately the world. I \nknow the Presiding Officer believes that.\n  I thank the leadership for allowing me to come to the floor and speak \non this today, and hopefully all of my colleagues will vote favorably \nfor this Senate resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  National Crime Victims' Rights Week\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I expect that a resolution authorizing \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week will be adopted unanimously by the \nSenate in a few moments. I wanted to come to the floor today and \nreaffirm my support for the rights and needs of survivors of crime. I \nalso wanted to express my gratitude to the dedicated advocates of crime \nvictims as well as the health and law enforcement professionals who \nwork to fight crime and help its victims recover.\n  Keeping our neighborhoods and communities safe is and will always be \na top priority of this country. But close to 20 million Americans are \nvictims of crime each year, and these individuals and their families \nare confronted with unique and difficult challenges. Acts of crime \ninflict lasting physical, emotional, and psychological wounds that take \ntime and care to heal. It is important that the necessary resources and \nservices be available to help rebuild the lives of crime survivors.\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\n  National Crime Victims' Rights Week, which our Nation has \ncommemorated annually for the last 30 years, renews our commitment to \nthose impacted by crime and the ways we can help them move forward. It \nis a time for remembrance and reflection, a moment to pause and honor \nvictims, advocates, professionals, and volunteers.\n  This year's theme is ambitious but critical: ``Extending the Vision: \nReaching Every Victim.'' This calls on each of us to make sure that all \nvictims get the help they need. Too many victims are still unable to \nreceive the protections and services they deserve. Our efforts toward \nbetter safety and security now are integral to ensuring the safety and \nsecurity of future generations.\n  On April 8, 1981, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the first Crime \nVictims' Rights Week. As a former prosecutor myself, I remember when \nthe concept of victims' rights was practically unknown as few \nmechanisms for victim assistance and support even existed. With this \nfirst proclamation, President Reagan fulfilled an important and long-\nawaited call to put the concerns and rights of crime victims on the \nnational agenda.\n  As President Reagan said in the first proclamation in 1981:\n\n       We need a renewed emphasis on and an enhanced sensitivity \n     to the rights of victims. These rights should be a central \n     concern of those who participate in the criminal justice \n     system, and it is time all of us paid greater heed to the \n     plight of victims.\n\n  This pioneering vision of President Reagan is one we continue to \nembrace today.\n  We are blessed to live in a nation of Good Samaritans, and we have \nachieved impressive strides toward helping crime victims get the \nservices they need. But the task of preventing crime and healing its \nharmful effects remains a constant battle. Technology, globalization, \nand new types of criminal behavior have made the challenge before us \nmore complex than ever before.\n  Our fight against crime in the 21st century will take strategic \npartnerships at the local, State, and national levels. It will rely on \nsupportive, vigilant, and compassionate communities and individuals. \nServing these individuals is more than an act of kindness; it helps \nmake all of our homes, neighborhoods, and communities safer and \nstronger.\n  The resolution I have submitted with Senators Leahy, Schumer, and \nGrassley and which I expect to be passed today supports the mission and \ngoals of this year's National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I urge my \ncolleagues to continue supporting those who have suffered crimes' \neffects and a renewed commitment toward reducing crime during this \nweek, which this year will be observed the week of April 22.\n  In closing, we have come a long way since the days when crime victims \nhad few rights and services. Yet it is also true that too many crimes \nare still committed and too few are reported and that many victims \nstruggle to overcome the lasting effects of crime. I am pleased that \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week offers us the opportunity each year \nto highlight the needs of crime survivors, recognize those who help \nthem, and engage the public in the fight for victims' rights.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, amendment No. 1574 modifying the \nCongressional authorization for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, \nSHEP, is clearly supported in the Constitution. Article I of the \nConstitution grants Congress the power to authorize and appropriate \nfunds and Article I, Section 8, specifically grants Congress the power \n``To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with Indian Tribes.'' The power of Congress to fund the \nSavannah Harbor Expansion Project is unquestionably granted by the \nCommerce Clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has also \nexpressly stated that ``Commerce with foreign nations means commerce \nbetween citizens of the United States and citizens or subjects of \nforeign governments. It means trade, and it means intercourse. It means \ncommercial intercourse between nations, and parts of nations, in all \nits branches. It includes navigation, as the principal means by which \nforeign intercourse is affected.''\n  The power to regulate, authorize, and appropriate funding for the \nports comes from the authority to regulate navigation, arising from the \nCommerce Clause. The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, and by \nextension all harbor deepening projects, involves the general welfare \nof the United States. The Port of Savannah is a turnstile for cargo \nthat impacts the United States as a whole. Congress is permitted to \ncontribute to the project because it would improve the ability of the \nUnited States to receive larger ships entering through the Panama \nCanal. The Project will make national trade more competitive, while \ngreatly impacting the State and the region. Trades, and its relations \n(ports), are fundamental extensions of the congressional power to \nregulate commerce. The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is a \npermissible exercise of Congress's authority to regulate commerce and \ncontributes to the general welfare of the United States. The \nconstitutional ability of Congress to provide funding for the program \nis unquestionable.\n  The Port of Savannah is the second largest container port on the East\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\nCoast and the fourth largest in the country. The Georgia Department of \nEconomic Development recently announced that Georgia exported more than \n$28.7 billion in goods last year, a 20.8 percent increase from 2009 and \nour imports experienced a 27 percent increase last year compared to \n2009. That's well over the overall national increase of 22.6 percent. \nExports accounted for more than 54 percent of the 2.8 million \ncontainers Georgia Ports moved last year. Savannah handles more than 17 \npercent of all container cargo on the East Coast and is an essential \nelement for the creation of new jobs, and the preservation of existing \njobs, in America. The Panama Canal Authority has undertaken a 7 year \n$5.25 billion project to widen the canal to double its capacity by \nallowing larger ships to transit it. After this expansion, the Panama \nCanal will be able to handle vessels of cargo capacity up to 13,000 \ntwenty-foot equivalent units or TEUs, which is the measure of cargo \ncapacity often used to describe the capacity of a container ship. As a \nresult of the canal's expansion and widening, shipping vessels are \nmodernizing their fleet and purchasing a much larger class of vessel. \nThese ``Post Panamax'' and ``New Panamax'' fleets will be comprised of \nvessels much larger than anything on the ocean today.\n  In order to accommodate these vessels, improvements must be made to \nour Nation's existing infrastructure. The Georgia Ports Authority and \nthe State of Georgia are undertaking a project to deepen the port's \nchannel from 42 feet to 48 feet in order to accommodate this larger \nclass of vessels. Doing so will protect existing jobs at the port while \nalso creating new jobs as these larger vessels call in the Port of \nSavannah. It is critically important that we expand not only Savannah \nHarbor but all harbors to ensure they continue to act as gateways for \nbusiness to not only Georgia and the Southeast United States, but the \nentire Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S610-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          RECOGNIZING WILBUR'S OF MAINE CHOCOLATE CONFECTIONS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today millions of Americans across \nthe country will be reminded of the wonders of love and romance. Some \nmay receive a traditional Valentines Day card, others a perfect bouquet \nof fragrant flowers, and several lucky individuals will receive \ndelectable chocolates, perhaps enclosed in a magnificent red heart \nshaped box. While today is Valentines Day, the entire month of February \nis National Chocolate Lover's month, and with these two festive \noccasions in mind, I rise to commend Wilbur's of Maine Chocolate \nConfections located in Freeport, ME.\n  Tom Wilbur and Catherine Carty-Wilbur opened this small chocolatier \nin 1983, with the goal of providing the highest quality chocolate \nproducts to their customers. One of the highlights of Wilbur's is their \nscrumptious Needham candy, which is a unique delicacy of Maine offering \na luxurious blend of chocolate and potato. Wilbur's uses only Maine-\nfarmed potatoes which are among the best in the world in making this \ndelightful treat.\n  Over the years, the store's charm and rich chocolate selection \nwarranted an expansion and Tom and Catherine sought to move from their \noriginal Freeport location to a larger space where they could produce \nmore candy. While garnering funds for expansion, the Wilburs consulted \nwith the Maine Small Business and Technology Development Center \nregarding a seed grant from the Maine Technology Institute, which they \nwere successfully awarded in 2008. This grant allowed Wilbur's to \nfinish research and development on two pieces of equipment, which were \nintegral in enhancing their company's candy production. Today, this \nsmall business has three retail store locations, two in Freeport and \none in Brunswick. Inquisitive customers can even tour one of their \nFreeport locations which doubles as Wilbur's factory!\n  Wilbur's also understands the importance of giving back to their \nlocal community. Recipients of their generous donations include the \nCentral Maine Medical Center as well as Day One in south Portland--a \nnon-profit whose mission is to reduce youth substance abuse. \nAdditionally, to spread the joy of chocolate making, this small \nbusiness frequently holds events to instruct individuals in this unique \ncraft, including a summer program to turn children into junior \nchocolatiers. Earlier this month, Wilbur's even held a fun ``love bug'' \nevent at their Freeport store where individuals could create a special \nValentines treat for their loved ones, and demonstrated Needham-making \nfor the Freeport Historical Society.\n  In light of their delicious product and valued contributions to the \nState, it is no surprise that this small company has received several \naccolades. In both 2010 and 2011, they were honored with the Readers' \nChoice Award for Candy Shops by Downeast Maine Magazine. Furthermore, \nearlier this year Tom and Catherine received the Gowell Award, which is \nthe highest honor bestowed by the New England Retail Confectioner \nAssociation and is only given out once every three years--a truly \nastounding achievement indeed.\n  Throughout the month of February, but especially today, we celebrate \nour love of all things chocolate. Wilbur's of Maine Chocolate \nConfections is a shining example of why everyone's heart truly lights \nup at the thought of consuming delectable chocolate goods. This company \nnot only produces a superior product, but continually provides valuable \ncontributions as active and engaged members of the community. I am \nproud to extend my congratulations to everyone at Wilbur's of Maine \nChocolate Confections for their dedication to excellence, and offer my \nbest wishes for their continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S610-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S610-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S610-4", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 2105.

First authorized in 1964, the Water Resources \nResearch Act established 54 Water Resources Research Institutes across \nthe country and set up a grant program for applied water supply \nresearch. The act was most recently reauthorized in 2006, in PL 109-\n471. The bill I introduce today would reauthorize the grant program for \nthe next 5 years and would add a program focused on the research and \ndevelopment of green infrastructure.\n  The research funded through the Water Resources Research Act has had \nlasting impacts on our Nation's waters. In fact, some of the tools we \nuse today for restoration of the Chesapeake Bay were a product of these \nresearch grants. WRRA Researchers across the Mid-Atlantic States have \ndeveloped ways to keep the Chesapeake waters clean through urban \nstormwater treatment, improved roadway design, and eco-friendly poultry \nfarming practices. Moreover, WRRA-funded projects develop innovative \nand cost-effective solutions for similar water resources issues across \nthe country. For example, the technology used in West Virginia's \ninnovative nutrient trading program utilizes technology developed by \nWRRA researchers. Undoubtedly, funding WRRA is an intelligent and \nnecessary investment in the future of our water resources.\n  WRRA authorizes two types of annual grants. First, it supplies grants \nto each Water Resources Research Institute for research that fosters \nimprovements in water supply reliability, explores new ways to address \nwater problems, encourages dissemination of research to water managers \nand the public, and encourages the entry of new\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\nscientists, engineers and technicians into the water resources field. \nSecond, WRRA authorizes a national competitive grant program to address \nregional water issues. All WRRA grants must be matched 2 to 1 with non-\nfederal funding.\n  In the last authorization period, the program was authorized at \n$12,000,000 per year, providing $6,000,000 to each type of grant. \nAuthorization for these grants expired in fiscal year 2011. Today's \nbill would reauthorize both grant programs for an additional five years \nby providing $7,500,000 for institutional grants and $1,500,000 for \nnational competitive grants. This change in authorization levels \nreflects our efforts to adjust for present fiscal limitations. The \nproposed authorization maximizes economic efficiency of the program \nwithout compromising its efficacy. The Water Resources Research \nInstitutes across the Nation have 45 years of experience assisting \nstates and federal agencies through research, education and outreach. \nWhile the Institutes are only required to match Federal funding with \noutside sources at a ratio of 2 to 1, they regularly exceed that \nproportion, often with ratios of more than 5 to 1. Moreover, Federal \ngrants are critical for the institutes to be able to leverage funding \nfrom their home State. Consequently, by focusing funds on the Water \nResources Research Institutes, we can be sure that we are supporting \ntop-notch science while maximizing cost-effectiveness. Moreover, by \nfunding this network of institutes we are investing in our future. The \nWater Resources Research Institutes are the country's single largest \ntraining program for water scientists, technicians, and engineers.\n  Today water-related issues pervade the nation. Whether it is floods, \ndroughts, or water degradation, American economies and lives depend on \nour water resources. WRRA grants provide us with improved understanding \nof water-related issues and better technology to address them. Nearly \nhalf a century after the Water Resources Research grant program was \nfirst put in place, this program is just as relevant, just as critical, \nand deserves our support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2104\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance the security and resiliency of the cyber \nand communications infrastructure of the United States; read the first \ntime.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to introduce the \nCyber Security Act of 2012. I am here with Senator Susan Collins. I \nthank her for all the work we have done together in what has been a \nwonderfully bipartisan, nonpartisan relationship to deal with a very \nserious national problem. I am honored that we are joined in \nintroducing this bill by the chairs of the two committees that have \nbeen most involved in questions of cyber security, chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Rockefeller, and the chair of the \nIntelligence Committee of the Senate, Senator Feinstein of California. \nWe have also had the involvement of the chairs and others on the \nForeign Relations Committee, Judiciary Committee, and Energy Committee. \nI am very proud this is a bill that Senators Collins and Rockefeller \nand Feinstein and I introduced today.\n  I wish to give particular thanks to the majority leader, Senator \nReid, for his unflagging support, based on his personal concern about \ncyber defenses and based on classified briefings he received on this \nproblem. He pushed us to work across party and committee lines to pull \nthe bill together that we are introducing today.\n  It is interesting to note--since there has been a lot of commentary \nin the last 24 hours about President Obama's budget--that President \nObama has recognized, in the most tangible terms, the danger that \nconfronts us by recommending adding at least $300 million in the coming \nyear to our cyber security effort.\n  Still, I know that while it is February 14, 2012, those of us who \nhave worked on this problem fear that when it comes to protecting \nAmerica from cyber attack, it may be September 10, 2001, all over \nagain. The question is whether America will confront this grave threat \nto our security before it happens, before our enemies attack.\n  We are being bled of our intellectual property every day by cyber \nthieves. The consequences of their thievery are very real to America's \neconomy, our prosperity, and indeed our capacity to create jobs and \nhold the ones we have.\n  Enemies probe the weaknesses in our critical national assets every \nday, waiting until the time is right, through cyber attack, to cripple \nour economy or attack, for instance, a city's electric grid with the \ntouch of a key on the other side of the world.\n  The fact is our cyber defenses are not what they should be, but such \nas they are they are blinking red. Yet, again, I fear we will not be \nable to connect the dots to prevent a 9/11-type cyber attack on America \nbefore it happens. The aim of this bill is to make sure we don't \nscramble here in Congress after such an attack to do what we can and \nshould do today.\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\n  Intellectual property worth billions of dollars has already been \nstolen, giving our international competitors access in the global \nmarketplace without ever having to invest a dime in research.\n  The fact is that even the most sophisticated companies are being \npenetrated, and our adversaries are using information learned in one \nintrusion to plan the next more sophisticated one.\n  Last year, the computer security firm McAfee conducted a study of 70 \nspecific instances of data theft, and they issued a report on those \ninstances. They included 13 defense contractors, 6 industrial plants, \nand 8 American and Canadian Government networks. Based on that report, \nthe former vice president of McAfee, Dmitri Alperovitch, issued this \nominous warning:\n\n       I am convinced that every company in every conceivable \n     industry with significant size and valuable intellectual \n     property and trade secrets has been compromised--or will be \n     shortly--with the great majority of the victims rarely \n     discovering the intrusion or its impact.\n\n  In fact, I divide this entire set of Fortune Global 2000 firms into \ntwo categories: those that know they've been compromised and those that \ndon't yet know.\n  These examples, of course, are deeply alarming, but in addition, \nlurking out in the ether are computer worms such as Stuxnet that can \ncommandeer the computers that control heavy machinery and potentially \nallow an intruder to open and close key valves and switches in \npipelines, refineries, factories, water and sewer systems, and electric \nplants in our country without detection by their operators.\n  Obviously, this capacity could be used by an enemy to attack our \ncountry and do damage not only comparable to 9/11 but far in excess of \nit. Depending on the target or targets, these kinds of cyber attacks \ncould lead to terrible physical destruction, massive loss of life, \nmassive evacuations, and, of course, widespread economic disruption.\n  Owners of these critical systems; that is, private sector owners--\nand, remember, most of private infrastructure in America is privately \nowned and is what this bill is talking about--have sometimes told us we \ndon't need to worry about the security of their systems because they \nare not connected to the Internet. But the reality today is that is \nsimply not correct. The experts have told us that a truly air-gapped \nsystem, as they call it; that is, one not connected to the Internet--is \nas rare as a blizzard in the Caribbean. If it exists, our best cyber \nexperts have yet to see it. And Stuxnet has shown us it doesn't matter \nif a system is air gapped, because one thumb drive plugged into a \ncomputer can lead to an infection that spreads.\n  If we don't act now to secure our computer network, sometime in the \nfuture--and I believe it will be in the near future--we will be forced \nto act in the middle of a mega cyber crisis or right after one that has \nhad an enormous, perhaps catastrophic, effect on our country. That is \nwhy we introduced this bill, and that is why we look forward to the \ndebate on it, and why we hope it will pass and be enacted before a \ncyber catastrophe occurs in America.\n  Let me briefly describe some of the important work this bill does. \nFirst, it ensures the computer systems--private systems--that control \nour most critical infrastructure that are currently not secure are made \nsecure. Our bill defines critical infrastructure narrowly to include \nthose systems that, if brought down, or commandeered in a cyber attack \nwould lead to mass casualties, evacuations of major population centers, \nthe collapse of financial markets, or degradation of our national \nsecurity. This is critical infrastructure. After identifying the \nprecise systems that meet the definition of high risk, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security would, under our legislation, then work with the \nprivate sector operators of those systems to develop cyber security \nperformance requirements based on risk assessments of those sectors. \nThe private sector owners would then have some flexibility to meet \nthose performance requirements with hardware or software they choose so \nlong as it achieves the required level of security.\n  The Department of Homeland Security will not be picking technological \nwinners and losers, so there is nothing in this bill that would stifle \ninnovation. In fact, I think quite the contrary. If a company can show \nit already has met high security standards, it will be exempt from \nthese requirements. The bill focuses on securing that which is not \nsecure today, not on putting new requirements on industries that are \ndoing everything they should be doing to protect themselves and our \nnational security.\n  Once these improved security systems come on line, I think many \ncompanies will want to apply them to noncritical systems that are not \ncovered by this bill as a way to protect the privacy of their employees \nand customers, as well as giving these companies the chance to offer \nsecure e-commerce services. But that will be up to each company.\n  This bill also seeks to make compliance easier, more rational for \ncovered critical infrastructure operators by creating a more \nstreamlined and efficient cyber organization within the Department of \nHomeland Security. And at each step in the process created by our bill, \nthe Department of Homeland Security must work with existing Federal \nregulators and the private sector they regulate to ensure no rules or \nregulations are put in place that duplicate or conflict with existing \nrequirements. If a company feels the designation of its networks as \ncritical infrastructure is somehow wrong, it has the right to appeal \nthat decision through a system that the law requires DHS to set up or \nthey can go to Federal district court.\n  This bill also establishes mechanisms for information sharing between \nthe private sector and the Federal Government and among the private \nsector operators themselves.\n  Senator Feinstein and her committee made a significant contribution \nto this part of our bill. This is important because computer security \nexperts in the private and public sectors need to be able to share \ninformation, compare notes, in order to protect us against the evolving \ncyber threat.\n  Our proposal also creates appropriate security measures and oversight \nto protect privacy and preserve civil liberties. In fact, I was pleased \nto read recently that the American Civil Liberties Union said it had \nstudied our bill and found it offers the greatest privacy protections \nof all the cyber security legislation that has been proposed.\n  I am going to jump forward a little so I can yield to my \ndistinguished ranking member in a moment.\n  I have discussed some of the things the bill does, but I want to \nmention two it doesn't do.\n  One myth about this bill is that it contains a kill switch that would \nallow the President of the United States in an emergency to seize \ncontrol of the Internet. There is nothing remotely like that in this \nbill. At one time we had considered language that would, in fact, have \nlimited powers the President has under the Communications Act of 1934 \nto take over electronic communications in times of war. But that \nprovision was so widely misunderstood or misrepresented that we dropped \nit rather than risk losing the chance to pass the rest of this urgently \nneeded legislation.\n  I also want to make clear that nothing in this bill touches on any of \nthe issues that quite recently have inflamed our consideration of the \nStop Online Piracy Act or the Protect IP Act, known as PIPA. Many \nMembers in the Chamber have, metaphorically speaking, scars that still \nshow from that experience. No need to fear this bill. This bill does \nnothing to affect the day-to-day workings of the Internet. Internet \npiracy and copyright protections are important concerns in the digital \nage. We have to deal with that at some point, but they are simply not \npart of this bill.\n  One final thing I do want to deal with is a complaint from, among \nothers, our Chamber of Commerce that we are ``rushing forward with \nlegislation that has not been fully vetted.'' Not true. This bipartisan \nlegislation has been 3 years in the making, and its outlines have not \nonly been shared with stakeholders and the public but their input has \nhelped shape this final version of the bill we are introducing today.\n  More than 20 hearings on cyber security have been held across seven \ndifferent Senate committees, with dozens more held on questions related \nto cyber security. In fact, our own committee, since 2005, has held \nnine hearings on the subject and will hold another one\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\nthis Thursday where we will hear reactions to this bill.\n  I am very pleased to say that Senator Reid continues to be very \ncommitted to seeing us do everything we can to adopt legislation to \nprotect our American cyber systems. I believe it is the leader's intent \nto bring up this bill in the next work period. I hope so. Because the \ntruth is, time is not on our side. We are not adequately protected at \nthis moment, and the capabilities of those who are attacking us for \neconomic reasons or who prepare to attack us for strategic reasons \ngrows larger and larger.\n  I do want to say we have a growing number of companies in the private \nsector--information technology, cyber security and other companies in \ncritical infrastructure areas--that are coming to support this bill. \nTwo I want to mention are SISCO and Oracle, which gives you some sense \nof the range of support for the bill.\n  Bottom line, I think this is a subject around which we should have a \ngood healthy debate, an open amendment process, and a bipartisan \nagreement, because this is not at all about regulation, it is about our \nmost fundamental national economic security and public safety.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I do rise today to introduce with the \nchairman of the Homeland Security Committee Senator Lieberman, as well \nas Senator Rockefeller and Senator Feinstein, the Cyber Security Act of \n2012. As always, it has been a great pleasure to work with my friend \nand colleague from Connecticut on what I believe is the most important \ninitiative we have come together on since perhaps our 2004 Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act.\n  I am also delighted that three Senate chairmen who have significant \njurisdiction in this area--Senators Lieberman, Rockefeller, and \nFeinstein--have come together. We have all worked very hard on this \nbill. I also want to commend the staff of our committee, which has \nworked extraordinarily hard over several years to produce this bill. \nOur legislation would provide the Federal Government and the private \nsector with the tools necessary to protect our most critical \ninfrastructure from growing cyber threats.\n  Earlier this month, FBI Director Robert Mueller warned that the cyber \nthreat will soon equal or surpass the threat from terrorism. He argued \nthat we should be addressing the cyber threat with the same intensity \nwe have applied to the terrorist threat.\n  Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper made the point even \nmore strongly. He described the cyber threat as:\n\n       A profound threat to this country, to its future, its \n     economy and its very being.\n\n  These warnings are the latest in a chorus of warnings from current \nand former officials. Last November, the Director of the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, warned that malicious \ncyber attacks threaten a growing number of the systems with which we \ninteract each and every day--the electric grid, our water treatment \nplants, and key financial systems.\n  Similarly, GEN Keith Alexander, commander of U.S. Cyber Command, and \ndirector of the National Security Agency, has warned that the cyber \nvulnerabilities we face are extraordinary and characterized by ``a \ndisturbing trend from exploitation to disruption to destruction. ``\n  As Senator Lieberman has pointed out, the threat is not only to our \nnational security but also to our economic well-being.\n  A study by the company, Norton, last year calculated the cost of \nglobal cyber crime at $114 billion annually. When combined with the \nvalue of time that victims lost due to cyber crime, this figure grows \nto $388 billion globally, which Norton described as ``significantly \nmore'' than the global black market in marijuana, cocaine, and heroin \ncombined.\n  In an op-ed last month titled, ``China's Cyber Thievery Is National \nPolicy--And Must Be Challenged,'' former DNI Mike McConnell, former \nHomeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, and former Deputy \nSecretary of Defense William Lynn noted the ability of cyberterrorists \nto cripple our critical infrastructure, and they sounded an even more \nurgent alarm about the threat of economic cyber espionage.\n  Citing an October 2011 report to Congress by the Office of the \nNational Counterintelligence Executive, they warned of the catastrophic \nimpact that cyber espionage--particularly that pursued by China--could \nhave on our economy and our competitiveness. They estimated that the \ncost easily means billions of dollars and millions of jobs. This threat \nis all the more menacing because it is being pursued by a global \ncompetitor seeking to steal the research and development of American \nfirms to undermine our economic leadership.\n  The evidence of our cyber security vulnerability is overwhelming and \ncompels us to act. As the chairman mentioned, since 2005, our Homeland \nSecurity Committee has held nine hearings on the cyber threat. In 2010, \nChairman Lieberman, Senator Carper, and I introduced our cyber security \nbill, which was reported by the committee later that same year. Since \nlast year, we have been working with Chairman Rockefeller to merge our \nbill with legislation he has championed which was reported by the \nCommerce Committee.\n  Lately, after incorporating changes based on the feedback of our \ncolleagues, the private sector, and the administration, we have \nproduced a new version which we introduced today. Some of our \ncolleagues have urged us to focus very narrowly on the Federal \nInformation Security Management Act, as well as on Federal research and \ndevelopment, and improved information sharing. We do need to address \nthose issues, and our bill does address those important issues.\n  Again, as did Senator Lieberman, I commend Senator Feinstein for her \ncontributions in the area of improved information sharing, and Senator \nCarper for the work he has done on the Federal Information Security \nManagement Act. But the fact remains that with 85 percent of our \nNation's critical infrastructure owned by the private sector, \ngovernment also has a critical role in ensuring that the most vital \nparts of that critical infrastructure--those whose disruption could \nresult in truly catastrophic consequences, such as mass casualties or \nmass evacuations--meet reasonable, risk-based performance standards.\n  In an editorial this week, the Washington Post concurred, writing \nthat:\n\n       Our critical systems have remained unprotected. To accept \n     the status quo would be an unacceptable risk to U.S. national \n     security.\n\n  The Post got it exactly right.\n  Some of our colleagues are skeptical about the need for any new \nregulations. There is no one who has worked harder than I have to \noppose regulations that would unnecessarily burden our economy and cost \nus jobs. But we need to distinguish between regulations that hurt our \neconomy and are not necessary and hinder our international \ncompetitiveness versus regulations that are necessary for our national \nsecurity and that promote rather than hinder our economic prosperity, \nthose that strengthen our economy and our Nation.\n  The fact is the risk-based performance requirements in our bill are \ntargeted carefully. They only apply to specific systems and assets--not \nentire companies--that, if damaged, could reasonably be expected to \nresult in mass casualties, huge evacuations, catastrophic economic \ndamages, or a severe degradation of our national security. In other \nwords, we are talking about truly catastrophic impacts. Moreover, the \nowners of critical infrastructure, not the government, would select and \nimplement the cyber security measures the owners determine to be best \nsuited to satisfy the risk-based cyber security performance \nrequirements.\n  Our new bill would also require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nselect from among existing industry practices and standards or choose \nperformance requirements proposed by the private sector--lots of \ncollaboration and consultation. Only if none of these mitigates the \nrisks identified through this public-private collaboration could the \nSecretary propose something different. That is extremely unlikely to \nhappen.\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\n  The bill prohibits the regulation of the design and development of \ncommercial IT products. It would require that existing requirements and \ncurrent regulators be used wherever possible. The bill would allow \nFederal officials to waive the bill's requirements when existing \nregulations or security measures are already sufficiently robust.\n  As with our earlier versions of this bill, companies in substantial \ncompliance with the performance requirements at the time of a cyber \nincident would receive liability protection from any punitive damages \nassociated with an incident, giving them an incentive to comply.\n  The fact remains that improving cyber security is absolutely \nessential. We cannot afford to wait for a cyber 9/11 before taking \naction. The warnings could not be clearer about the vulnerabilities and \nthe threat to our systems. Every single day nation states, terrorist \ngroups, cyber criminals, and hackers probe our systems both in the \npublic and the private sectors, and they have been successful over and \nover in their intrusions.\n  We don't want to look back after a catastrophic cyber event and say: \nWhy didn't we act? How could we have ignored all of these warnings? So \nI would encourage our colleagues to continue to work with us and to \ncome together and enact this vitally needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, when most Americans think of cyber \nsecurity, they conjure up an image of somebody having a credit card \nnumber stolen, for example, or a prankster using their Twitter account \nor somebody downloading a movie without paying for it. And although \nthat is all true and important, it is not dangerous. The internet is \ncentral to our lives, our economy, and our society. Any insecurity is a \nworry. I will expand.\n  We are here today because the experts are warning us that we are on \nthe brink of something much worse, something that could bring down our \neconomy, rip open our national security or even take lives. The \nprospect of mass casualty is what has propelled us to make cyber \nsecurity a top priority for this year, to make it an issue that \ntranscends political parties or ideology.\n  Consider the warning signs: Hackers now seem to be able to routinely \ncrack the codes of our government agencies, including the most \nsensitive ones. They do so routinely with our Fortune 500 companies, \nand then everything in between. ADM Mike Mullen, former Joint Chiefs of \nStaff Chairman, said that a cyber security threat is the only other \nthreat that is on the same level as Russia's stockpile of nuclear \nweapons--loose nukes, if you will. FBI Director Robert Mueller \ntestified to Congress very recently that the cyber threat will soon \novercome terrorism as the top national security focus of the FBI. Think \nabout that--cyber threats will be as dangerous as terrorism.\n  Cyber threats and the prospects of a widespread cyber attack could \npotentially be as devastating to this country as the terrorist strikes \nthat tore apart this country just 10 short years ago. How is that \npossible, you ask. Think about how many people could die if a cyber \nterrorist attacked our air traffic control system--both now and when it \nis made modern--and our planes slammed into one another or if rail-\nswitching networks were hacked, causing trains carrying people--and \nmore than that, perhaps hazardous material, toxic materials--to derail \nor collide in the midst of our most populated urban areas, such as \nChicago, New York, San Francisco, Washington, DC, et cetera. What about \nan attack on networks that run a pipeline, refinery, or a chemical \nfactory, causing temperature and pressure imbalance, leading to an \nexplosion equivalent to a massive bomb, or an attack on a power grid, \nshutting down generators and killing electricity going into cities and \nour hospitals. In short, we are on the brink of what could be a \ncalamity.\n  President Bush's last Director of National Intelligence and President \nObama's first Director of National Intelligence in consecutive years \nsaid that cyber security was the major national security threat facing \nthis Nation. Are we paying attention? We can act now and try to prepare \nourselves as best we can or we can wait and we will be surprised with \nwhat happens.\n  I am here to argue that we should act now to prevent a cyber \ndisaster. That is what this bill would do. Working with my friends \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Collins, we have written legislation that \nI believe strikes the right balance, addressing the danger without \nputting an undue new set of regulations on business.\n  Our bill would determine the greatest cyber vulnerabilities \nthroughout our critical infrastructure; protect and promote private \nsector innovation, creativity, and encourage private sector leadership \nand real accountability in securing their private systems; and improve \nthreat and vulnerability information sharing between the government and \nthe private sector, while protecting as best as we can privacy and \ncivil liberties. It will improve the security of the Federal Government \nnetworks, including our most sensitive ones that are now being hacked \ninto; clarify the roles and responsibilities of Federal agencies; \nstrengthen our cyber workforce; coordinate cyber security research and \ndevelopment; and promote public awareness of cyber vulnerabilities to \nensure a better informed and more alert citizenry, frankly.\n  Let me say again that this is bipartisan and was written to address \nthe many concerns that surfaced 3 years ago when we first raised this \nissue and, frankly, when we started writing this bill. We held meetings \nwith all sides and incorporated hundreds of specific suggestions and, \nin short, tried to do what we do with any important and large piece of \nlegislation--make a lot of people really think deeply and come up with \na compromise to which everyone can agree.\n  Earlier this month, an association of major high-tech companies \npraised our approach. Generally, they do. We have talked with industry, \nwith the White House, with everybody hundreds of times over a period of \n3 years, and in the end we settled on a plan that creates no new \nbureaucracy or heavyhanded regulation. However, it is premised on \ncompanies taking responsibility for securing their own networks, with \ngovernment assistance as necessary. Will they do that?\n  I think back to 2000 and 2001 when we all saw signs of people moving \nin and out of the country. We were not quite sure what that meant. We \nsaw dots appear to connect, but did they or didn't they? And we knew \nsomething new and something different and something dangerous just \nmight be upon us, but we didn't drill down. Our intelligence and \nnational security leadership took these matters very seriously, as best \nas they possibly could, but in the end not seriously enough. It was too \nlate--September 11 happened.\n  Today, with a new set of warnings flashing before us on a different \nsubject--cyber security and a wide range of new challenges to our \nsecurity and our safety--we again face a choice: act now and put in \nplace safeguards to protect this country and our people or act later \nwhen it is too late. I hope we act now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN of Ohio (for himself, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Udall of \n        New Mexico):\n  S. 2108. A bill to amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to \nprovide for the establishment of Youth Corps programs and provide for \nwider dissemination of the Youth Corps model; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, today, only 54 percent of Americans \nages 18 to 24 have jobs--the lowest employment rate for young people \nsince this data was first collected in 1948. It is a job deficit that \ncripples our economy in both the short-term and long-term. But it's \nalso a deficit we can close if we do the right thing and invest in \nprograms that help young people find the jobs they--and our economy--\nneed. That is why I am introducing the Youth Corps Act of 2012.\n  The Youth Corps Act of 2012 would establish a competitive grant \nprogram in the Workforce Investment Act to expand the Youth Corps \nprogram across the Nation.\n  The Youth Corps is a direct descendent of President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, his most successful and \npopular New Deal program aimed at helping young men find employment \nduring the Great Depression.\n  From 1933 to 1942, more than 3 million young men served in the \nCivilian\n\n[[Page S620]]\n\nConservation Corps dramatically improving the Nation's public land, \nwhile also receiving food, housing, education, and a small stipend. \nThey helped plant nearly 3 billion trees to reforest the nation, \nconstructed more than 800 parks nationwide, and built a network of \npublic roadways in remote areas. In Ohio, their legacy persists across \nour State in organizations like the Muskingum Conservancy Watershed \nDistrict, which provides the system that protects thousands of acres of \nland from flooding.\n  Today, more than 30,000 young men and women participate annually in \nthe Youth Corps program in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. \nSome Corps members improve and preserve public lands and national \nparks, while others work with students in our Nation's public schools. \nFinally, some members provide disaster preparation and recovery \nservices to underresourced communities.\n  The Youth Corps Act of 2012 would provide more young adults with the \nopportunity to experience Youth Corps, while ensuring a steady source \nof funding for these programs. Currently, funding for Youth Corps \nprograms comes from a wide variety of sources, forcing many Corps to \noperate with uncertainty. By investing in Youth Corps, we are investing \nin our Nation's future teachers and principals, doctors and lawyers.\n  The men and women who participate in Youth Corps are selfless, \ndedicated, and passionate people. While some may have faced challenges \nduring their childhood or struggled in school, all of them are \ninterested in bridging the gap between education and opportunity that \ntoo often plagues our communities. With the guidance of an adult \ncommunity leader, a modest stipend, and support services like education \nand career preparation, participants are able to gain valuable life and \ncareer skills.\n  Ohio is home to three Youth Corps programs: the WSOS Quilter \nConservation Corps, City Year Cleveland, and City Year Columbus. \nMembers of these Corps provide a great public service to the citizens \nof Ohio--a legacy like that of the CCC which will persist for \ngenerations.\n  The WSOS Quilter Conservation Corps members serve as Benefit and Tax \nCounselors, helping low-income individuals file their State and Federal \ntaxes, apply for benefits like health care coverage, home energy \nassistance, child care subsidies and food stamps.\n  Members of City Year Cleveland and City Year Columbus serve as \nmentors and educators in our most challenged schools.\n  My daughter, Elizabeth, was a City Year Corps Member in Philadelphia, \nand my other daughter, Caitlin, was a member of City Year in \nProvidence.\n  City Year is a national model on how each of us can serve our Nation. \nFor this reason, we must invest more in these vital programs.\n  Each of these programs improves our state while providing skills to \nour Nation's future leaders. And for this reason, we must invest more \nin these important programs.\n  That is why I am proud to introduce the Youth Corps Act of 2012. By \nempowering our young people to serve their communities, we can help \nprovide them with the skills they need to find jobs, strengthen our \neconomy, and enrich our communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 2109. A bill to approve the settlement of water rights claims of \nthe Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, and the allottees of the Navajo \nNation and Hopi Tribe in the State of Arizona, to authorize \nconstruction of municipal water projects relating to the water rights \nclaims, to resolve litigation against the United States concerning \nColorado River operations affecting the States of California, Arizona, \nand Nevada, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain and myself, I am \npleased to introduce the Navajo-Hopi Little Colorado River Water Rights \nSettlement Act of 2012. This is S. 2109.\n  It is propitious as the State of Arizona today celebrates its \ncentennial--its 100th birthday--that we also have the opportunity to \nresolve significant water rights issues for the Navajo Nation, the Hopi \nTribe, and water users throughout the Southwest. Indeed, the legal \narguments for the claims being settled predate Arizona's induction into \nthe Union. It is also worth noting that for more than two decades--more \nthan 20 percent of Arizona's statehood time--hundreds of individuals in \nArizona and here in Washington have worked hard to settle all these \nclaims.\n  The protracted, and at times contentious, negotiations are a \nreflection of water's fundamental importance as well as the care and \nattention communities in the Southwest have given to managing this very \nlimited resource. For many on the Navajo and Hopi Reservations, \nhowever, management of the resource is nothing more than a mirage.\n  It shocks the conscience in this day and age that many on the Navajo \nand Hopi Reservations only have access to the amount of water they can \nhaul--in some instances literally by horse and wagon--to the remote \nreaches of the reservations. While this picture of conditions near \nDilkon on the Navajo Reservation could be confused as a depiction of \nconditions at the time Arizona became a State in 1912, it was taken in \njust August of last year.\n  We can see that it depicts, as in many other areas of the \nreservation, that between one-third and one-half of the households lack \ncomplete plumbing facilities, with many families being forced to haul \nwater significant distances. That is what we see depicted in this \nphotograph. This has become a way of life on the reservation--a full-\ntime job that limits economic opportunities and perpetuates a cycle of \npoverty. What is more, this lack of clean, readily available drinking \nwater significantly impacts the health and safety of the Navajo and \nHopi people. There are higher rates of disease and infant mortality and \na lack of sufficient water supplies to meet fire-suppression needs. It \nis inconceivable in 2012 that Navajo and Hopi families are still living \nin these conditions.\n  Legally, the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe may assert claims to \nlarger quantities of water, but, as seen here, they do not have the \nmeans to make use of those supplies in a safe and productive manner. \nAmong water law practitioners, the tribes may be said to have ``paper'' \nwater, as opposed to ``wet'' water. Those claims are far-reaching, \nextending beyond the mesas and plateaus of northern Arizona and calling \ninto question water uses even in California and Nevada.\n  The legislation we introduce today, however, would resolve many of \nthose issues. In exchange for legal waivers, the Navajo Nation and the \nHopi Tribe would receive critical drinking water infrastructure. The \nthree groundwater projects contemplated by this act would deliver much \nneeded drinking water supplies to the impoverished areas of the Navajo \nand Hopi Reservations.\n  It is also important to note that this settlement would facilitate \nwater deliveries to the eastern part of the Navajo reservation through \nthe Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project, a project that has not only \nbeen approved by Congress but was one of 14 projects chosen by the \nPresident in October for expedited environmental review and permitting. \nAlthough that expedited project may deliver 6,411 acre-feet of water to \nNavajo communities in Arizona, such deliveries cannot occur until the \nNavajo claims in Arizona have been resolved. This settlement \naccomplishes that goal, reallocating water for delivery through the \nNavajo-Gallup pipeline.\n  Importantly, this settlement would not only inure to the benefit of \nthe Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe, but it would also provide \nimmeasurable benefits to non-Indian communities throughout Arizona, \nCalifornia, and Nevada. Without a settlement, resolution of the tribes' \nclaims would take years, require parties to expend significant sums, \ncreate continued uncertainty concerning water supplies, and seriously \nimpair the economic well-being of all of the parties to the settlement.\n  For example, municipalities, farmers, ranchers, and industrial water \nusers in northern Arizona would be able to better plan for their water \nfuture without the uncertainty and expense of continuing costly \nlitigation against the tribes. Likewise, water users from the Imperial \nValley of California to the Las Vegas Strip would be\n\n[[Page S621]]\n\nable to take comfort in the knowledge that lower Colorado River water-\nmanagement regulations that they spent years developing would no longer \nbe subject to challenge by the Navajo Nation.\n  In addition to resolving the tribes' claims to the Little Colorado \nRiver, this settlement sets the table for future negotiations regarding \nthe lower Colorado River. The settlement, among other things, reserves \nwater for future negotiation of those claims. In doing so, this bill \nacknowledges the importance of those settlement negotiations to the \ntribes and the non-Indian communities throughout the Southwest.\n  I have had the privilege to work on a number of water settlements \nthroughout my career. Each has been rewarding and served to meet \nsignificant needs for both the American Indian and non-Indian \ncommunities involved. In that same regard, I am pleased to have had the \nopportunity to work with the many parties who have negotiated this \nsettlement, and I am committed to bringing it to fruition through \ncongressional enactment.\n  I believe this bill represents the best opportunity for all of the \nparties and for the American taxpayer to achieve a fair result. The \nsettlement resolves significant legal claims, limits legal exposure, \navoids protracted litigation costs, and, most important, saves lives. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  As we move forward with the request for hearings that we will need to \nhold and hopefully, after that, bringing this legislation, after \nproperly marking it up, to the floor of the Senate, Senator McCain and \nI will have much more to say about how the settlement came about, what \nits importance is to the people of Arizona, describing the legal \nconsequences of it, and what it means to the future of my State.\n  I am particularly pleased that all of the parties in Arizona--\nliterally hundreds of people came together to reach an agreement that \nwe could then embody in legislation that I could introduce on the day \nof Arizona's birthday, its centennial, its 100th birthday, as another \nimportant event in the history of our State. I think it would be a \nfitting birthday present to the people of the State Arizona if our \ncolleagues will help us in ensuring that this legislation can be \nadopted in this centennial year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2109\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 372\n\n       Whereas the Governments and people of the United States and \n     Egypt enjoy a long history of a strong strategic partnership;\n       Whereas the United States Government seeks to maintain \n     robust bilateral relations with the Government and people of \n     Egypt so that they may continue to work together toward our \n     shared goals of peace, security, and economic prosperity in \n     Egypt and the region;\n       Whereas, on February 11, 2011, peaceful mass protests \n     succeeded in bringing an end to the authoritarian rule of \n     Hosni Mubarak;\n       Whereas the United States Government and the international \n     community stood by the people of Egypt as they began to \n     undertake their transition to a democracy;\n       Whereas there have been numerous clashes between security \n     personnel and protesters, including Egyptians who were \n     calling for a swifter transition to civilian-led rule;\n       Whereas, on November 28 and 29, 2011, the first of three \n     rounds of parliamentary elections began in Egypt, which have \n     been deemed largely free and fair by civil society observers \n     and monitors;\n       Whereas United States-based organizations such as the \n     National Democratic Institute, the International Republican \n     Institute, Freedom House, and the International Center for \n     Journalists were in Egypt to support and promote democratic \n     activity, including elections, adherence to the rule of law, \n     and the existence of a free press;\n       Whereas certain of those organizations had been operating \n     openly in Egypt for many years, had long sought formal \n     registration and had never received rejections of their \n     applications, had exhibited an unprecedented level of \n     transparency, and had only recently become the targets of \n     malicious reporting by state-run media in Egypt;\n       Whereas, on December 29, 2011, the Government of Egypt \n     raided the offices of the National Democratic Institute, the \n     International Republican Institute, Freedom House, the \n     International Center for Journalists, and several other \n     Egyptian and international civil society organizations in \n     Egypt, confiscating their property and equipment;\n       Whereas the Government of Egypt announced that it would \n     launch investigations into hundreds of civil society \n     organizations, has targeted and interrogated staff of these \n     organizations, and has imposed restrictions on the movement \n     of United States citizens who are staff members of these \n     organizations, including placing them on a ``no-fly'' list to \n     prohibit departure from the country;\n       Whereas, on February 5, 2012, the Government of Egypt \n     announced that it would refer for arrest more than 40 staff \n     members of various nongovernmental organizations, among them \n     16 United States citizens, including staff of the United \n     States-based National Democratic Institute, the International \n     Republican Institute, Freedom House, the International Center \n     for Journalists, and Germany-based Konrad Adenauer Stiftung;\n       Whereas in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 \n     (Public Law 112-74), Congress conditioned economic and \n     military assistance to Egypt on the Secretary of State's \n     certification that Egypt is meeting its obligations under the \n     1979 Peace Treaty with Israel and that it is supporting the \n     transition to a civilian government, including by holding \n     free and fair elections and protecting freedoms of \n     expression, association, and religion and due process of law;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has stated that \n     the United States Government has ``deep concerns about what \n     is happening to our NGOs, and Americans and others who work \n     for them. . . We do not believe there is any basis for these \n     investigations, these raids on the sites that the NGOs \n     operate out of, the seizure of their equipment, and certainly \n     no basis for prohibiting the exit from the country by \n     individuals who have been working with our NGOs.'';\n       Whereas restricting the space for civil society engagement \n     dishonors the promise of the Egyptian revolution and could \n     potentially damage the country's transition to democracy; and\n       Whereas, according to Secretary of State Clinton, ``We have \n     worked very hard the last year to put into place financial \n     assistance and other support for the economic and political \n     reforms that are occurring in Egypt, and we will have to \n     closely review these matters as it comes time for us to \n     certify whether or not any of these funds from our government \n     can be made available under these circumstances.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the central and historic importance of the \n     United States-Egyptian strategic partnership in advancing the \n     common interests of both countries, including peace and \n     security in the broader Middle East and North Africa;\n       (2) reiterates its support for the people of Egypt during a \n     difficult political transition towards a more representative \n     and responsive democratic government;\n       (3) praises the work that United States democracy promotion \n     organizations such as the National Democratic Institute, the \n     International Republican Institute, Freedom House, and the \n     International Center for Journalists, do internationally to \n     strengthen civic institutions, democratic practice, political \n     parties, the rule of law, respect for human rights, and \n     protections for independent media;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment of the Government and people \n     of the United States to universal rights of freedom of \n     expression, religion, assembly, and association, including \n     Internet freedom;\n       (5) notes the critical role civil society plays in \n     democratic societies and applauds the work of democracy \n     promotion, human rights, and developmental organizations in \n     Egypt;\n       (6) expresses deep concern at the intimidation and media \n     manipulation against democracy activists and Egyptian and \n     international civil society organizations in Egypt;\n       (7) urges the Government of Egypt to protect civil \n     liberties for all citizens, embrace transparency and \n     accountability, and promote the creation of a vibrant civil \n     society;\n       (8) calls upon the Government of Egypt to immediately cease \n     its intimidation and prosecution of civil society workers and \n     democracy activists of all nationalities in Egypt, including \n     Egyptians, and to allow non-Egyptian civil society workers to \n     voluntarily leave the country; and\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\n       (9) calls on the Government of Egypt to halt harassment, \n     including that conducted via state media, of democracy and \n     human rights activists in Egypt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S637-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 373--RECOGNIZING FEBRUARY 14, 2012, AS THE CENTENNIAL \n                        OF THE STATE OF ARIZONA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been \n     to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system \n     that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all \n     States;\n       (2) that objective has been attained, and the Interstate \n     System connecting all States is near completion;\n       (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an \n     efficient transportation network for the residents of the \n     State;\n       (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network \n     of transportation systems, including highways, that best \n     serves the needs of the State;\n       (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of \n     the State and acting on those needs;\n       (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over \n     time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels \n     used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the \n     States based on the Federal Government's perceptions of what \n     is best for the States;\n       (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels \n     tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not \n     necessarily appropriate for individual States;\n       (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement \n     process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive \n     activities;\n       (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, \n     regardless of the different circumstances of the States, \n     cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars \n     on projects, programs, and activities that the States would \n     not otherwise undertake; and\n       (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing \n     the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to \n     manage its own affairs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to return to the individual States maximum \n     discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all \n     elements of the national surface transportation systems that \n     are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;\n       (2) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways;\n       (3) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of \n     Transportation for--\n       (A) design, construction, and preservation of \n     transportation facilities on Federal public land;\n       (B) national programs of transportation research and \n     development and transportation safety; and\n       (C) emergency assistance to the States in response to \n     natural disasters;\n       (4) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal \n     obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative \n     solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, \n     and preservation of Federal and State transportation \n     facilities; and\n       (5) with respect to transportation activities carried out \n     by States, local governments, and the private sector, to \n     encourage--\n       (A) competition among States, local governments, and the \n     private sector; and\n       (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector \n     participation, and productivity.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been \n     to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system \n     that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all \n     States;\n       (2) that objective has been attained, and the Interstate \n     System connecting all States is near completion;\n       (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an \n     efficient transportation network for the residents of the \n     State;\n       (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network \n     of transportation systems, including highways, that best \n     serves the needs of the State;\n       (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of \n     the State and acting on those needs;\n       (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over \n     time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels \n     used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the \n     States based on the Federal Government's perceptions of what \n     is best for the States;\n       (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels \n     tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not \n     necessarily appropriate for individual States;\n       (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement \n     process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive \n     activities;\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\n       (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, \n     regardless of the different circumstances of the States, \n     cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars \n     on projects, programs, and activities that the States would \n     not otherwise undertake; and\n       (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing \n     the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to \n     manage its own affairs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to return to the individual States maximum \n     discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all \n     elements of the national surface transportation systems that \n     are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;\n       (2) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways;\n       (3) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of \n     Transportation for--\n       (A) design, construction, and preservation of \n     transportation facilities on Federal public land;\n       (B) national programs of transportation research and \n     development and transportation safety; and\n       (C) emergency assistance to the States in response to \n     natural disasters;\n       (4) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal \n     obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative \n     solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, \n     and preservation of Federal and State transportation \n     facilities; and\n       (5) with respect to transportation activities carried out \n     by States, local governments, and the private sector, to \n     encourage--\n       (A) competition among States, local governments, and the \n     private sector; and\n       (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector \n     participation, and productivity.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 374\n\nSupporting the mission and goals of 2012 National Crime Victims' Rights \nWeek to increase public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns of \n          victims and survivors of crime in the United States\n\n       Whereas each year, approximately 19,000,000 individuals in \n     the United States are victims of crime, including more than \n     4,000,0000 victims of violent crime;\n       Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on \n     individuals, families, and communities by ensuring that \n     rights, resources, and services are available to help rebuild \n     lives;\n       Whereas although the United States has steadily expanded \n     rights, protections, and services for victims of crime, too \n     many victims are still not able to realize the hope and \n     promise of these gains;\n       Whereas despite impressive accomplishments during the past \n     40 years in the rights of and services available to crime \n     victims, there remain many challenges to ensure that all \n     victims--\n         (1) are treated with fairness, dignity, and respect;\n         (2) are offered support and services regardless of \n     whether the victims report crimes committed against them; and\n         (3) are recognized as key participants within systems of \n     justice in the United States when the victims do report \n     crimes;\n       Whereas observing the rights of victims and treating \n     victims with fairness, dignity, and respect serve the public \n     interest by--\n         (1) engaging victims in the justice system;\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\n         (2) inspiring respect for public authorities; and\n         (3) promoting confidence in public safety;\n       Whereas the people of the United States recognize that we \n     make our homes, neighborhoods, and communities safer and \n     stronger by serving victims of crime and ensuring justice for \n     all;\n       Whereas in each of the last 30 years, communities \n     throughout the United States have joined Congress and the \n     Department of Justice in observing National Crime Victims' \n     Rights Week to celebrate a vision of a comprehensive and just \n     response to all victims of crime;\n       Whereas, the theme of 2012 National Crime Victims' Rights \n     Week, celebrated on April 22, 2012, through April 28, 2012, \n     is ``Extending the Vision: Reaching Every Victim,'' which \n     highlights the importance of ensuring that services are \n     available for all victims of crime; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States appreciate the \n     continued importance of promoting victims' rights and \n     honoring crime victims and those who advocate on their \n     behalf: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the mission and goals of 2012 National Crime \n     Victims' Rights Week to increase public awareness of--\n       (A) the impact on victims and survivors of crime; and\n       (B) the constitutional and statutory rights and needs of \n     those victims and survivors; and\n       (2) recognizes that fairness, dignity, and respect comprise \n     the very foundation of how victims and survivors of crime \n     should be treated.\n\n                              S. Res. 375\n\nCelebrating the bicentennial of the City of Columbus, the capital city \n                          of the State of Ohio\n\n       Whereas in 1787, Congress enacted the Northwest Ordinance \n     to settle claims following the American Revolution and begin \n     the westward expansion of our Nation;\n       Whereas in 1803, Ohio was admitted as the 17th State in the \n     Union, becoming the first territory of the Northwest \n     Ordinance to achieve statehood;\n       Whereas in 1812, the Ohio General Assembly was offered land \n     along the Scioto River in Central Ohio to serve as the \n     capital of the State, due to its central location;\n       Whereas on February 14, 1812, the Ohio General Assembly \n     officially designated the new capital city as Columbus, in \n     honor of Christopher Columbus;\n       Whereas Columbus emerged as a trading and transportation \n     hub through the influence of the Ohio & Erie Canal and the \n     National Highway;\n       Whereas on March 3, 1834, 31 years after Ohio achieved \n     statehood, Columbus was officially chartered as a city \n     because of its growing population;\n       Whereas during the Civil War, Columbus was home to Camp \n     Chase, a major base for the Union Army that housed 26,000 \n     troops, Camp Jackson, an assembly center for recruits, and \n     Columbus Barracks, which served as an arsenal;\n       Whereas Columbus was a major outpost on the Underground \n     Railroad, led by the Kelton family, who assisted fugitive \n     slaves on their road to freedom;\n       Whereas in 1870, the Ohio General Assembly used to the \n     Morrill Land Grant Act to create the Ohio Agricultural and \n     Mechanical College, which was renamed the Ohio State \n     University in 1878 and is presently one of the Nation's \n     premier public universities and an anchor for economic \n     activity in the City of Columbus;\n       Whereas Columbus is home to other world-class institutions \n     of higher learning, including Capital University, established \n     in 1830, Columbus College of Art and Design, established in \n     1879, Pontifical College Josephinum, established in 1888, \n     Franklin University, established in 1902, Mount Carmel \n     College of Nursing, established in 1903, Ohio Dominican \n     University, established in 1911, and Columbus State Community \n     College, established in 1963;\n       Whereas Columbus is home to some of the Nation's earliest \n     schools for Americans living with disabilities, having \n     established the Ohio School for the Deaf in 1829 and the Ohio \n     State School for the Blind in 1837;\n       Whereas Columbus is of historical importance to the \n     organized labor movement, as one of the Nation's first \n     federations of labor, the American Federation of Labor, was \n     founded in Columbus in 1886;\n       Whereas the American Veterans of Foreign Service, the \n     earliest organization of veterans of foreign wars, was \n     founded in Columbus in 1899;\n       Whereas in the late 19th century and the early 20th \n     century, Columbus saw the rise of manufacturing and steel \n     businesses, brewers, and cultural and arts institutions, such \n     as the Southern Theatre;\n       Whereas leading retail corporations, health care and \n     insurance companies, and financial institutions call Columbus \n     their home, attracted by the city's world-class workforce and \n     cultural outlets;\n       Whereas Columbus serves as a leader in cutting-edge medical \n     research and hospital systems through the Ohio State Medical \n     Center and the Arthur James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. \n     Solove Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, \n     Mt. Carmel Hospital, Riverside Community Hospital, and Grant \n     Medical Center;\n       Whereas Columbus is home to green space and parks that are \n     used as both community gathering locations and to honor \n     pioneers, including Shrum Mound, one of the last remaining \n     conical burial mounds in the United States, which dates back \n     more than 2,000 years;\n       Whereas Columbus is also home to the Midwest's largest \n     Fourth of July Festival and the famed Ohio State Fair;\n       Whereas Columbus combines excellence in art and culture \n     with professional sports teams such as the Columbus Clippers, \n     the Columbus Crew, and the Columbus Blue Jackets;\n       Whereas Columbus is Ohio's most populous city and the 15th \n     largest city in the United States, as well as one of the \n     fastest growing cities in the Eastern United States;\n       Whereas February 14, 2012, marks the 200th anniversary of \n     the founding of Columbus, Ohio; and\n       Whereas the citizens of Columbus will commemorate a year-\n     long bicentennial celebration with the theme of ``Honor the \n     Past. Celebrate the Present. Envision the Future.'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the bicentennial anniversary of the founding \n     of the City of Columbus, the capital of the State of Ohio; \n     and\n       (2) honors the important economic, cultural, educational, \n     and artistic contributions that the people of Columbus have \n     made to this Nation over the past 200 years.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I would like to speak on one of \nthese resolutions, S. Res. 375, about the Columbus, OH, bicentennial.\n  Today marks the 200th anniversary of the founding of the city of \nColumbus, our largest city, one of the great cities of America, the \ncapital of the great State of Ohio. I have lived in different \nneighborhoods in Columbus over the last 30 years--from German Village \nto Berwick to the Hilltop. My grandson and his parents live in \nClintonville, a great neighborhood in the north side of Columbus. Our \ndaughter lives in the Short North, one of the most exciting places of \nany city in the Midwest.\n  For 200 years Columbus has been a hub of economic and cultural \nactivity for the State. We talk often in Columbus about the great brain \ngain; how Columbus is one of the fastest growing cities in the Midwest \nand east of the Mississippi.\n  Columbus started in its early days as a trading post along the Scioto \nRiver and continued as steamboats and railroads connected more people \nwith new opportunities and new commerce. I should add that the \nPresiding Officer, if I am allowed to say this, once lived in the great \ncity of Columbus. I think I am allowed to say that. He now is the very \nable junior Senator from Colorado.\n  During the Civil War, Columbus became an important location for the \nUnion Army, and something I am more particularly proud of, the \nUnderground Railroad. Through the turmoil of that era, President \nLincoln signed the Morrill Act, which led to the creation of the Ohio \nAgricultural and Mechanical College in 1870. In 1878 it was renamed \nOhio State University.\n  Today, OSU is one of the Nation's premiere public universities, and \nthere are many other institutions of higher learning in Columbus: \nCapital University, established much earlier than that, 1830; the \nColumbus College of Art and Design, established in 1879; the Pontifical \nCollege Josephinum, established in 1888; Franklin University, \nestablished in 1902; the Mount Carmel College of Nursing in 1903; Ohio \nDominican University, established in 1911, the year my father was born; \nand the Columbus State Community College, part of the great group of \ncommunity colleges who were visiting the Capitol today--many people \nfrom those colleges--established in 1963.\n  Columbus is home to some of the Nation's earliest schools for \nAmericans living with disabilities. The Ohio School for the Deaf was \nestablished in 1829. Many graduates of that school have gone on to \nGallaudet University located in Washington, founded during the Civil \nWar by Abraham Lincoln, the most outstanding school of its kind in the \ncountry. The Ohio School for the Blind was established in 1837.\n  In 2011, the Columbus library system was named the best in the United \nStates, the recipient of the National Medal for Museum and Library \nService. Columbus prospered in the post-Civil-War era through new \nbanks, expanded railroad networks, extended streetcar service, and the \ncity's first waterworks system. Manufacturers from horse-and-buggy \nmanufacturers, to steel, and brewers made Columbus an important \nlocation for organized labor. The American Federation of Labor later \nmerged with the Congress of Industrial Organizations into what we know \ntoday as the\n\n[[Page S659]]\n\nAFL-CIO. The American Federation of Labor was founded in Columbus 116 \nyears ago in 1886.\n  Today the legacy of advanced manufacturing continues at Ohio's \ncutting-edge Edison Networks, the Ohio Manufacturing Association, and \nBattelle. The spirit of the labor movement continues as workers of the \nColumbus local unions represent all types of industries and \nprofessions.\n  Attracted by world-class workforces and cultural outlets, leading \nretail corporations, health care, insurance companies, and financial \ninstitutions such as the Limited, Nationwide, Grange, Cardinal Health, \nand Huntington all call Columbus their home.\n  Columbus is a leader in cutting-edge medical research and hospital \nsystems. We see it at the Ohio State Medical Center, the Arthur James \nCancer Hospital, the Richard J. Solove Research Institute, and \nNationwide Children's Hospitals. Of the top 10 Children's Hospitals in \nAmerica, three of them are in Ohio consistently: Cleveland, Columbus, \nand Cincinnati, in addition to other great Children's Hospitals in \nOhio: Mount Caramel Hospital, Riverside Community Hospital, and Grant \nMedical Center.\n  Columbus is a crown jewel of arts and culture in the Midwest. The \nmajestic Southern Theatre, Southern Theatre and Hotel attracted world-\nclass performances for more than 100 years. The Southern Hotel was one \nof President Theodore Roosevelt's favorite stops as he traveled through \nthe Midwest.\n  The Short North is the epicenter of the burgeoning art scene, home to \ngalleries, parks, and restaurants such as Betty's, the Happy Greek, \nJeni's Ice Cream, and the North Market that attract an incredible \nnumber of young people with energy and commitment to that city.\n  It hosts some of the Midwest's largest concerts, fairs, and festivals \nranging from ComFest to the Pride Festival. Columbus is also home to \nthe Midwest's largest Fourth of July festival and the very famous Ohio \nState Fair.\n  Mayor Coleman and the Columbus Partnership, which is much more than \njust business organizations, are doing a tremendous job promoting \neconomic development from the South Campus Gateway to the Short North, \nto the Scioto riverfront and the German Village.\n  Like Ohioans across the State, our people have long served those who \nserve us. One of the first Veterans of Foreign Wars chapters in the \ncountry was founded in Columbus in 1899.\n  Aside from the Buckeyes of Ohio State, Columbus is home to \nprofessional sports teams, including the Columbus Clippers, the \nColumbus Crew, and the Blue Jackets.\n  This year, Columbus will commence a year-long bicentennial \ncelebration, with the theme ``Honoring the Past. Celebrate the Present. \nEnvision the Future.'' In doing so, it will celebrate the economic, \ncultural, educational, and artistic contributions of the people of \nColumbus to our great State and Nation.\n  On behalf of the Senate, with unanimous consent, I wish all the \ncitizens of Columbus a happy 200th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/14/senate-section/article/S659-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2105\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.
