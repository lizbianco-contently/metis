Mr. President, people in my hometown of Louisville, \nKY, are still recovering this morning from a series of storms and \npossible tornadoes last night that inflicted considerable damage across \nthe city, including at the historic Churchill Downs racetrack, home of \nthe Kentucky Derby.\n  More than 600 Louisvillians were without power this morning after \nthousands lost power yesterday. The storms did their worst at Churchill \nDowns in South Louisville, where there were reports of funnel clouds, \nand some barns were destroyed, sending many horses running loose. In \nmany parts of the city, there were downed power lines. The storms also \ndid considerable damage near my alma mater, the University of \nLouisville, and in the Jeffersontown area.\n  The National Weather Service plans to be in Louisville today to \nsurvey the damage and determine if the city was indeed struck by \ntornadoes. The town is bracing itself for another round of severe \nweather with severe thunderstorms, high winds, and even hail in the \nforecast for today.\n  Luckily, it appears so far that only property was damaged and no \nlives were lost or people injured. The horses are all OK too, for that \nmatter, which is extremely important to us in Kentucky.\n  We are thinking of those who have been affected by these storms and \nwill continue to keep a close eye on the city of Louisville and make \nsure the people have everything they need to clean up and rebuild.\n\n\n                               Debt Limit\n\n  Mr. President, this morning I would like to address what I view as a \nworrisome development in connection with the ongoing debt limit talks, \nbut first I think it is important to remind ourselves what the purpose \nof these talks is.\n  From the very beginning, the goal has been clear: to come up with a \nserious and significant plan for reducing the deficit as a condition \nfor any agreement to raise the limit. Without such a plan, we are told, \nAmerica could very quickly face an economic calamity of historic \nproportions, at a time when millions of Americans are still trying to \nrecover from the last one.\n  As one of the major credit agencies recently put it:\n\n       The rating outlook [of the U.S.] will depend on the outcome \n     of negotiations on deficit reduction . . . a credible \n     agreement on substantial deficit reduction would support a \n     continued stable outlook; lack of such an agreement would \n     prompt Moody's to change its outlook to negative on the AAA \n     rating.\n\n  This is serious stuff, and many of us have been hoping for and \nworking toward a serious bipartisan solution, a plan that would \nconvince the American people, the markets, and the world that America \nis capable of getting its fiscal house in order. Let's be clear about \nsomething else: We all know what such a plan would look like. Everyone, \nincluding the President, knows we cannot rein in our debt without a \nreform of long-term entitlements. It cannot be done. And everyone knows\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\nany serious plan would have to be in the trillions to get the job done. \nThat is why even the Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee said \nthis week that he wouldn't even support a plan that proposed to cut \nless than $4 trillion over the next 10 years. That is also why it is so \nconcerning to many of us that some have begun to suggest a different \ngoal for these talks.\n  Over the past several days, some have suggested in various news \nstories that the real goal of these talks is to devise a plan that \nsatisfies one side by reducing the debt and satisfies the other side by \nraising taxes. The suggestion here is that all this is all just some \nquid pro quo exercise between the two parties. This is a dangerous \ntrend, and it is wrong. It is important that we dispel it.\n  The central issue in these talks, as every serious person knows, is \nour Nation's massive deficit and debt and the disastrous long-term \nconsequences for jobs and the economy that would result if we do \nabsolutely nothing about it. We have this problem for one very \nunderstandable reason: The government spends too much. The way to solve \nit is to spend less.\n  It is mystifying, really, that at the eleventh hour some would now \npropose tax hikes as a condition to any agreement. It is mystifying not \nonly because of the absurdity of proposing a tax hike as a way to help \nthe economy and create jobs, it is mystifying above all because we know \nquite well that a tax hike would never make it through Congress, not \nbecause of Republican opposition but because of Republican and \nDemocratic opposition. We have already had the votes to prove it. Six \nmonths ago, Democrats couldn't even muster enough votes to pass a tax \nhike on upper income Americans when they had 59 seats in the Senate, a \n40-seat majority in the House, and a Democrat in the White House. They \ncouldn't get that done 6 months ago. Less than 2 weeks later, right \nafter that effort to raise taxes, which they couldn't get done, they \nvoted almost 4 to 1 in favor of keeping the current tax rates in place. \nThat was when the Democrats had a huge majority in the Senate, a huge \nmajority in the House, and a President of the United States. They \ncouldn't raise taxes.\n\n  So there is one of two things going on here: Either someone on the \nother side has forgotten that there is strong bipartisan opposition in \nCongress to raising taxes or someone involved is acting in bad faith. \nWe have known from the beginning that tax hikes would be a poison pill \nto any deficit reduction proposal. Those who are proposing them now \neither know this or they need to realize it very quickly.\n  That is to say nothing of those who are now proposing more spending \nas a solution to our debt crisis. This isn't just mystifying, it is \nabsolutely farcical. Most Americans had to wonder if they were dreaming \nthis morning when they saw this headline: ``Democrats Call for New \nSpending in U.S. Debt Deal.'' It is unbelievable. More spending as a \nsolution to the debt crisis? What planet are they on?\n  All of which gets at the larger issue in this whole debate, and here \nI am referring to the continuing silence of the one person who matters \nmost to its outcome.\n  For weeks, lawmakers have worked around the clock to hammer out a \nplan that would help us avert a crisis we all know is coming. Do you \nremember what Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, said when asked what our biggest national security threat was? \nHe said: Our debt. Erskine Bowles, Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff, \nCochairman of the deficit reduction commission, called it the most \npredictable crisis in American history. We all know this crisis is \ncoming, knowing at some point the President will have to sign on to \nsome solution. So it is worth asking, where in the world has President \nObama been for the last month? Where is he? What does he propose? What \nis he willing to do to reduce the debt and to avoid this crisis that is \nbuilding on his watch? He is the one in charge. I think most Americans \nthink it is about time he started acting like it.\n  It is not enough for the President to step in front of a microphone \nevery once in a while and say a few words that somebody hands him to \nsay about the jobs situation and our economy. Americans want to see \nthat he is actually doing something about it. What they see instead is \nmore bad economic news every day, a gathering crisis that threatens to \nmake current problems even worse, and a President who is either \nunwilling or unable to recognize that our Nation's economy is in very \nserious trouble. He is the President. He needs to lead. He needs to \nshow that he recognizes the problem. He needs to do something about it. \nWe are not in the majority. We can't sign anything into law. That is \nthe President's job. That is his job. Yet, until now, he has stood in \nthe background. He has acted as if it is not his problem. Well, it is \nhis problem. This is his problem to solve. America is waiting.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4038-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the last month or 6 weeks the Vice \nPresident of the United States, Joe Biden, who served in this body for \n36 years, has been assigned by the President of the United States to \nwork with people who have been assigned by me, Senator McConnell, the \nminority leader in the House, and the Speaker to meet with Senator \nBiden to work out problems that we have facing our country with this \nhuge debt. Senator Biden has been working very hard. There have been \nnumerous meetings with this group of people that we assigned. Progress \nis being made. Whether it is enough progress remains to be seen.\n  The President of the United States gets up early every morning, gets \nan intelligence report about what is going on around the world--there \nare a lot of things going on around the world that he has to keep his \neye on, and that is an understatement. We have had many issues come \nabout this last month on which he has had to focus. No one can suggest \nin any way the President is not engaged in what is going on in the \ncountry. He is briefed at least once a day by the Vice President as to \nthese negotiations. Following that, almost every day he meets with his \nadvisers as to what should be the next step.\n  I think it is unfair to say things such as, ``Where is the \nPresident?'' I think it is fair to take a little look at history. When \nGeorge Bush became President, following that time of 8 years of \nPresident Clinton, he was given reports at his desk in the White House \nthat showed there was about a $7 trillion surplus over the next 10 \nyears. We had developed, during the years of President Clinton, a \nnumber of procedures. One was the pay-go rules. We made sure if there \nwas a new program that we couldn't pay for, we would take some money \nfrom another program, take the money we used for that and use it to \ntake care of the new program. It was a time of economic vibrancy in \nthis country that we have never seen before.\n  President Bush got rid of the pay-go rules and decided to do \nsomething unique. He decided to do everything on credit--two unfunded \nwars that are now approaching $2 trillion in cost, none of which is \npaid for, money we borrowed from Saudi Arabia and China\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\nand other countries--and then we gave President Bush's huge tax cuts \nthat have been deemed by most all writers around America and around the \ncountry to be unfair.\n  Warren Buffett, who some believe is the richest man in the world, \nsaid it is unfair that he pays less taxes percentage-wise than his \nsecretary. So this $7 trillion surplus we had over 10 years, the Bush \nadministration wiped that out with all these wars unpaid for and all \nthese tax and other actions that were taken.\n  When President Obama became President, there had been 8 million jobs \nlost, and he found himself in a big hole. I think one of the things we \nshould do is stop denigrating the economy of our country. Is it vibrant \nand strong? Of course not, but it is improving. It is getting better--\nnot fast enough, not good enough, but it is improving.\n  So I say to my friend, my counterpart, the Republican leader, who \nsays the only place we can solve the problems of this country is just \nto basically cut domestic programs significantly, we know we are going \nto have to do a better job of balancing the budget because of the cards \nthat were given to President Obama. We are going to be doing our very \nbest to do that. But the one interesting point my friend failed to \nmention as he talked about the Bowles-Simpson debt reduction program is \nthey said, among other things: Of course, we have to make significant \ncuts in domestic discretionary spending, in defense, in mandatory \nprograms. They looked at some of the work we needed to do with \nentitlements. But they also said there had to be something done with \nrevenue. My friend ignores what they said about that.\n  They also said; that is, Bowles-Simpson, together with the people who \nwere on that Commission--and I made a number of appointments to that \nCommission--they said: Yes, we need to do some cutting, but these next \nfew years we have to spend some money to create jobs. We hear not a \nword from my Republican colleagues about creating jobs.\n  The House of Representatives, all they do is flex their muscles on \nthings they want to eliminate. But the one thing they do not talk about \nis creating jobs--not a word.\n  This week my Republican colleagues killed their fourth jobs bill this \nyear. The Economic Development Administration reauthorization was \ncommonsense legislation with a proven track record of spurring \ninnovation and hiring by private companies because for every dollar we \nspent as a government, $7 came back in return from the private sector. \nThey killed our fourth jobs bill this year. It seems Republicans don't \ncare about putting Americans back to work. They don't even pay lip \nservice to the issue.\n  Americans have said they care more about creating jobs than anything \nelse. In fact, yesterday the junior Senator from Tennessee, a \nRepublican, said right here on the Senate floor that this effort to \ncreate and protect, as we did the last few years, 314,000 jobs was \n``nothing of importance.'' That is a direct quote. I am confident the \n14 million Americans out of work today, including many from Tennessee \nand every other State in our country, would disagree with the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  He also went on to say, this junior Senator from Tennessee--I repeat, \nwho is a Republican--he went on to say that this worthy legislation, \nour fourth jobs bill of this Congress, was nothing more than an attempt \nto ``kill time.'' He said it is an attempt to kill time. He went on \nalso, I repeat, to say it was unimportant.\n  Republicans may consider job creation a waste of time, but Democrats \ndisagree and Americans disagree--Democrats, Republicans, and \nIndependents alike. We are not going to stop fighting to get Americans \nback to work until we get our economy back on track. We cannot solve \nour problems without jobs creation. Congress has no more important task \nthan creating jobs. There is no better way for us to spend our time, \nthere is no issue more important than job development. This \nlegislation, which, again, would have supported 314,000 jobs, as it did \nin the last 5 years, is an important part of that effort.\n  But don't take my word for it. The junior Senator from Tennessee said \nthis about the Economic Development Administration 2 years ago. This is \nwhat he said prior to his saying that it was a waste of time, prior to \nhis saying that it was not of importance. Here is what he said. This is \na direct quote, less than 2 years ago:\n\n       In the midst of an economic crisis, projects like these are \n     just the kinds of things that will renew confidence and \n     reinvigorate private investment in the area.\n\n  That is what he said. He said ``EDA funds protect jobs and support \neconomic growth.'' Why, then, didn't he vote that way? No wonder the \njunior Republican Senator from Tennessee had such high praise for the \nprogram. EDA investments over the last 5 years will support an \nestimated 7,000 jobs in Tennessee. But in spite of his previous \nsupport, he voted to kill this worthy legislation anyway. And he is not \nthe only Republican whose words don't match their actions.\n  His counterpart, the senior Senator from Tennessee, also a \nRepublican, also supported EDA and those 7,000 jobs once. He did it \nbefore. He said an EDA grant would ``bring a much needed boost to the \nlocal economy.'' Just a few days ago he voted to kill the program.\n  Last month, the junior Senator from Texas, also a Republican, said an \nEDA grant in his State would ``pave the way for the creation of new \njobs.'' He said it would ``strengthen the region's economy.'' EDA \ninvestments from the last 5 years are expected to support more than \n18,000 jobs in Texas. Yet he voted to kill the program.\n  The senior Republican Senator from Oklahoma said he has ``long been a \nsupporter of EDA programs.'' That is a direct quote. EDA investments \nfrom the last 5 years are expected to support more than 5,000 jobs in \nOklahoma. He is such a big supporter he was an original cosponsor of \nthe legislation, but he voted to kill it.\n  These are only 3 of 23 Republican Senators who lauded the importance \nof this legislation and then voted against it.\n  Nevada has been hit harder by this terrible recession than any other \nState. EDA investments from the last 5 years are responsible for \ncreating almost 5,000 jobs in Nevada. The legislation Republicans \nkilled this week could have created hundreds of thousands more jobs all \nacross America. I take it very seriously when a Republican Senator says \nputting thousands of people to work is a waste of time. The real waste \nof time is this endless obstructionism by Republican Senators. They \nwaste the Senate's time when they put partisan politics ahead of our \neconomic recovery.\n  Americans have told us time and time again, putting 14 million people \nback to work is their No. 1 priority. Democrats share that priority. \nObviously, the Republicans do not. Their goal is to change Medicare as \nwe know it, to end it. Believe me, thousands of Nevadans who are \nworking today because of EDA don't think our efforts to create jobs are \nnothing of importance, as the junior Senator from Tennessee said. In \nfact, we have heard from out-of-work people in Nevada and every other \nState in this great country that there is absolutely nothing more \nimportant than job creation.\n  Would the Chair now announce morning business, please.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4039-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This bill is a \nresponse to the dire need in our country for greater financial literacy \namong young adults.\n  To be financially literate is to possess one of the most empowering \nlife skills that an individual can have. Those who have a sound \nunderstanding of personal finance and economics are better prepared for \nthe many pivotal moments that they encounter in life where decisions \nabout money must be made. Sound decisionmaking in those instances \nseparate the financially literate from the financially illiterate. \nThose who effectively evaluate their financial choices, wisely manage \ntheir personal finances, and budget and save live more financially \nstable and secure lives. Those who make poor decisions about money live \nwithout financial certainty and become vulnerable to anticonsumer \nbusiness practices and unscrupulous lenders.\n  Financial independence begins during or immediately after college for \nmany of us and brings with it new opportunities and challenges. Before \nwe buy a home, put a child through school, or retire, we make choices \nabout purchasing a car, buying with credit in lieu of cash, and \nbalancing our ``wants'' and ``needs'' while struggling to extract rent \nout of our first few paychecks. From that point on, financial choices \nincrease in cost and magnitude. Financial decisions made and habits \ndeveloped as young adults dictate whether we go through life on sound \nfinancial footing and are prepared for unforeseen financial obstacles.\n  Given the tremendous importance of early adulthood financial choices \nand actions, it is extremely troubling how unprepared young adults are \nfor these challenges. Too few students have opportunities to learn \nabout personal finance or economics before they enter college. The \nCouncil for Economic Education's most recent Survey of the States found \nthat only 21 States require students to take a class in economics as a \nrequirement for graduation and only 13 require a course in personal \nfinance. Parents, moreover, are often unreliable sources of financial \neducation because many are financially illiterate themselves. For \nexample, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling's fifth annual \nFinancial Literacy Survey found that 76 percent of adults recognized \nthat they could benefit from the advice of a financial professional \nregarding everyday financial questions.\n  Even as we acknowledge widespread financial illiteracy among young \nadults, we allow students in higher education to take on alarming \nlevels of debt during college. Borrowing to pay for school has become \nthe norm. Two out of every three undergraduates receive some type of \nfinancial aid. At for-profit colleges, 96 percent of students borrow to \npay for school. These trends have led to over $100 billion in Federal \neducational loans being originated each year. When these borrowers \ngraduate, they do so with significant student loan debt, with the \nmedian over $23,000. The Department of Education estimates that over 36 \nmillion Americans have outstanding Federal student loan debt that, when \ncombined, totals over $740 billion. And yet, because of the steep \nupward trend in college tuition, which in the last decade has risen \neach year by 5.6 percent beyond inflation, students commonly rely on \ncredit cards on top of their student loans to pay their way through \ncollege. Even as far back as 7 years ago, 56 percent of dependent \nstudents had a credit card in their own name.\n  The consequences of this culture of borrowing in higher education are \nclear and concerning. The most recent cohort default rate, CDR, on \nFederal student loans was 7 percent, indicating that large numbers of \nyoung adults are failing to effectively manage their debt. The average \nCDR for proprietary colleges alone is 22.3 percent. Meanwhile, the \naverage student credit card balance rose from around $1,400 in 2002 to \n$2,000 today. Given what we know about student financial literacy and \ncapability, this is not surprising. For example, a Charles Schwab study \nin 2007 found that only 45 percent of teens know how to use a credit \ncard and even fewer--just 26 percent--understand credit card fees and \nthe concept of interest.\n  The increase in Federal educational lending and student debt can be \ninterpreted positively. I am happy to see young people continuing on to \ncollege in numbers that I would never have imagined when I graduated \nfrom the University of Hawaii in 1952. For our best and brightest, \ncollege continues to be a stepping stone on their paths to becoming \nfuture leaders. For millions of others today, however, college simply \nand rightfully represents an opportunity for better lives for \nthemselves and their families. But, the ever-rising cost of education \nis a reality that we must address. We are allowing--and even \nencouraging--students to become borrowers and consumers. It is our \nresponsibility, therefore, to ensure that these young adults have the \nknowledge, skills, and capability to manage the consequences that come \nwith their financial decisions. Unfortunately, we are not doing enough.\n  The College LIFE Act begins to address this clear and urgent void in \nearly adulthood financial literacy and economic education. It would \nprovide financial literacy counseling to all university-level students \nwho take out federal educational loans when they begin and leave \nschool. First receipt of a student loan and departure from school are \ntwo prime teachable moments in the lives of young adults. In addition, \nthey are two opportunities for individuals to learn the importance of \nresponsible financial behavior without those lessons coming at their \nown expense.\n  Financial literacy counseling under the College LIFE Act would teach \nthe financial education core competencies--earning, spending, saving, \nborrowing, and protection--developed by the Financial Literacy and \nEducation Commission. Existing loan counseling already provides student \nborrowers with valuable information about the terms, features, and \ncommon pitfalls of educational loans. This financial literacy \ncounseling would complement existing activities, and the College LIFE \nAct specifies that financial literacy loan counseling may be provided \nin conjunction with current counseling requirements.\n  I thank my colleague in the House of Representatives, Congresswoman \nSheila Jackson Lee of Texas, for joining me as the House sponsor of \nthis bill. I also thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who \nchairs the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, for \nlending his expertise to this bill in the areas of financial literacy \nand student debt in higher education, including at for-profit colleges.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues to enact the College LIFE \nAct. I call on them to join me in support of this legislation and other \nefforts to improve financial literacy in America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4040-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4040-S4045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today to implore my colleagues and \nto implore the negotiators who are working on this budget issue to come \nto a comprehensive solution that meaningfully addresses our deficit and \nour debt.\n  If all you knew about our politics was what you see on the television \nat night, you would think we were committed to an endless stream of \ninvective, of name-calling, of division, that we had absolutely no \ninterest or desire to solve the Nation's problems or solve the Nation's \nchallenges, and you would be right to sort of give up all hope we could \nactually honor the heritage of our parents and our grandparents and \nmake sure we are not the first generation of Americans to leave less \nopportunity, not more, to our kids and our grandkids. That is what you \nmight think if all you knew about our country was what you saw on the \nTV at night.\n  Fortunately, I have had the privilege, as has everybody in this body, \nto travel my State and to learn that actually the American people are \nnowhere near as divided as Washington, DC, or as what you see on \ntelevision at night. In fact, we share an awful lot in common in my \nState of Colorado whether we are Republicans, Democrats, or \nIndependents, and part of that is because we are coming out of the \nworst recession since the Great Depression.\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\n  By the end of the discussion I was having during the campaign over \nthe last couple of years, there were about four things people thought \nmight be good ideas. They thought it would be good to have an economy \nin this country where median family income was rising instead of \nfalling, that we were creating jobs in the United States rather than \nshipping them overseas. They thought it would be a good idea if our \nenergy would not require us to send billions of dollars a week to the \nPersian Gulf to buy oil. They thought it would be a good idea--and as a \nformer school superintendent, I agree with them--to educate our kids \nfor the 21st century. They thought it would be a good idea if we were \nactually willing to make hard choices to deal with our debt and our \ndeficit.\n  There is a lot of disagreement around here that I do not really \nunderstand, but in Colorado, the way they would like us to do that is \nto see a comprehensive plan that materially addresses the problem. They \nknow we cannot solve it overnight, but they would like to see us \nmaterially address the problem. They want to know we are all in it \ntogether. They are not interested in the Washington game of whose ox is \ngoing to get gored; they want to know we are all in this together, that \nall of us have something to contribute to solving this problem. They \nemphatically want it to be bipartisan, which is good because we have a \ndivided Congress now, and it needs to be bipartisan to get this work \ndone. The reason is that they do not trust either party's go-it-alone \nstrategy. I think they are right to believe we are better off \ncompromising on a set of comprehensive proposals than continuing to \nfight.\n  I would add a corollary to it, which is that whatever we do, we \nbetter satisfy the capital markets that their paper is worth what they \npaid for it. If they are not satisfied, we are going to be in an \ninterest rate environment that is going to make all of the discussions \nwe have had about cuts seem trivial in terms of the effect on the \ndeficit and debt.\n  Then I come here, and we have these phony conversations about solving \nthe problem. We had a discussion, you will remember, about whether we \nought to shut the government down. And I did the math on the bid ask \nspread that divided the two parties over whether we are going to shut \nthe government down, and that math equalled about 4 cents on the $20 \nmeal at Applebee's. It would be like you and me, Mr. President, \nfighting over that 4 cents because we couldn't figure out how to pay \nthe bill. It would be like the city of Alamosa in my State, in the San \nLuis Valley, where my predecessor, Ken Salazar, came from--it would be \nlike the mayor saying: We can't agree on $27,000, so we are going to \nshut the government down, we are not going to pick up your trash, we \nare not going to educate your kids. The American people should know \nthat is what that debate was about. Now we come to the debt ceiling \ndebate where people are saying: We are not going to vote to raise the \ndebt ceiling.\n  Somebody in a townhall meeting said to me: Michael, don't you know my \nneighbor and I are having to figure out how to pay as we go? We have to \nfigure out how to pull in our purse strings to make sure we can afford \nto do what we need to do? I said: I absolutely agree with you. He said: \nWhy aren't you guys showing the same restraint? And I said: We need to \nshow the same restraint, but that is not about the debt ceiling. The \ndebt ceiling is about bills we have already incurred; it is not about \ncutting up your credit card. It would be great if it were. That is not \nwhat it is about. It is about saying: I have a cable bill this month, \nand I am just not going to pay it. I got my mortgage this month, but I \nam just not going to pay it.\n  That is not fiscally responsible. In fact, do you know what happens \nto people who do that? Their interest rates go up because lenders say \nto you: You are not a good risk because you didn't pay your mortgage on \ntime. You are not a good risk because you didn't pay your cable bill on \ntime. That is what our lenders are going to say to the Federal \nGovernment of the United States if we are willing to jeopardize the \nfull faith and credit of the United States. It is fiscally and \npolitically irresponsible for us to do that.\n  In this context, we are having a debate about dealing with the fact \nthat we now have a $1.5 trillion deficit and a $15 trillion debt.\n  By the way, I would say on the debt ceiling that at least this \nSenator would settle for raising it just the amount the Ryan plan would \nincrease our debt. I would be happy with the Ryan plan, which is the \nHouse Republican plan, to raise the debt by about $5.4 trillion. \nEverybody over there voted for it. A lot of people here voted for it \nimplicitly; therefore, they are suggesting the debt ceiling ought to be \nraised by at least that amount, and I would be happy to support that \nand cosponsor that. But what I want us to do is come together in a \ncomprehensive way.\n\n  Mr. President, Mike Johanns from Nebraska and I circulated a letter \non March 15. I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 2011.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: As the Administration continues to \n     work with Congressional leadership regarding our current \n     budget situation, we write to inform you that we believe \n     comprehensive deficit reduction measures are imperative and \n     to ask you to support a broad approach to solving the \n     problem.\n       As you know, a bipartisan group of Senators has been \n     working to craft a comprehensive deficit reduction package \n     based upon the recommendations of the Fiscal Commission. \n     While we may not agree with every aspect of the Commission's \n     recommendations, we believe that its work represents an \n     important foundation to achieve meaningful progress on our \n     debt. The Commission's work also underscored the scope and \n     breadth of our nation's long-term fiscal challenges.\n       Beyond FY2011 funding decisions, we urge you to engage in a \n     broader discussion about a comprehensive deficit reduction \n     package. Specifically, we hope that the discussion will \n     include discretionary spending cuts, entitlement changes and \n     tax reform.\n       By approaching these negotiations comprehensively, with a \n     strong signal of support from you, we believe that we can \n     achieve consensus on these important fiscal issues. This \n     would send a powerful message to Americans that Washington \n     can work together to tackle this critical issue.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael F. Bennet.\n     Mike Johanns.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. We sent it around to people, and it was a letter to the \nPresident that in part said:\n\n       Specifically, we hope that the discussion will include \n     discretionary spending cuts, entitlement changes and tax \n     reform.\n\n  A comprehensive plan. Sixty-four Senators signed that letter--more \nthan a majority of the Senate. It is more than the 60-vote threshold \nnecessary to pass legislation around here--a majority of Republicans \nand a majority of Democrats recognizing what is blindingly obvious to \nthe American people, which is that we need a comprehensive plan because \nthe math does not work otherwise. And we need people of good will to \ncome together and say: We understand we are not going to be able to \nsolve this problem if we continue to fight with each other. We are not \ngoing to be able to solve this problem if we continue to pretend there \nare some magical mathematics out there that allows us to solve the debt \ncrisis based on political ideology rather than our working together.\n  People ask me sometimes what they can do to help with this \ndiscussion. What I say to them is they ought to be holding the people \nin this body to the same standard they hold our local officials back in \nColorado--that mayor in Alamosa or a superintendent in Denver--who \nnever in their wildest dreams would think they were going to phony up \nthe math and go back to people and say: Sorry, we could not make it \nwork, so we are going to shut down or, sorry, we could not make it \nwork, so we are going to destroy our credit rating, so you end up \nspending more money on interest instead of on the services you care \nabout.\n  Our job is to fix this problem. It is not going to be easy. It is \ngoing to take people on both sides of the aisle to think differently \nabout what is possible. My own view is the Deficit and Debt Commission \ngave us a roadmap here. It was a bipartisan group. The final result got \nthe vote of Dick Durbin, one of the most liberal members of\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\nthe Democratic Party, and one of the most conservative members of the \nRepublican Party, Tom Coburn, who signed onto a plan that said: Let's \ntake a quarter of it from discretionary spending, let's take a quarter \nof it from entitlements, let's take a quarter of it from interest \nsavings, and let's get a quarter from tax reform. That sounds about \nright to me.\n  If we could produce a plan here that satisfied the test I mentioned \nearlier, I could go back to the townhalls in Colorado, and I guarantee \nyou what people would say is: Thank you for finally working together. \nThank you for producing something that is credible. Let's now move on \nto the other business in this country to make sure we can compete and \nwin in the 21st century.\n  I would say I hope, to the extent anybody is listening to the floor \ntoday, they would think again about the importance of using this moment \nto try to create a comprehensive plan, to try to figure out what the \ncompromises are. I for one am happy to work with anybody on either side \nof the aisle to make sure we get this done.\n  I see the chairman of our Budget Committee is in the Chamber. I thank \nhim for his efforts on the Deficit Commission, and also for the work he \nhas been doing with the Gang of Six--the Gang of Five, trying, month \nafter month after month, for the last 18 months, to produce a \ncomprehensive plan that actually addresses the problems.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \nremarks and for his leadership. He has been right on point with respect \nto what has to be done in this country to get the debt threat under \ncontrol.\n  Make no mistake, we do face a debt threat of ominous proportions.\n  Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office again warned us: ``Debt \ncrisis looms absent major policy changes.''\n  You go to the end of this article that was from the Associated Press, \nby Mr. Andrew Taylor, a respected writer, and it says:\n\n       CBO says the debt increases the probability of a fiscal \n     crisis in which investors lose faith in U.S. bonds and force \n     policymakers to make drastic spending cuts or tax hikes.\n\n  That is where we are headed if we do not respond. And it is going to \nrequire a bipartisan response with Republicans and Democrats, because \nRepublicans control the House of Representatives, Democrats control the \nSenate, and there is a Democratic White House.\n  So when Republicans--as I just heard on this floor--blame it all on \nthe President, that is not going to work. That is not going to work, \nbecause Republicans can block anything in this Chamber, and Republicans \ncontrol the House of Representatives. So guess what. They are going to \nhave to join Democrats and be responsible. And being responsible means \ndoing some things that are tough.\n  Republicans and Democrats are going to have to do some things that \nare tough. Why? Because we are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we \nspend. That cannot be continued much longer.\n  If you look at the historic relationship between spending and \nrevenue, here it is, as shown on this chart, going back to 1950. The \nred line is the spending line. The green line is the revenue line. What \nyou see is spending as a share of national income is the highest it has \nbeen in 60 years. Revenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years.\n  When I hear my Republican friends say this is just a spending \nproblem, they have it half right. It is in part a spending problem. \nSpending is the highest it has been in 60 years--or very close to it. \nBut revenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years. So let's get real. \nLet's get honest. This is a spending problem and a revenue problem. It \nis the difference between the two that leads to record deficits and a \ndebt that is spiraling out of control.\n  Here is what the head of our Armed Forces--Admiral Mike Mullen, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--said last year at about this \ntime:\n\n       Our national debt is our biggest national security threat.\n\n  Colleagues, are you listening? Are you listening? We are moving at \nwarp speed toward a fiscal crisis. Nobody can tell us when it will \nhappen. What everyone is telling us is that it will happen.\n  Here is where we are, as shown on this chart. This is the gross debt \nof the United States. We are now, at the end of this year, going to be \nover 100 percent of our gross domestic product. That is going to be the \ngross debt of the United States--all the bills we owe. The black line \nshown on the chart is the 90-percent threshold line. Why does that \nmatter? Because we have just had the definitive economic study done on \ndeficits and debt and economic growth. It was done by Professor Carmen \nReinhart at the University of Maryland--she is no longer there; she was \nat the University of Maryland--and Professor Ken Rogoff at Harvard. \nHere is what they concluded:\n\n       We examine the experience of 44 countries spanning up to \n     two centuries of data on central government debt, inflation \n     and growth. Our main finding is that across both advanced \n     countries and emerging markets, high debt/GDP levels (90 \n     percent and above) are associated with notably lower growth \n     outcomes [for the future].\n\n  This is not just about numbers on a page. This is about the future \neconomic prospects of our Nation. A failure to act will consign us to a \nmore limited future. Fewer jobs, less economic growth, less economic \nactivity, a weaker position for the United States in the world--that is \nwhere we are headed.\n\n  We have been warned repeatedly. Quoting from the Wall Street Journal: \n``S''--the major rating agency--``Signals Top Credit Rating Is in \nDanger, Stoking Political Battle on Deficit.'' ``U.S. Warned on Debt \nLoad.'' So nobody in this Chamber, nobody across the Capitol in the \nHouse of Representatives, can claim they did not know what was coming. \nWe have been warned, and we have been warned repeatedly.\n  What happens if we do not act and there is a reaction in the interest \nrate environment for the U.S. debt? I would remind my colleagues, a 1-\npercentage point increase in interest rates will add $1.3 trillion to \nthe debt over the next 10 years. A 1-percentage point change in \ninterest rates will add $1.3 trillion to the debt over the next 10 \nyears.\n  People say: Well, we are not going to extend the debt, we are not \ngoing to extend the debt limit of the United States. Do you know what \nhappens? The creditors say: Oh, really? Well, we are not going to lend \nyou more money then. Do you know what happens then? Interest rates go \nup in order to attract other lenders. And what happens? Every 1-\npercentage point increase in the interest rates adds $1.3 trillion to \nthe debt in just 10 years.\n  Here are the remarks of 10 of the previous chairs of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers. Headline: ``Unsustainable Budget \nThreatens Nation.'' This is their conclusion, the top economic advisers \nto former Presidents, Democrats and Republicans. The previous 10 \nunanimously said this:\n\n       There are many issues on which we don't agree. Yet we find \n     ourselves in remarkable unanimity about the long-run federal \n     budget deficit: It is a severe threat that calls for serious \n     and prompt attention. . . . We all strongly support prompt \n     consideration of the Fiscal Commission's proposals. The \n     unsustainable long-run budget outlook is a growing threat to \n     our well-being. Further stalemate and inaction would be \n     irresponsible.\n\n  I served on that commission. There were 18 of us. Eleven of us agreed \nto the recommendations--five Democrats, five Republicans, and one \nIndependent. That proposal would reduce the debt from what it would \notherwise be by $4 trillion. Mr. President, 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans, \nand 1 Independent--11 of the 18 agreed to support the recommendations. \nWe cut spending. We cut domestic nondefense spending. We cut defense \nspending. We took on the entitlements. And, yes, we raised revenue by \n$1 trillion over the next 10 years--not by raising tax rates. In fact, \nwe cut tax rates. But we still got more revenue because we expanded the \ntax base by reducing tax expenditures that are now running $1.1 \ntrillion a year.\n  Over the next 10 years, the tax expenditures of this country are \ngoing to be $15 trillion. Let me repeat that. The tax expenditures in \nthis country over the next 10 years--special loopholes, deductions, \nexclusions, all the gimmicks that are in the Code--$15 trillion.\n  Not only did the Fiscal Commission come up with a recommendation of\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\nabout $4 trillion, almost every other group that has made a \nrecommendation has called for debt reduction of about $4 trillion over \nthe next 10 years from what it would otherwise be: the Fiscal \nCommission, the Bipartisan Policy Center, the American Enterprise \nInstitute, the Center for American Progress, the Heritage Foundation, \nthe Roosevelt Institute--all of them saying we need to get this debt \ndown.\n  Here is where we are headed, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. This is not the gross debt. This is the publicly held debt. It \nis headed for 233 percent of the gross domestic product of the country \nif we fail to act. If, instead, we would adopt the commission proposal, \nyou can see, as shown on this chart, we would actually work the debt \ndown, the publicly held debt, to 30 percent of GDP.\n  Every part of the budget has to be scrutinized and has to generate \nsavings. Here is what has happened to defense spending since 1997. It \nhas gone straight up, from $254 billion a year to $688 billion a year.\n  Secretary of Defense Gates said this:\n\n       [T]he budget of the Pentagon almost doubled during the last \n     decade. But our capabilities didn't particularly expand. A \n     lot of that money went into infrastructure and overhead and, \n     frankly, I think a culture that had an open checkbook.\n\n  I think he got it right. When we look at this growing debt, where did \nit come from? The Washington Post had this report on May 1:\n\n       The biggest culprit, by far, has been an erosion of tax \n     revenue triggered largely by two recessions and multiple \n     rounds of tax cuts. Together, the economy and the tax bills \n     enacted under former president George W. Bush, and to a \n     lesser extent by President Obama, wiped out $6.3 trillion in \n     anticipated revenue. That's nearly half of the $12.7 trillion \n     swing from projected surpluses to real debt.\n\n  If we look back on the five times we have balanced the budget in the \nlast 40 years, revenue has been close to 20 percent of GDP: 19.7 in \n1969; 19.9 in 1998; 19.8 in 1999; 20.6 in 2000; 19.5 in 2001. Where is \nrevenue today? It is 14.8 percent of GDP. And our friends across the \naisle say it is only a spending problem. Let's get real. It is a \nspending problem and it is a revenue problem. Let's be honest with the \nAmerican people.\n  Martin Feldstein, the distinguished conservative economist, said \nthis:\n\n       Cutting tax expenditures is really the best way to reduce \n     government spending . . . [E]liminating tax expenditures does \n     not increase marginal tax rates or reduce the reward for \n     saving, investment or risk-taking. It would also increase \n     overall economic efficiency by removing incentives that \n     distort private spending decisions. And eliminating or \n     consolidating the large number of overlapping tax-based \n     subsidies would also greatly simplify tax filing. In short, \n     cutting tax expenditures is not at all like other ways of \n     raising revenue.\n\n  Mr. Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said this, and \nI will conclude on this point:\n\n       Acting now to develop a credible program to reduce future \n     deficits would not only enhance economic growth and stability \n     in the long run, but could also yield substantial near-term \n     benefits in terms of lower long-term interest rates and \n     increased consumer and business confidence.\n\n  This is a defining moment for our country. We can either continue to \nrun head-long toward a debt crisis, or we can join together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, in a comprehensive plan to get our debt \nunder control. That will require a comprehensive plan, one that \naddresses spending--spending must be reduced. But it needs to be \nreduced when this economy is stronger. That is what every one of the \nbipartisan commissions has concluded. Yes, spending has to be cut, but \nnot right this minute. It has to be part of a plan that assures it will \nbe cut, and it has to be every part of spending: domestic discretionary \nspending, defense spending--yes, the entitlements have to be right-\nsized and we have to have the additional revenue given the fact, the \nsimple fact, that revenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years as a \nshare of our GDP, far lower than it has been in every one of the 5 \nyears we have balanced the budget out of the last 40.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides, now is the time for principled \ncompromise. Now is the time to come together to put in place a plan \nthat deals with this debt threat, fundamentally and assuredly. We have \nthat opportunity. We should not let this opportunity slip by.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my Republican colleagues for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as we all know, the most important issues \nthat are facing our country today are the economy, job creation, the \nnational debt, and excessive government spending. One of the things \nthat is having a huge effect on job creation and the economy right now \nis regulation.\n  The administration continues to overreach and overstep in the \nimplementation of dozens of new regulations, be it the EPA regulating \ngreenhouse gases, or the DOT's recent proposal that would require \ncommercial drivers' licenses for farmers who drive tractors.\n  These oversteps have real consequences in the form of jobs. Take, for \ninstance, Mr. Thomas Clements from Youngsville, LA, who is testifying \ntoday in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. Mr. Clements is a small business owner since 2008. He owns \nOilfield CMC Machining with his wife. They produce metal parts and \nsystems for offshore oil rigs.\n  His run-in with our overreaching administration started after the \ntragic 2010 BP oilspill with the President's decision in May of 2010 to \nenact a 6-month moratorium on new oil drilling in the gulf. His \nbusiness continues to struggle today because of the Department of the \nInterior's decision to slow walk new drilling permits. Before these \nactions, he had a thriving small business that not only provided for \nhis family but also for his employees.\n  Today, they are barely staying afloat, and will likely close unless \nthe administration changes course and actually begins taking steps \ntoward recovery instead of continued rhetoric.\n  Another big drag on the economy is the amount of spending and debt. \nYesterday the Congressional Budget Office released their long-term \nbudget outlook. This was certainly sobering reading. They pointed out \nthat under the alternative fiscal scenario, in 2024, interest costs, \nSocial Security, and major health spending would exceed all of the \nrevenue coming into the government.\n  The need for action is clear. The Congressional Budget Office states \nthat these levels of debt will cause incomes to be between 7 percent \nand 18 percent lower in 2035 than they would be otherwise.\n  Another study by economists Reinhart and Rogoff found that countries \nwith a debt-to-GDP level that is greater than 90 percent--I would \nemphasize that we are currently at 95 percent--but that countries with \na debt-to-GDP level greater than 90 percent grow at 1 percentage point \nless than they would otherwise. In other words, when you are carrying \nthis kind of a debt load, 90 percent debt to GDP, for a sustained \nperiod of time, you are bleeding about 1 percent of economic growth \nevery single year.\n  As we know from the President's own economic advisers, a 1-percent \nreduction--1-percent drop in growth--translates into about 1 million \nlost jobs. One of the places we see that has been hard hit in our \ncountry by the downturn is the State of Ohio. My colleague from Ohio \nSenator Portman is here. I would be interested perhaps in hearing from \nhim on whether he has seen the evidence of the recovery that was \npromised by the administration or does his economy in Ohio still \nreflect an economy that is held back by excessive regulation, debt and \nspending. I would be interested in the perspective of the Senator from \nOhio on that particular subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. First of all, I thank my colleague from South Dakota for \ncoming to the floor today to talk about the economy and jobs. It is \nclearly a top issue on the minds of folks in Ohio. And, no, the Ohio \neconomy is still hurting. We are not creating the jobs we hoped to \ncreate.\n  If you look at it nationally, there are now 14 million Americans who \nare out of work, and more than 1 million want to work but have given up \nlooking for work. So when you look at what is\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\ngoing on out there, you add the 8.5 million Americans who are getting \nby with part-time jobs--even though they would like to work full time--\nthat is about 23 million Americans suffering from a lack of the full-\ntime job they want. This unemployment issue continues to be the No. 1 \nissue in Ohio and nationally. We have got to address it.\n  You talked a little bit today about some of the ways that we need to \napproach it, including the regulatory overreach and its impact on jobs \nand small businesses. But let me talk about even a deeper concern in \nOhio. That is the length of time people have been out of work. The \naverage unemployment now is 40 weeks. That is about 9 months. It is 9 \nmonths of stress, 9 months of uncertainty, 9 months of wondering how to \nmake ends meet. This is, I am told, the worst statistic in terms of \nlength of being unemployed that we have had since the records were \nkept. So it is not just about these terrible unemployment numbers, it \nis the fact that when have you been out that long, you lose some of \nyour job skills, you have a gap in your resume, and it is harder to get \na job. This is not what was promised, by the way.\n  If you look at what the President and his economists promised when \nthe stimulus was passed, they said that unemployment today would be \nabout 6.7 percent. Instead, it is over 9 percent--9.1 percent. So it \nhas not worked. The President has called it a bump in the road. \nUnfortunately, I think it is a lot more than that.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve talked about this yesterday, that \nhe was very concerned now about some of the economic projections. He \nthinks we are not in as good a shape as even the projections--which \nwere not very optimistic--show. There was 1.8 percent growth in the \nfirst quarter. At this point in the last deep recession we had, the \ngrowth was 7 percent.\n  This chart is interesting because it shows Federal spending as a \npercent of the economy, which as we all know has gone up significantly, \nand part of that is because of the stimulus package and then the \nunemployment rate. Unfortunately, when you look at this, there has not \nbeen an increase in spending and a decrease in unemployment. There has \nbeen an increase in spending and an increase in unemployment. So this \nsimple notion that you cannot spend your way to prosperity, which is a \ncommonsense notion that most Americans agree with, has been proven to \nbe true.\n  Unfortunately, the stimulus package did not lead to the kind of \nprogress the President and his team predicted. We are all paying the \nprice for it. So, instead, we need to approach it in a different way.\n  Again, as Senator Thune mentioned earlier, part of the answer to this \nis dealing with the regulations, dealing with our tax system, dealing \nwith these high energy costs, dealing with the high health care costs, \nwhich do impact employment, getting the economy back on track through \nsmart progrowth policies.\n  I know the Senator from South Dakota has done a lot of thinking about \nhow do we get out of this mess we are in, instead of the spending. But \nI do not know if the Senator has any thoughts about what the debt and \nthe spending is doing to our economy. He mentioned the Rogoff and \nReinhart study showing that our economy would be growing much faster \nthan it is now but for this big overhang of spending and deficit and \ndebt.\n  I wonder if the Senator has additional thoughts.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate my colleague's observations regarding his \nState, which is a pivotal State when it comes to whether we are going \nto see the economy recover. It is a State that feels the impact right \naway when you have a down economy and job losses and all of the \nnegative things that go with that. So I appreciate his perspective on \nit. Obviously, I wish I could say this administration's policies have \nmade the situation better. Unfortunately, the evidence overwhelmingly \npoints to the President and his policies making this situation worse--\nmuch worse. For example, the Senator mentioned nondefense discretionary \nspending, which is the part of spending that the President has to sign \ninto law every year. It went up 4.1 percent. That is astounding when \nyou consider inflation was about 2 percent over that time. Government \nspending was growing 10 times the rate of inflation.\n  What is even more amazing, this doesn't include the increases in \ndiscretionary spending attributed to stimulus. That was supposed to \nhave brought the unemployment rate down to 6.7 percent. Clearly, we are \nover 9 percent today.\n  There is no correlation between additional spending and job creation. \nWe have clearly demonstrated that. That spending level doesn't include \nspending on the ``Cash for Clunkers'' program, which was supposed to \ncreate jobs. It doesn't include ``un-offset'' increases in spending on \nmandatory programs that are signed into law, such as additional \nunemployment insurance, Medicaid, or trade adjustment assistance. It \ndoesn't include the spending increases the President fought for but has \nbeen unsuccessful in passing.\n  Because of this exorbitant spending, we are at a point where 40 cents \nout of every dollar the Federal Government spends is borrowed. While \nmost people would look at this situation and say it is time to do \nsomething about it to improve the situation, the President clearly \npunted over the medium and long term, and his proposed budget makes the \nsituation even worse. In fact, his proposed fiscal 2012 budget would \nspend $46 trillion over a 10-year time period, add $9.47 trillion to \nthe debt, and raise taxes by $1.6 trillion. So their prescription \ncontinues to be more spending, more borrowing, and higher taxes.\n  The question is, is this helping or hurting our economy? If you look \nat a recent Bloomberg poll, it found 65 percent of Americans think the \ndebt is a major reason why our unemployment rate is so high. The answer \nfrom the American people is clear.\n  I guess what I say to my colleague from Ohio--and he and I have \nworked together on ideas on how to get the economy going again and \ncreate an environment conducive to job growth--is that, clearly, \ngetting spending under control here is a huge factor. As he pointed \nout, there is lots of research out there that demonstrates connectivity \nbetween spending and debt and the economy. I simply add that ratings \nagencies, such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's, all gave a negative \nassessment to our credit rating; and if that led to a downgrade in our \ncredit rating, it would reflect much higher interest rates for another \nnegative impact.\n  Spending and debt have a profound negative impact on our ability to \ngrow the economy and create jobs. The Senator from Ohio has been a \ngreat leader getting out there in talking about solutions that would \nlead to job creation. I am interested in hearing about some of what we \nmight be able to do that is clearly not being done today and, frankly, \nwhat I hope is contrary to the policies put forward by this \nadministration, which are costing jobs.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. That is right. There are a number of things that can be \ndone. There is no reason it can't be done on a bipartisan basis.\n  I left a hearing in the Government Affairs Committee, where we talked \nabout regulations and their impact on the economy. Today, the cost of \nregulations to the economy--in particular, small businesses--is about \n$1.75 trillion. That is more than the IRS collects in income taxes. \nThere were both Democrats and Republicans talking about proposals and \nwho are concerned about the administration's continued regulations. The \nPresident said some of the right things, but there are more regulations \nthat have a bigger impact.\n  In Washington, it is tough to get this under control without changing \nthe law, in my view. We need to have a better process in the agencies \nto force them to look at cost-benefit analyses and force them to use \nthe least-cost burdensome alternatives. I talked about legislation in \nthat area today, as did Democrats and Republicans alike. There are \nthings we have to do. Regarding the Senator's point about the impact of \nthe debt and deficit on the job front, the Senator is right. The poll \nhe talked about indicated that 65 percent of Americans think the debt \nand deficit is a major factor in high unemployment. They are right. The \nstudy the Senator talked about said if the debt gets past 90 percent, \nit will cost our economy about a million jobs. We are now at about 100 \npercent, and it will be 105 percent in 2012--next year.\n  This is what is happening. We are going into that period where our \ndebt\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\nis bigger than our whole economy. This study, by the way, is based on \nlooking at countries all around the world, which will have gone through \nthis experience, including countries in Europe that are going through \nit now, and seeing what the impact is on jobs.\n  There are solutions. We talked about regulations. That is one of \nthem. My hope is that this Senate can vote on sensible regulatory \nreform--and soon. The story the Senator told earlier about the oil and \ngas industry, we should display that all over. The recent proposed \nregulations from the EPA on emissions from powerplants in terms of \nmercury--all of us want clean air. We know you have to have \nregulations, but the question is, how do you regulate? These are very \nonerous and will have a big impact on my State. There is a study out \nsaying it is going to result in thousands of jobs being lost, and a few \npowerplants being shut down, and electricity costs increasing 10, 15 \npercent in our State. We cannot afford that.\n  But there is more than that. There is the Tax Code. We should, again, \nas a body, and the House and the administration should reform our Tax \nCode to make it simpler and more progrowth. It can be done. Economists \nacross the spectrum say this current code is a mess. It doesn't work \nbecause you are encouraging businesses to make investments and allocate \nresources based on Tax Code-motivated interests rather than business \nreasons. Getting rid of these preferences and clearing out the Code, as \nhappened in 1986, you could get more economic growth through the Tax \nCode reform.\n  I think the time is here, and the President's fiscal commission \nrecommended this when they said, how do you look at the next 20, 30 \nyears and come up with a way to deal with the deficit and debt? \nEconomic growth needs to be part of it. And part of it was tax reform, \nand making our workforce more competitive.\n  Today, we do spend money at the Federal level on workforce \ndevelopment. Yet it is not spent very efficiently. There are some \norganizations that do it better than others. We should take their best \npractices and apply them generally. There are nine different agencies \nand departments engaged in looking at how to improve our workforce \nthrough the 21st century. It is a Federal program that, when connected \nwith businesses, works; when it is not, it doesn't work well. There are \nopportunities to reform that program. It should be bipartisan.\n  I hear from communities and businesses what is working and what is \nnot working. Flexibility is the key. There is a lot of redtape and \nbureaucracy. We need to enforce our trade agreements and the \ninternational rules. Enforcement is critical. But we need to open \nmarkets to our products. Every country is engaged in opening markets \nfor their products, workers, and service providers. We need to be more \naggressive in forcing other countries to open our markets to them. If \nwe don't, we don't have access to 95 percent of the consumers in the \nworld. The President has said that if you were to pass these three \ntrade agreements out there, you would create over 250,000 new jobs. \nThink about that. That is something we ought to do. Again it is \nbipartisan.\n  Somehow we cannot seem to get these three relatively small trade \nagreements that we have already done through the process. We need to do \nthat right now, because of this economic crisis we face of unemployment \nand long-term unemployment. This would help, in combination with a more \ncompetitive workforce.\n  On energy, another part of our seven-point plan--and this is a jobs \nplan to get us back--we have to use our own resources. There is natural \ngas in places such as Ohio, and South Dakota and North Dakota have a \nlot of natural gas. We have the technology. Let's use it. We may have \nthe greatest resources of natural gas in the world, based on geological \nfinds. We need to use that now, and we can help us get less dependent \non foreign oil.\n  Finally, health care costs. We talked about this earlier. There are \nsome commonsense things we can do now to get health care costs down, \nincluding stopping frivolous lawsuits, which we all pay for, through \nsensible medical malpractice reform. Some States do it well. It should \nbe done on a national level to get the costs down. We should allow \npeople to buy insurance across State lines. Several insurance companies \ncould compete for the business. This would help get spending under \ncontrol. We should reform the Tax Code, have regulatory relief, a more \ncompetitive workforce, increase jobs through exports, enforce the trade \nagreements, power America's economy with our own energy, and have \nsensible solutions to getting costs of health care down, which will \nhelp create jobs. All of these things are proposals the Senator has \nbeen working on, and I appreciate that.\n  I ask the Senator a question. If the Senator is focused on getting at \nthis issue, does he think we have a problem on the debt and deficit \nbecause of the lack of revenue through taxation or is it through \noverspending? Does he have any thoughts or suggestions as to how we \ndeal with that?\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate that. That was a great description by the \nSenator. The Senator from Ohio hit upon all the relevant issues, if we \nare going to get the economy going, creating jobs again--talking about \ngetting trade deals done, and energy policy that relies upon American \nenergy production, keeping taxes and regulations low, common sense when \nit comes to energy regulations, and getting spending and debt under \ncontrol. Those are all part of a solution that will grow the economy.\n  What I say to my colleague with regard to the issue of taxing and \nspending is that a lot of people believe somehow we can get additional \nrevenues and raise taxes and solve these problems. Clearly, that would \nbe very counter to growing the economy and creating jobs. I think it \nwould be harmful, if anything. If we look at taxes as a way to deal \nwith the deficit and debt issue, frankly, I think most Americans \nbelieve--and I believe they are right--this is overwhelmingly a \nspending issue.\n  If you look at our 40-year average spending, up until 2008 it was \n20.6 percent of our GDP. The budget would have to spend about 24.3 \npercent of GDP. If you look at what we need to focus on, I say to my \ncolleague from Ohio, it is clearly in the area of spending and debt \ncontrol and dealing with that issue as opposed to the issue of revenue. \nI look forward to working with him on these issues. I hope we can put \npolicies into place that will grow the economy and get people in this \ncountry back to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that be \nextended by 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4045-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4045-S4046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ACTIONS, NOT WORDS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about jobs, \nand also to talk about an admonition I got from my father when I was \ngrowing up: Judge a man by his actions, not his words.\n  I intend to apply that, as well. We should all be judged by our \nactions, not just our words. I am very disappointed in what this \nadministration is doing now. On the one hand, they are talking about \njobs being the most important thing America needs. Yet every single \naction of the agencies is a job killer. Here is an example: The most \nrecent nominee to be the new Commerce Secretary of the United States is \na former director of the Boeing Aircraft Company. That aircraft \ncorporation is now under a suit from the interim general counsel of the \nNLRB to stop them from opening a new plant that will employ 1,000 \npeople in the State of South Carolina, alleging they built the plant \nthere to strike back at the unions in Washington State, when in fact \nthe Dreamliner, their main airliner, which they have tremendous orders \nfor, is being built in Washington, but they had to expand another plant \nto meet the demand for orders. They decided, in the interest of the \ncompany, to have one on the east coast and one on the west coast. They \nweren't retaliating. They were trying to create jobs for a great \nAmerican product. The NLRB wants to stop 1,000 jobs from being created \non an allegation that it is some type of retribution. That is dead \nwrong.\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\n  The NLRB this week came out with a new admonition. That is, they are \ngoing to change election rules so new elections, instead of being \nrequired to take 38 to 42 days, can have quickie union elections in 10 \nto 12 days, making it much more difficult for management to react to a \nunion vote or a union movement.\n  All these things are job creators. I am not here to demagogue unions \nor to demagogue this President for that matter. I just think fair is \nfair. If you say you want to create jobs, don't stop job creation. If \nyou say you want the economy to recover, do those things necessary to \nempower business.\n  Let me take another example; that is, the National Mediation Board. \nThe National Mediation Board is the agency that regulates employment \nfrom the standpoint of airlines and railroads and transportation \nentities. The NMB is 75 years old. For 75 years, their rule on a union \nelection in a covered company is that 51 percent of the number of \npeople employed who would be unionized had to vote in order for a union \nto become established.\n  Summarily, 11 days after their appointment under the new \nadministration, that 75-year-old rule was struck to become only a \nsimple majority of the number of people who vote, regardless of how \nmany people are going to be covered in employment. Now, that was \nspecifically targeted at Delta Airlines--an Atlanta company that became \nthe largest airline in the world after buying Northwest and merging the \ntwo.\n  Northwest had union flight attendants, Delta did not. Delta's flight \nattendants had twice in the last decade rejected unionization in a vote \nof 50 percent plus 1 of all employees covered. The change in this rule \nwas specifically targeted to try to force Delta to go from a nonunion \nshop in their flight attendants to a union shop. But even after an \naggressive change in law and by the unions, the flight attendants still \nvoted--under the new rule, which is much easier--not to unionize.\n  Still not satisfied, the National Mediation Board has now filed an \naction against Delta alleging improper activities. I find this very \nironic since in the FAA conference committee, which I am a part of \ntoday, we are trying to get a chance for airlines and those covered to \nbe able to have a legal action against a ruling of the NMB if they \nsuspect the NMB ruled unfairly. The NMB has rejected that entirely, the \nleadership of this body has rejected it entirely, and that conference \nreport languishes--all over an issue that would create jobs, but \ninstead they want to retard jobs.\n  My message in coming to the floor is very simple. Actions count, \nwords don't matter, simply talking about creating jobs don't mean a \nthing if we are taking actions that stymie business or punish people \nfrom making investments that bring about employment.\n  It is time for this President, it is time for each of us in the \nSenate, it is time for this administration, and it is time for the \nCongress to do what the American people have done: put our shoulder to \nthe grindstone and do those things that bring American business back, \nour economy back, and bring jobs back to the greatest country on the \nface of this Earth--the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 679, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 679) to reduce the number of executive positions \n     subject to Senate confirmation.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       DeMint amendment No. 501, to repeal the authority to \n     provide certain loans to the International Monetary Fund, the \n     increase in the United States quota to the Fund, and certain \n     other related authorities, and rescind related appropriated \n     amounts;\n       DeMint amendment No. 510, to strike the provision relating \n     to the Director, Bureau of Justice Statistics;\n       DeMint amendment No. 511, to enhance accountability and \n     transparency among various Executive agencies;\n       Vitter amendment No. 499, to end the appointments of \n     Presidential czars who have not been subject to the advice \n     and consent of the Senate and to prohibit funds for any \n     salaries and expenses for appointed czars;\n       Coburn amendment No. 500, to prevent the creation of \n     duplicative and overlapping Federal programs;\n       Portman amendment No. 509, to provide that the provisions \n     relating to the Assistant Secretary (Comptroller) of the \n     Navy, the Assistant Secretary (Comptroller) of the Army, and \n     the Assistant Secretary (Comptroller) of the Air Force, the \n     chief financial officer positions, and the Controller of the \n     Office of Management and Budget shall not take effect;\n       Cornyn amendment No. 504, to strike the provisions relating \n     to the Comptroller of the Army, the Comptroller of the Navy, \n     and the Comptroller of the Air Force.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be up to \n30 minutes of debate, with the Senator from Louisiana, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, the Senator from Nevada, or his designee, and the \nSenator from Kentucky, or his designee, each controlling 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 499\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I would like to close on my czar amendment \nand encourage strong bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, we have a bill before us about the Senate advice and \nconsent process--the Senate confirmation process--and I think it would \nbe a tragedy to consider any bill on that subject and not, in fact, \naddress the biggest issue, the biggest problem with that process that \nexists now--certainly also in the eyes of the American people--and that \nis the abuse by the Executive, over several administrations but \nculminating in this administration, of appointing so-called czars as an \nend run around the U.S. Constitution, as an end run around the powers \nof the Senate and the balance of power of advice and consent and \nconfirmation.\n  My amendment would fix that. It would defund czars and their offices. \nIt is carefully crafted, it is carefully defined, and it would say we \nare not going to allow these czars to operate when they are essentially \ntaking the place and the function of what should be a Senate-confirmed \nposition. Again, the language is careful. It is carefully thought out, \nit is carefully crafted, and there are exceptions in the language which \nare important, so I commend all my colleagues to look at that. But the \nmain point is simple and clear and important: We shouldn't allow any \nExecutive, any administration, to end-run the U.S. Constitution, to \nend-run the Senate's important and appropriate role of confirmation, or \nadvice and consent.\n  So I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  In closing, I thank several Members who have cosponsored the \namendment--Senators Paul and Heller and Grassley--and I also thank very \nmuch Senator Collins, who has been a leader on this effort and has \nfreestanding legislation on the topic which I support. We have and will \ncontinue to consult on this issue until we properly get the job done.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be equally \nallocated to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President I ask that the quorum call be suspended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I would like to speak on my amendment which will be voted \non in a few minutes.\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 510\n\n  This amendment would strike the Director of the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics from the list of the Senate-confirmed positions that would \nbe removed from the confirmation process. I wish to explain why this is \nimportant because this seems to be something that maybe would not be \nimportant to pull out from this long list of nominees who no longer \nneed be confirmed. It is very important that this particular position, \nthis nominee for this position, be vetted and confirmed by the Senate.\n  It is often said statistics don't lie; people do. Particularly in \nthis business, we have seen one set of statistics be interpreted and \npublicized in totally different ways, and that is why this position is \nso important. The role they have is critical. In a democracy and in a \nfree country, one of the most important aspects to protect against is \nthat risk of the government becoming a propaganda machine.\n  I wish to read what this particular position does: The Bureau of \nJustice Statistics collects, analyzes, publishes, and disseminates \ninformation on crime, criminal offenders, crime victims, and criminal \njustice operations.\n  It is very important. This information is acted on by local, State, \nand Federal officials. Lots of our laws are shaped and based on this \ninformation. Statistics are only as valuable as the reputation of the \nstatistician, and that is what this position is.\n  Every Member of this body knows how to write a question so you get \nthe answer you want. If we are going to have a Bureau of Justice \nStatistics, don't we want the public to have some level of trust in the \ndata they publish? If we just put some political hack in this \nposition--as, unfortunately, has happened over administrations of both \nparties, not necessarily for this position but we know in some \npositions--it would totally discredit what this person does. So do we \nwant the public to think they are cooking the books to promote policy \nends on issues such as gun control, hate crimes, racial profiling, \nimmigration, drug policy, and so forth? If we cannot absolutely trust \nthe impartiality of the management of the Bureau, we should abolish it \nand give the money back to the taxpayers.\n  We know we are $14 trillion in debt. Our Nation is on the brink of \nfinancial collapse. My constituents have no interest in borrowing money \nfrom the Chinese to fund the Bureau to compile crime statistics if we \ncan't trust the numbers. If there is even a hint of bias of a political \nagenda or of the head of this Bureau being friendly to the perspective \nof whatever party is in the White House, then we should abolish the \nagency.\n  In the past, those on the right have been suspicious that the Bureau \nof Justice Statistics has had a bias against gun rights and against the \nfirst amendment. Whether that is true, who knows. BJS statistics are \nused to form policy decisions. If the agency becomes a tool of the \nparty in power, that will no longer be the case.\n  When James Lynch, the nominee for the Director of the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, was asked in his confirmation hearing what the \nbiggest challenge for the Bureau of Justice Statistics moving forward \nwas, he responded: ``I think the biggest challenges of the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics moving forward are the perennial challenges to a \nstatistical agency; that is to say, to maintain its credibility as an \nindependent Federal statistical agency.''\n  It is important we hear that. It is important Americans hear that, \nand we will not have that opportunity if this position is no longer \nconfirmed.\n  It is not often that you hear a nominee suggest that the No. 1 \nchallenge he faces in assuming a position is to maintain the \ncredibility and independence of the agency he is about to run. But, as \nDr. Lynch said, that is the nature of a statistical agency, and it is \nprecisely the reason why we should not remove this position from the \nconfirmation process.\n  The questions at the live hearing and the submitted written questions \nappropriately focused almost exclusively on this issue of credibility, \nindependence, and accountability.\n  How do we protect the Director from political influence and tampering \nby the executive? There was discussion about ways to restructure the \noffice to make it more independent and further reinforce its \nindependent roll. There was discussion of moving the director to a 6-\nyear term to further reinforce his independence, a proposal that the \nnominee supports. Of course, a 6-year term would imply Senate \nconfirmation.\n  In every way possible, the committee and nominee discussed ways to \nsolidify the independence of the position and protect it from political \ninfluence. In the context of these discussions, it was once suggested \nthat we remove the position from the confirmation process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. With all the nominees who are confirmed in the Senate \nwith no debate or vote, it would seem the confirmation process is \nserving a purpose.\n  First, there are things that happen behind the scenes to vet and \nreview these nominees and their backgrounds. Unfortunately, as we have \nseen, the President, in some cases, with what we call czars in other \npositions and recess appointments, has sidestepped that. That has \nreduced the credibility in these positions, but let me just focus again \non this one position.\n  We never want the American Government to be accused of being a \npropaganda machine, as we see from governments all over the world. This \none area of statistics, where they are disseminating information all \nover the country that so many respond to, needs to be credible and \nindependent. I encourage my colleagues to keep this one position in the \nconfirmation process so we will have an opportunity to make sure that, \nregardless of which party is in power, we have a credible, independent \nvoice dealing with these statistics.\n  I thank the President for yielding me a little more time. I yield \nback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 499\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBarrasso be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I just wish to indicate my support for \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Although it is drafted a little differently than I would have done \nit, it does address a real problem; that is, when the President--this \nPresident or any President--creates a new position within the White \nHouse that is duplicative of a Cabinet member's responsibilities, the \nresult is we lose our ability to exercise accountability for the \npolicies that individual comes up with. Let me give you a specific \nexample.\n  EPA is a Senate-Presidential appointee, Senate-confirmed position, \nthe Administrator of the EPA. Yet President Obama created a position \nwithin the White House where there is essentially an environmental \nczar, and this individual--Carol Browner, who has since left, actually \nnegotiated a deal with the automobile industry having to do with \nemissions. Well, the problem with that is, it is circumventing \nCongress's ability to hold accountable the person who is involved in \nmaking and coordinating that policy.\n  What the Senator from Louisiana is trying to get at is the creation \nof these unaccountable czars within the White House who are doing the \njob that is supposed to be done by a Cabinet official, by a \nPresidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed official.\n  So I support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before I get into the substance of my \nremarks, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the previous \norder, the vote in relation to the Vitter amendment No. 499 occur at \n12:30 and the vote in relation to the DeMint amendment No. 510 occur at \n2 p.m, with the remaining provisions of the previous order remaining in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to make sure this has been cleared \nwith the Senator from South Carolina?\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It has.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is our intention to work on setting up \nadditional votes this afternoon following the vote on the DeMint \namendment No. 510.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered \nby my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Vitter. As you know, the \nunderlying bill is the product of a bipartisan gentlemen's agreement \nreached earlier this year that seeks to streamline and otherwise \nimprove the efficiency of the Senate's confirmation process. The \nSenator from Maine, the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from \nConnecticut, and myself, as well as the leaders, Leader Reid and Leader \nMcConnell, have been heavily involved in this process.\n  The amendment offered by Mr. Vitter runs counter to the spirit of \ncomity behind this important bill. It is a poison pill designed to \nhandcuff the President's ability to assemble a team of topflight \nadvisers and aides. The amendment is nothing new. It has been \nintroduced several times in several iterations.\n  Now is the time to move forward. It is one of those moments when we \ncan bridge the partisan divide and make the Senate a more efficient \nbody. It is not the time or place to relitigate old and, frankly, silly \npolitical battles about so-called czars.\n  It is our constitutionally mandated duty as Senators to ensure that \nthe most important positions in government are confirmed in a timely \nmanner. With the underlying bill, we finally begin to break the logjam \nthat holds up senior positions by taking midlevel, nonpolicy positions \noff the docket.\n  I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 510\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I also rise now because of the change in \nthe time schedule to speak against the amendment offered by Mr. DeMint. \nLike the Vitter amendment, this amendment is opposed to the great \nspirit of comity behind the underlying bill.\n  I would like to remind my colleague from South Carolina that the \nbipartisan working group labored over every decision we made. Far from \nlifting our index fingers to the wind, we carefully debated the nuances \nof the changes that were ultimately proposed.\n  The change the Senator from South Carolina finds fault with involves \nthe Bureau of Justice Statistics. Let me tell you about this position. \nThe Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports to the Senate-\nconfirmed Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice \nPrograms, who then reports to the Senate-confirmed Associate Attorney \nGeneral, who then reports to the Senate-confirmed Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, who--you guessed it--reports to the Attorney General, also \nconfirmed. How much more oversight do we need for one man? Is four \nlevels of congressional oversight not enough?\n  It is clear to me that this amendment is really designed to hamper \nour goal of improving the way the Senate functions. After all, there \nare four similar positions at the Department of Justice with parallel \nlines of reporting that we plan to remove from Senate confirmation, but \nthe Senator from South Carolina does not take aim at those. Simply put, \nthis is a prime example of the type of amendment that slows the Senate \ndown, the type of amendment that is really aimed at preventing the \npassage of this bill.\n  The number of Senate-confirmed positions has increased by hundreds \nover the last few decades. As you know, this proliferation has slowed \nthe confirmation process to a near standstill. What used to be a \nflowing, functioning faucet now trickles.\n  This position is one of those midlevel positions that should be \nremoved to free up our process so we can focus our time on the \npositions that are more senior, that do not report to so many other \nlevels of Senate-confirmed positions. Removing Senate confirmation for \nthis position does not in any way weaken our constitutional advice and \nconsent power or give any extra power to the President. This power was \ngiven to us to be used to confirm the most senior policymaking \npositions, and the President has power to appoint his midlevel and \nlower level appointees.\n  I oppose this amendment, which will be voted on after our respective \nlunches, and urge my colleagues to join me in voting against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Currency Manipulation\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, last week Minority Leader Pelosi \nand some of her colleagues signaled their intention to introduce a \ndischarge resolution for a vote on H.R. 639, the Currency Reform for \nFair Trade Act. I applaud those in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives who want to push on currency reform and encourage the \nSpeaker and House leadership to support this position.\n  Similar legislation to this passed overwhelmingly with strong \nbipartisanship in the last Congress. Senator Snowe from Maine and I \nintroduced that legislation in the Senate. It would strengthen \ncountervailing duty laws to consider undervalued currency as an unfair \nsubsidy in determining duty rates.\n  What does that mean? What that means is that in essence we have lost \njobs in this country because too often the playing field in our trade \nrelationship with the People's Republic of China is simply not level. \nWe know that China in far too many cases subsidizes energy. We know \nthey subsidize land. We know they subsidize capital. We know they \nsubsidize production in various ways. We also know in terms of currency \nthat China does not play fairly.\n  When an industry such as the coated-paper industry in Hamilton, OH, \nin southwest Ohio, north of Cincinnati, or the aluminum industry in \nwestern Ohio, in Sidney, or the steel industry in Lorain, OH--when an \nindustry petitions the International Trade Commission for relief \nagainst unfair subsidies, currency manipulation would be part of that \ninvestigation. That bill would make sure that happens. It is simple, it \nis straightforward, and it is achievable. It sends a signal to our \ntrading partners that we will not accept unfair advantage over American \nworkers and American businesses. I can't count the number of times--I \nknow that in North Carolina the Presiding Officer has seen the same \nsituation in textiles and other industries--where, simply put, American \nworkers have trouble competing and American businesses have trouble \nselling their products because of unfair trade advantages that \ncountries and companies in those countries have inflicted on the United \nStates.\n  Don't forget the stakes. We are all concerned about the budget \ndeficit, to be sure, and we heard Senator Conrad earlier talking about \nthat in a convincing and persuasive way. Cut the budget. Set it up long \nterm, medium term. Don't do it right now, as Chairman Bernanke, a \nRepublican appointee, says. That will cost us jobs. But build in \ndeficit reductions. Think about the budget deficit, but don't forget \nthe trade deficit.\n  Over the last 10 years, particularly since most favored nation with \nChina and NAFTA and the Bush administration's trade agenda on CAFTA and \nthe other trade agreements and lack of enforcement on those trade \nagreements, we have seen job losses because of those trade agreements.\n  President Bush once said that $1 billion in trade surplus or trade \ndeficit\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\ntranslates into 13,000 jobs. Why is that? If you have a budget surplus \nof $1 billion, you have 13,000 more jobs in your country. If you have a \ntrade deficit of $1 billion, you have 13,000 fewer. The reason is \nclear: If you have a $1 billion trade deficit, it means you are buying \n$1 billion worth of goods more from country X--China, let's say--than \nyou are selling to China. That means $1 billion worth of more \nproduction is taking place in China than in the United States. That is \nOK, but when the numbers are hundreds of billions of dollars--our trade \ndeficit is fluctuating between $400 and $750 billion, between $1 \nbillion a day and $2 billion a day--that is real jobs. Multiply those \njob numbers--13,000 for $1 billion--and you see the kind of job losses \nwe have in the United States of America, especially in manufacturing, \nhitting those communities such as Lorain or Mansfield or Springfield or \nDayton or Youngstown or Cleveland or cities in western New York, in \nSyracuse or Rochester or cities in North Carolina. You can see what it \nhas done in small towns and urban areas alike to our job growth.\n  In April 2011, our total trade deficit in that month alone was $54 \nbillion. Our trade deficit with China in that month alone was $21 \nbillion.\n  Paul Krugman, a columnist with the New York Times, said:\n\n       If you want a trade policy that helps employment, it has to \n     be a policy that induces other countries to run bigger \n     deficits or smaller surpluses. A countervailing duty on \n     Chinese exports would be job creating; a deal with South \n     Korea, not.\n\n  I am not here today to argue or debate or even be critical of the \nfree-trade agreement with South Korea. I think it is a bad idea. I hear \nthe promises of administration after administration. This \nadministration at least has not overpromised, as the Bush and Clinton \nadministrations did, on the creation of jobs and trade, but we know \nthat every time there is a trade agreement, the trade deficit goes up \nand job loss accelerates, especially in manufacturing.\n  The point is that one major thing we can do about this is what the \nHouse of Representatives is trying to do; that is, pass the Currency \nReform for Fair Trade Act. It will simply mean that China and the \nUnited States are on a more even, more level playing field, a more even \nrelationship. It will save and help to increase manufacturing jobs. We \nknow manufacturing jobs are a ticket to the middle class.\n  In Germany, 20 percent of its workforce is in manufacturing. Only 10 \npercent of our workforce is in manufacturing. Germany has higher \nunionization rates, higher wages, and a trade surplus.\n  The United States has, as I pointed out, almost a $1 billion-a-day \ntrade deficit with China--somewhat less than that; not much--and up to \na $2 billion-a-day trade deficit with the world as a whole. Clearly our \ntrade policy is not working. Currency reform is one major step in \nfixing that. It is something that I hope this Senate takes up sooner \nrather than later and that the House of Representatives does the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to \namendment No. 499, offered by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arkansas (Mr. Boozman) and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote the yeas are 47, the nays are 51. \nUnder the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of this \namendment, the amendment is not agreed to.\n  Under the previous order, the motion to reconsider is considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 514\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Toomey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 514.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the Governors and \n    alternate governors of the International Monetary Fund and the \n         International Bank for Reconstruction and Development)\n\n       On page 63, strike lines 3 through 18.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nVitter as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I rise to offer an amendment to retain the Senate \nconfirmation process for two positions: the position of Governor and \nAlternate Governor of the IMF and the International Bank for \nReconstruction and Development.\n  The Board of Governors at the IMF is the highest level of governance \nof the IMF. Currently, the Governor and the Alternative Governor are \nboth subject to Senate confirmation. This bill would change that. This \nbill would remove them from the Senate confirmation process.\n  I think I understand the rationale behind that thinking. It is \nprobably because, by custom, the United States has appointed the \nSecretary of the Treasury as the Governor designate to the IMF and the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve as the Alternate Governor. So since \nthose folks have already been through a Senate confirmation process, no \ndoubt the thought was that we did not need to have a separate one.\n  Here is the reason for my amendment; that is, the decision to appoint \nthese two individuals to these two posts has been by custom, and there \nis nothing in statute or otherwise that requires the President to \nappoint these two individuals. The President--any future President--\ncould choose to nominate anyone he or she may like. I think it is very \nimportant in that event the Senate would continue to have the oversight \nthat comes with the advice and consent that my amendment would retain.\n  The truth is, the United States is the largest lender to the IMF, and \nright now the IMF is in the process of using U.S. taxpayer dollars to \nbail out Greece and perhaps other countries. At a time when Greece and \nEurope are virtually drowning in debt, I do not think the Senate should \nbe conceding its confirmation authority and potentially\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\nthereby reducing its oversight over the key IMF officials responsible \nfor overseeing tens of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars.\n  I think we all know, the United States does not even have its own \nfiscal house in order.\n  Yet here we are giving over $100 billion to the IMF for them to, in \nturn, lend money to insolvent governments. That doesn't make sense to \nme. We are running a $1.5 trillion deficit, nearly 10 percent of our \nentire economy. Our debt is at 69 percent of our GDP and rising \nrapidly. It seems to me that American taxpayers should not be asked to \nbail out European governments that clearly haven't been able to get \ntheir act together. But recently, we actually expanded the liability \nU.S. taxpayers have to the IMF.\n  Let me comment for a minute specifically on this idea of bailing out \nGreece because I think it is a very bad idea. Greek debt exceeds 150 \npercent of their total economy now. The Brookings Institute estimates \nthat bribery and corruption alone amount to 8 percent of GDP annually. \nThe Greek workforce has a very low productivity rate. There is a very \nlow percentage of their population engaged in the workforce. By any \nmeasure, this is an economy that is in a downward spiral.\n  Despite that and despite a $160 billion bailout last May, in 2011, \nthe Greek Government decided to increase its total expenditures. While \nrunning this staggering and unsustainable government, their \ngovernment's decision was to increase spending. The fact is, \nunfortunately, no loan, no matter how large, no matter from where it \ncomes, is going to solve Greece's problems. It is not that Greece has a \nproblem with liquidity; their problem is solvency. Greece is insolvent. \nIt cannot, and therefore will not, repay all its debt.\n  The danger is going down this road and having the IMF and other \nmultinationals lending money to Greece now, and we are effectively \nreplacing the existing loans made by private banks--essentially \nEuropean banks--with taxpayer dollars provided by these big \ninstitutions.\n  Essentially, the Greek Government is going to default on the debt. \nThe only question is, Upon whose debt? Will it be that of the private \nbanks that lent them the money, as I believe it ought to be--those are \nthe people who made the imprudent decision when they extended money to \na fundamentally insolvent government--or will it be taxpayer-funded \ninstitutions because those institutions have taken out the debt of the \nprivate banks?\n  I am afraid that is where we are heading, and that will include U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars. I think it is a big mistake. It is also an unusual \ntransaction for IMF, primarily for two reasons. It is unusual to lend \nmoney to developed economies. Usually, this kind of program goes to \ndeveloping nations. But it is even more unusual in the magnitude, the \nsheer scale of this.\n  In 2010, the IMF bailout of Greece was more than 3,000 percent of \nGreece's IMF quota. Typically, the size of loans such as this is no \nmore than 200 to 600 percent of a nation's quota. This was 3,000 \npercent.\n  One of the biggest problems with going down this road of having \nmultinational institutions bailing out insolvent countries is the moral \nhazard. There are a number of countries around Europe that are in \nsubstantial trouble, with varying degrees of fiscal problems, and some \nare teetering on the edge of insolvency. What is the message we are \nsending to those governments if multinationals come in and bail out \nGreece? The message is: Don't make the tough decisions now and impose \nthe kinds of austerity you need because someday somebody will come \nalong and bail you out of this problem. That is a very bad policy.\n  Most of all, we ought not to be putting U.S. taxpayers in this \nposition of taking on this liability, which I am afraid is not going to \nbe repaid. The reality is, Congress has very limited oversight over \nIMF, by design--very limited authority. One of the few checks we do \nhave is the ability to provide or to withhold our consent with respect \nto those who are nominated to that powerful governing board. I don't \nthink, at a time when the IMF is going out putting tens of billions of \nU.S. taxpayer dollars at risk, bailing out irresponsible and insolvent \nforeign countries--at a time such as this, I don't think we should be \ndoing anything to relinquish that authority we have, to diminish the \nopportunity we would have to provide that advice and consent.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for the purpose of speaking as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Libya and Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I speak today on a day that appears to be \npositioned between two very consequential decisions.\n  Yesterday, the President announced his plan to draw down U.S. forces \nin Afghanistan, pledging to pull out 10,000 troops this year and the \nremaining 23,000 surge forces by September of 2012.\n  Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will likely vote on a measure \nto limit the use of U.S. funding for U.S. military operations in Libya \nto only ``nonkinetic activities''--in other words, noncombat \nactivities--meaning no limited strike missions to suppress air defenses \nor predator strikes against Qadhafi forces, which we are doing very \nlittle of already. The only military actions for which the Commander in \nChief could commit our Armed Forces would be supporting missions from \nsearch and rescue to aerial refueling to intelligence.\n  Those are the provisions in what is very likely to be voted on and \npassed by the House of Representatives tomorrow.\n  Some may not see a connection between these decisions, but the \nconnection is profound. We are having a profound debate in this country \nright now that I suspect will continue for some time. Critical \nquestions are being asked and discussed: How should we in the United \nStates define our national interests? What is the proper role for \nAmerica in the world? How do we balance our commitments abroad and the \nglobal demands for U.S. leadership with an American public that is \njustifiably war weary after a decade of conflict and that is rightly \nconcerned with our unsustainable levels of government spending and \nnational debt?\n  These are vital questions. They will determine the future of our \nNation and, indeed, the future of the world. Reasonable Americans can \ndisagree over what the right answers are. Although our disagreements \nmay be heated and passionate, we should always remember that we are all \nAmericans, that we are all patriotic, and that we all want to do what \nis best for the Nation we love.\n  The discussions we are now having over Libya and Afghanistan go right \nto the heart of this broader debate, and this is where we see the real \npractical impact of the decisions all of us in public life must make \nand be accountable for. We are all trying to define America's interests \nand role in the world, to separate that which we can and must do from \nthat which is beyond our capacity and our benefit to try to accomplish. \nWe are all striving for a balanced approach to America's interests \nabroad, and it is for that reason I am very concerned about both the \nPresident's decision on Afghanistan and the House's pending vote on \nLibya.\n  I agree with the President that, thanks especially to the sacrifice \nand courage of our fighting men and women, we are making amazing \nprogress in Afghanistan. This progress is real and it is remarkable. \nBut as our commanders on the ground all point out, it is also fragile \nand reversible. Our commanders also say what will be decisive is the \nfighting season next year--the warmer spring and summer months--when \nthe insurgency historically picks up its operations after resting and \nregrouping a bit during the colder months. This will be our opportunity \nto consolidate our gains in southern Afghanistan and begin \ntransitioning more and more of that fight to our Afghan friends, while \nincreasing numbers of U.S. forces shift\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\ntheir main effort to eastern Afghanistan where the Haqqani network, al-\nQaida, and other regional militant groups are still present and \noperating actively.\n  The reason our commanders had to take this sequential approach is \nbecause they did not get all the forces they requested in 2009--40,000 \ntroops as opposed to the 33,000 the President gave them. What this \nmeans in practice is that our commanders in Afghanistan still need next \nyear's fighting season to deal the same crushing blow to al-Qaida and \nthe Taliban in the east as our forces have dealt them in the south. \nHowever, under the President's plan, which calls for having all of our \nsurge units out of Afghanistan by September, those troops will begin \nflowing out of Afghanistan right at the time the Taliban, al-Qaida, and \ntheir allies begin stepping up their operations, especially in eastern \nAfghanistan.\n  This is the irony of it all. The President's decision in December \n2009 had the effect of making this war longer and costlier by forcing \nour commanders to tackle our enemies in southern and eastern \nAfghanistan sequentially over 2 years rather than simultaneously in one \ndecisive action over 1 year. Now, just at the moment when our troops \ncould finish our main objective and begin ending our combat operations \nin a responsible way, just when they are 1 year away from turning over \na battered and broken enemy in both southern and eastern Afghanistan to \nour Afghan partners, the President has now decided to deny them the \nforces our commanders believe they need to accomplish their objective.\n  I hope I am wrong, I hope the President is right, that this decision \nwill not endanger the hard-won gains our troops have made with the \ndecisive progress they still need to make next year. I hope that proves \ncorrect. But I am very concerned the President's decision poses an \nunnecessary risk to the progress we have made thus far to our mission \nand to our men and women in uniform.\n  Our troops are not exhausted. They are excited that after 10 years we \nfinally have a winning strategy that is turning this war around. Anyone \nwho says that our troops are exhausted should go out and talk to them. \nThey want to stay at this until the job is done. We have sacrificed too \nmuch. America has a vital national interest in succeeding in \nAfghanistan. After all that we have given to this mission, the money we \nhave committed to it, the decade we have devoted to it, and the \nprecious lives we have lost throughout it, why would we do anything now \nthat puts our mission at greater risk of failure?\n  I would offer the same counsel to my Republican friends in the House \nwith regard to our mission in Libya. I know my colleagues in Congress \nare angry with the administration and its Libya policy, and they have \nevery right to be. From the disrespect and disregard the administration \nhas shown Congress, to their bizarre assertion we are not really \nengaged in the hostilities in Libya, to the lack of resolve with which \nthey have prosecuted this fight and made the public case for it, the \nadministration has done an unfortunate amount to earn the ire of \nCongress. But we can't forget the main point: In the midst of the most \nground-breaking geopolitical event in two decades, at least, as \npeaceful protests for democracy were sweeping the Middle East, with \nQadhafi's forces to strike at the gates of Benghazi, and with Arabs and \nMuslims in Libya and across the region pleading for the U.S. military \nto stop the bloodshed, the United States and our allies took action and \nprevented the massacre that Qadhafi had promised to commit in a city of \n700,000 people.\n  By doing so, they began creating conditions that are increasing the \npressure on Qadhafi to give up power. Yes, the progress toward this \ngoal has been slower than many had hoped, and the administration is \ndoing less to achieve it than I and others would like. But here are the \nfacts: We are succeeding in Libya. Qadhafi is going to fall. It is just \na matter of time.\n  So I would ask my colleagues: Is this the time for Congress to turn \nagainst this policy? Is this the time to ride to the rescue of an anti-\nAmerican tyrant, when the writing is on the wall that he is collapsing?\n  Is this the time for Congress to declare to the world and to Qadhafi \nand his inner circle, to Qadhafi's opponents who are fighting for their \nfreedom, and to our NATO allies who are carrying a far heavier burden \nin this conflict than we are, is this the time for America to tell all \nof these people that our heart is not in this and that we won't see \nthis mission through; that we will abandon our best friends and allies \non a whim?\n  This all comes back to how we, as Americans, define our national \ninterests and act on them. We can all agree that none of us are averse \nto doing what is necessary to defend America and our allies when we \nface a clear threat in the world.\n  In that way, we are like any other nation in history. But what sets \nus apart from those other nations, what makes us exceptional, what \nmakes us the United States of America is that we define our interests \nmore broadly than that. Our interests also encompass the fact that we \nare the leader of the free world; that the circle of nations that want \nus to play that role is growing, not diminishing; and that this \nposition of leadership also confers responsibilities that are greater \nthan our own immediate and material self-interests. It is the \nresponsibility we have to the universal ideals of freedom and justice \nand human rights, of which our Nation is both the greatest embodiment \nand the greatest champion in human history.\n  That is not to say we can or should be involved everywhere. That is \nnot to say we must act wherever and whenever our ideals are threatened. \nThis is not to say military action is always the right answer, nor is \nthis a recipe for endless conflict and commitment. America is powerful, \nbut we are not omnipotent. We must make hard choices about where to \nspend our blood and treasure.\n  There will be more occasions than not when we will choose not to \nintervene, either because our interests do not warrant it or because we \ndon't have the capacity to do so or because greater American \ninvolvement will not improve the situation. When we choose not to \nintervene forcefully in places where the cause of justice is calling \nout to us, be it Sudan or the Congo or Syria or countless other places \nwhere I and others have argued against intervention, we will be \nassailed as hypocritical and inconsistent. That is unfair, but it is \nnothing new for America.\n  What we can never forget is that our Nation's interests are forever \ncolored by our values. America has always believed that the success of \nfreedom and democracy in other lands does not just make our world more \njust; it makes it a safer, more secure, and better place for Americans \nand our children.\n  We can never afford to define our interests so narrowly that we would \nhave sat back as an anti-American tyrant slaughtered his own people, \nthereby destroying one of the most historic attempts by millions of \nArabs and Muslims to build better and more stable governments. That \nwould have served neither our moral nor our strategic interests. \nSimilarly, once we are engaged in a fight, as we are now in Libya and \nAfghanistan, and when we still have a clear path to succeed, as we do \nin both countries, it is in our moral and strategic interests to finish \nthe job even if it is difficult and costly and unpopular. Failure is \nthe only cost we truly cannot afford.\n  America cannot make the world perfect, but we can make it better, \nfreer, more just, more prosperous. That is what has always made us an \nexceptional nation. That is what has always been the greatest source of \nour national security. That is what has always made us America. And \nthat is how we must remain.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following articles be \nprinted in the Record: the Wall Street Journal article from this \nmorning entitled ``Libya and Republicans,'' the Washington Post \neditorial from this morning entitled ``End of a Surge,'' and the Wall \nStreet Journal article entitled ``Unplugging the Afghan Surge.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 23, 2011]\n\n                             End of A Surge\n\n\n     the mismatch between President Obama's strategy and his troop \n                          withdrawal timetable\n\n       President Obama failed to offer a convincing military or \n     strategic rationale for\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\n     the troop withdrawals from Afghanistan that he announced \n     Wednesday night. In several ways, they are at odds with the \n     strategy adopted by NATO, which aims to turn over the war to \n     the Afghan army by the end of 2014. For that plan to succeed, \n     military commanders believe that U.S. and allied forces must \n     hold the areas in southern Afghanistan that have been cleared \n     of the Taliban through this summer's fighting season as well \n     as that of 2012. They also must sweep eastern provinces that \n     have not yet been reached by the counterinsurgency campaign.\n       By withdrawing 5,000 U.S. troops this summer and another \n     5,000 by the end of the year, Mr. Obama will make those tasks \n     harder. By setting September 2012 as a deadline for \n     withdrawing all of the 33,000 reinforcements he ordered in \n     late 2009, the President risks undermining not only the war \n     on the ground but also the effort to draw elements of the \n     Taliban into a political settlement; the militants may prefer \n     to wait out a retreating enemy. It also may be harder to gain \n     cooperation from Pakistan, whose willingness to break with \n     the Taliban is linked to its perception of U.S. determination \n     to remain engaged in the region. U.S. allies, which have \n     committed 40,000 troops to the 2014 plan, may revise their \n     own exit strategies.\n       An accelerated withdrawal of American forces would make \n     more sense if Mr. Obama had decided to abandon the modified \n     counterinsurgency plan he adopted at the end of 2009, which \n     was later expanded and endorsed by NATO. Vice President \n     Biden, among others, has pressed for a more limited \n     counterterrorism strategy focused on combating al-Qaeda. But \n     Mr. Obama offered no indication in Wednesday's speech that he \n     has altered his objectives. Instead, he argued that the \n     reduction is possible because ``we are achieving our goals. . \n     . . We are starting this drawdown from a position of \n     strength.''\n       Mr. Obama correctly pointed out that the killing of Osama \n     bin Laden and operations in Pakistan have weakened al-Qaeda \n     and limited its ability to attack the United States. But a \n     Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan, which Mr. Obama's \n     withdrawals risk, would be deeply destabilizing for a region \n     that includes nuclear-armed Pakistan and India. If the Afghan \n     government or army crumbles, there would be a considerable \n     chance that the United States would lose the bases it now \n     uses for drone attacks against al-Qaeda.\n       Perhaps the best justification for Mr. Obama's decision is \n     U.S. domestic opinion. As senior administration officials \n     have pointed out, Americans have grown weary of the war; \n     polls show that a majority support a rapid withdrawal of U.S. \n     forces, and that view is increasingly reflected in Congress \n     and even among Republican presidential candidates. Many in \n     Congress cite the cost of the war--though the few billion \n     dollars saved through a faster withdrawal will have little \n     impact on a deficit measured in trillions.\n       By announcing these pullouts, Mr. Obama may ease some of \n     the political pressure while still allowing his commanders \n     enough forces to complete the 2014 transition plan. The \n     president's supporters point out that at the end of 2012, \n     there will still be twice as many U.S. troops in \n     Afghanistan--68,000--as when Mr. Obama took office. We hope \n     those prove sufficient. But Mr. Obama's withdrawal decision, \n     with no clear basis in strategy, increases the risk of \n     failure.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 23, 2011]\n\n                         Libya and Republicans\n\n\n        Cutting off funds is what Democrats do to GOP Presidents\n\n       Back in the day--this would be March 7, 2011--Newt Gingrich \n     offered a compelling case for intervening militarily in \n     Libya:\n       ``Exercise a no-fly zone this evening,'' he told Fox News \n     Channel. ``Communicate to the Libyan military that Gadhafi is \n     gone. . . . Provide help to the rebels to replace him. I \n     mean, the idea that we're confused about a man who has been \n     an anti-American dictator since 1969 just tells you how inept \n     this Administration is. . . . We don't need to have the \n     United Nations. All we have to say is that we think \n     slaughtering your own citizens is unacceptable.''\n       Mr. Gingrich has since, er, clarified his position, so that \n     today the former Speaker is one of several prominent \n     Republicans, along with fellow Presidential candidates \n     Michele Bachmann and Jon Huntsman, opposing President Obama \n     for doing most of what he advised a few months ago. Add the \n     House vote expected Friday seeking to limit funding for the \n     Libya effort, and we are witnessing at the very least some \n     unsightly political opportunism, if not yet the rebirth of \n     pre-Eisenhower GOP isolationism.\n       We understand the argument--we've made it often ourselves--\n     that Mr. Obama has prosecuted the Libya campaign half-\n     heartedly. The major part of the U.S. combat mission lasted \n     days and has been over for months. The U.S. is supplying \n     logistical help to NATO, but the alliance hasn't been able to \n     dislodge Moammar Gadhafi. U.S. aid to the Libyan rebels has \n     been of the ``non-lethal'' variant--mainly MRE rations--when \n     what they most need are guns and munitions.\n       About a dozen countries, most recently Germany, have \n     formally recognized the Benghazi-based Transitional National \n     Council as Libya's legitimate government. But the U.S. hasn't \n     done so, and only now is Congress advancing the legislation \n     that would allow Gadhafi's frozen assets to be sent to \n     Libya's people in the form of humanitarian aid. The evidence \n     we've seen does not suggest, beyond isolated examples, that \n     the rebels are linked to al Qaeda, while Gadhafi's record in \n     promoting terrorism is clear.\n       But all of this is an argument for prodding Mr. Obama to \n     win the wars he starts, not to cut off funding and guarantee \n     defeat. It is also an opportunity for Republicans to point \n     out that Gadhafi has the blood of hundreds of Americans on \n     his hands, and that to allow him to remain in power would \n     give the vindictive tyrant a chance to strike back. It would \n     also likely mean the collapse of NATO as a credible military \n     alliance. These are the kind of U.S. security interests that \n     Republicans have defended as a core party principle for \n     decades.\n       Instead on Libya, Republicans are wrapping themselves in \n     the 1973 War Powers Resolution, a Watergate-era law the \n     constitutionality of which no President has recognized, and \n     which Mr. Gingrich rightly attempted to have repealed in the \n     1990s, saying at the time that ``I want to strengthen the \n     current Democratic President because he is the President of \n     the United States.''\n       Trying to defund U.S. military operations has been the \n     habit of Democrats in Congress going back to the Vietnam era, \n     to no good end. In 1975, they slashed support for our allies \n     in South Vietnam, signaling to the North that it was open \n     season to invade. Saigon fell, and a generation of detention \n     and murder descended on Southeast Asia.\n       In the 1980s, Democrats cut off funds for the contra rebels \n     in Nicaragua, delaying their liberation from Communist \n     Sandinista rule. And most recently, they tried to shut down \n     the war in Iraq, emboldening the terrorist insurgents until \n     the GOP-backed surge defeated them. Is this the kind of \n     example that Republicans want to follow?\n       It's true that the Senate probably won't join any fund cut-\n     off, and Mr. Obama can veto the bill. In that sense the House \n     vote is purely symbolic--and even more politically cynical. \n     But such nuances will be missed in Tripoli, where the Gadhafi \n     family will take it as a sign to hold out longer. There's a \n     reason the dictator sent a thank-you missive to Speaker John \n     Boehner after the House Libya vote three weeks ago.\n       For half a century, and especially since Vietnam, the \n     Republican Party has stood for a strong national defense and \n     the projection of military power to defend U.S. interests and \n     to spread freedom around the world. Running to the left of \n     Nancy Pelosi and John Kerry is not the way to win elections, \n     much less to enhance America's security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 23, 2011]\n\n                      Unplugging the Afghan Surge\n\n\n       President Obama declares victory before it's been achieved\n\n       President Obama delivered a remarkable speech last night, \n     essentially unplugging the Afghanistan troop surge he \n     proposed only 18 months ago and doing so before its goals \n     have been achieved. We half expected to see a ``mission \n     accomplished'' banner somewhere in the background.\n       Not long ago, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates spoke about \n     only a token drawdown this year, but he's now on his way out \n     of the Pentagon. This time Mr. Obama overruled his military \n     advisers and sided instead with Vice President Joe Biden and \n     his political generals who have their eye on the mission of \n     re-election. His real generals, the ones in the field, will \n     now have to scramble to fulfill their counterinsurgency \n     mission, if that is still possible.\n       Mr. Obama said the U.S. will start to remove troops next \n     month, returning 10,000, or three or four brigades, by the \n     end of the year. The entire 33,000-soldier Obama surge will \n     be gone by next summer, and withdrawals will continue ``at a \n     steady pace'' after that. So the full surge force will have \n     been in Afghanistan for only a single fighting season, and \n     even the remaining 68,000 troops are heading out. Mr. Obama \n     reiterated NATO's previously agreed on date of 2014 for the \n     full transfer of combat operations to Afghan forces, but that \n     date now seems notional.\n       The President rightly pointed to the coalition progress \n     against the Taliban in Helmand and Kandahar provinces in the \n     south, in building up an Afghan army and eliminating \n     terrorist sanctuaries in Pakistan. But the military knows \n     these gains are tentative, and it pressed the White House to \n     keep all the fighting brigades in Afghanistan to press the \n     advantage. We don't envy the task of Lt. General John Allen, \n     who is taking over the Afghan command this summer from \n     General David Petraeus. He'll now have to take the battle to \n     the remaining Taliban strongholds in the east, while \n     protecting the gains made in the south and elsewhere, even as \n     he also manages the withdrawals. The expanding Afghan forces \n     will be able to fill in only some of the gaps, and the U.S. \n     troops who remain will be exposed to greater risks. The \n     burden of long deployments is hard on the troops, but those \n     we talk to would rather finish the job than leave too soon \n     and risk having their sacrifice washed away in a Taliban \n     resurgence.\n       In justifying the withdrawal, Mr. Obama repeatedly stressed \n     the damage we've done to al Qaeda. Yet most of those \n     successes have been mounted from Afghanistan, including the \n     killing of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Obama stressed that he'll \n     continue to press Pakistan to cooperate in attacking \n     terrorist havens, but his accelerated withdrawal schedule \n     will make that persuasion harder. The Pakistan military will \n     now almost surely not act against the Afghan Taliban. The \n     Pakistanis will press instead for a ``reconciliation'' \n     between the Afghan government\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\n     and Taliban leaders, who will be the most relieved by last \n     night's speech.\n       The President wanted to accentuate the progress of the \n     surge last night to explain his decision to short-circuit it. \n     But the real message was political and could not have been \n     clearer: ``America,'' he said, ``it is time to focus on \n     nation building here at home.'' And ``the tide of war is \n     receding.''\n       Mr. Obama was laying out his re-election theme as a \n     Commander in Chief who ended George W. Bush's wars and \n     brought the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan. He could \n     bring the troops home from Iraq because Mr. Bush had already \n     won the surge before Mr. Obama took office. Let's hope \n     America's generals can still conjure a similar success from \n     Afghanistan, despite a pre-empted surge and a Presidential \n     march to the exits.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I note my friend from South Carolina here today. The \nSenator from South Carolina, as many of us know, is a reserve colonel--\na terrible mistake by the promotion boards--in the U.S. Air Force JAG \nCorps. He has spent more time in Afghanistan than any Member of \nCongress, including more than most Members of Congress combined. He has \nobserved closely in Afghanistan the surge, its success, its \nimpediments. I ask unanimous consent to engage in colloquy with the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wonder if my friend saw General Keene, the architect of \nthe surge in Iraq, on one of the networks this morning describing his \nviews on the President's decision concerning drawing down our troops \nfrom Afghanistan.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I did. And if I could respond to my colleague about his \nstatement on the floor, I would like to associate myself with it. I \nthought it was a very well articulated statement about the times in \nwhich we live.\n  For about 18 months, we have had additional military capacity that \nwas never known to Afghanistan, all because of President Obama's \ndecision to send 33,000 troops at General Petraeus' request. Now, the \nrequest was for 40,000, but at the time, I said: I do appreciate \nPresident Obama giving the commander the resources that could do the \njob, but you have to do it differently.\n  General Keene is the architect of counterinsurgency. He is a mentor \nof General Petraeus. He and General Petraeus and others came up with \nthe strategy that succeeded in Iraq. Here is what has happened, from my \npoint of view.\n  I go about every 3 months. About 2 years ago, I was very afraid we \nwere going to lose.\n  How could the Taliban come back with about 100,000 NATO forces in \nAfghanistan? The truth was that the rules of engagement for NATO really \nwere law enforcement rules. The NATO forces could not engage the enemy \nin an effective way.\n  We were looking at this from the eyes of a law enforcement activity, \nand the number of American forces was about 30,000. That wasn't enough \nto help build the Afghan Army, train and equip the Afghan Army, control \nthe population, provide safety, and give governance a chance to \nflourish through better security. That is why we needed more troops.\n  To all the commanders before General Petraeus, you were holding \nAfghanistan together, in many ways with duct tape.\n  I believe Iraq is a pivotal moment in the war on terror, but it is a \nfair observation to make that because of the war in Iraq, resources \nwere taken away from Afghanistan. The truth is that even though we have \nbeen there almost 10 years, we really have only been there with the \ncapacity to bring about change for the last 18 months.\n  So what has happened in the last 18 months? The 30,000 surge forces \nwere sent to the southern part of Afghanistan. This really is a Pashtun \ncivil war. It is a fight between the Taliban, a radical element of the \nPashtun community, and a majority of Pashtuns and other Afghans who \nwant a different way.\n  Kandahar is in the south. It is the spiritual home of Mullah Omar. \nThat is the place he lived, and there is an American operating base \nwithin a mile of his compound. You can get up on the roof of a prison \nthere, and you can see Mullah Omar's compound. So the argument is, if \nwe can win in the south, we can win anywhere. So we took 30,000 troops \ninto the southern part of Afghanistan, and we broke the enemy's back. \nWe have allowed the Afghan Army and security forces to develop.\n  In September 2009, there were 800 people a month joining the Afghan \nArmy and 2,000 a month leaving. I am not very good at math, but that is \nnot a way to build an army. From December 2009 to the present, we have \nbeen recruiting 6,000 a month in the army, 3,000 in the police. What \nhappened? Better pay and a sense that we were going to win. So in 17 \nmonths, we have built up the Afghan security forces by 90,000. We will \nhave 305,000 by the end of this year.\n  What is the problem with the President's drawdown of forces? Why \ncan't you do it with the numbers we have? Counterinsurgency is a very \nlabor-intensive operation. Its goal is to provide population security \nand focus on training by fighting with a unit. Instead of training them \nduring the day and hoping they do well at night, you literally go out \nand live with the police and the army. It is a very labor-intensive \nactivity, but it is the best way to provide training and build \ncapacity.\n  Here is the problem. The surge forces under President Obama's \nwithdrawal plan are now going to compromise next summer. Drawing 10,000 \ndown this year is going to make it hard to finish out the fighting \nseason we are engaged in now.\n  But here is General Allen's dilemma. Because we had 30, not 40, we \ncouldn't go to RC-East, where the Haqqani Network exists, and fight the \nTaliban in the south at the same time. So we took our full force of the \nsurge and put it against the Taliban in the south. We broke their back. \nWe have been holding RC-East, and the game plan was to take those surge \nforces out of the south and go to RC-East next summer and deliver a \ndecisive blow to the Haqqani Network. That way, the two forces \nundermining Afghanistan would be put at bay.\n  Because of the President's decision and the rejection of General \nPetraeus' advice, come next summer the surge forces will be all gone by \nSeptember, and General Allen is in a box. How does he hang on to the \nsecurity gains in RC-South? Because the enemy's will has been broken, \nthey have been put on their knees, but they are not yet defeated \nbecause they can go across the border to Pakistan. So next summer, the \nsurge forces we were going to have available for General Allen are \ngoing to be gone, and RC-East cannot be engaged in the same fashion as \nRC-South.\n  What does that all matter? That means one of the enemies of the \nAfghan people is getting a reprieve and the ability to develop security \nforces all over the country so that when we leave, they can fight and \nwin has been compromised. Counterinsurgency requires math. You need a \ncertain amount of soldiers against the enemy.\n  I was asked last night: There are only 50 al-Qaida. Why do you need \nso many troops? One Navy SEAL could defeat 50 al-Qaida.\n  Those who suggest that simplistic formula don't understand what we \nare trying to do. We are trying to take a country that has been beaten \ndown and involved in civil war for 30 years and provide better \ngovernance through better security.\n  The way you beat the Taliban is you go and take them on with an \noverwhelming show of force. You inspire the local population to come \nyour way and get off the sidelines because they don't want the Taliban \nto win, but they are afraid that at the end of the day we are going to \nleave and the Taliban will take over. Because of this surge, the people \nin the south jumped our way. And this is what is so heartbreaking. We \nare on the verge of being able in two summers to deliver decisive blows \nto two enemies of ours and the Afghan people--the radical element of \nthe Taliban and the Haqqani Network in the east. But because of this \nadjustment in strategy, I think we now have lost capability, and \nGeneral Allen is going to have a much more difficult job.\n  Things to watch.\n  Mr. McCAIN. According to the Washington Post this morning, the \neditorial ``End Of A Surge. The mismatch between President Obama's \nstrategy and his troop withdrawal timetable'':\n\n       Mr. Obama's withdrawal decision, with no clear basis in \n     strategy, increases the risk of failure.\n\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\n\n  The only other issue--and I think the Senator from South Carolina is \nvery well qualified to describe it--I hear over and over, especially \nfrom those who are opposed to our involvement in this conflict, the \ntroops are exhausted, the troops are exhausted. Yet General Keene, this \nmorning on one of the news channels, said: They are not exhausted. They \nare exhilarated because they are winning. They know they have \nsacrificed so many of their comrades, killed and wounded. They are not \nexhausted. But they certainly, certainly don't want to come home in \ndefeat, something that I saw a long time ago.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is a very good question. Who are these people and \nwhat makes them tick? Why would people who could leave by just not \nreenlisting keep going back to Iraq and Afghanistan? My view of our \nforces is that they see the face of the enemy, they believe they have a \nstrategy that is working, and they don't want their kids to go back. So \nwhen you use the troops as a reason to shortcut this war, I don't think \nyou are really listening to what they say and what they do. If they \nwere exhausted and hopeless, they would change careers.\n  I have never seen Afghanistan change as much as I have in the last \nyear, and my fear is that the successes we have achieved are going to \nbe compromised for no good reason. Both of us believe that you could, \nat the end of 2012, if you do this right, remove all of the surge \nforces. But what we have been trying to argue to the President and \nanyone else who will listen is that this fighting season and the next \nfighting season are the best chance we will have in our lifetime to \nbring about permanent, sustainable change. And I think General Petraeus \nhas been trying to tell the country and the President: Give General \nAllen the ability to take the fight to the east like we did to the \nsouth.\n  From the troops' point of view, the reason they go to Afghanistan and \nIraq over and over is they understand this enemy better than you and I. \nThey see what the enemy is capable of doing. They saw it in Anbar, \nwhere children were killed in front of their parents by al-Qaida. They \nsee what happens when the Taliban hangs a 9-year-old boy because they \nbelieve he is providing information to the coalition forces.\n  I think our troops understand the danger America faces, to the point \nthat they are willing to leave their families time and time again to \nprotect all of us back here at home.\n  If you do not believe Afghanistan matters, then I think you are going \nto be in for a rude awakening. If it goes bad in Afghanistan, if the \nTaliban can survive and wait us out and they begin to reemerge, a lot \nof people who helped us, I say to Senator McCain, are going to get \nkilled. And when America goes off to some future conflict to help the \noppressed, we are going to be seen as an unreliable ally and our \nenemies are going to be stronger.\n  One final thought. This is a consequential week. The negotiations \ndealing with our national debt have broken down. My colleagues in the \nHouse, whom I respect, are about to vote to cut off funding, which will \nsend a signal to Muammar Qadafi that I think is unhealthy. At the end \nof the day, the decisions we make here in Congress are going to affect \nour Nation long after you and I leave this body. Qadafi is on the \nropes. NATO has limited capacity, but if the American Congress tells \nQadafi we are out of the fight, I am afraid that is going to give him a \nsense of hope he does not have today.\n  What does it matter if he stays? I think logically you can expect, if \nhe outlasts NATO, the Arab spring is over. We can't go into Syria, but \nhe will take it out on his people. I think it will affect the price of \noil. That will be the end of NATO, because with NATO taking on Qadafi \nand losing, it is going to be very hard for that organization to go off \nto another war and be taken seriously.\n  I hope we can survive this week, that cooler heads will prevail. I am \ngoing to tell Mike Mullen, when you come to get confirmed for this job, \nplease let us know if you are having to make hard decisions because of \na lack of resources. Give the President that information and let \nCongress know so we can adjust the strategy. I hope the President is \nright and that we are both wrong. But General Keene and General \nPetreaus have come up with a strategy that I think, given time and \npatience, will work. This new strategy is something that is untested, \nthat is unnecessarily risky.\n  The way to keep America safe, Ronald Reagan said, the way to prevent \na war--he said: When people who love freedom are strong, not weak, that \nis the best way to prevent war.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I say in summary--and I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for his forbearance--I agree with the Senator from South \nCarolina, obviously. I say to my friends on the other side of the \nCapitol, although it may fall on deaf ears at this moment, I hope they \nknow that we understand their frustration about the President's failure \nto recognize the War Powers Act exists, and the failure of the \nadministration to consult and brief Members of Congress on the \nsituation in Libya, about many aspects of the way this conflict has \nbeen conducted where America is ``leading from behind.''\n  But I want to repeat what the Senator from South Carolina said: This \ncould mean the end of NATO. If NATO cannot defeat a third-rate military \npower, then NATO is probably going to go out of business. If we do not \nsucceed in Libya and oust Qadafi, as is the President's policy, you \nwill see a center for terrorist activities, you will see a return of \nal-Qaida to Libya--certainly a dramatically increased influence. And, \nfrankly, it will send a message to the world that even though we say \nabout a dictator and a brutal killer and murderer such as Qadafi that \nit is our policy that he be removed from power, we are either unwilling \nor unable to do so.\n  I again caution my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I hope \nthey would not do anything that would enhance the ability of this \nbrutal dictator to remain in power and continue to perpetrate the \nmurders and crimes for which he is so well known.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                            Gasoline Prices\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to follow that very \narticulate colloquy between my colleagues from Arizona and South \nCarolina and certainly draw inspiration from what they have outlined in \nthat colloquy, the consequences internationally and at home in this \nvery important week. I rise to call attention to developments in an \narea that is among those consequences--the price of gasoline, the \nsupply of fuel internationally and at home.\n  I rise to commend the President of the United States for releasing \ntoday some 30 million barrels of oil over the next 30 days, which \nalready has brought down the price of oil by about $5 per barrel on the \nNew York Mercantile Exchange. This consequence certainly cannot be the \nend of the campaign that we must continue to wage. I commend the \nPresident for heeding the calls from myself and my colleagues to \naddress the pain felt across Connecticut and the country as prices \nremain too high, at close to $4 a gallon. The drop we have seen today \nshould be followed by additional reductions. That can happen only if \nthe administration and this body continue to campaign to achieve those \nlower prices.\n  This development follows the decision by the Federal Trade Commission \nto conduct an investigation, again heeding calls from me and my \ncolleagues, that a searching, penetrating, comprehensive investigation \nis necessary to forestall and prevent manipulation and speculation on \nthe markets. We have seen over these months that supply and demand is \nnot the cause of increases in the price of oil internationally or here \nat home. It is directly and substantially a consequence of speculation \nby traders and the hedge funds, as well as potentially illegal \nmanipulation.\n  The FTC investigation is in response to those calls we have made, \nbased on what we have seen in those markets. Clearly the FTC is \nreacting, for example, to the fact that U.S. refiners' margins have \nincreased more than 90 percent since the beginning of 2011. Over that \nsame period of time the amount of capacity has been reduced by 7 \npercent. It is 81.7 percent over this same period of time, a 7-percent \nreduction from the same period in 2010. Those indicia of potential \nforces in the market that\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\nhave nothing to do with supply and demand are certainly more than \nsufficient basis for the FTC investigation. Combined with the release \nof product from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they have helped to \nbring down prices.\n  But the campaign must continue. We must deter speculation and illegal \nmanipulation. We must send a message to those speculators and \nmanipulators who are on the wrong side of these markets, who are on the \nwrong side of history: You will lose and you will lose big time This \nkind of message is what is necessary to protect Connecticut and \nnational consumers. We have seen in Connecticut that the price is still \nabove $4 on average in many places.\n  This issue is not just one that affects consumers, it is an economic \nissue with broad and far-reaching ramifications. It affects small \nbusiness people who have to drive their cars to get to work, to deliver \nproduct, to arrive at places where they are working and spending time. \nIt has ripple effects throughout our economy. It is crushing to \nfamilies and small businesses.\n  The rise in prices in this country for fuel and gasoline has been \ncrushing families and small businesses. It had ramifications throughout \nthe economy that these two steps, release of product through the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve and the FTC investigation, will help to \ncounter.\n  More is necessary--stronger enforcement and regulatory steps to stop \nand prevent abusive speculation and manipulation. I will be announcing \na number of proposals for my part that I hope will be followed in the \nnext days and weeks.\n  These two steps are important, but they must be followed by others, \nthey must be the beginning, not the end, of a comprehensive strategy to \nbring down the price of fuel--not just gasoline but soon heating oil--\nfor Connecticut families as well as consumers across the country. This \npattern must continue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 510\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 510.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes, if I \ncould, just to speak on----\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from Delaware yield?\n  Mr. CARPER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are trying to arrive at an end to this \nlegislation. We are not there yet. We hope there will be no more votes \ntoday. We feel positive there will not be, but we are not ready to make \nthat decision right now. We should within the next hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to begin my remarks this \nafternoon by congratulating several of our colleagues who have worked \nlong and hard on this legislation, and their staffs who have worked \nequally long and hard: Senator Schumer and Senator Alexander; I see \nSenator Collins is on the floor; Senator Lieberman; our leaders, \nDemocrat and Republican leaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell.\n  Anyone watching this debate from across America on C-SPAN might be \nwondering why is this important? Why are they doing this? Why are we \nspending several days, literally, in session in the Senate to focus on \na nominations bill? Why? For those folks who might be wondering why, \nlet me just offer these thoughts.\n  This administration has been in office for roughly 2\\1/2\\ years now. \nIf we look throughout the Federal Government, the executive branch of \nthe government, most of the positions that require Presidential \nnominations and Senate confirmation have now been filled. But a number, \nincluding a number that are in highly important, highly critical \npositions, have not been. Until fairly recently this administration \nlooked like what I describe as ``executive branch Swiss cheese.''\n  People sometimes wonder why the Federal Government in Washington does \nnot work better and maybe why does it not work as well as our States. I \nwant to take a moment, if I can, to compare the approach we used in \nDelaware. I know Senator Alexander is a former Governor. It is probably \nthe approach they use in Tennessee, to fill key leadership positions in \nthe executive branch of those State governments.\n  In my State, for example, the Governor nominates people to serve as \ncabinet secretaries in a dozen or so different departments. Those \nnominations have to be confirmed before the senate. They hold hearings \nand generally report those nominations favorably. In fact, in my 8 \nyears as Governor, we never had the senate fail to report and to vote \nfor one of our nominees for an executive branch department--for \nexample, secretary of transportation, secretary of education, those \nkinds of appointments. Within those various departments of State \ngovernment, the division directors are appointed by the Governor \nwithout confirmation by the senate. The rest of our line departments \nwithin State government in Delaware are not appointed by the Governor; \nthey are literally chosen through the merit system and report up the \nchain of command through the director of the division to the secretary \nof the department. That is the way it works.\n  I remember when I was about to be sworn in as Governor. I met with \nthe senate--it was a Democrat majority at the time--and they were \ninterested in knowing who I was going to nominate to different \npositions. I explained who we had in mind. They said: We do not know \nsome of those people. Some of them are from other States. We are not \nsure that we ought to be confirming them.\n  I asked them: Look, why don't we make a deal. Give me the team I feel \nthat as Governor I am entitled to have, make sure they are honorable \npeople, smart people, that sort of thing. But at the end of the day, \nlet me have my team and go forward and try to govern in partnership \nwith the legislative branch, and judge us in the end on how we perform.\n  To their credit, that is what the State senate decided to do. That is \nthe way we operated for 8 years. They were 9 very good years. I was \nfortunate to be Governor at the same time that Bill Clinton was \nPresident, and we managed\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\nto balance our budget for 8 years in a row. We actually cut taxes 7 \nyears in a row. We got ourselves a AAA credit rating for the first time \nin State history and still have it. That is the way we operated.\n  It does not look that way or operate that way here, and there are a \nnumber of reasons this administration, the last administration, and I \nsuspect the one before that, a year or 2 years even into those \nadministrations, the executive branch--if we look through the senior \nranks of the leadership of the various departments--looked too much \nlike executive branch Swiss cheese.\n  Senator Alexander and Senator Schumer, to their credit, are trying to \nchange that. I commend them for their efforts. I think it is enormously \nimportant.\n  If you are trying to be the President and lead this country, you need \nyour team. It is important that they be capable people, honorable \npeople. But at the end of the day, a President of either party needs a \ngood team, a strong team, filled sooner rather than later.\n  There are a number of reasons it is so difficult to get many of these \nvacancies filled. One of them is a reluctance on the part of some \npeople to go through the process, the confirmation process. It takes \nforever in some cases. These nominees are asked to bare, not their \nsouls but largely bare their lives to go through a process where they \ncan be maybe not crucified but certainly exposed to anything they have \never done wrong in their lives. None of us is perfect.\n  I think that in itself deters people from wanting to go through this \nprocess. I was once nominated when I was Governor to serve on the \nAmtrak board by President Clinton. I remember how long it took just to \nfill out the paperwork--one set of paperwork for the executive branch, \na totally different set of paperwork for the legislative branch.\n  I remember saying to my wife, after spending a weekend just to fill \nout the paperwork: I am not sure it is really worth doing all of this. \nI am really not sure it is worth it. I am sure for other folks who go \nthrough this process they probably reach the same conclusion at least \nonce during the time they go through the paperwork.\n  We need to have not separate questionnaires, we need to synchronize, \nhomogenize at least the paperwork, and hopefully put it in an \nelectronic form so we can do it electronically--those nominees can do \nit electronically one time and be done with it and send it off to the \nright folks to look at.\n  One of the reasons we go slowly is--I will share with you--I was \nriding in Afghanistan or Pakistan, one of those countries a couple of \nmonths ago, riding around with a codel on a bus going from place to \nplace. One of the folks on the bus said they were looking for somebody \nto put a hold on a nomination in order to get some leverage on \nsomething that Senator was trying to get from the administration--that \nis with a Democratic President and a Republican Senator. But I want to \ntell you, that conversation could have happened 4 years ago with a \nDemocratic Senator and a Republican President. A lot of folks have used \nfor years the ability to put a hold, to stop a nomination from moving \nforward, in order to gain some kind of political advantage, which has \nnothing to do maybe with the nominee or the nominee's ability to serve.\n  The other point I want to make--I shared this with some of our \ncolleagues in our caucus, the Senate Democratic caucus, the other day. \nI talked to my colleagues about the work of the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO. Every year they publish, as most of us \nknow, something called a High Risk List. And a high risk is just a \nwhole lot of initiatives or problems that exist throughout the Federal \nGovernment that either are costing us a lot of money or are going to \ncost us a lot of money unless we do something different.\n  One of the top items on the GAO's High Risk List for years now has \nbeen major weapons systems cost overruns. In 2000, GAO determined that \nmajor weapons systems cost overruns--Department of Defense--was $42 \nbillion. That is a lot of money.\n\n  They update that list every year. They updated it for 2010 not long \nago, and they concluded that major weapons systems cost overruns in \n2010 had gone from $42 billion--10 years ago--to $402 billion in 2010.\n  I chair a subcommittee called Federal Financial Management, part of \nHomeland Security Government Affairs. We have held a number of hearings \nin recent years to try to figure out how we can get better results for \nless money--how we get better results for taxpayers for less money or \nbetter results for maybe not much more money.\n  As we drilled down on major weapons systems cost overruns, here is \none of the things we found out. Through testimony offered by a fellow \nfrom--one of the top three people in acquisition in the Department of \nDefense, a fellow named Jim Finley, who reported to John Young, the top \nacquisition guy in the last administration, who reported to Bob Gates, \nthe Secretary.\n  We brought in Jim Finley for testimony on major weapons systems cost \noverruns. Again, this is Secretary Gates, John Young, top acquisition \nguy at the Pentagon, and then Jim Finley. We asked Mr. Finley--I asked \nhim a question: How long have you been in your job?\n  He told me how many months he had served in his job.\n  I asked him what kind of turnover he got from his predecessor.\n  He said: My predecessor left 18 months before I was confirmed for \nthis position.\n  So I said: You mean, for like 18 months, there was no confirmed \nperson in your position for acquisition to oversee the major weapons \nsystems?\n  I said: How many direct reports did you have once you got into your \njob--how many folks were directly reporting to you?\n  He said: There are six direct reports to me in that job but only two \nof them were filled.\n  Just think about that. Here we are, the Department of Defense, \nhundreds of billions of dollars of weapons systems to oversee in \nacquisitions, and arguably the No. 2 person in acquisitions in the \nDepartment of Defense, that position was vacant for 18 months--18 \nmonths.\n  When he finally got confirmed, of the six direct reports, only two \nwere filled. No wonder we have these huge weapons systems cost \noverruns--and it is not just an isolated incident. We brought in Jim \nFinley's counterpart today in this administration, a fellow named Frank \nKendall. Good man. He testified earlier this year. Again, it is Bob \nGates, the Secretary. Now it is Ashton Carter who is the top \nacquisition person in DOD. Then we have Frank Kendall.\n  I said to Mr. Kendall: How long have you been in the job?\n  He told me how many months.\n  I said: What kind of turnover did you get from your predecessor?\n  He said: My predecessor left 15 months before I got here.\n  My friends, I do not know how good we all are at connecting the dots, \nbut when we have one of the top two people at the Department of Defense \nresponsible for riding herd on the defense industry, all our \ncontractors, and these contracts are for very expensive weapons \nsystems--when we have a vacancy for 18 months in one administration, \nthe next administration, pretty much like a vacancy for 15 months--that \nis no good. That is an invitation for disaster.\n  When we see the major weapons systems cost overruns go from $42 \nbillion in 2000 to $400 billion 10 years later, I would suggest one of \nthe reasons is because of this confirmation process, the vetting \nprocess. Really, the biggest problem of all is the administration. The \nadministration takes forever to identify people to go in these \npositions, to vet these positions and actually give us a name.\n  There are no silver bullets in terms of solving this problem. We need \na lot of silver BBs. One of the good things about the legislation \nbefore us is it provides a number of very helpful tools to expedite the \nconsideration of nominees, to better ensure that the next \nadministration, or even this administration a year or two from now if \nthe President is reelected, that we do not end up with more and more \nexecutive branch Swiss cheese, which really translates to the taxpayers \nan enormous cost, costs we cannot afford with the budget deficit of \nover $1 trillion.\n  The last thing I want to say, if I may, I know people are offering \namendments. I am going to call up an amendment to this bill in just a \nmoment. It\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\nis an amendment that involves again our friends at GAO, the Government \nAccountability Office. Our amendment is pretty straightforward. It \nwould require GAO to investigate and conduct a survey on the number of \nPresidentially appointed positions that are not Senate confirmed in \neach agency, a category of jobs that also routinely go unfilled for \nextended periods of time.\n  The study would provide recommendations as to whether eliminating or \nconverting certain appointees to career positions would be more \nefficient. In addition, the survey should evaluate whether it is \nbeneficial to reduce and convert specialized categories of appointees, \nsuch as inspector generals, chief financial officers, or acquisition \nofficers to career status, not as politically appointed.\n  The purpose of the amendment is that the proposal, we believe, would \nprovide an analysis of what is an efficient amount of Presidentially \nappointed positions governmentwide. It also would provide \nrecommendations on how to further reduce or convert these positions.\n  As far as I can tell, it is not a controversial proposal. GAO does a \nlot of good work for us to help figure out how to operate more \nefficiently, also to use some common sense. My hope is that my \ncolleagues will see fit to support it.\n  That having been said, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment \nNo. 517, which I filed earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 517.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that the Government Accountability Office shall \n    conduct a study and submit a report on presidentially appointed \n                positions to Congress and the President)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. REPORT ON PRESIDENTIALLY APPOINTED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``agency'' means an Executive agency defined \n     under section 105 of title 5, United States Code; and\n       (2) the term ``covered position'' means a position in an \n     agency that requires appointment by the President without the \n     advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (b) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Government Accountability Office \n     shall conduct a study and submit a report on covered \n     positions to Congress and the President.\n       (c) Contents.--The report submitted under this section \n     shall include--\n       (1) a determination of the number of covered positions in \n     each agency;\n       (2) an evaluation of whether maintaining the total number \n     of covered positions is necessary;\n       (3) an evaluation of the benefits and disadvantages of--\n       (A) eliminating certain covered positions;\n       (B) converting certain covered positions to career \n     positions or positions in the Senior Executive Service that \n     are not career reserved positions; and\n       (C) converting any categories of covered positions to \n     career positions;\n       (4) the identification of--\n       (A) covered positions described under paragraph (3)(A) and \n     (B); and\n       (B) categories of covered positions described under \n     paragraph (3)(C); and\n       (5) any other recommendations relating to covered \n     positions.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           U.S. Credit Score\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, most Americans have a credit score. We \ndon't know much about it until we start to borrow money. Then you find \nout what your score is, and that will determine whether you are going \nto get a loan and, if you get one, how much interest you will pay for \nit.\n  Several years ago, I got a phone call from a bill collection agency \nto my home in Springfield, saying: Durbin, we finally caught up with \nyou; I don't know how you thought you could get away from us, but the \ncharges that you have run up here at Home Depot in Denver, CO, haven't \nbeen paid for months. I said I had never been to the Home Depot in \nDenver, CO.\n  Well, I was a victim of identity theft. Somebody got enough \ninformation about me to apply for an account there and run up some \ncharges. They said: Prove it. So I sent them some information and they \ncame back and said: We are satisfied you weren't the person who ran up \nthe charges, and you better check with your credit agencies to see what \nyour credit score is now because everybody has been reporting this \ndefault on payment on the Home Depot in Denver, CO. I checked and, sure \nenough, my credit scores, which I never pay any attention to because I \ndon't borrow a lot of money, were terrible. I went through about 3 \nmonths of reconstructing what happened and clearing my record, and at \nthe end they said everything is fine. It can be done.\n  Why do I bring up this example? The credit score of the United States \nis now in question. On August 2, the Secretary of the Treasury tells us \nthat if we don't extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we are \ngoing to be in a terrible financial situation.\n  What is the debt ceiling? The debt ceiling is America's mortgage--the \namount of money we borrow as a government, as a nation, to sustain \nourselves. We borrow a lot of money--40 cents for every $1 we spend, \nwhether it is on a missile or a food stamp. The creditors--our \ncreditors around the world--of course, get paid interest for loaning us \nmoney to cover our debt. The level of interest they are paid reflects \ntheir confidence that we will ultimately make payments and be good for \nthe debt.\n  Right now, you can pick up the newspaper and read what is going on in \nGreece. The Popoulias government barely survived this week because they \nhave had to initiate austerity measures, cutbacks in spending that \naren't politically popular. If they didn't, they were going to watch \nthe Greek credit rating fall further and the cost of borrowing money go \nup even higher.\n  So when the time comes on August 2, our deadline on our basic debt \nceiling, our creditors around the world will look and see what happens. \nWhat happens, without fail, in the history of the United States, is we \ndo the right thing and extend the debt ceiling. They say: Fine, so the \nfull faith and credit of the United States can be relied on \nconfidently. They can say they made another payment as they said they \nwould, and we can go forward with our business.\n  Now there is a hue and cry, primarily from the other party, that we \nshould not pay any attention to this debt ceiling. We should ignore it. \nMany of them have made arguments which, frankly, are stunning.\n  Just to give you a couple of examples, a colleague from the State of \nPennsylvania, Senator Pat Toomey, said today that ``failure to raise \nthe debt limit upon the deadline submitted by the Treasury Secretary \ndoes not equate to a default on our debt at all.''\n  I will remind him what Ronald Reagan said:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of default--by the United States are impossible to \n     predict and awesome to contemplate. . . . The Nation can ill \n     afford to allow such a result.\n\n  Senator DeMint of South Carolina, a Republican, said:\n\n       Republicans must do everything they can to block an \n     increase in the debt limit.\n\n  Here is what the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, said:\n\n       Failing to raise the debt ceiling in a timely way will be \n     self-defeating if the objective is to chart a course for the \n     better fiscal situation for our Nation.\n\n  Congressman Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Republican Budget \nCommittee, said that holders of U.S. Government debt would be willing \nto miss payments ``for a day or two or three or four.''\n  Tim Geithner, the Treasury Secretary, said this:\n\n       Even a very short-term or limited default would have \n     catastrophic economic consequences that would last for \n     decades.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not sure you follow the stock market, but if you \ndid, today you know it is off. It is off because news about employment \nis not encouraging. Too many Americans are out of work. So there is a \nquestion mark about this economy and where it is headed. We are doing \nour best to turn it around, and I think we have done some good, but we \nneed to do more. We can talk more about that.\n  If we, for some reason, do not extend the debt limit of the United \nStates, the credit rating of the United States\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\nwould go down in the eyes of people who loan us money. What would \nhappen next? As predictable as I stand here, interest rates would go \nup. People loaning money to the United States would say: If they are \nnot going to extend the debt ceiling when they are supposed to, then we \nwant to cover our bets and have a higher interest rate. What happens \nwhen the interest rate paid by the United States of America on its debt \ngoes up? All interest rates go up. Interest rates would go up on people \nbuying homes and cars and on businesses that want to expand or buy more \ninventory.\n  Can you think of a worse thing at this moment in our economic \nhistory? Where the Federal Reserve has announced this week that they \nare going to try to keep interest rates down so we can get out of this \nrecession, Congress, if it fails to meet its responsibility on the debt \nceiling, would end up raising interest rates--exactly the opposite of \nwhat the Federal Reserve says we need to get the economy back on its \nfeet and get America back to work.\n  This is the introduction to a point I wish to make that has a lot to \ndo with a speech made on the floor today. Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, came to the floor this morning to explain he has \ndecided the Republicans will walk away from the budget negotiations \nwith Vice President Biden. Congressman Cantor, a leader in the House of \nRepresentatives, and today Senator Kyl, one of our leaders in the \nSenate, have said that after weeks of sitting in the room with the Vice \nPresident trying to work out some kind of agreement on the budget \ndeficit, they were walking out, and they did. The two Republican \nleaders in the room walked away from it.\n  Senator McConnell said this this morning in explaining it:\n\n       We're not in the majority. We can't sign anything into law. \n     That's the President's job. That's his job. He has acted as \n     if it is not his problem. This is his problem to solve.\n\n  As if that wasn't bad enough, the House majority leader announced \nsoon after that he will no longer participate in the bipartisan \nnegotiations.\n  Congressman Cantor said:\n\n       It is up to the President to come in and talk to the \n     Speaker. We've reached the end of this phase.\n\n  How does this break down? How does the Republican walkout on budget \nnegotiations and the extension of the debt ceiling come together? We \ncan't extend the debt ceiling without the support of the House \nRepublican majority and without the support of Republicans in the \nSenate. They have said they will not vote for it unless we have an \nagreement on the budget.\n  Well, the clock is ticking. At this point, we know August 2 is \nlooming, and we know if we fail to extend the debt ceiling, it will be \nthe worst thing we can do for the American economy at this moment in \ntime. If there were ever a time when both political parties ought to \nstop making some of these speeches and come together and work it out, \nthis is it. What it means is that both sides--our side, the Democrats, \nand their side, the Republicans--have to come together and put \neverything on the table. It means that some of the things we hold \ndearest, such as Medicare and Social Security and entitlement programs, \nwe need to talk about their future in honest terms. It means that the \nRepublican side has to come forward and accept the reality that we will \nneed some new revenue to deal with our budget deficit situation. That \nis the reality.\n\n  I only know this a little better than some because I spent the last \nyear and a half working on it--on the President's deficit commission \nand with a group of four or five other Senators from both parties \ntrying to come up with some kind of agreement. That is where we are \ntoday.\n  This breakdown of the discussions on the Biden budget negotiations, \nbecause of the walkout of Congressman Cantor and Senator Kyl, is not \npromising. Next week, the Senate will be back in session, the House \nwill not. It is one of their recess weeks. The following week, after \nthe Fourth of July, we are out of session, and the House is back in. So \nfor 2 weeks now, we are not going to have both Houses in Washington. \nThat will make it more difficult to reach an agreement, but we have to \ndo it.\n  As bad as things are with this economy, if we send a signal that we \nare unable to responsibly lead on a bipartisan basis, I am afraid we \nare going to have very negative consequences. I implore the Republican \nleaders to reconsider their position. Walking away from their \ncongressional responsibility to negotiate for a good budget agreement \nand to extend the debt ceiling is the height of economic \nirresponsibility. It would create a disaster that would touch innocent \npeople across the United States and around the world. What we need to \ndo--and it is so hard in this town--is to try to put this partisanship \naside. At one point early in the session, the Republican leader said \nthe most important thing we can achieve during the course of this \nsession--I will quote him:\n\n       The single most important thing we want to achieve is for \n     President Obama to be a one-term President.\n\n  That was a quote Senator McConnell made several months ago. We are \nall partisan to some extent, but that isn't the most important thing \nSenator McConnell or Senator Durbin can achieve. The most important \nthing to do is to deal with our debt responsibly and get the economy \nmoving forward in a bipartisan way. Running up filibusters on bill \nafter bill on the floor of the Senate may give somebody a quick \ntemporary victory, but it doesn't solve the problems we face. We need \nto work together to create jobs and pass legislation, get a budget \nagreement together, and extend the debt ceiling.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider \nthis walkout from the budget negotiation. We need to work in good faith \nto solve the problems of this country. After all, that is why we were \nelected.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all first-\ndegree amendments to S. 679, with the exception of the managers' \namendment, must be offered prior to the close of business today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there will be no further rollcall votes \ntoday. The next vote will be Tuesday before the caucus. There will be \nno votes on Monday or tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending Coburn amendment No. 500 be \nwithdrawn; that when the Senate considers S. Res. 116, it be in order \nfor Senator Coburn to offer his duplication amendment to the \nresolution; that there be up to 1 hour of debate on the amendment, \nequally divided between Senator Coburn and the majority leader or their \ndesignees; that the amendment be subject to a two-thirds threshold; \nthat the amendment not be divisible; that no amendments, motions or \npoints of order be in order prior to any vote in relation to the Coburn \namendment other than budget points of order and the applicable motions \nto waive; and that all other provisions of the previous order with \nrespect to the resolution remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, this is very much out of character, what \nI am getting ready to do, but this morning I was in a Foreign Relations \nhearing on Afghanistan and Pakistan and my staff tells me the majority \nleader came down and happened to castigate me for speaking about the \nfact we had not taken up some of the Nation's most important business \nthis year; that we have spent a lot of time on bills that\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\nwere not as important as our Nation's debt crisis and other kinds of \nthings.\n  I can't imagine there is anybody in this body who feels, as a \nSenator, and it being June 23, that we have taken up very serious \nbusiness this year. I can't imagine there is anybody who is proud of \nwhat we have been able to accomplish this year as it relates to \naddressing our country's most pressing problems. And that was the point \nof the speech I made yesterday on the floor which, I might add, a \nnumber of Democrats have since come up to me and said they could not \nagree with me more.\n  The point is we need to deal with our Nation's No. 1 crisis today, \nwhich is spending. I talked a little bit about what is happening with \nthe Blair House negotiations and the fact that, basically, the goal the \nBlair House negotiators have attempted to achieve--their aspirational \ngoal--probably is not strong enough for most people on either side of \nthe aisle to support, and so we need to be far more serious about our \ncountry's spending problems.\n  However, I know we are not busy, and when we are not busy, sometimes \nwe say things we don't mean and we get ourselves in trouble. It is my \nunderstanding, again, that the majority leader came to the floor and \nfound a quote I had made 2 years ago about EDA to try to, if you will, \ncastigate me for the comments I made yesterday, which he said were out \nof line.\n  I know we haven't taken up a budget in 785 days in the Senate. We \nhave not taken up a budget. Two years ago a budget was passed out of \ncommittee, but there was an unwillingness to take up that budget on the \nfloor. This year, the Budget Committee didn't even pass a budget out of \ncommittee. So here we have a country that is spending $1.5 trillion a \nyear that we don't have--and borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we \nspend--but here in the Senate we are basically hoping others will solve \nthis problem for us. Candidly, I hope that happens. I do hope we come \nto a conclusion sometime soon.\n  I understand how the majority leader would be defensive. He is the \nmajority leader of the Senate--the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld, some say--and we haven't even taken up a budget to account for \nthe $3.7 trillion we spend of our country's money each year. So I know \nhe is embarrassed; I know he is defensive; and I understand that. But I \nwould say that my words--the essence of what I said yesterday--still \nstand. This body has not done the serious work the Senate should do. We \nhave a looming crisis coming before us, with a debt ceiling vote coming \nup on August 2 and, to my knowledge, there has been no public debate \nabout solutions toward that.\n  The Presiding Officer and myself have offered a bill called the CAP \nAct to try to deal with that. It is the only bipartisan, bicameral act \nthat has been introduced in both bodies. It certainly is not the total \nsolution to our problem, but that, coupled with other fixes--some \nMedicare fixes, coupled with a 302(a) top line for a couple of years--\nto me is the essence of something that might solve our country's \nproblems.\n  I have tried to offer some constructive solutions to our problem. I \nknow the Presiding Officer has tried to offer some constructive \nsolutions. To me, those are the kinds of things we here in the Senate \nshould be dealing with today. The markets, rightfully so--and very \nsoon, as they should--will become very volatile. It is my opinion we \nare close to a potential trainwreck. I know people have pulled away \nfrom the Blair House negotiations, and my sense is the two sides are \nvery much in disarray at this point. There have been numbers of public \ncomments that have been put forth. Again, I come back to the Senate, \nwhere we have gone 785 days without even taking up a budget.\n  So again, I know the majority leader is defensive and embarrassed, \nand I understand why he would be, but I stand by my comments yesterday.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Whitehouse pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1271 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 493\n\n  Mr. KIRK. On behalf of Senator McCain, I call up amendment No. 493.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Kirk], for Mr. McCain, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 493.\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To preserve congressional oversight into the budget overruns \n              of the Office of Navajo and Hopi Relocation)\n\n       Strike section 2(w).\n\n  Mr. KIRK. I ask to be recognized for 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, under General Petraeus, the deployment of \na local army is critical to winning a war. In Iraq he used extra U.S. \ntroops to sustain military momentum against an enemy until a well-\ntrained local Army was trained and ready for action. Petraeus had the \ntime he needed to stand up a 500,000-man local Army and then won the \nwar. This has also been his model for Afghanistan. While Iraq and \nAfghanistan differ, the military challenge was the same: to train and \ndeploy a local army that could sustain a fight until victory.\n  Starting with nothing, the United States and our NATO allies set a \ngoal of building an Afghan Army and police force to eventually number \n400,000. By reaching this goal, the combat mission of the U.S. and \nother NATO forces would disappear. We would remain helpful with \nsupplies, repair and intelligence, but not frontline combat.\n  I agreed with President Obama's decision to surge to Afghanistan, and \nI was in the audience to show my support when he delivered a historic \naddress at West Point. By following the recommendations of General \nPetraeus, Secretary Gates and others, President Obama gave the United \nStates and our NATO allies the time needed to vastly expand the Afghan \npolice and army.\n  Unfortunately, the President has changed course from establishing a \nsufficient Afghan security force before scaling down our military \npresence. To date, the Afghan police and army are short of their \n400,000-man goal. As of April, there were 284,000 in both services, \nwell over 100,000 people short.\n  Overall, the Afghan Army loses 32 percent of its personnel a year, \nwhile its police lose 23 percent. To expand the security forces, losses \nmust be held to 24 percent annually. Therefore, according to our \nNational Military Training Mission in Afghanistan, the commander of \nthat training effort, General Caldwell, must train 23 Afghans for every \n10 to be deployed. We find key shortfalls in the officer corps and \namong noncommissioned officers. To date, 82 percent of Afghan officer \nbillets are not filled, along with 85 percent of noncommissioned \nsergeants and corporals. The Afghan Army is also short of recruits from \nthe communities where the fighting is most difficult. Only 3 percent of \nthe Afghan Army was born in the southern Pashtun regions where Afghan \nleaders traditionally originate.\n  The Afghan Army is also lacking in literacy. In 2008, only 14 percent \nof Afghan military personnel could read or write. Now, thanks to \nGeneral Caldwell, that number has grown to 85 percent in both the \npolice and Army. One of the critical factors in training an Afghan Army \nthat can win this war is the number of NATO trainers. To date the \ntraining command lacks over 700 trainers due to personnel shortfalls \namong our NATO allies. Each of these facts paints a clear picture of a \nwork in progress but one that is about to be strained by the \nPresident's decision to leave Afghanistan 2 years too early. Under the \noriginal Petraeus plan, the United States and NATO would have deployed \nan Afghan police and military\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nnumbering 400,000 by 2014. Having trained together for 1 year or more, \nthese Afghan units would likely endure the stress of combat and deliver \nvictory in 2015 or 2016.\n\n  Unfortunately, the President has rejected his general's \nrecommendations and decided to leave early--withdrawing one U.S. \nbrigade combat team right away. Our NATO allies express quiet concern \nabout this departure. U.S. and local commanders will have about 12 \npercent of their combat power taken off the battlefield right away. The \nPresident will then remove two more brigade combat teams by the \nelection day in 2012, leaving U.S. and local commanders with only 66 \npercent of the current combat power.\n  These actions will severely strain the Afghan police and Army, just \nas Afghanistan prepares for a new Presidential election. It also \nprovides some hope for the Taliban, whose strategy may be a 12-month \nrest and refit of their operations to then reenter the battlefield \nagainst a much weaker enemy in 2013.\n  We learned a painful lesson when we ignored Afghanistan in 1992. \nWithout any domestic oil or a coastline, the United States paid no \nattention to the rise of the Taliban and al-Qaida, and we paid an awful \nprice for that policy on September 11, 2001. In my view, the lesson of \nthat day should move us to realize that the Petraeus plan should have \nbeen fully implemented and not ended early.\n  Separately, I would like to take a moment to applaud our Treasury \nDepartment and especially our Acting Under Secretary, David Cohen, for \nmoving decisively today to designate Iran Air and a major Iranian port \noperator, Tidewater, responsible for facilitating Iran's transfer of \nweapons and other proliferation activities.\n  Both of these Treasury designations will significantly restrict \nshipping to and from Iran and will put even more pressure on the \nIranian economy. Under Secretary Cohen has proven himself to be a \nworthy successor to former Under Secretary Levey, and he has my \nconfidence.\n  In the weeks ahead, I urge the administration to move forward with \nour allies in Europe and Asia to implement a comprehensive strategy to \ncollapse the Central Bank of Iran. The Central Bank of Iran facilitates \nthe operations of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and the \nMinistry of Intelligence Services and lies at the center of Iran's \nstrategy to circumvent international sanctions. It is time for the \nUnited States and our allies to decapitate the Central Bank of Iran and \nto place unprecedented stress on the Iranian economy.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Deficit Crisis\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think many Americans understand we are \nat a pivotal moment in American history, and decisions that will be \nmade in the Senate, decisions that will be made in the House, decisions \nthat will be made in the White House regarding the budget and how we \ndeal with the debt ceiling will impact virtually every American--our \nchildren, working families, seniors--virtually every American for \ndecades to come. The stakes are huge. The debate is not just about a \nbudget but the question of which direction America goes forward in.\n  Today, the Republican leaders--Eric Cantor in the House, Jon Kyl in \nthe Senate--withdrew from the bipartisan budget talks that have been \nled by Vice President Biden. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican \nleader in the Senate, and Senator Kyl said:\n\n       The White House and Democrats are insisting on job-killing \n     tax hikes and new spending.\n       President Obama needs to decide between his goal of higher \n     taxes or a bipartisan plan to address our deficit. He can't \n     have both. But we need to hear from him.\n\n  We need to hear from the President.\n  I agree with Senator Kyl and Senator McConnell that we need--the \nAmerican people need, the Senate needs--to hear from President Obama on \nthis enormously important issue. But I believe we need to hear from the \nPresident in a very different way than what Senator Kyl and Senator \nMcConnell and Congressman Cantor want to hear.\n  Here is where we are in America today, and this is what the debate is \nabout: Virtually every American understands that, to a very significant \ndegree, the middle class in this country is disappearing. Median family \nincome has gone down by $2,500 in the last 10 years. Many millions of \nworkers today are earning lower wages than they used to earn. They are \nmoving in the wrong direction.\n  In a recent 25-year period, ending in 2005, 80 percent of all new \nincome did not go to the middle class. It went to the people on top. So \nthe overall dynamic of America now: The middle class is collapsing, \npoverty is increasing, young people are finding it very difficult to \nget decent-paying jobs. While all that is going on, the people on top \nhave never had it so good. Almost all new income is going to the top 1 \npercent.\n  There was an interesting piece in the Washington Post this Sunday \ntalking about the growing gap between the very rich and everybody else. \nWall Street, whose thievery and illegal behavior and recklessness \ncaused this recession, is now making more money for their executives \nthan they did before the recession they helped cause.\n  The top 1 percent is earning more income than the bottom 50 percent. \nThe top 1 percent alone is earning 22 percent of all income in America. \nThe top 400 individuals in this country own more wealth than the bottom \n150 million.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has made the point about the gross \ninequities and unfairness in our tax system, that while the middle \nclass is sinking, the people on top have been able to enjoy effective \ntax rates that are the lowest in recorded history, that janitors, cops, \nnurses--working people today--are paying an effective tax rate that is \nhigher than millionaires and billionaires.\n  That is the reality economically this country faces today, and then \nthat is the reality we have to deal with as we move toward a budget.\n  Every single poll I have seen says what is obvious: that if we are \ngoing to address the deficit crisis, it must be done in a way that is \nfair, that everybody participates in.\n  Our Republican friends have a very unusual idea about how to solve \nthe deficit crisis. Yes, they say the rich are getting richer. Yes, \nthey say corporations are doing phenomenally well. Some are making \nbillions of dollars in profits, not paying a nickel in taxes. Yes, they \nunderstand the gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing \nwider, and their quaint and interesting idea, in the midst of that \ncontext, is that while the rich get richer, they should not be asked to \ncontribute one nickel--not one penny--for deficit reduction.\n  Quite the contrary, under the Republican budget passed in the House, \nthe so-called Ryan budget, while the rich get richer and corporations \nenjoy recordbreaking profits, their budget proposes $1 trillion more in \ntax breaks for the rich and large corporations.\n  Meanwhile, while the middle class disappears and poverty increases, \ntheir idea for deficit reduction is to make savage cuts in programs the \nmiddle class and working families depend upon to survive--to survive.\n\n  Under the Republican budget, they would end Medicare as we know it in \na 10-year period. They propose to give a senior citizen an $8,000 \ncheck, a voucher, and have that senior go out and get an insurance plan \nwith a private insurance company.\n  Tell me what kind of plan a 70-year-old person dealing with cancer or \nanother illness is going to get with an $8,000 voucher? Are they living \nin the real world? Do they know what hospital care costs today? You eat \nup $8,000 in the first day. Yet that is what a senior is supposed to \nlive on for health care for 1 year.\n  But it is not only ending Medicare as we know it in order to give tax \nbreaks to billionaires; it is savage cuts in Medicaid. Half the people \non Medicaid are children. We are the only country today in the \nindustrialized world that does not guarantee health care to all\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\nits people. Fifty million people are uninsured. If you cut Medicaid by \n$700 billion over a 10-year period, tens of millions more, including a \nlot of kids, will have no health insurance. They get sick. Working-\nclass parents, where are they going to get the care? How do they get \nthe care? I guess we have to do that in order to give a tax break to a \nlarge corporation that already is not paying anything in taxes.\n  Let me mention, for a moment, what is a fair way--a fair way--to move \ntoward deficit reduction in a way the American people overwhelmingly \nsupport. You go out and you ask the American people: Do you think it \nmakes sense, in terms of addressing the serious problem with deficit \nreduction, to give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the richest people and \nmake savage cuts in programs that working people need in health care, \neducation, nutrition, environmental protection? The overwhelming \nmajority of the American people say that is nuts; it does not make any \nsense; we must not go in that direction.\n  So when my Republican friends in the leadership say: There is a lot \nof responsibility now on the President, the President has to decide \nwhich direction he wants this country to go, they are right. My hope is \nthe President of the United States listens to the American people and \ndemands that deficit reduction consist of shared sacrifice, that we \nmove toward deficit reduction not just on the backs of the elderly and \nthe children and the sick and the poor but that everybody--I know even \npeople who make large campaign contributions--I know that is heresy to \nsay on the floor of the Senate--but maybe even large corporations that \nbuy and sell politicians, maybe they should be asked to contribute \ntoward deficit reduction. Maybe billionaires, who have more money than \nthey are going to spend in 100 lifetimes, might be asked to pay \nsomewhat more in taxes before we throw children off our health \ninsurance or deny nutrition to low-income seniors.\n  There are many ways to go forward in addressing the deficit crisis \nthat is fair, that does not decimate programs working families depend \non, especially in the middle of a severe recession.\n  Let me mention very few. We should not extend the tax breaks \nPresident Bush gave the wealthiest people in this country. That is it. \nWe have a $1.5 trillion deficit, a $14 trillion-plus national debt. \nSorry, we cannot afford it. These guys have already received huge tax \nbreaks. No more. We cannot afford it.\n  We have to take a hard look at our defense budget. We have to begin \nbringing the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan a lot faster than \nthe President has indicated. The defense budget has tripled since 1997. \nIt has tripled. It is time to make cuts in the defense budget. We can \ndo that while maintaining our strong defense capabilities.\n  There are studies which indicate that large corporations and wealthy \nindividuals are stashing huge amounts of money in tax havens such as \nthe Cayman Islands and Bermuda, and collectively they are avoiding \npaying $100 billion in taxes to the U.S. Treasury. I think that is \nabsurd. We have to end those loopholes. They have to pay their fair \nshare of taxes.\n  I can go on and on in terms of loopholes that exist for corporate \nAmerica which have to be closed, the absurdity of the richest people in \nthis country having an effective, a real tax rate lower than middle-\nclass people.\n  But here is the issue if the Republicans walk away from those \nnegotiations. The President of the United States has to accept that \nchallenge. He has to go out to the American people. He has to rally the \nAmerican people around a deficit reduction program which calls for \nshared sacrifice. That is what the call of the moment is. I hope the \nPresident does that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 512\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Akaka, I call up \namendment No. 512.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for Mr. Akaka, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 512.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To preserve Senate confirmation of the Commissioner of the \n                  Administration for Native Americans)\n\n       On page 48, strike lines 4 through 9.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                            Another Stimulus\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am reading in press reports that some of \nmy colleagues across the aisle are advocating another stimulus package, \nsometimes called government investment, otherwise called spending \ntaxpayers' money that we do not have and borrowing it from our children \nand most immediately from the Chinese, who own $1 trillion of our \nnational debt. It is astonishing to me that after the last stimulus \npackage early in 2009 failed to meet the President's own stated target \nof keeping unemployment to 8 percent or lower, some of our colleagues \nare trying to double down on a bad deal by advocating more stimulus, \nwhen 43 cents out of every dollar that is being spent in America today \nis borrowed money.\n  I mention that the President in his speech on Afghanistan last night \nsaid the Federal Government needs to invest more. Well, I do not think \nanybody should be fooled by what he really means when he says the \nFederal Government must invest. The only money the Federal Government \nhas is the money that comes from your wallet, from taxpayers. When \nthere is not enough money coming in to keep up with the reckless \nspending habits of Washington, DC, then they simply borrow the money or \nprint money we do not have, and that is what ``investment'' means when \nthe President talks about needing to invest more Federal Government \nmoney.\n  On the same day the President spoke, the Congressional Budget Office \nreleased a report that shows the Federal Government spending spree is \nnot sustainable, and the Nation's fiscal position is getting worse. I \ndo not think that is breaking news. I think most Americans could tell \nyou that was the case, at least intuitively already.\n  Over the last 2 years, the Nation's debt has dramatically worsened. \nGross Federal debt is expected to equal 100 percent of our entire \neconomy in just 3 months--well past the 90-percent threshold where many \neconomists believe the debt will seriously undermine economic growth. \nSome studies show that this increased debt, which crowds out private \ninvestment and borrowing, may result in the loss of at least 1 million \njobs a year.\n  But getting back to my initial point about this stimulus notion in \nthe negotiations with Vice President Biden over raising the debt \nceiling, it seems that many have forgotten the trillion-dollar stimulus \npackage passed back in 2009, that the ``green shoots'' predicted never \nmaterialized, that the ``recovery summer'' never happened, and, as I \nsay, it failed to keep unemployment below the targeted rate of 8 \npercent. Indeed, now it hovers nationwide at a rate of 9.1 percent. It \nis much worse in many regions of the country. Only in Washington, DC, \nwould someone advocate a repetition of a program that we know has \nfailed to meet its stated goals and was, I believe, a total flop. First \nof all, it was borrowed money, so it wasn't even spending money that we \nhad, it was exacerbating an already dangerously high debt. The first \nstimulus failed for one reason--because of our massive deficits in jobs \nand our budget.\n  We know the American people believe, as the Gallup organization tells \nus, a large majority of Americans believe that spending too much money \non unneeded and wasteful government programs is to blame for Federal \nbudget deficits. And if you ask any business owner--anyone, really, \noutside of the beltway--the reason why jobs are just not coming back, \nit is in large part because of the uncertainty of what is coming out of \nWashington, not only legislatively but as a regulatory matter, whether \nit is the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Labor--all \nthe alphabet soup of Federal agencies that exist here in Washington, \nDC.\n  Instead of passing another unpaid-for stimulus plan or issuing more \njob-killing regulations, our focus should remain on ways to reduce and \nreform government spending and thereby help get the economy moving \nagain. In fact,\n\n[[Page S4062]]\n\nI think we need to force the Congress and the Federal Government to \nlive within its means by passing a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution and this should be the focus of our efforts here over the \nnext couple of months as we tackle not only this unsustainable debt and \nthese huge annual deficits but as we look for ways to put a \nstraitjacket on the Federal Government to make sure it doesn't keep \nspending money it does not have. No families, no business--as a matter \nof fact, 49 States have balanced budget requirements. Only the Federal \nGovernment and only Congress can continue to spend money we don't have.\n  A balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution would \npermanently change Washington's behavior. So far, 47 Senators in the \nSenate on this side of the aisle have endorsed and cosponsored a \nbalanced budget amendment. We would invite our colleagues across the \naisle to join us in this effort.\n  In summary, we need to unburden the economy from regulatory \nuncertainty or in some cases the certainty that the bureaucracy will \noverreach and make it harder, not easier, to create jobs. We need to \npass free-trade agreements that should be pending before the Senate to \nhelp create more jobs here at home by producing things here that we can \nthen sell abroad. Then we need to develop our domestic energy \nproduction with the great gifts we have been given in this country. I \nknow the Presiding Officer, coming from an energy-producing State--\nAlaska--agrees with me that we need to produce more domestic energy, \nwhich will also have the added benefit of creating jobs right here in \nAmerica rather than continuing the bad habit and the dangerous habit of \nimporting about 60 percent of our energy from abroad, from some \ndangerous parts of the world.\n  I wish to close with a couple of other thoughts.\n  Listening to my colleague from Vermont calling for shared sacrifice \nin meeting some of the deficit reduction plans, I would just suggest to \nthe distinguished Senator that 9.1-percent unemployment reflects a lot \nof sacrifice among a lot of people who can't find jobs in this bad \neconomy. That is shared sacrifice, but that is a sacrifice which I know \nthey and we would prefer they did not have to share. When you don't \nhave a job, it is pretty hard to make your mortgage payments, and when \nyou can't make your mortgage payments or you can't move because your \nmortgage is more expensive than the value of your home--your home is \nunderwater--you are simply stuck. A lot of people are finding \nthemselves defaulting on their mortgages and losing their homes, which \nis usually the largest single investment any of us will make.\n  I want to close on this thought. I want to ask my colleagues across \nthe aisle who have been so critical of the proposals that have been \nmade by the House of Representatives and others, where is your plan? \nWhere is your budget? It has been 2 years since the Congress has passed \na budget, since it has been in control of our Democratic friends. Where \nis your plan to save Medicare, which the Medicare trustees have said \nwill go insolvent--that means there is more money going out than coming \nin--by the year 2024? How do we keep the promise to our most vulnerable \nseniors that Medicare will be there for them if we don't do something \nto shore up this insolvent program?\n  Unfortunately, I believe the President is listening too closely to \nhis political advisers rather than listening to those who are telling \nhim: Mr. President, we have a problem we need to solve. The first place \nhe ought to look for a proposed solution is his own bipartisan fiscal \ncommission that reported back in December in a report, 66 pages long. \nIt is scary but important reading. The title of that is ``The Moment of \nTruth.''\n  We have reached a crossroads in this country where we simply cannot \nkick the can down the road, where we cannot keep spending money we \ndon't have, where we cannot keep relying upon Communist China to buy \nour debt and to bail us out. We simply cannot continue to pass these \nresponsibilities on to our children and grandchildren. We have \nimportant promises to keep to our seniors, to make sure that safety net \nof Medicare and Social Security is going to be there for them, but we \ncan't do it unless we have willing partners join us across the aisle.\n  Right now, the only one in this country who is in a position to make \nthis happen is the President of the United States, but so far the \nPresident has been AWOL on this issue. After his bipartisan fiscal \ncommission issued the report I referred to a moment ago in December of \n2010, in his State of the Union speech, the President barely mentioned, \nif at all, this mounting debt crisis and the problems with the pending \ninsolvency of Medicare and Social Security.\n  The budget that the President proposed was never acted on by the \nmajority leader or the Budget Committee on which I sit. And being in \nthe minority, we can't force this issue; it can only happen if the \nchairman of the Budget Committee marks up a budget and if the majority \nleader, Senator Harry Reid across the aisle, will put it on the floor \nof the Senate where we can debate it and offer amendments. But they \nchose not to do so, relying instead on their political consultants who \nsaid: You know, if you offer a constructive proposal, there may be some \nacross the aisle who will criticize it, and, you know what, you may \njust have to take some hard votes.\n  Well, anybody who has come to the Senate who isn't willing to vote \ntheir convictions, whatever those convictions are, and be held \naccountable by their constituents back home doesn't deserve to be in \nthe Congress. We are here to take hard votes and to make hard decisions \nbecause it is not about us and our political career, and it is not \nabout the next election; it is about addressing these problems we have \nbeen sent here to try to fix the best we can under the circumstances.\n  It is beyond unbelievable when I hear some of our colleagues across \nthe aisle--the senior Senator from New York, among others--talking \nabout another stimulus spending as part of this debt reduction deal.\n  Beyond that, we have the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \nmaking clear that an insistence on tax increases was a central element \nof any deal on raising the debt limit. The Vice President himself was \nquoted as saying, in the Politico publication:\n\n       The piece that is most important to us Democrats--revenue.\n\n  The word ``revenue'' is Washington-speak for tax increases. The \nPresident and Republicans and Democrats got together after the last \nelection and agreed to extend expiring tax provisions because all of us \nagreed, on a bipartisan basis, that the worst thing we could do for a \nfragile, recovering economy was to raise taxes on small businesses, \nwhich are the engine of job creation, and on individuals who would be \nable to then invest that money into starting a business or growing an \nexisting business.\n  There is a reason the private sector is afraid of Washington, DC. \nThey see these mounting debts and deficits, and they realize one of the \nthings we might be tempted to do is raise their taxes. Do you know \nwhat. The business model for their small business may not be able to \nwithstand that tax increase or the regulatory overreach of some Federal \nWashington bureaucrat. So they are scared, and they are sitting on the \nsidelines.\n  The two things we need to do the most are to bring down that spending \ncurve by reducing Federal Government spending and begin to attack that \ndebt and make sure we don't have to keep raising the credit limit on \nthe Nation's credit card but, rather, we can bring it down, and within \nsustainable limits. Second, we need to take our boot off the neck of \nthe private sector, the free enterprise system in America, so it can \ncreate jobs, grow businesses, and pay taxes. We can begin to close the \ngap between what the Federal Government is spending and what it brings \nin in terms of revenue.\n  In 2007, when our Democratic friends took control of the House and \nSenate, President Bush was still President of the United States, and \nour annual deficit was roughly 1.2 percent of our GDP, our entire \neconomy. Today, it is roughly 10 percent. The reason it was 1.2 percent \nis not because we weren't spending a significant amount of money; we \nwere. It was because the economy was booming and revenue to the Federal \nTreasury was at an all-time high. That should tell us that we need to \ndo two things: cut spending,\n\n[[Page S4063]]\n\nnot just raise taxes so Washington can spend some more and throw a wet \nblanket on the economy and the job creators, we need to cut spending \nand fix these entitlement programs so we can keep our promise to our \nseniors who are relying on these programs. We also need to get the \neconomy moving again by growing jobs in the private sector and by \nadopting a national energy policy that says we prefer domestic, or \nAmerican, energy sources rather than those from abroad.\n  Mr. President, we need to do it soon. I am saddened to see that as a \nresult of the insistence on the part of the Vice President and our \nfriends across the aisle that tax increases must be a part of any \npackage of debt reduction; that the majority leader in the House of \nRepresentatives and the assistant minority leader in the Senate, \nSenator Kyl, have reached an impasse and said they don't see any point \nin continuing the negotiations at this point.\n  I hope the Vice President, or indeed the President of the United \nStates himself, who is the only Democrat who can get this deal done, \nwill reconsider their approach and work with Republicans to live within \nour means, reduce spending, and try to get our economy moving again so \nwe can alleviate our children from the debt burden they are inheriting \nfrom us.\n  Every child born in America today will come into this world with \n$46,000, roughly, in debt. That is because of what we have not been \ndoing, which is living within our means. It is time to do that, and we \nneed to work together to solve the problem.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we heard an announcement today that the \nso-called ``Biden talks'' have broken down. It is not something that \nsurprises me terribly. I have always said that I didn't think this was \nthe right approach--to negotiate in secret some of the most important \ndecisions this Nation has to make.\n  In truth, we have never been in a more severe financial condition \nthan we are today. Many remember the government shutdown in the 1990s \nand the fact the Nation ended up, out of that difficult contentious \ntime, balancing the budget in 3 years. Well, I serve on the Budget \nCommittee--the Presiding Officer is an able member of the Budget \nCommittee--and we know it is not going to be easy. It is going to be \nvery difficult to get this country on the right financial course. So I \nthink the decision of the House majority leader and Senator Kyl to \nwithdraw from the negotiations over the debt ceiling underscores the \ninherent problems with this kind of nonpublic meetings, designed to \ncome up with some global, comprehensive settlement of apparently all \nour financial difficulties. It is just not easy.\n  I think it underscores additionally a very important fact: that a \nPresident cannot lead from behind in dealing with the most pressing \ncrisis our Nation faces--our exploding debt and the increasing damage \nthat the debt is doing to the American economy right now. It is taking \ntoo long for a proposal to be presented to the Congress, and it is \nclear now that optimistic statements about progress have been too \ngenerous. It will be unacceptable for the White House talks, or any \ntalks, to produce a controversial agreement at the eleventh hour and to \nthen come before Congress in a panic and say: You have to enact this \nsolution we came up with in secret, or the country will have a serious \ndebt crisis.\n  That is the path we are heading down, just as we did with the CR--the \ncontinuing resolution--that was passed. That is not what the American \npeople want; that is not what they deserve. They want regular order. \nThey want Congress to have the opportunity to debate and vote. If it \ntakes weeks--and it should take weeks for us to work through a \nchallenge as serious as this one--then so be it. It just takes weeks. \nIf it takes hundreds of votes, with people going on record and being \ncriticized back home by one group or another for the vote they cast, so \nbe it. That is what we are paid to do, and we are not guaranteed \nreelection. That seems basic to me.\n  Congress and the American people deserve an opportunity to fully \nreview and consider any debt limit deal that is struck behind closed \ndoors.\n  It has also been reported--in one publication at least--that in order \nto make the numbers look better, we are going to resort to certain \nbudget gimmicks. In other words, let's say we eliminate a $100 million \nprogram. Well, we have been talking about how much that would save over \n10 years, whether it would save $100 million over 10 years. That would \nbe $1 billion. One of the gimmicks that was floated around, and was in \nfact used in the President's debt plan, was to say that we are going to \ndo it over 12 years instead of 10 years as the deficit commission \nrecommended. So we haven't actually cut any more; we have just added a \ncouple of years to the timeframe that we are considering to make it \nseem like we reached the goal.\n  We have had gimmicks in which a big military payment to soldiers or a \nSocial Security payment falling near the end of the month is pushed \nover to the next fiscal year--so it is due on September 30, and they \nmake it payable October 1--and the numbers look better. We don't show \nthe expenditure, but it is still there. The money is still going to be \nspent. Nothing has been changed except the date when the money is paid. \nThese so gimmicks are unacceptable. Any plan that is presented on this \nfloor, however it comes forward, must be free of gimmicks and \naccounting tricks. It must be an honest, fact-based budget. \nAdditionally, raising the debt ceiling should not be accomplished by \ntax hikes. A punishing tax increase would not only threaten the growth \nwe have to have in our economy, but it would also give a free pass to \nthe egregious overspending of Washington. It would bail out the big \nspending excesses that have been put in place here. This overspending \nbehavior is morally and economically culpable for our current crisis.\n  Federal Government spending already controls nearly 25 percent of our \neconomy. It amounts to that much--the highest we have ever had. Some of \nthat is because the economy is down. Some of it is because spending is \nup. But 25 percent of the economy is now driven by the Federal \nGovernment, with tax money and borrowed money. Sixty percent of what \nthey spend is tax money; 40 percent-plus is borrowed. We take in $2.2 \ntrillion, and we spend $3.7 trillion. That is why all the experts tell \nus this is unsustainable--and we know it is true. That is why we cannot \ndo business as usual. That is why we have to do something. And that is \nwhy the House of Representatives produced a budget that cut spending. \nSome people didn't like it, but unless we have massive tax increases--\ntax increase that will damage the economy--we have to reduce spending; \nright? Certainly this is correct. So that is where we are.\n  The difficulty is the spending and the resulting debt that is \nprojected by the Congressional Budget Office--at least as they have \nanalyzed the budget presented by the President. The current spending \npath, if it is just continued, is very dangerous. They are setting us \non an even worse path.\n  Now, the President did submit a budget to the Congress. I offered it, \nand it was voted down 97 to 0. It made the already unacceptable debt \npath we were on much worse. Indeed, it would have doubled the country's \ndebt, from $13 trillion to $27 trillion in 10 years. That is the path \nthey projected, and the debt in the out years would be increasing, not \ndecreasing; an unsustainable path.\n  So, ultimately, the numbers we have been hearing--like $2 trillion in \ncuts--are not sufficient. It is only a part of what we would have to do \nto get our country on a sound fiscal path. We hear this figure--that we \nneed $2 trillion in cuts. A lot of people don't realize that the House \nbudget reduces spending by $6 trillion over the next 12 years. By the \nway, over the next 12 years we are projected to add $13 trillion to the \nnational debt, doubling it. So cutting $6 trillion is pretty \nsignificant. It requires us to take firm action.\n  This makes some people uneasy. They think we can't cut that much. But \nmany of our States and cities and\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\ncounties have been cutting more than that on a percentage basis, and \nthey are going to survive. They know they have to live within their \nmeans, but Washington has not gotten that message.\n  It is rumored that an unseen draft of the Senate Democratic budget \nproposes only $1.5 trillion in cuts. This is according to reports. They \nhave tried to make the number bigger by counting interest savings, \nincluding those from tax hikes. This is a gimmick, because $1 in \nspending cuts is not equivalent to $1 in tax hikes. It just simply is \nnot.\n  Cutting spending restores economic confidence and makes room for \nprivate sector growth. Studies show that this approach results in more \nsignificant deficit reduction. Cutting spending allows us to pursue a \nmore competitive Tax Code. Hiking taxes is a less successful way to \ntrim the deficit. That is the reality. Hiking taxes punishes families \nfor the waste of Washington, and it enables a bloated government that \nneeds to be trimmed and whipped into shape.\n  Raising taxes to pay for excessive government spending is a refusal \nto recognize there are limits to how much we can spend and how much we \ncan tax. There is a limit to how much we can spend and how much we can \ntax if we want to be a government of democratic ideals, freedom, and \nfree markets; and limited government is what our Founders intended.\n  A plan to reduce the deficit by $4 trillion and only cut $2 trillion \nin actual spending contains only a fraction of the savings we can and \nmust achieve. That is my firm view, and I think we have many people in \nWashington, including, I have to say, our President, who are in denial \nabout the challenges and difficulties we face.\n  This is not a situation in which a few little cuts here and there can \nput us on the path to fiscal solvency and get us off the path to fiscal \ndestruction. It is going to take stronger steps, the kind of steps they \nare taking in New York State, the kind of steps Governor Christie is \ntaking in New Jersey. We are not even reaching the level of cuts \nGovernor Brown has achieved in California or what the English are doing \nin the U.K. We have to wise up. We cannot continue down this path.\n  Let me share a few other thoughts about debt because debt is a \ndangerous thing. It hurts us right now. Most of us have gotten into the \nhabit of saying we are worried about our children and our \ngrandchildren, and certainly we are worried about their future because \nof the debt burden we are placing on their shoulders. But the truth is, \nthe debt threatens us right now. It is a danger to our economy. It is a \ndanger and it is a drag on the economy. Let me explain how debt \ndestroys jobs and why this Senate should pass a budget.\n  The House of Representatives has passed a budget; they have made it \npublic and they have defended it and explained it. Let's see what the \nSenate Democratic majority will do about a budget.\n  Higher debt leads to slower economic growth. Empirical studies show \nthat high levels of government debt inhibit economic growth by creating \nuncertainty, displacing needed private investment and placing upward \npressure on interest rates and raising burden on the government itself \nthrough interest payments on the debt.\n  For example, the very well-respected and much commented-on study by \nReinhart and Rogoff, Harvard and University of Maryland economists, \nfound that in advanced economies with gross government debt above 90 \npercent of GDP--in other words, a total debt equal to 90 percent or \nabove the size of the American economy--median economic growth tends to \nbe between 1 and 2 percent lower, depending on the time period \nanalyzed, when compared to countries with lower debt-to-GDP ratios.\n  What do we mean by 1 percent to 2 percent lower? In the first quarter \nof this year, we were expecting almost 3 percent growth. In reality, it \nwas shockingly lower. It adversely impacted the stock market. What did \nit come in at? 1.8 percent. The second quarter may not be so good \neither. We are already above 90 percent of debt to GDP; so presumably, \nif this study is accurate, we should have been at 2.8 percent growth. \nIn a sense, it is not a 1-percent reduction; it is 36 percent less than \nthe growth we need to have.\n  Another study has shown that 1 percent growth in the gross domestic \nproduct, 1 percent growth in our economy, creates 1 million jobs.\n  When asked about this Reinhart-Rogoff study, President Obama's \nSecretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, told the Budget Committee \nhe considered it an excellent study--not only that, he told us in the \ncommittee he thought it underestimated the problem. Because when you \nget debt the size of 90 to 100 percent of GDP--and we are projected to \nreach 100 percent of GDP as our debt by the end of this year--he said \nit creates the danger of an economic crisis, some sort of spasm like we \nhad when we had the financial crisis or even something similar to \nGreece. Something that could put us into another recession, which would \nbe the worst thing that could happen to our economy.\n  That is why this is serious business. We are feeling the impact of \nthis debt right now. It is pulling down economic growth. It is costing \nus jobs. It is creating uncertainty and fear in the marketplace. We \nhave to get off of it.\n  President Obama appointed the fiscal commission, cochaired by Alan \nSimpson, a former Senator, and Erskine Bowles, former chief of staff to \nPresident Clinton. Erskine Bowles and Senator Simpson told the Budget \nCommittee we are facing the most predictable debt crisis in this \nNation's history--the most predictable economic crisis in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  In other words, they explained that the debt trajectory we are on \nguarantees an economic crisis. The question is when.\n  So that is why we have to change. We don't want to have to cut any \nspending. The last thing politicians want to do is cut spending. The \nreason we are talking about this is because we have to. I do believe \nPresident Obama deserves severe criticism for not being out front \nleading on this, not telling the American people what his own experts \nare telling him. This was his expert, Mr. Bowles, and his Treasury \nSecretary, Mr. Geithner, telling us we have to change the debt path we \nare on. He needs to help explain to the American people why this is \nnecessary, while it will be painful in the short run, but it can put us \non the road to prosperity and not on the road to decline.\n  Other studies, including Caner, Grennes, and Koehler-Geib's 2010 \nstudy of 99 countries between 1980 and 2008, reached a similar \nconclusion about debt.\n  Successful debt-reduction measures relying on spending cuts, not tax \nincreases, have consistently resulted in stronger economic growth. \nResearch from Harvard economist Alberto Alesina, as well as a Goldman \nSachs report, found that fiscal consolidations--reductions in \nspending--that focused on cutting government spending, including on \nsubsidies, transfer payments, and government worker pensions, were \nsuccessful in cutting fiscal imbalances, typically boosted economic \ngrowth, and were followed by improved equity--that is the stock \nmarket--and bond market performance. That is what their study found, an \nempirical study by Goldman Sachs and a professor from Harvard, \neconomist Alberto Alesina--not Jeff Sessions. These are independent \nanalyses.\n  Examples of successful spending reductions include Canada, which is \nin some ways doing far better than we are. We are at 9.1 percent \nunemployment and our unemployment numbers still seem to be going up; \nwhereas, Canada is at about 7.1 percent and going down.\n  New Zealand had a dramatic turnaround in the early 1990s. They went \nfrom 22 consecutive years of deficit spending to now 16 years of \nsurpluses. It was a deliberate, systematic decision by the people of \nNew Zealand through their government to change what they were doing. \nThey reduced spending. They created ways to make sure the government \nwas productive and saved money. They privatized a lot of activities the \ngovernment had taken over that didn't need to be government functions, \nand the country has been progressing solidly ever since.\n  Financial markets have issued dire warnings about the consequences of \nour inaction. Against the backdrop of a spreading euro zone debt \ncrisis, the International Monetary Fund--certainly not a rightwing \norganization--the International Monetary Fund recently urged the United \nStates to act\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\nswiftly to address its soaring budget deficits saying: ``You cannot \nafford to have a world economy where these important decisions are \npostponed.''\n  The credit rating agencies Moody's and S have warned that they may \nplace the U.S. Government's AAA bond rating under review for a possible \ndowngrade within months.\n  Bill Gross, the head of PIMCO, the largest bond fund in the world, \nwith hundreds of billions of dollars invested, has ceased buying U.S. \nGovernment Treasurys. None of that is in his portfolio. He said \nrecently that what we are doing with our economy through the Fed, with \nthis quantitative easing, and the government with its worthless \nstimulus package, is what he called a sugar high, not real, a temporary \nsurge that has not changed the circumstances we are in. He is a man who \ndeals every day with investments, and he has ceased to invest in U.S. \nTreasurys.\n  Yet the Nation has operated without a budget now for 785 days. The \nDemocratically led Senate, even when they had a huge majority last \nyear, perhaps the biggest majority in my lifetime--I can't remember a \nparty having 60 votes in the Senate, when that last occurred--didn't \npass a budget. You can pass a budget with just 50 votes. It was given \npriority. We know we need a budget. So we set up a Budget Act that \nallows even a bare majority of Senators to pass a budget, and set a \nplan for our Congress.\n  The Senate has not even allowed the Budget Committee to meet this \nyear to mark up a budget resolution. The Budget Act calls for the \nBudget Committee to hold a markup by April 1. It calls for the Congress \nto pass a budget by April 15. The House passed their budget by April \n15. We have not yet even had a markup to work on a budget resolution, \nand the leadership in the Senate has refused to pass a budget since \nApril 29, 2009, 785 days ago. We wonder why this country is in a \nfinancial crisis when we will not even get together to pass a budget, \nas every city, county, and State has. I don't know of a single one that \nhasn't.\n  Over this time that we haven't passed a budget, the Nation has spent \n$7.1 trillion and added $3.2 trillion to the gross Federal debt.\n  The majority leader, my friend, Harry Reid--I know he has a tough \njob, but he made a big mistake. He recently said it would be foolish \nfor the Democrats to produce a budget.\n  Foolish to produce a budget? Is this the kind of leadership the \nAmerican people expect out of Washington, that the No. 1 Senator, the \nleader of the majority party, who has the power to control the flow of \nlegislation in this body, says he is not about to produce a budget? \nIndeed, he says it is foolish to produce one, and he has basically sent \nword to the Budget Committee we are not to even have committee \nhearings.\n  I think nothing could be more foolish than refusing to provide the \nNation's job creators, investors, and taxpayers with a solid blueprint \nfor our fiscal future. A blueprint in which the American people can see \nwe have gotten it, we understand the debt course we are on is \nunsustainable, and now we have a plan to get us on the right track.\n  Why wouldn't the people who wanted to be in the majority, who asked \nto lead, step forward and lead? Why will they not lay forth a plan that \ncan be analyzed and shown to the American people? Why aren't they proud \nto present their vision for what America should be like and how we \nshould handle their future?\n  I will say in conclusion that the breakdown of the talks does not \nsurprise me. The Gang of Six tried. Those talks seem to have fallen \napart. Then we went to the Biden talks. Once again, people said that we \nwere about to reach an agreement any minute, that all the rest of us \nSenators could relax and all we needed to do is walk up and sign our \nname to what these wise few have decided our financial future should be \nlike.\n  I think most of us realize we were elected. We are Senators. We are \nnot rubberstamps for Vice President Biden and some of our fine \ncolleagues. The Presiding Officer is an independent American citizen. \nHe is going to make up his own mind. So am I. But when you are talking \nabout a budget, a financial plan, a program to raise the debt ceiling \nin this Congress, we ought to read it, we ought to know what is in it. \nNot only us, the American people should know what is in it. They need \nto have time to absorb what it means for them and their future, that \nthere will be no gimmicks or tricks, and it will be honestly presented. \nThat takes some time.\n  I am worried and have been worried if they reach an agreement, even \nif it is a somewhat good agreement--I don't expect it to be a great \none, but if a decent agreement is made, it is going to be brought \nforward and we will have to pass it within days because of a panic that \nwe will have an economic problem if we do not raise the debt limit and \nwe cannot spend so much money. I don't think we should head that way.\n  I don't know what is going to happen now. It is late, I will \nacknowledge, for us to go back to the regular order and have Budget \nCommittee hearings and amendments in the Budget Committee and have \npeople stand up before the world and explain their view and offer \namendments. I don't think it is necessarily too late. I do not know \nwhere it will go. But this has not been a shining hour for the Senate, \nand after this last election in which Senators and House Members took a \nshellacking by the American people, who were very unhappy with us, the \nHouse I think appears to at least have gotten the message. They put \nforth an honest budget that changes the debt trajectory and they put it \nforth and explained it and defended it.\n  What do we have in the Senate? We have the majority leader saying it \nis foolish for us to produce a budget. We are not going to produce a \nbudget. Did he mean it is foolish for America? No, he meant it is \nfoolish for political reasons. He meant it was foolish for us as \nDemocrats to step forward and lay out an honest plan because, wow, that \nplan may include tax increases. It might include spending reductions. \nIt may not reduce the deficit very much, and we would have to defend \nthat to the American people and we might not be able to defend it and \npeople might be unhappy with us, as they were in the last election. So \nlet's be clever, let's not produce a budget, let's let Mr. Ryan and the \nHouse lead with their chin, let them come out and make a plan and we \nwill attack it. That is the Democratic leadership we have seen in this \nSenate.\n  It is not legitimate, it is not justified leadership. It is \nirresponsible and the President has not been engaged. He does not want \nto talk about it. He has not explained it in his State of the Union \nAddress. He has not talked to the American people consistently about \nwhy his own debt commission chairman, Mr. Erskine Bowles, says we are \nfacing the most predictable economic crisis in our history. No, he \ndoesn't want to talk about that. Why? Because once you talk about it, \nit becomes obvious that spending needs to be cut and because it is \nobvious that you cannot fix your way out of this by raising taxes. If \nyou are a tax and spender, you don't want to deal with that reality, in \nmy view.\n  I am worried about it. I don't know where we are heading today. \nSenator Reid is a good man. Senator McConnell is a good leader on our \nside. I don't know what Speaker Boehner is going to do, what Vice \nPresident Biden will do. But the time, as old Snuffy Smith, the \nmountaineer, used to say, ``Time's a-wastin'.'' The deadline is coming \ncloser and closer. We are going to have to figure out something to help \nsecure the future of this country and I hope we can do it sooner rather \nthan later.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 502 and 503\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Paul, I call up \namendments Nos. 502 and 503, and ask unanimous consent that they be \nreported by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for Mr. Paul, \n     proposes amendments en bloc numbered 502 and 503.\n\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 502\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the Treasurer of the \n                             United States)\n\n       On page 55, strike lines 12 through 22.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 503\n\n(Purpose: To strike the provision relating to the Director of the Mint)\n\n       On page 55, line 23, strike all through page 56, line 5.\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, today, I was unavoidably absent for votes \nNo. 95 and No. 96. At the time of the votes, I was attending a memorial \nservice at Fort Riley, KS, for six soldiers of the 2nd Brigade, 1st \nInfantry Division. Had I been present, I would have voted yea on the \nVitter amendment No. 499 and the DeMint amendment No. 510 to S. 679.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in \nsupport of the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act \nof 2011. This is a good, commonsense piece of legislation that has \nbipartisan support.\n  When President Kennedy came to office, he had 286 positions to fill \nwith the titles of Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, \nAssistant Secretary, and Administrator. By the end of the Clinton \nadministration, there were 914 positions with these titles.\n  Today, there are more than 1,200 positions appointed by the President \nthat require the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  The large number of positions requiring confirmation causes long \ndelays in selecting, vetting, and nominating these appointees.\n  I strongly believe the confirmation process must be thorough enough \nfor the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty, but it should not be \nso onerous as to deter qualified people from public service.\n  The Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act removes \nthe need for Senate confirmation for only 205 positions by converting \nthese positions to Presidential appointment-only. They include \npositions involved with internal agency management and positions that \nare already accountable to other Senate-confirmed positions, such as \ninternal management and administrative positions and deputies or \nnonpolicy-related Assistant Secretaries who report to individuals who \nare Senate-confirmed.\n  Some have argued that, through this bill, the Senate cedes some of \nits constitutional power to the executive branch. However, this bill \nactually represents an exercise of the Senate's constitutional \nprerogatives.\n  The Constitution gives Congress the authority to decide whether a \nparticular position should be categorized as an inferior officer that \nneed not go through the Senate confirmation process.\n  The Senate has a number of important responsibilities that it must \nundertake, and it is questionable whether spending time confirming, for \ninstance, the Alternate Federal Cochairman, Appalachian Regional \nCommission, is the most appropriate use of our limited time and \nresources. Prioritizing our work for the American people, by \neliminating some Senate-confirmed positions, does not diminish the \nSenate's authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4066-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4066-S4068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CLYDE BROCK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Kentucky's \ninspirational treasures. Ninety-four-year-old Clyde Brock is one of \nfour residents of Laurel County, KY, who was chosen to share his \nremarkable story as part of London, KY's Living Treasures Project. \nLooking back, Clyde Brock has remembered for us the monumental events \nand cherished memories that helped shape his life.\n  Born April 9, 1917, in a small town called Roots Branch in Clay \nCounty, KY, Clyde Brock was the eldest of 10 children of Johnny and \nMary Brock. Suffering from a staph infection in his leg, Clyde endured \na childhood of doctor visits and constant operations. Though his \ndisability left him with one leg shorter than the other, Clyde refused \nto let it hinder his ability to experience life to the fullest. He can \nrecall the excitement of seeing his first Model T Ford, the growth and \ndevelopment of his hometown, the constant changes in prices, the Great \nDepression, and the effects of war. After being turned down for the \ndraft, due to his leg, Brock went on to pursue a career in teaching \nafter graduating Sue Bennett College in 1940.\n  Clyde also took the position of postmaster and remembers well when \ncustomers would bring eggs to pay for their stamps instead of money. \nThree eggs paid for a letter; eggs sold for 12 cents a dozen back then. \nClyde also ran a rationing board during World War II. He can remember \nfolks standing in line half a day to get their pound of lard.\n  Soon after, Clyde married his late wife Ada Brown and they had three \nchildren. Sadly, Ada passed away earlier this year after suffering a \nsevere stroke. After many years together, Clyde says that his greatest \naccomplishment in life was getting her to marry him.\n  After 32 successful years at eight different schools teaching history \nand civics, Mr. Brock retired. While recollecting his memories of \nwalking to school through the snow and the enjoyment of seeing his \nstudents become excited about learning, it's clear Clyde Brock still \nhas a passion for teaching.\n  Clyde is a member of Providence Baptist Church, where he is a deacon \nand trustee. Realizing that life is short, Mr. Brock says that it has \nonly been ``by the grace of God'' that he has been able to live for so \nlong.\n  I know my U.S. Senate colleagues join me is saying Mr. Clyde Brock, \nwho can look back with pride at a full life well lived, is an \ninspiration to us all. He is not only a living treasure to London, but \na living treasure to the State of Kentucky.\n  Mr. President, the Laurel County Sentinel Echo recently published an \narticle illuminating Mr. Clyde Brock's long life and career. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, May 11, 2011]\n\n                   London's Living Treasures: Part 1\n\n                     (Transcribed by Tara Kaprowy)\n\n       Following is the life story of 94-year-old Clyde Brock, who \n     is one of four Laurel Countians chosen to be part of London's \n     Living Treasures project. Over a two-hour interview, while \n     sitting in an easy chair in his Bush-area home, Brock shared \n     many memories, from the day he saw his first car to the day \n     his beloved wife Ada died ``with just a curtain between \n     them.''\n       ``I was born April 9, 1917 in Clay County in a place called \n     Roots Branch because so many Roots lived there. I was born in \n     a big log house. I was the first of 10 children to a young \n     couple called Johnny and Mary Brock.\n       My dad bought a farm, I was about 5 years old when we moved \n     from there. Then he decided to leave the farm and got a \n     public job and we moved to Corbin. It must have been about \n     1924. I went to school one year there, Felts School.\n       I remember my grandfather had a brother that fought on the \n     southern side during the Civil War. I just remember him. He'd \n     come to see my grandfather and he had a mule and I just \n     remember that. He didn't draw a pension. Then I saw one \n     soldier that fought on the northern side and he drew $100 a \n     month.\n       In 1926, I had the misfortune of getting a staph germ. It \n     was one Sunday evening, I was just out fooling around outside \n     and it hit me, all at twice. The next morning there was a \n     knot in my leg.\n       Well, they took me to Corbin Hospital. They scraped the \n     bone, but it didn't help. Brought me to London, you know \n     where the First National Bank is now. There was a little bank \n     and it had a little hospital over it. Well, they took me in \n     there and my temperature was 105.5. This doctor, he saved my \n     life, Dr. H.V. Pennington. The kind of surgical tools he used \n     was a hammer and chisel to chisel bone out.\n       I stayed there a month until they got the new hospital over \n     on the hill. There was eight of us moved into that new \n     building. There was four doctors in it: Dr. J.W. Crook, Dr. \n     G.S. Brock, Dr. O.D. Brock and Dr. Pennington. I had two more \n     surgeries there, and I stayed there from last of March in \n     1926 until some time in August. With staph going on up, they \n     performed surgery on my knee. That didn't check it, and it \n     got to my hip. They come in, all four of them one day with a \n     big needle, they went into my hip and they found it had got \n     up there. So, they told my mother and my father to come up \n     because they'd have to perform surgery again. My dad picked \n     me up in his arms and carried me to the operating surgery \n     table. They took the ball out, I don't have that ball in my \n     hip. It made my leg shorter so they put a 10-pound weight on \n     a roller on the foot of the bed and held it six weeks to try \n     to pull it down. It didn't work. They didn't have therapy \n     then, they didn't have penicillin then, so that staph, it \n     left my leg short and stiff.\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\n       We moved to Cane Creek and I had C. Frank Bentley as a \n     teacher at Union Grade School. Then my father, he wanted a \n     bigger farm so he swapped that farm in to one about 200 acres \n     and we moved there. I start Bush School in the seventh grade. \n     I had eight brothers and sisters graduated from Bush. I was \n     about an average student--no, I didn't shine.\n\n\n                          The Great Depression\n\n       Let me tell you a bit about the Great Depression. If you \n     live down on the farm, it didn't affect you because you \n     didn't have any bills to pay. Everybody had their own meat \n     and killed their own hogs, they had their cows where they got \n     their butter or their milk, they had their chickens, had \n     their eggs. You was almost independent.\n       My job was to go to the mill on Saturday evenings. We'd \n     shell a bushel of corn on Friday night. I'd take that corn to \n     mill and everybody else did too and get it ground into meal \n     and it made that good, ole cornbread. It was over here on \n     Black water Road, Henry Hale run the mill. I'd ride on a \n     mule. You either walked or rode a mule or horse.\n       I saw my first car when I was about 5 years old. It had \n     come over from London to Manchester. A man come along \n     walking. He said, ``There's a car coming up here.'' Well, I \n     was out to see it in the yard and here it comes. One of those \n     old Model-T Fords in the wagon tracks.\n       I got out of high school, I went to Sue Bennett College, \n     1938. London used to be a lot of wooden buildings down each \n     side there. Over on Broad Street, straight across from the \n     courthouse where those annex buildings are now, there used to \n     be two dwelling houses there. And they had a theater up there \n     that you could go to the movies, 15 cents in 1938, '39. You \n     went in and had to go up some steps and it had about two rows \n     of seats, aisle down the middle. Next block over from \n     Weaver's pool room. You could get you a hamburger and a \n     bottle of pop there and it would cost about 15 cents.\n\n\n                             Wages and War\n\n       They had Hackney's, Daniel's, Woody's, 10 cents stores, \n     they had a lot of them. Then they had pool rooms. Laurel \n     County was wet at one time, about '38, '39. '40, they had \n     beer joints. Where Scoville's office is, when you go down in \n     a hole, that was called Underworld, they had a beer joint \n     down there. Then they had one in east London over by Benge \n     Supply, used to be a liquor store. Go in and bottles were \n     sitting up on the counter.\n       There used to be a lot of people go to church on Sunday \n     because they didn't have anywhere else to go. They'd stay \n     outside and fight and things; I was outside too. There'd be \n     more people outside than there were in. Blackwater Church, \n     I've seen the preacher come right out and his son and the \n     other preacher's son were fighting right at the door. He just \n     walked out and tried to get them separated.\n       Going to Sue Bennett, I stayed in the dorm, the boys would \n     sit up all night and play poker, blackjack for a penny. \n     Cigarettes used to you could buy for 11 cents, you could get \n     Camels, Lucky's for 15 cents. On Sunday, if you want to get \n     out, if you got a pack of cigarettes and a pack of chewing \n     gum, you was doing pretty good.\n       I graduated from Sue Bennett in 1940 and got my teaching \n     diploma. That was the quickest thing you could do then. That \n     was after the Depression. I made $73.74 a month. When I was \n     about 23, I got to be postmaster. There would be people to \n     bring three eggs to the post office to mail a letter. Eggs \n     was 12 cents a dozen at one time. My dad had a store and he'd \n     take the eggs and he'd sell them and put 3 cents in. He could \n     get all the men he wanted to work for 50 cents a day and \n     their dinner.\n       War started. In addition to being postmaster, I was also \n     deputy clerk. People had to come to register when they \n     rationed everything. They'd come and sign up and you'd give \n     them a ration book with stamps in it. Coffee was rationed and \n     people used lard back then. They'd stand in line about a half \n     a day to get about a pound of lard.\n       I was called in January before the War started. With my \n     leg, I got so I could work and do things, I didn't have to go \n     on crutches. I done about anything anybody else used to do. \n     I'd a liked to go, I told them they could use me anywhere, \n     I'd have gone. I was the second one called in the county \n     before the War started, but I was turned down. A teacher I \n     was teaching with, he told me I would pass. He said, ``They \n     don't want you to run, you're not supposed to run when you're \n     in a war.''\n\n\n                          Love of a Good Woman\n\n       In 1940, I met a girl that meant more to me than all the \n     rest that I knew. Named Ada Brown, who lived over in Pigeon \n     Roost in Clay County. We married in 1941, I must have been \n     about 20. I had a good friend I'd run around with, and he was \n     dating her sister. We went to Freedom United Church one \n     Wednesday night, and after church he and her sister was \n     walking in front. He was down leading a mule. I was riding \n     behind this other one and she was walking by herself. I asked \n     about getting down, and we got together. That was the best \n     thing that happened to me in my life, she marrying me. We \n     went to Jellico, Tenn., went into the clerk's office to get \n     the license. He said $10, $5 for the license, $5 for the \n     preacher.\n       We had a four-room house and about four acres of ground and \n     had a cook stove. Then we had a kitchen cabinet, a little \n     dining room set, we had two beds and a few chairs.\n\n\n                        Seven Miles in the Snow\n\n       The second year I started teaching, they sent me to a \n     school called Darl Jones, and it was about seven miles away. \n     I had to get a horse, cost me about $75. In wintertime, one \n     morning, I got up and you had to be there at 8 o'clock. I \n     thought, ``It's too cold to ride, it's way below zero,'' so I \n     said, ``I'm going to walk.'' I left walking, snow on the \n     ground, moon shining bright, I walked that seven miles. You \n     know what I was wishing? I wished that someone would ask me \n     to stay all night with them. Just about before we turned out \n     for lunch, a fellow by the name of Willie Martin that lived \n     in the community, he come in and sit down and he said, ``I \n     want you to stay all night with me.'' He didn't have to twist \n     my arm.\n       In 1941, I had 44 students in school, 16 in the sixth \n     grade. Now, a lot of them's already passed on. On Friday \n     afternoon, used to young people would come around because \n     after school you had a ballgame or you had a ciphering match. \n     We'd see which side could add the columns the quickest. Well \n     one Friday night, a man come there and when it started to \n     rain he went outside and got his gun, a pump shotgun, and set \n     it in the corner of the schoolhouse. We paid no attention to \n     that. When it quit raining, he got his gun and went up the \n     road.\n       The day my first son was born, I was gone up to get my pay \n     that day at a teacher's meeting. My brother had to go and get \n     the doctor. He had an old bicycle, but one pedal was broken \n     off, it just had that rod that came out, and his foot kept \n     slipping off and it would cut his leg. And it was hot, it was \n     in September, he rode all the way and back with that old \n     bicycle and burned up and he always said, ``And look what we \n     got.'' Well, I felt good, and you know I had a pay day that \n     day. You know how much it cost? $20. He's a pretty good boy, \n     never had to go to the jailhouse or anything like that.\n       I have three children, Larry, Janice and Gary.\n       I was about 25 or 26 when I got my first car, a 1936 \n     Chevrolet. I didn't know how to drive. On Monday morning I \n     started out and I had to go up a little bank. Well, I says, \n     ``I'll put it up in second.'' Well, I didn't put it in \n     second, I put it in reverse. It went back with me. I had a \n     time driving.\n       In 1946, that's when I built this house. I was going to \n     build it out of wood. Couldn't find it, couldn't get wood. \n     Corbin had a cement block factory, and I got a man to lay the \n     block 50 cents an hour. Rationing was so bad, you couldn't \n     buy a car. When we got the house up, we couldn't get any \n     windows. It was a year before I could get windows.\n\n\n                        Through Faith and Grace\n\n       We got saved in 1951, been members of Providence Baptist \n     Church now for 60 years. I taught Sunday school for 36 years. \n     And you know they gave me an honor? They named the class \n     after me. And I'm still a deacon and a trustee.\n       In 1955, we started raising chickens. I guess we raised \n     chickens 20 years and we always had chicken to eat. Then we \n     raised tobacco. And Ada always had a big garden, and she \n     always had a big freezer. She froze everything.\n       I retired in 1972, taught 32 years. I taught at eight \n     schools, Blackwater, Darl Jones, Bennett Branch, Lake, White \n     Hall, Pace's Creek, Boggs, Head Beech Creek and Bush Junior \n     High. I liked teaching history and civics, but not English, \n     didn't like diagramming and analyzing. I couldn't tell a \n     dangling modifier now from anything else. But I liked when I \n     could see progress in some of them, you knew you was doing \n     maybe something good. Those little fellers, I'd like to watch \n     them. They'd get up to the board, we loved going to the board \n     and make ABCs back then. Now you don't do that, you don't \n     memorize nothing now.\n       A lot of my students came to me when I was up in that \n     nursing home in December last year. They said, ``You had a \n     lot of company.'' Some of them come in there with old, grey \n     beards, and I didn't recognize them. They said, ``Well, I \n     went to school with you.'' I stayed about 31 days up there. I \n     was there with Ada.\n       In 1992, one day my wife, she cooked a big dinner. We ate \n     dinner, we watched Price Is Right, she says, ``I'm going in \n     here to freeze some beans.'' I got up and went through there \n     and she laid on the floor. No response. I called 9-1-1 and \n     when they come they thought it was a stroke and that's what \n     it was. It took her speech and paralyzed her right side.\n       She stayed in the hospital and nursing home. From the time \n     she went in to the day she passed away was 18 years, six \n     months and 9 days. And she stayed in Laurel Heights in London \n     18 years. I had already retired. We was together for about 51 \n     good years. She was a quilter and a good cook. She was noted \n     for her fried apple pies. She'd take them to the homecomings \n     at church. She'd made 60 pies one morning.\n       After I got sick this December, I had to go for rehab and \n     they had me go to Laurel Heights. The lady that was in with \n     Ada passed away and they said, ``You go be in the room with \n     your wife.'' So I went. They'd get me up in the wheelchair. \n     They let me sit by her on Sunday. After I'd been there a \n     while, she passed away, just a curtain between us. That was \n     the 22nd day of January this year.\n       See I'm 94 years old now. My wife was 88. Now I stay here \n     by myself. But I gave up driving. Just six months ago. I \n     thought I'd better quit while I was ahead.\n       How does it feel to be 94? You know one thing, you know \n     your time is getting shorter, and you don't have too long to \n     stay here.\n\n[[Page S4068]]\n\n       I say it's been by the grace of God that I've been blessed \n     to live this long. I don't want to take any honor or \n     anything, as if I've done something myself to stay healthy. \n     It's all for the grace of God.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4068-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MARVIN CLEVINGER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the heroic \nefforts of an honored Kentuckian. Known for his service and his \nallegiance to his country, PFC Marvin Clevinger is a true World War II \nhero in Pike County, KY.\n  Born March 18, 1922, to James and Dollie May Clevinger, Marvin was \nthe eldest of eight. Growing up on a farm in eastern Kentucky, Mr. \nClevinger, also known as ``Garl'' around his family, was an intelligent \nyoung man who dropped out of the 7th grade to help provide for his \nfamily. Working as a timber man and a farmer before his days as a \nsoldier, ``Garl'' did all he could to help his family as well as his \ncommunity.\n  After enrolling in the war, Private First Class Clevinger, also known \nas ``Zeke'' to his platoon, fought in numerous battles, putting his \nlife on the line for his country. Clevinger was said to be amongst the \nstrongest and most agile of the soldiers and was honored with the \nprivilege of being a scout for his platoon. In one battle, when his \nplatoon found itself pinned by German machine gun fire, Private First \nClass Clevinger advanced 150 yards under intense fire and threw several \ngrenades to silence the enemy. He received a Bronze Star for his heroic \nactions.\n  Private First Class Clevinger spent a month in the hospital in Paris \nafter receiving multiple wounds in his legs during battle. He received \nnumerous medals, awards, and decorations, including the Bronze Star \nwith Three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal, \nthe Rifle Sharpshooter Badge, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the \nAmerican Campaign Ribbon, the World War II Victory Medal Ribbon, and \nthe European/African/Middle Eastern Theatre Campaign Ribbon.\n  Marvin Clevinger returned to Belcher, KY, after the war and worked \nfor the Russell Fork Coal Company Preparation Plant for 32 years. \nCurrently, Marvin is an active member of Ferrell's Creek Church of \nChrist, and he serves as an inspiration to his family. Because of his \nhard work and all he has achieved and overcome in his 89 years, Marvin \nClevinger is a hero to us all.\n  Mr. President, the Appalachian News Express recently published an \narticle highlighting Marvin Clevinger's life and service. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Appalachian News Express, May 28, 2011]\n\n                 Marvin Clevinger: A World War II Hero\n\n                           (By Nancy M. Goss)\n\n       Belcher.--Over 66 years ago 89-year-old Marvin ``Garl'' \n     Clevinger of Belcher fought in the European Campaign during \n     World War II.\n       Because he suffered a stroke 10 years ago that affected his \n     ability to converse fluently, Marvin allowed family members \n     to tell his story, adding comments from time to time. His \n     nephew, Phillip Ratliff, is an authority on his uncle's role \n     in World War II and provided most of this information.\n       ``I fought in Germany,'' Marvin said. Then added, ``I was \n     shot three times.''\n       ``Marvin never really talked about his war time experiences \n     when I was young, but I'm familiar with the battles he was \n     in,'' Phillip said. ``I was always fascinated by soldiers and \n     military stuff so I just read a lot and later on, I had the \n     little campaign book Garl brought back from the war and I \n     read it a couple times.''\n       Marvin is mentioned in the book by the nickname his platoon \n     gave him, ``Zeke'' Clevinger.\n       Phillip said there were probably only about 200 copies of \n     the campaign booklet of Marvin's company's actions during the \n     war; they were given to the men at the end of the fighting.\n       Marvin's rank and unit: PFC Marvin Clevinger, 1st Rifle \n     Squad, 2nd Platoon, Company B, 61st Armored Infantry \n     Battalion, 10th Armored Division, 3rd Army, USA.\n       He was also a scout for his platoon.\n       ``Only a couple men in a platoon were scouts,'' Phillip \n     explained. ``Back then, if there was a man like Marvin, who \n     was agile and able to move through heavy woods and rough \n     terrain, he was pretty much sought out.''\n       Many of the men were city boys and not used to tramping \n     through woods as was Marvin, who grew up in the mountains of \n     Eastern Kentucky.\n       ``Garl was a deadly shot when he was a young man and came \n     back from the war,'' Phillip said. ``I feel sorry for any \n     human that got in front of his rifle sight because you're \n     talking about a man who could shoot squirrels out of a tree \n     with a 22 rifle. And in the army, those men were pretty \n     valuable, I'd say.''\n       ``He got the medal for sharp shooter,'' added Marvin's \n     brother Paul. ``And the Purple Heart and Bronze Star.''\n       According to a paper accompanying his Bronze Star:\n       ``Private First Class Marvin Clevinger, Company B, Armored \n     Infantry Battalion, United States Army. For heroic \n     achievement in connection with military operations against an \n     enemy of the United States in Germany on March 26, 1945. \n     During an attack on Schoden, Germany, an infantry platoon was \n     suddenly pinned down by machine gun and sniper fire from a \n     well-concealed pillbox. Private First Class Clevinger, scout, \n     advanced 150 yards under the intense fire to within five \n     yards of the enemy position from where he threw grenades \n     through an embrasure in the pillbox, silencing the enemy \n     fire. PFC Clevinger's intrepid action reflects great credit \n     upon himself and the military forces of the United States. \n     Entered the military service from Belcher, Kentucky.''\n       Marvin was shot twice in one leg and once in the other, but \n     still managed to walk and crawl about three miles to an aid \n     station that was back down the side of the mountain. He spent \n     a month and a half in Paris at the hospital and then went \n     straight back to the front lines and saw heavy action again.\n       Phillip said the winter of '44, during the Battle of the \n     Bulge, was the coldest winter of the 20th century and Marvin \n     got frostbit, as did most of the men in his unit.\n       Besides the battle at Schoden and the Battle of the Bulge, \n     Martin also fought in the Battle of Bastogne, and at the \n     Saar-Moselle Triangle, Trier, Berdorf, Consdorf, Echtemach, \n     Landau, Oehringer, Heilbronn, Ulm, Inst, Oberammergau and \n     countless other sites.\n       Marvin was born March 18, 1922, the son of the late James \n     and Dollie May Clevinger. He was raised at Belcher, close to \n     where he lives now, and according to Paul, attended Belcher \n     Grade School up to seventh grade. He had to quit to help on \n     the family's farm. He is the oldest of eight children. He, \n     his sister Faye Potter, and Paul, are the only ones living.\n       Before Marvin went to war, he timbered and farmed. After \n     the war, he was employed in the preparation plant at the \n     Russell Fork Coal Company, owned by A.T. Massey, where he \n     worked for 32 years. He was a member of United Mine Workers \n     of America, Local 8338, at Beaver, which closed many years \n     ago.\n       Marvin said he remembers working at the coal company.\n       ``He would come home from work at the tipple and hoe corn \n     until dark,'' Phillip said. ``For his size, Garl was the \n     strongest guy and the hardest working man I ever saw.''\n       ``He had been out pulling brush and trees down on the road \n     on the day he had the stroke,'' said Gloria Sweeney, Marvin's \n     cousin and caretaker.\n       ``And he knew the woods,'' Phillip said. ``If you went into \n     the woods any time of the year with him, whether there were \n     leaves on the trees or not, he could look at the tree and \n     tell you, ``that's a black oak, that's a chestnut oak, that's \n     a red oak . . .''.\n       ``He was an expert on ginseng, too,'' added his nephew \n     Jason Clevinger. ``Every time we went into the woods--and he \n     was much older than I--he could find much more than I \n     could.''\n       Marvin was an active member of DAV Chapter 140, Elkhorn \n     City, until he had the stroke and is a member of the Ferrells \n     Creek Church of Christ.\n       ``You'll never find a more humble man than this one right \n     here,'' Gloria said. ``Best man in the world.''\n       ``He was always my hero,'' Phillip said.\n       Then he added, ``There's a much larger story here really, \n     even than Garl. He deserves to be the centerpiece because of \n     what he did, but Garl had two first cousins and they all grew \n     up in this holler here. One of his cousins was named Clyde \n     Clevinger and he was killed in action during the first Allied \n     landings in North Africa. His other first cousin's name was \n     Gordon ``Bennett'' Clevinger. Bennett enlisted in the Navy \n     and was on an American submarine right after Pearl Harbor and \n     was captured by the Japanese. He spent about three and a half \n     years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. But he did survive \n     and came home.\n       ``Of those three boys who grew up in this little narrow \n     holler here, all of them were heroes. You can't find men like \n     that anymore,'' Phillip said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4068-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4068-S4069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NLRB\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the National Labor \nRelations Board for issuing new proposed rules that will modernize the \nprocess that workers use to form a union. These new rules will improve \nthe consistency and efficiency of the election process, protect \nworkers' right to a\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\ntimely vote, and limit opportunities for possible coercion by both \nemployers and unions.\n  America's middle class is struggling. Hard-working families are \nfinding it hard to make ends meet. We are recovering from the deepest \nrecession since the Great Depression, and there are workers who are \ntrying to achieve for their families what we all want: financial \nstability that keeps our families secure. However, as workers see their \nbenefits, hours, and pay being cut, they feel powerless. Meanwhile, \nexecutives can and do negotiate their employment contracts. Where is \nthe fairness?\n  Unions can level the playing field for workers, but the process for \nchoosing a union is outdated. Current NRLB election procedures produce \nextensive delays, encourage litigious stall tactics, and provide \nopportunities for intimidation. Further, the organizational structure \nof the NLRB has created inconsistencies in the processing of the \nelection petitions. It is time for the NLRB to address these important \nprocedural shortcomings, and I am encouraged by their response.\n  The new rules do not advantage nor do they disadvantage unions. The \nrules merely create a uniform process for resolving pre- and post-\nelection disputes. Both sides are given the opportunity to present \narguments to allow a fair and well-informed vote. It is also important \nto note that these streamlining rules apply equally to both elections \nseeking to certify a union and elections seeking to decertify a union.\n  Workers deserve the right to choose a union or not to choose a union \nwith a fair, timely, and well-informed up-or-down vote. The right to \nvote is central to our democracy, and we must continue to ensure that \nAmerican workers are afforded this right without impediment or fear. \nThus, I applaud the NLRB for their actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4069-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4069-S4070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MINORITY VIEWS--S. 1103\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, because our minority views were not \nincluded in the Senate Judiciary Committee's report on S. 1103, I ask \nunanimous consent to have them printed in the Record. We hope these \nviews will be of use to Members of the Senate if this legislation is \nconsidered on the Senate floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n  Minority Views of Senators Hatch, Sessions, Graham, Lee, and Coburn\n\n       We fully support the President's request to extend FBI \n     Director Mueller's time in office by two years, followed by a \n     return to the previous practice of one ten-year term for each \n     subsequent FBI Director. We also are committed to \n     implementing this extension before Director Mueller's current \n     ten-year term expires in August. The Senate must, however, \n     pursue this extension in a constitutional manner.\n\n\n                       1. Constitutional Concerns\n\n       Senators Hatch, Cornyn, Graham, Lee, and Coburn have \n     proposed a method of extending FBI Director Mueller's time in \n     office in a way that is universally agreed to be \n     constitutionally unimpeachable. In contrast, a prominent \n     legal scholar has called into question the constitutionality \n     of the method of appointment that S. 1103 proposes. Setting \n     aside the question of our duty to ensure the \n     constitutionality of all legislation approved by our chamber \n     of Congress, the practical consequences of a court declaring \n     void Director Mueller's extension could have widespread \n     ramifications. Any litigation challenging the \n     constitutionality of S. 1103 would call into question the \n     authority of the head of one of America's most important \n     domestic counterterrorism and law enforcement agencies. \n     Potential litigants could be numerous given the substantial \n     number of suspects seeking to avoid criminal liability and \n     those seeking to undermine our terrorism investigations and \n     national security apparatus. For example, at the hearing, \n     James Madison Distinguished Professor of Law at the \n     University of Virginia School of Law John Harrison was asked \n     about potential legal challenges to the validity of Section \n     215 orders for sensitive business records. Pursuant to the \n     2005 extension to the Patriot Act, these Section 215 orders \n     must be authorized by one of three top government officials \n     or their deputies. Professor Harrison testified that 215 \n     orders were a good example of the potential problem that \n     could result from challenges to Director Mueller's extension \n     because a judge might find that orders signed by him were \n     unauthorized.\n       Since at least one prominent legal scholar has testified \n     that S. 1103 would unconstitutionally appoint Director \n     Mueller to a new term, it is easy to imagine at least a few \n     of our 677 Federal District Court judges coming to the same \n     conclusion. In fact, even Senators Schumer and Whitehouse \n     agreed this legislation is of questionable constitutionality. \n     Senator Whitehouse said, ``with respect to the Appointments \n     Clause, we are in a constitutionally gray area,'' and he said \n     he could see the judicial decision ``going either way.'' \n     Senator Whitehouse continued that if he ``were a clerk for a \n     judge and was asked to'' he could ``write it going both \n     ways.'' Senator Schumer agreed stating it is a ``fuzzy \n     issue'' and ``there are merits on either side'' and ``it is a \n     close question.''\n       Even assuming that such a ruling were overturned on appeal, \n     during the intervening period, FBI operations could be \n     stagnated as all official acts of the FBI Director since his \n     extension began would be of questionable validity. This \n     scenario could lead to a failure to gather critical \n     intelligence or to the release of dangerous criminal and \n     terrorism suspects.\n       The Majority argues that constitutional concerns are \n     nonexistent because only one witness at the June 8, 2011 \n     hearing raised constitutional concerns about S. 1103; \n     however, the Minority would point out that due to \n     longstanding committee practice, the minority is allocated a \n     limited number of witnesses. In this case, the ratio on the \n     panel was three to one. Our one witnesses testified as to \n     concerns and these concerns are likely shared by other legal \n     scholars who were not invited to testify. Notwithstanding, \n     even if there is only a small chance that a judge might find \n     S. 1103 unconstitutional, we believe that the Senate has a \n     duty to avoid that contingency, which carries with it \n     potentially severe consequences.\n       Fortunately, we have an ironclad alternative that would \n     accomplish the same goals as S. 1103 in the form of the \n     amendment Senator Coburn offered to S. 1103. We believe the \n     supporters of S. 1103 have the burden of proof to show why we \n     should not follow the undisputedly constitutional course, \n     even if they believe there is only a small chance of a judge \n     declaring an action taken by Director Mueller to be \n     unauthorized. Given the opinions of Professor Harrison and \n     other eminent scholars in addition to the lack of a U.S. \n     Supreme Court decision directly on point, they cannot \n     credibly claim there is no realistic chance at all. Indeed, \n     at the Committee's June 16, 2011 business meeting, Senator \n     Whitehouse stated that ``with respect to the Appointments \n     Clause, we are in a constitutionally gray area'' and that he \n     could see a judge ``going either way.'' Senator Schumer said \n     this was a ``fuzzy issue,'' ``there are merits on either \n     side,'' and ``it is a close question.'' Senator Coburn's \n     simple alternative removes the gray fuzz, thus preserving our \n     national security and law enforcement infrastructure from \n     potential confusion.\n\n\n    2. S. 1103 Violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution\n\n     The Appointments Clause's four methods\n       The Appointments Clause of the Constitution requires all \n     Executive Branch appointments to be made by the President \n     with the Advice and Consent of the Senate with only three \n     exceptions: ``[T]he Congress may by Law vest the Appointment \n     of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the \n     President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of \n     Departments.'' Congressional appointments are not among the \n     exceptions, and the majority report properly points out that \n     Congress cannot make appointments of Executive Branch \n     officials and that the FBI Director is an Executive Branch \n     official. The question, then, is whether or not S. 1103 would \n     allow Congress to extend the FBI Director's statutory ten \n     year term for two additional years.\n       Professor Harrison testified that, ``An appointment is a \n     legal act that causes someone to hold an office that \n     otherwise would be vacant or held by someone else. . . . A \n     statutory extension of the term of an incumbent causes the \n     current incumbent to hold an office that otherwise would be \n     vacant upon the expiration of the incumbent's term. It is \n     thus a statutory appointment. . . . It is just like a statute \n     that provides that a named person is hereby appointed to a \n     specified office.'' We believe Professor Harrison's \n     interpretation has merit and thus conclude that extending \n     Director Mueller's term and causing him to hold an office \n     that otherwise would be vacant on August 4, 2011, could \n     violate the Appointments Clause.\n       The law currently requires Director Mueller to step down \n     after his ten-year term ends and forbids his reappointment by \n     the President. Thus, it could be argued that S. 1103 \n     reappoints Director Mueller to a new two-year term by \n     legislative decree in violation of the Appointments Clause. \n     The Supreme Court has recognized that Congress cannot make \n     Executive appointments, even if the President signs the law \n     making those appointments. It is irrelevant that the \n     President and almost all members of Congress wish Director \n     Mueller to continue in office. Constitutional formalities \n     must be followed. For example, if all members of both houses \n     of Congress sent a letter to the President saying they \n     thereby willed a certain bill to become law, and the \n     President sent a letter in return saying that he too willed \n     the bill to become law through his letter, it would not \n     become law, and no court would treat it as law. We have a \n     written Constitution for this very reason and Congress and \n     the president must comply with its specific procedures. The \n     Constitution requires that both houses vote on a bill and \n     present it to the President for his signature before it can \n     become law. The majority's emphasis on the President's desire \n     that the FBI Director continue in office is immaterial. The \n     President's only constitutional method of placing someone in \n     office is by appointment.\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\n                             3. The Caselaw\n\n       The caselaw on statutory extensions of Executive officials' \n     terms is unclear, making a clearly constitutional bill from \n     Congress all the more imperative. The best the majority \n     report could produce is In re Benny, a Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals case. In re Benny suffers from three flaws: it is \n     binding in only one circuit, the circuit most often \n     overturned by the Supreme Court; it came down before the \n     Supreme Court's Morrison v. Olson decision on the subject of \n     appointments and thus did not integrate the reasoning of that \n     decision into its own; and as the majority admits, one of the \n     concurring opinions in In re Benny does not support S. 1103's \n     constitutionality. Judge Norris' opinion in In re Benny \n     flatly states, ``My principal disagreement with the \n     majority's position is that I believe the Appointments Clause \n     precludes Congress from extending the terms of incumbent \n     officeholders. I am simply unable to see any principled \n     distinction between congressional extensions of the terms of \n     incumbents and more traditional forms of congressional \n     appointments.''\n       The disagreement even among the concurring judges in the \n     Committee majority's list of supporting caselaw demonstrates \n     the likelihood of litigation and the possibility of negative \n     decisions in this ``gray'' and ``fuzzy'' area of law.\n       Further, In re Benny misinterpreted Supreme Court caselaw. \n     As Professor Harrison points out, that case relied on Wiener \n     v. United States, which merely allowed legislation \n     restricting the President's ability to remove quasi-judicial \n     officers to stand. Professor Harrison also notes legislation \n     extending the life of an agency or commission is not the same \n     as extending the term of an appointee because it does ``not \n     extend the term of an officer who otherwise would have been \n     replaced by a new appointee.''\n       Morrison is similarly gray and fuzzy. That case \n     demonstrates the U.S. Supreme Court takes very seriously \n     challenges to federal officials' authority based on the \n     Appointments Clause and the Court is willing to contemplate \n     voiding the actions of an official whose appointment violates \n     the clause. In Morrison, the Court undertakes an extensive \n     analysis of what authority the appointed official has, how \n     that authority could interfere with presidential duties and \n     prerogatives if that official was not appointed by the \n     President or by someone under the President's control, and \n     who appoints the official and from what section of the \n     Constitution the appointing persons derive their authority to \n     appoint. Rather than relying on bright-line rules, the Court \n     weighs and examines many aspects of the Act involved and its \n     practical effects in order to come to many of its \n     conclusions. The Morrison Court upheld the constitutionality \n     of having courts of law appoint independent counsels, but \n     simple formulae are not employed to construct this decision, \n     which is a distinct encouragement to future litigation since \n     attorneys have many pathways to plausibly arguing \n     unconstitutionality.\n       Justice Scalia in his dissent went so far as to assert that \n     the Court had laid down no real guidance at all, and that \n     decisions about the constitutionality of appointments would \n     from now on be made ad hoc by the Court, certainly an \n     invitation to future litigation:\n\n       Having abandoned as the basis for our decision-making the \n     text of Article II that ``the executive Power'' must be \n     vested in the President, the Court does not even attempt to \n     craft a substitute criterion--a ``justiciable standard''. . . \n     . Evidently, the governing standard is to be what might be \n     called the unfettered wisdom of a majority of this Court, \n     revealed to an obedient people on a case-by-case basis. This \n     is not only not the government of laws that the \n     Constitution established; it is not a government of laws \n     at all.\n       The Morrison Court did not uphold congressional \n     appointments as constitutional, which of course they are not, \n     because it did not address that question. Moreover, a \n     reasonable argument could be made that the Court would have \n     considered the appointment of the FBI Director under S. 1103 \n     to be unconstitutional under its analysis. The Court held \n     that if the official in question had been a ``principal'' or \n     ``superior'' officer instead of an ``inferior'' officer, \n     ``then the Act [would be] in violation of the Appointments \n     Clause.'' It is hard to imagine a court classifying the \n     Director of the FBI as an ``inferior'' officer under the \n     Appointments Clause rather than a ``superior'' one given the \n     appointment process since 1968.\n       As further evidence of the Court's willingness to challenge \n     the actions of those whose appointments are of questionable \n     constitutionality, in Ryder v. United States the Court \n     reversed the lower courts and threw out the conviction of a \n     member of the Coast Guard because two of his judges were \n     appointed contrary to the requirements of the Appointments \n     Clause. The Court had also invalidated most of the powers of \n     the members of the Federal Election Commission, as created by \n     the Federal Election Campaign Act, because they were not \n     appointed in conformity with the Appointments Clause.\n\n\n                   4. Department of Justice Opinions\n\n       Given the lack of precedential caselaw and the novelty of \n     the issues presented in S. 1103, the series of DOJ legal \n     opinions that the majority cites in favor of S. 1103's \n     constitutionality cannot be held to be determinative. \n     Further, these opinions are inconsistent. As the CRS report \n     on which the Majority relies says, ``In 1994, the OLC [Office \n     of Legal Counsel] addressed the second five-year extension of \n     the parole commissioners' tenure and explicitly disavowed an \n     earlier 1987 opinion, which viewed the first extension of the \n     Parole [sic] commissioners' terms of office as \n     unconstitutional, finding it in contradiction with its 1951 \n     opinion.'' Hence, the OLC endorsed the constitutionality of \n     extensions, then repudiated it, then endorsed it again.\n       Regardless of OLC opinions, very few cases have been \n     litigated concerning legislative extensions of officials' \n     tenures. Unlike the appointees whose terms were extended by \n     legislation cited by the majority, the FBI Director is a \n     ``principal'' or ``superior'' officer, which may cause the \n     courts to view his case differently, and we still have not \n     heard anything definitive from the Supreme Court on this \n     question.\n\n\n                            5. The Rationale\n\n       The jealous guarding of the President's power to appoint is \n     crucial to preserving the separation of powers and promoting \n     good government. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist \n     No. 76,\n       The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will \n     naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact \n     regard to reputation. He will on this account feel himself \n     under stronger obligations, and more interested to \n     investigate with care the qualities requisite to the stations \n     to be filled, and to prefer with impartiality the persons who \n     may have the fairest pretensions to them.\n       The President has an absolute veto over Executive Branch \n     nominations because he initiates them, which also means he \n     must take responsibility for them. Eliminating the \n     formalities of the confirmation process which require a \n     nomination by the president undermines that connection \n     between president and nominee the assignment of political \n     responsibility.\n\n\n                            6. The Solution\n\n       We see a simple resolution to our disagreement that \n     accomplishes the goals shared by the Majority, the President, \n     and almost all members of Congress, including ourselves. The \n     amendment cosponsored by five members of the Judiciary \n     Committee would create a new two-year term to begin on or \n     after the day that Director Mueller's current term expires. \n     After this one-time two-year term concludes, the FBI \n     directorship would return to the previous statutory ten-year \n     term, and Director Mueller would not be eligible to serve \n     beyond the new two-year term. The President may nominate \n     Director Mueller to this two-year term or whomever else he \n     chooses. We are committed to expediting Senate confirmation \n     of Director Mueller's nomination and ensuring there is no gap \n     in service at the top of the FBI. We are willing to waive a \n     confirmation hearing for Director Mueller and also the \n     Committee questionnaire. And, we will do what we can to \n     ensure a speedy vote by the full Senate. To our knowledge, no \n     one has raised any constitutional objections that could call \n     into question Director Mueller's authority if our alternative \n     is followed, and the experts we have consulted unanimously \n     agree that there is no constitutional difficulty. As former \n     Deputy Attorney General James Comey testified regarding the \n     constitutionality of extending Mueller's tenure, ``If you can \n     do it in a way that makes it bulletproof, especially against \n     the kind of litigation that you've spoken of, that would be \n     better.''\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       We do not assert that S. 1103 is clearly unconstitutional. \n     We assert that its constitutionality has been called into \n     question by respected experts and could expose Director \n     Mueller's authority to dangerous litigation. We further \n     assert that we have a duty to enact a constitutionally \n     airtight alternative that would achieve the same goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4070-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4070-S4071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE PEKIN NOODLE PARLOR\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a Butte \ninstitution. The Pekin Noodle Parlor has served generations of \nMontanans from all walks of life. My good friends, Danny and Sharon \nTam, and their family have run the parlor for an astounding 100 years. \nFor generations, the parlor has been a centerpiece of Chinatown and an \nevolving Butte community. The restaurant specializes in Chinese and \nAmerican fare, and the lower level has housed a wide array of \nactivities--from Chinese social organizations to herbal medicine. I \nalso want to recognize the Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives for their \nunparalleled work collecting and preserving the treasured history of \nButte-Silver Bow. In particular, their efforts to protect the cherished \nnarrative of the Pekin Noodle Parlor will be recognized for years to \ncome. I ask that their commemoration of the Pekin Noodle Parlor below \nbe printed in the Record.\n  One hundred years ago, Hum Yow opened his Pekin Noodle Parlor on the \nsecond floor of the building at 115/117/119 South Main. The \nrestaurant's offerings of local favorites, Yatcamein--wet\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\nnoodles--and chop suey, were eaten by miners, the ``after-theater'' \ncrowd, and prominent citizens alike. It always catered to non-Chinese \nclientele, many of whom in the early days were curious to get a glimpse \nof Chinatown. Over time, the noodle parlor came to incorporate a good \ncomplement of American food on its menu, while retaining its Chinese \nfood specialties. Among the attractions were the narrow, beadboard \nbooths which allowed semiprivate dining. A seating arrangement that is \nmaintained to this day by Hum Yow's nephew, Ding Tam, who is also known \nas Danny Wong.\n  While the restaurant business continued upstairs, items from previous \nestablishments were stored below. This rare collection of artifacts, \nsome dating as early as the 1910s, narrates the position of the Hum/Tam \nfamily in Butte and among Chinese communities in the western United \nStates and China. Butte-Silver Bow Public Archives presents in the \nexhibit, One Family-One Hundred Years, a story of family commitment, \nrather than an emphasis on Chinese illegal drugs and prostitution. \nDisplays provide insight into Chinese social organizations, gambling, \nherbal medicine, and the continuing Chinese influence in Butte, MT, by \nthe Pekin Noodle Parlor.\n  The information follows:\n\n                       A Look Inside the Exhibit\n\n       The Tam family's roots in Montana extend to the 1860s, \n     almost 50 years before the opening of the Pekin Noodle \n     Parlor. Although his name has been forgotten, the first \n     family member to come to the U.S. delivered supplies to the \n     Chinese camps and communities at various places in the \n     American West. Butte was among those camps. By the late \n     1890s, his son came to Butte, where he and others ran a \n     laundry on South Arizona Street for many years. The Quong \n     Fong Laundry was a staple on Arizona well into the mid-1950s \n     even after the Tam family member had returned to China.\n       The next generation of family immigrants gained \n     considerable prominence in Chinatown and the community of \n     Butte at large. Hum Yow and Tam Kwong Yee, close relatives \n     from the same district near Canton, China, forged a \n     successful alliance that spanned most of the first half of \n     the twentieth century. After erecting a building at the east \n     edge of Chinatown at 115/117/119 South Main, Hum Yow & Co. \n     established a Chinese mercantile there, to at least the late \n     1910s. By 1914, a Sanborn map shows Hum Yow's noodle parlor \n     on the second floor, while Tam Kwong Yee managed a club room \n     on the first floor facing onto China Alley.\n       The inhabitants of Butte's Chinatown formed social clubs \n     that were similar to other fraternal organizations of that \n     time. The purpose of these organizations, according to their \n     articles of incorporation, was to provide for ``. . . mutual \n     helpfulness, mental and moral improvement, mental recreation \n     . . .'' and so on. Artifacts from three known Chinese clubs \n     were found in the basement of the Pekin. Along with the \n     clubs' signs, such items as membership rosters, instruments, \n     maps and photos tell part of the story of these long-gone \n     associations.\n       In the new country, where the Chinese population was \n     predominantly single men who knew little English, gambling \n     was not only a tradition that continued but also became a \n     major form of recreation during social gatherings. As \n     gambling drew in other ethnic groups to Chinatown, the \n     gambling parlors eventually gained entrances on Main Street \n     proper. On the face of the Pekin building, it was in the form \n     of a ``cigar store'' called the London Company at 119 South \n     Main. Hum's Pekin Noodle Parlor and Tam's London Company \n     gambling hall were staples of Butte's Chinatown until \n     gambling was closed across Montana in 1952.\n       Unlike many of his countrymen in Butte, Hum Yow married \n     while in the U.S. His wife, Sui (Bessie) Wong, was born and \n     raised in San Francisco. Shortly after marrying in 1915, the \n     Hums began their family, raising their three children in the \n     Pekin building. Tam Kwong Yee, on the other hand, had left \n     his wife and children behind in China but remained close to \n     them, providing financially for both basic needs and advanced \n     education.\n       As a model of his family values, Tam had been trained as an \n     herbal doctor in China before emigrating to the U.S. It was \n     many years, however, before he had the opportunity to \n     practice his trade in Butte. There were several Chinese \n     herbal doctors in Butte over the years. The most well-known \n     of those from the early twentieth century was Huie Pock, who \n     had his business in the next block of South Main from the \n     Pekin. Several years after Huie's death in 1927, Tam acquired \n     his collection of Chinese herbs.\n       By 1942, Tam opened his business, ``Joe Tom's Herbs,'' on \n     the first floor of the Pekin Noodle Parlor building (at the \n     115 South Main address). The business name suggests that Tam \n     specialized in dispensing herbs rather than diagnoses. His \n     on-site advertising, however, promoted ``free consultation'' \n     as well.\n       In 1947, Tam's grandson, Ding Tam joined the older man in \n     Butte. Just as thousands of Chinese immigrants before him, \n     Ding came to the U.S. to make money to support his family \n     back home. He quickly became known by the more Americanized \n     name of Danny Wong, the last name taken from Bessie Wong's \n     family. Several years later he took over the Pekin Noodle \n     Parlor while his grandfather continued working as a Chinese \n     herbal doctor. Danny married Sharon Chu on August 9, 1963, \n     and raised five children in Butte, passing down the Tam \n     family's appreciation for higher education, commitment to \n     hard work, and business savvy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4071-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MARYLAND LEGAL AID\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the Legal Aid Bureau in Baltimore, MD. Legal Aid was \nfounded in 1911 in Baltimore to provide legal representation for the \npoor. In 1929, Baltimore attorneys H. Hamilton Hackney and John A. \nO'Shea took over leadership of Legal Aid. Mr. Hackney believed that \njustice should not be a matter of charity. He believed that people \nshould be secure in the knowledge ``that their poverty does not \nnecessarily mean that they will be in a position of inequality before \nthe law.'' As a result of Hackney and O'Shea's efforts, Legal Aid \nevolved from a charity organization to an independent, private, \nnonprofit corporation.\n  During the Great Depression, Legal Aid's poverty practice mushroomed. \nBy 1932, it was serving 3,200 clients a year. In 1941, the staff \nconsisted of five lawyers. In 1949, the caseload had grown to 7,000 a \nyear and Legal Aid helped its 100,000th client. In 1953, Baltimore City \nbuilt its new People's Court Building at Fallsway and Gay streets, with \nthe third floor dedicated to Legal Aid's use.\n  The 1960s were a period of change. In 1964, Congress passed the \nEconomic Opportunities Act and launched the war on poverty, funneling \nfunds for legal services to the Nation's cities. In 1971, Legal Aid \nestablished three offices outside of Baltimore and later in the decade, \nacross the State.\n  In 1974, one of President Nixon's last acts in office was to sign \ninto law the National Legal Services Corporation Act; the next year the \nLegal Services Corporation, LSC, was established, and legal services \norganizations across the country continued a rapid expansion. Starting \nin the late 1970s, Legal Aid began to champion the cause of migrant \nfarm workers, sued the steel industry to eliminate practices that \nprevented women and minorities from getting higher paying jobs, and \ntargeted the cause of mentally disabled people.\n  In the 1980s, President Reagan sought to eliminate LSC, submitting \nseven straight budgets without an appropriation for the corporation. \nWhile some of the funding was restored by a sympathetic Congress, Legal \nAid lost $1.2 million in funding in 1982, forcing staffing cuts in most \noffices. In response to the cuts, under my leadership, the Maryland \nGeneral Assembly established the Maryland Legal Services Corporation \nand provided funding through the Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts, \nIOLTA, Program to provide additional funding to Legal Aid and other \nlegal services programs representing the poor.\n  Under the leadership of Wilhelm H. Joseph, Jr., who took the helm in \n1996, Legal Aid has grown to be one of the Nation's largest and most \nrespected legal services organizations. Today, there are more than 250 \nstaff members in 13 offices statewide. Last year, more than 60,000 \npeople from across the State were served, including residents of \nsubsidized and public housing, the elderly, migrant farm workers, and \nneglected and abused children.\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Legal Aid for \nits outstanding achievements and service to the people of Maryland over \nthe past 100 years, reminding us of the importance of the words \ninscribed over the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court, ``Equal Justice \nfor All.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4071-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4071-S4072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM A. HAWKINS\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I honor and pay tribute to \na true leader from my home state of Minnesota, William A. Hawkins. Bill \nmost recently retired with distinction as the chairman and CEO of \nMedtronic, the world's leading medical technology company. He is an \nindividual whose life personifies the Medtronic Mission Statement.\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\n  The Medtronic mission, in part, states, ``To contribute to human \nwelfare by application of biomedical engineering in the research, \ndesign, manufacture, and sale of instruments or appliances that \nalleviate pain, restore health, and extend life.''\n  Not every CEO gets the privilege to lead a company that makes \nlifesaving products, but for Bill the Medtronic mission is very \npersonal and is a source of encouragement for his distinguished career. \nSeveral members of his own family received medical technology products \ndeveloped and manufactured by the very company he has led. In 2008 when \nhe was made chairman, he recalled the personal feeling he experienced \nduring an assembly for employees. Included in the audience were the \nfamily members who had received coronary stents, a heart valve and a \npacemaker, and a deep brain stimulator to control tremors caused by a \nWorld War II injury.\n  I have most especially appreciated Bill Hawkins in my role as chair \nof the Subcommittee on Competitiveness, Innovation, and Export \nPromotion, where my focus has been creating an innovation agenda that \ncan help grow our economy and create jobs in America. Bill has a true \npassion for advancing innovation to make the world healthier and has \nbeen a major influence on all of Medtronic's innovation-related \npolicies. I could not have asked for a more inspired or committed \npartner with which to work during the last few years.\n  Bill has nearly 35 years of career experience in the medical device \nindustry, serving in leadership positions at Novoste Corporation, \nAmerican Home Products, Johnson & Johnson, Guidant Corporation, and Eli \nLilly. He began his medical technology career with Carolina Medical \nElectronics in 1977.\n  He joined Medtronic in 2002 as senior vice president and president of \nthe company's vascular business before serving as corporate president \nand chief operating officer. Bill Hawkins was named chief executive \nofficer of Medtronic in 2007 and assumed the additional role of \nchairman in 2008. Under his guidance, Medtronic's capacity to serve \npatients extended further to provide an array of diagnostic, \npreventive, and chronic disease management solutions. During his decade \nof service and leadership, the company launched many important new \ntechnologies, made major investments in quality and innovation, and \nsuccessfully navigated through an increasingly challenging environment. \nI have been pleased to work with Bill on health care and FDA reform and \na host of matters that have ensured improved patient access to advanced \nmedical technology.\n  In March of 2010 Bill received the Biomedical Engineering Society's \nDistinguished Achievement Award. This award is given to recognize those \nwho have made great contributions to the field of biomedical \nengineering/bioengineering.\n  Bill serves on the board of visitors for the Duke University School \nof Engineering and the board of directors for the Guthrie Theater and \nthe University of Minnesota Foundation.\n  I know that my colleagues join me, his friends, family, and \ncolleagues in commending Bill Hawkins on his numerous accomplishments \nand wishing him well as he begins a new phase of his career.\n  Congratulations, Bill Hawkins.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4072-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ARMOUR, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to improve Indian education, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Native \nculture, language, and access for success in schools bill, Native \nCLASS.\n  As a former educator, I understand the critical role of education, \nnot just to the life of a young person, but also to the future of a \nculture and a community. For too long, the Native people of this \ncountry have lived with a substandard education system that lacks \ncultural relevance and is burdened with administrative challenges and \nsevere underfunding.\n  Three major reports by the Federal Government on Native education \nsince 1928 have demonstrated little, if any, improvement in the \neducation of Native people in the past 80 years. This ailing system has \nresulted in some of the worst education outcomes in the country. On \naverage, in the States with the highest Native populations, the \ngraduation rates for Native students are lower than the graduation \nrates for all other racial/ethnic groups, hovering well below 50 \npercent. We can no longer tolerate this, especially because our Federal \nGovernment has a unique trust\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\nobligation to provide a quality education to its Native people.\n  Native languages and cultures are the roots of all Native peoples, \nand to oki, to cut those roots is to inherently harm the Native \npeoples. The comprehensive legislation I am introducing today puts \nforward a new vision of Native education, one that is grounded in \nculture, language, and local community control. The bill provides for \nmany new access opportunities for tribes to be partners in their own \neducation systems and paves the way for innovative language and \nculture-based instruction programs. Additionally, it provides much \nstronger accountability by agencies to native communities for the \nadministration of their children's education. The provisions of this \nbill are the result of consultation and input with a wide range of \nAmerican Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian stakeholders.\n  The introduction of this bill is only the beginning of a dialogue \nabout this new vision of Native education. We will continue to work \nwith our Native stakeholders to improve this bill and ensure that it \nbuilds strong roots and meets the unique needs of all our native \nstudents.\n  I thank Mr. Johnson and Mr. Inouye for sponsoring this bill. I urge \nmy other colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to encourage, enhance, and integrate Silver Alert \nplans throughout the United States and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Manchin to \nintroduce the Silver Alert Act of 2011. This legislation increases the \nchances of quickly locating missing senior citizens by establishing a \nnational communications network to help regional and local search \nefforts.\n  Every year, thousands of adults go missing from their homes or care \nfacilities due to diminished mental capacity, dementia, Alzheimer's \ndisease, or other circumstances. As the population of the United States \nages, that number is likely to increase. Over five million Americans \ncurrently suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and it is estimated that 60 \npercent of these men and women are likely to wander away from their \nhomes. Disorientation and confusion may keep many from finding their \nway back home. The safe return of missing persons often depends upon \nthem being found quickly. If not found within 24 hours, roughly half \nrisk serious illness, injury, or death. Only four percent of those \nAlzheimer's sufferers who leave home are able to get back without some \nassistance.\n  Our bill would create a national program to coordinate existing \nstate-based Silver Alert plans so that missing seniors can be returned \nsafely to their homes and families. Not only will a federal network \nincrease the success of efforts to find missing seniors, but it also \neliminates duplicative search efforts, saving the public time and \nmoney. The Silver Alert Act creates this needed Federal network.\n  The Amber Alert system, which the Silver Alert Act is modeled after, \nhas a track record of success. The Amber Alert Act created a similar \nFederal program that filters information and transmits relevant details \nto the appropriate authorities as quickly as possible. Just as with \nmissing and abducted children, timely notification and dissemination of \nappropriate information about missing seniors greatly improves the \nchances that they will be found before they are seriously harmed. \nSilver Alert plans use the same infrastructure as Amber Alert plans, so \nthis Act enables us to protect another vulnerable group in our \npopulation, at very little additional cost.\n  Over half of States have responded to the problem of missing seniors \nby establishing Silver Alert plans. These plans have created public \nnotification systems triggered by the report of a missing senior. \nPostings on highways, radio, television, and other forms of media \nbroadcast information about the missing senior to locate him or her, \nand return the senior safely home.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Leahy, \n        and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1264. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \npermit facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs to be \ndesignated as voter registration agencies, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, together with \nSenator Kerry, the Veteran Voting Support Act of 2011. We are joined by \nSenators Reid, Leahy, and Durbin.\n  This bill would take important steps to improve veterans' access to \nvoter registration services. Our veterans have served our Nation at \ngreat risk and sacrifice. I believe we should do everything in our \npower to ensure that they play a central role in our democratic \nprocess, that their votes are cast and their voices heard.\n  Almost 4 years ago, during the previous administration, I learned \nthat a Department of Veterans Affairs facility in California had been \nbarring voter registration groups from accessing veterans in the \nfacility. Similar reports emerged in Connecticut and other parts of the \ncountry.\n  Since that time, Senator Kerry and I have been working, together with \nour cosponsors, to make sure that our Government works to provide \nveterans with voter registration services, not to prevent them from \nreceiving election-related materials.\n  We have written letters and our staffs have held meetings with the VA \nto establish a fair, nonpartisan policy to facilitate voter \nregistration for veterans who receive services from VA facilities.\n  We have made significant progress.\n  After much negotiation, in 2008, the VA established a new and \nsubstantially improved policy that allows state and local election \nofficials, as well as nonpartisan groups, to access VA facilities for \nvoter registration under terms and conditions set by the facility. This \nis an improvement, and we have not heard serious complaints in recent \nyears.\n  However, legislation remains necessary. First, this voluntary policy \ncould be rescinded or rolled back in the future; Federal law cannot. \nSecond, more should be done to ensure not only that outside groups can \nregister voters in a nonpartisan manner in VA facilities but also that \nveterans who live in and use these facilities have easy access to voter \nregistration and absentee ballot forms, even when no group or official \ncomes by.\n  The Veteran Voting Support Act of 2011 would require the VA to \nprovide voter registration forms to veterans when they enroll in the VA \nhealth care system, or change their status or address in that system.\n  The bill would also ensure that veterans who live in VA facilities \nhave access to absentee ballots when they want to cast votes, and that \nVA employees assist veterans with election-related forms if necessary, \nin the same way that these employees assist veterans with other forms.\n  It would allow nonpartisan voter groups and election officials to \nprovide voter information and registration services to veterans in a \ntime, place, and manner that makes sense for the facilities.\n  It would give the Attorney General authority to enforce these \nprovisions.\n  It is a cornerstone of our democracy that every eligible citizen is \nable to register and cast their vote. These rights should never be \ndenied, by fiat or as a matter of practicality, to those who have given \nthe very most for our country.\n  I believe it is time that the VA provides veterans with the support \nthey need and deserve to register, cast their votes, and have those \nvotes counted.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Veteran Voting \nSupport Act of 2011.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran Voting Support Act \n     of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Veterans have performed a great service to, and risked \n     the greatest sacrifice in the name of, our country, and \n     should be supported by the people and the Government of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Veterans are especially qualified to understand issues \n     of war, foreign policy, and government support for veterans, \n     and they should have the opportunity to voice that \n     understanding through voting.\n       (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs should assist \n     veterans to register to vote and to vote.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nGovernment by providing for greater interagency experience among \nnational security and homeland security personnel through the \ndevelopment of a national security and homeland security human capital \nstrategy and interagency rotational service by employees, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleagues \nSenator Collins and Senator Akaka, to introduce legislation to improve \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of our Government by fostering greater \nintegration among the personnel who work on critical national security \nand homeland security missions.\n  The national security and homeland security challenges that our \nnation faces in the 21st century are far more complex than those of the \nlast century. Threats such as terrorism, proliferation of nuclear and \nbiological weapons, insurgencies, and failed states are beyond the \ncapability of any single agency of our Government, such as the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, the Department of State, or the \nintelligence community, to counter on its own.\n  In addition, threats such as terrorism and organized crime know no \nborders and instead cross the so-called ``foreign/domestic divide,'' \nthe bureaucratic, cultural, and legal division between agencies that \nfocus on threats from beyond our borders and those that focus on \nthreats from within.\n  Finally, a new group of government agencies is now involved in \nnational and homeland security. These agencies bring to bear critical \ncapabilities, such as interdicting terrorist finance, enforcing \nsanctions, protecting our critical infrastructure, and helping foreign \ncountries threatened by terrorism to build their economies and legal \nsystems, but many of them have relatively little experience of \ninvolvement with the traditional national security agencies. Some of \nthese agencies have existed for decades or centuries, such as the \nDepartments of Treasury, Justice, and Health and Human Services, HHS, \nwhile others are new since 9/11, such as the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, \nODNI.\n  As a result, our government needs to be able to apply all instruments \nof national power, including military, diplomatic, intelligence, law \nenforcement, foreign aid, homeland security, and public health, in a \nwhole-of-government approach to counter these threats. We only need to \nlook at our government's failure to use the full range of civilian and \nmilitary capabilities to stymie the Iraqi insurgency immediately after \nthe fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003, the government's failure \nto prepare and respond to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the \ngovernment's failure to share information and coordinate action prior \nto the attack at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009, for examples of failure of \ninteragency coordination and their costs in terms of lives, money, and \nthe national interest.\n  The challenge of integrating the agencies of the Executive Branch \ninto a whole-of-government approach has been recognized by \nCongressionally chartered commissions for more than a decade. Prior to \n9/11, the Commission led by former Senators Gary Hart and Warren \nRudman, entitled the U.S. Commission on National Security in the 21st \nCentury, issued reports recommending fundamental reorganization to \nintegrate government capabilities, including for homeland security.\n  In 2004, the 9/11 Commission, led by former Governor Tom Kean and \nformer Representative Lee Hamilton, found that the U.S. Government \nneeded reform in order to foster a stronger, faster, and more efficient \ngovernment-wide effort against terrorism.\n  In 2008, the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Proliferation and Terrorism, led by former Senators Bob \nGraham and Jim Talent, called for improving interagency coordination in \nour Nation's defenses against bioterrorism and other weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Congress has long recognized that a key way to better integrate our \nGovernment's capabilities is to provide strong incentives for personnel \nto do rotational assignments across bureaucratic stovepipes. The \npersonnel who serve in our Government are our Nation's best-and-\nbrightest, and they have and will respond to incentives that we \ninstitute in order to improve coordination across our government.\n  In 1986, Congress enacted the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense \nReorganization Act. That legislation sought to break down stovepipes \nand foster jointness across the military services by requiring that \nmilitary officers have served in a position outside of their service as \na requirement for promotion to general or admiral.\n  Twenty-five years later, this requirement has produced a sea change \nin military officers' mindsets and created a dominant military culture \nof jointness.\n  In 2004, Congress enacted the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act at the 9/11 Commission's recommendation and required a \nsimilar rotational requirement for intelligence personnel. The Director \nof National Intelligence has since instituted rotations across the \nIntelligence Community as an eligibility requirement for promotion to \nsenior intelligence positions, and this requirement is helping to \nintegrate the 16 agencies and elements of the Intelligence Community.\n  Finally, in 2005, Congress enacted the Post-Katrina Emergency \nManagement Reform Act to improve our Nation's preparedness for and \nresponses to domestic catastrophes and instituted a\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\nrotational program within the Department of Homeland Security in order \nto integrate that department.\n  This proven mechanism of rotations must be applied to integrate the \ngovernment as a whole on national security and homeland security \nissues. Indeed, the Hart/Rudman Commission called for rotations to \nother agencies and interagency professional education to be required in \norder for personnel to hold certain positions or be promoted to certain \nlevels. The Graham/Talent Commission called for the Government to \nrecruit the next generation of national security experts by \nestablishing a program of joint duty, education, and training in order \nto create a culture of interagency collaboration, flexibility, and \ninnovation.\n  The Executive Branch has also recognized the need to foster greater \ninteragency rotations and experience in order to improve integration \nacross its agencies. In 2007, President George W. Bush issued Executive \nOrder 13434 concerning national security professional development and \nto include interagency assignments. However, that executive order was \nnot implemented aggressively toward the end of the Bush administration \nand has languished as the Obama administration pursued other \npriorities.\n  Clearly, it is time for Congress to act and to institute the \npersonnel incentives and reforms necessary to further integrate our \ngovernment and enable it to counter the national security and homeland \nsecurity threats of the 21st Century.\n  Today I join with Senator Susan M. Collins and Senator Daniel K. \nAkaka to introduce the bipartisan Interagency Personnel Rotation Act of \n2011. Companion legislation is being introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives on a bipartisan basis by Representative Geoff Davis and \nRepresentative John F. Tierney.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to enable Executive Branch \npersonnel to view national security and homeland security issues from a \nwhole-of-government perspective and be able to capitalize upon \ncommunities of interest composed of personnel from multiple agencies \nwho work on the same national security or homeland security issue.\n  This legislation requires that the Executive Branch identify \n``Interagency Communities of Interest,'' which are subject areas \nspanning multiple agencies and within which the Executive Branch needs \nto operate on a more integrated basis. Interagency Communities of \nInterest could include counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, counter \nproliferation, or regional areas such as the Middle East.\n  This legislation then requires that agencies identify positions that \nare within each Interagency Community of Interest. Government personnel \nwould then rotate to positions within other agencies but within the \nparticular Interagency Community of Interest related to their \nexpertise.\n  Government personnel could also rotate to positions at offices that \nhave specific interagency missions such as the National Security Staff. \nCompleting an interagency rotation would be a prerequisite for \nselection to certain Senior Executive Service positions within that \nInteragency Community of Interest. As a result, personnel would have \nthe incentives to serve in a rotational position and to develop the \nwhole-of-government perspective and the network of contacts necessary \nfor integrating across agencies and accomplishing national security and \nhomeland security missions more efficiently and effectively.\n  Let me offer some examples of how this might work.\n  An employee of the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, \nwho specializes in development strategy could rotate to the Office of \nthe Secretary of Defense to advise DOD in planning on how development \nissues should be taken into account in military operations, while DOD \ncounterinsurgency specialists could rotate to USAID to advise on how \ndevelopment priorities should be assessed in a counterinsurgency.\n  A Treasury employee who does terrorist finance work could benefit \nfrom a rotation to Department of Justice to understand operations to \ntake down terrorist cells and how terrorist finance work can help \nidentify and prosecute their members, while Justice personnel would \nhave the chance to learn from the Treasury's financial expertise in \nunderstanding how sources of funding can affect cells' formation and \nplotting.\n  Someone from HHS who specializes in public health could rotate to a \nDOD counterinsurgency office to advise on improving public health in \norder to win over the hearts and minds of the population prone to \ncounterinsurgency, while someone from DHS could rotate to HHS in order \nto learn about HHS's work to prepare the U.S. public health system for \na biological terrorist attack.\n  The cosponsors of this legislation and I recognize the complexity \ninvolved in the creation of Interagency Communities of Interest, the \ninstitution of rotations across a wide variety of government agencies, \nand having a rotation as a prerequisite for selection to certain Senior \nExecutive Service positions. As a result, our legislation gives the \nExecutive Branch substantial flexibility, including to identify \nInteragency Communities of Interest, to identify which positions in \neach agency are within a particular Interagency Community of Interest; \nto identify which positions in an Interagency Community of Interest \nshould be open for rotation and how long the rotations will be; and \nfinally, which Senior Executive Service positions have interagency \nrotational service as a prerequisite.\n  To be clear, this legislation does not mandate that any agency be \nincluded in an Interagency Community of Interest or the interagency \npersonnel rotations; instead, this legislation permits the Executive \nBranch to include any agency or part of an agency as the Executive \nBranch determines that our nation's national and homeland security \nmissions require.\n  In addition, our legislation gives the Executive Branch 15 years in \nwhich to implement this legislation and contains a substantial number \nof exemptions and waivers, especially during but not limited to the \nphase-in period.\n  The legislation contains a number of provisions designed to protect \nthe rights of our government personnel under existing law.\n  Finally, this legislation is designed to be implemented without \nrequiring any additional personnel for the Executive Branch. The \nlegislation envisions that rotations will be conducted so that there is \na reasonable equivalence between the number of personnel rotating out \nof an agency and the number rotating in. That way, no agency will be \nshort-staffed as a result of having sent its best-and-brightest to do \nrotations; each agency will be receiving the best-and-brightest from \nother agencies.\n  Let me close by answering a common objection to government \nreorganization. To quote the 9/11 Commission, ``An argument against \nchange is that the nation is at war, and cannot afford to reorganize in \nmidstream. But some of the main innovations of the 1940s and 1950s, \nincluding the creation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and even the \nconstruction of the Pentagon itself, were undertaken in the midst of \nwar. Surely the country cannot wait until the struggle against Islamic \nterrorism is over.''\n  I urge my colleagues to take bold action to improve the efficiency \nand effectiveness of our Government in countering 21st century national \nsecurity and homeland security threats by promptly passing the \nInteragency Personnel Rotation Act of 2011.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1269. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to require the Secretary of Education to collect information \nfrom coeducational secondary schools on such schools' athletic \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr President, I rise to introduce the High School Data \nTransparency Act in celebration of the 39th Anniversary of Title IX. I \nam pleased to be joined again this year by my colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray. Since the 108th Congress, we have \nintroduced this bill to require that high schools, like their \ncollegiate counterparts, disclose data on equity in sports, making it \npossible for student athletes and their parents to ensure fairness in \ntheir school's athletic programs.\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n\n  Since my first day in Washington in 1979, I have been a stalwart \nsupporter of Title IX. And there should be no mistake what this 39 \nyear-old landmark civil rights law is all about, equal opportunity for \nboth girls and boys to excel in athletics. Obviously, athletic \nparticipation supports physical health, but sports also impart benefits \nbeyond the field of play.\n  For girls who compete in sports, 50 percent are less likely to suffer \ndepression and breast cancer . . . 80 percent are less likely to have a \ndrug problem . . . and 92 percent are less likely to have an unwanted \npregnancy. Athletic participation helps cultivate the kind of positive, \ncompetitive spirit that develops dedication, self-confidence, a sense \nof team spirit, and ultimate success later in life. So it is not \nsurprising that, according to several studies, more than eight out of \nten successful businesswomen played organized sports while growing up.\n  To cite one example, Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and CEO, Kraft Foods \nwas quoted as saying, ``growing up, I was extremely athletic, and very \ncompetitive. I played four varsity sports in high school and went to \nCornell because they had a fabulous women's athletic program, and the \nacademics weren't bad either.''\n  Without question, Title IX has been the driving factor in allowing \nthousands of women and girls the opportunity to benefit from \nintercollegiate and high school sports. Indeed, prior to Title IX, only \n1 in 27 high school girls, fewer than 300,000, played sports. Today, \nthe number is more than 2.9 million . . . that is an increase of over \n900 percent. Moreover, our country is celebrating the achievements and \nbeing inspired by our female athletes now more than ever.\n  Last fall, the University of California, Berkley celebrated the life \nof the late Jill Costello who served as an inspiration not only to her \nfellow teammates but to the thousands of girls who defy the odds every \nday. Jill participated on Cal's Women's Crew Team as their varsity \ncoxswain despite being diagnosed with stage IV cancer with only nine \nmonths to live. Throughout her treatment she not only supported her \nfriends, family and teammates but was supported by them. Despite \nbattling for her life Jill led Cal to achieve second place at the NCAA \nnational crew championship. Jill's story proves that the incredible \nmystical nature of team and friendship does exist.\n  Earlier this year, the University of Connecticut's Women's Basketball \nTeam furthered displayed women's progress in athletics. These women \nsurpassed the University of California at Los Angeles men's basketball \nrecord of 88 consecutive wins achieving the longest winning streak of \n90 games. The impact of this accomplishment has yet to be fully \nrealized but has surely raised the profile of not only women's \nbasketball but also woman's athletics.\n  Indeed, in my state of Maine, Bowdoin's women's varsity field hockey \nteam has remarkably won Division III national championships in 3 of the \nlast 4 years, putting Bowdoin and Maine on the women's field hockey \nmap.\n  So while we celebrate this remarkable progress, we cannot allow rest \non our laurels. That is why I am so pleased to join with Senator Patty \nMurray, who has been a tireless advocate for women's sports, to \nreintroduce the High School Sports Data Collection Act of 2011.\n  Our bill directs the Commissioner of the National Center for \nEducation Statistics to collect information regarding participation in \nathletics broken down by gender; teams; race and ethnicity; and overall \nexpenditures, including items like travel expenses, equipment and \nuniforms.\n  These data are already reported, in most cases, to the state \nDepartments of Education and should not pose any additional burden on \nthe high schools. Further, to ensure public access to this vital \ninformation, our legislation would require high schools to post the \ndata on the Department of Education's Web site and make this \ninformation available to students and the public upon request.\n  For nearly 40 years, Title IX has opened doors by giving women and \ngirls an equal opportunity to participate in student athletic programs. \nThis bill will continue that tradition by allowing us to assess current \nopportunities for sports participation for young women, and correct any \ndeficiencies.\n  With this new information, we can ensure that young women all over \nthe country have the chance not only to improve their athletic ability, \nbut also to develop the qualities of teamwork, discipline, and self-\nconfidence that lead to success off the playing field. Soccer star, Mia \nHamm, characterized it best when ``somewhere behind the athlete you've \nbecome and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is \na little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back . . \n. play for her,'' and I am introducing this bill today for her as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE:\n  S. 1271. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1968 to provide \na temporary credit for hiring previously unemployed workers; to the \nCommittee on finance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, with the unemployment rate hovering \nabove 9 percent nationwide, and at almost 11 percent in my home State \nof Rhode Island, job creation must continue to be our No. 1 priority as \nlawmakers.\n  It disappoints me that Republicans chose politics over job creation \nyesterday when they filibustered legislation that would have \nreauthorized the Economic Development Administration, an agency \ndedicated to restoring economically distressed regions to prosperity. \nIn the past, this bill has been reauthorized and supported broadly, \nindeed, by unanimous consent. It is the fourth jobs bill the minority \nhas chosen to obstruct, and I hope my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will reconsider their tactics. If not, we may have to \nreconsider ours and force some votes on job creation measures without \nthis litany of irrelevant amendments that have bogged down and \nobstructed the previous jobs bill we have tried to get action on. Out-\nof-work Americans are hurting right now, and they want us to act to \nhelp create jobs.\n  I rise today to introduce a measure that will do just that. I have \nheard from dozens of Rhode Island business owners that business is \npicking up a bit, but they are still concerned the recovery may be \ntemporary and that discourages them from hiring additional workers. I \nspoke with one such small business owner on Monday. I visited Dona \nVincent during a tour of her Cranston, RI company, Tedco. Tedco makes \nand stamps metal components for the automotive, aerospace, and \ncommunications industry. It employed 13 people before the recession \nstruck in 2008. Now it is down to eight employees. Dona and Ted's co-\ngeneral manager Barbara Galonio wishes to start hiring more workers, \nbut they worry that business could slow down again. They told me they \nhave been waiting to hire, wanting to hire, and for months saying to \nthemselves: Well, what if this? What if that? They have been on the \nborder of hiring.\n  The legislation I have introduced today, the Job Creation Tax Credit \nAct of 2011, would give Dona and thousands of other business owners \nnationwide greater security as they look forward to building their \nworkforces. The bill would provide refundable tax credits for employers \nto hire new workers now. The way it would work is that for each \nqualified hire made in 2011, the business would receive a tax credit \nequal to 15 percent of the wages paid to the new employee. If the new \nemployee remains employed or if the business were to hire additional \nemployees in 2012, the business would be eligible for a 10-percent tax \ncredit on those employees' wages next year. Because these tax credits \nwould be refundable, businesses would benefit from them even if they \nare not currently profitable.\n  One of the problems with struggling businesses that are not sure how \nmuch profit they are going to make if they are right on the edge is \ngiving them a tax credit doesn't help because they have no tax against \nwhich to take the credit. A refundable tax credit comes to the business \nin spite of that. The higher credit in 2011 I expect would encourage \nemployers to hire new workers as soon as possible, and the additional \ncredit in 2012 would encourage retaining those employees and additional \nworkforce expansion. To help those Americans who are struggling to find \nwork, qualified hires would be defined as new employees who have been \nunemployed for at least 60 days prior to getting hired.\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\n  The Job Creation Tax Credit Act would continue the job creations \nsparked by the HIRE Act of 2010 which included somewhat different tax \nincentives for new hiring. Economist Mark Zandi has estimated that the \nHIRE Act created 250,000 new jobs, a quarter of a million families with \na paycheck coming in. The larger financial incentives in this new bill \nwould continue to dent the unemployment numbers in Rhode Island and \nnationwide.\n  The previous HIRE Act, sponsored by Senator Schumer and Senator \nHatch, received wide bipartisan support, and I hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle will support the Job Creation Tax Credit Act as \nwell because right now we cannot forget that too many unemployed \nAmericans are hurting. Too many are out of work. Too many are out of \nwork through no fault of their own. Indeed, too many of them are still \nout of work because of the cascade of misery that washed across this \ncountry from the Wall Street meltdown. There may be a lot of blame to \ngo around on that, but none of it attaches to the workers who got \ncaught in that cascade of misery. Of course, too many families are \nstruggling to make ends meet week to week. We must continue fighting \nfor them by using every tool at our disposal, including these new tax \nincentives, to get our economy moving and to help businesses start \nhiring.\n  Again, this is a bill with a proven successful strategy, that has \nbeen approved by this body in the past, that has had bipartisan support \nin the past, and that addresses the most important issue facing our \ncountry right now, and that is putting people back to work, rekindling \nour economy, and getting folks into jobs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1272. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nsubmit to Congress a report on the feasibility and advisability of \nestablishing of a polytrauma rehabilitation center or polytrauma \nnetwork site of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the southern New \nMexico and El Paso, Texas, region, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, last fall I led a discussion \nwith NM Veterans Secretary John Garcia on post-traumatic stress \ndisorder or PTSD and other issues facing our veterans. We held our \ndiscussion near Silver City, New Mexico, at the historic Fort Bayard \nmedical facility. This was an outstanding chance to hear firsthand from \nveterans about the medical problems they were facing.\n  During this meeting, I found out that one of the biggest challenges \nthat many veterans in southern New Mexico face is finding nearby \ntreatment for PTSD and traumatic brain injury which are called the \nsignature wounds of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  A bit of background for those who may not be familiar with my home \nState. Southern New Mexico is home to White Sands Missile Range, \nHolloman Air Force Base, and most of Fort. Bliss. It is a region filled \nwith active duty personnel, as well as many veterans who choose to stay \nin New Mexico and the El Paso region after finishing their active duty \nservice. And as more and more veterans return from Afghanistan and Iraq \nsuffering from PTSD and traumatic brain injury, many need the services \nof polytrauma centers--which specialize in treating injuries like PTSD \nand TBI.\n  Unfortunately, the closest polytrauma centers to southern New Mexico \nare hundreds of miles away.\n  That is why, after hearing the stories of veterans who attended our \nFort Bayard meeting, I began working on legislation to help improve the \nability for them to access care in the region.\n  With this legislation we hope to address that issue by requiring the \nVeterans Administration to submit to Congress a study on the \nfeasibility of building a polytrauma center in the region. And we want \nthem to consider Fort Bayard specifically as a location for that new \npolytrauma center.\n  The facilities at Fort Bayard should not be wasted and could be put \nto good use by the Veterans Administration for a polytrauma center for \nthe southern New Mexico/El Paso region. This plan would be a win-win \nfor the region--it would provide veterans with much-needed, convenient \naccess to a quality polytrauma center through the innovative use of a \nfacility that is currently being underutilized.\n  Veterans who have risked their lives for our country deserve \nconvenient access to the best of care when they return home. Because as \nlong as America faces threats and values freedom, we will need men and \nwomen willing to protect us. And as long as Americans serve in uniform, \nwe have a sacred responsibility to support them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1275. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto remove social security account numbers from Medicare identification \ncards and communications provided to Medicare beneficiaries in order to \nprotect Medicare beneficiaries from identity theft; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Kohl to remove Social Security numbers, \nSSNs, from Medicare identification cards.\n  Today, many of the 45 million Medicare beneficiaries in the United \nStates carry their Medicare cards in their wallets. The card displays \nan individual's Medicare identification number, which is their Social \nSecurity number with a 1- or 2-digit code at the end.\n  The use of Social Security numbers on Medicare cards places millions \nof seniors at risk of identity theft because if the card is lost or \nstolen, their Social Security number is easily obtained. A person's \nSocial Security number is one of the most valuable pieces of \ninformation that a thief can steal. It can unlock a treasure trove of \npersonal and financial information.\n  Last year, nearly 8.1 million Americans were victims of identity \ntheft, many after their Social Security numbers were stolen. These \ncrimes accounted for more than $37 billion in fraudulent charges.\n  Recognizing this risk of identity theft, many government agencies and \nprivate businesses have stopped displaying Social Security numbers on \nidentification cards. Thirty-three states have enacted laws that limit \nhow public and private entities use and display Social Security \nnumbers. Social Security numbers are being removed from driver's \nlicenses, and most private health insurance cards no longer display \nthem.\n  Federal agencies have also taken steps to reduce the threat of \nidentity theft. The Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of \nDefense are no longer displaying Social Security numbers on new \nidentification cards. In addition, the Office of Personnel Management \nhas directed health insurers participating in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Program to eliminate Social Security numbers from \ninsurance cards.\n  Unfortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nis lagging behind other agencies.\n  In 2005, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 2006 Labor-HHS-\nEducation appropriations bill to require CMS to remove SSNs from \nMedicare cards. My amendment passed 98-0. The final bill directed CMS \nto provide Congress a report on steps necessary to remove the numbers.\n  CMS issued the report in 2006, but it has not yet begun to remove \nSocial Security numbers from Medicare cards.\n  In 2008, the Inspector General of the Social Security Administration \ntook CMS to task for its inaction. The Inspector General's report \nconfirmed that displaying Social Security numbers on Medicare cards \nplaces millions of people at risk for identity theft and concluded that \n``immediate action is needed to address this significant \nvulnerability.''\n  The bill that I am introducing today, the Social Security Number \nProtection Act of 2011, establishes a reasonable timetable for CMS to \nbegin removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards.\n  Not later than 3 years after enactment, CMS would be prohibited from \ndisplaying Social Security numbers on newly issued Medicare cards. CMS \nwould be prohibited from displaying the number on existing cards no \nlater than 5 years after enactment.\n  In addition to Medicare cards, the bill would prohibit CMS from \ndisplaying Social Security numbers on all written and electronic \ncommunications to Medicare beneficiaries, beginning no\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\nlater than 3 years after enactment, except in cases where their display \nis essential for the operation of the Medicare program.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work \nwith me to enact it. Removing Social Security numbers from Medicare \ncards and communications to beneficiaries is long overdue.\n  Medicare beneficiaries should not be placed at greater risk of \nidentity theft than people with private health insurance. Other Federal \nagencies have successfully removed Social Security numbers from \nidentification cards, and we should require CMS to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe excise tax on indoor tanning services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as former Chair and now Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Small Business Committee, it is my privilege and my \nresponsibility today to stand up for small businesses across America \nthat are being unfairly hurt by a punitive and unnecessary tax. The so-\ncalled ``tanning tax'' was included at the eleventh hour as part of \nlast year's health care legislative maneuvering, and I am pleased to \noffer this legislation to repeal the tanning tax.\n  The tanning tax was added to the health care bill without any \nanalysis of how it would affect this industry comprised primarily of \nsmall businesses, 75 percent of whose employees and customers are \nwomen. I cannot reiterate enough that small businesses are the primary \njob creators in this country, responsible for more than two-thirds of \nall new jobs created. At a time when a staggering and seemingly \nintractable unemployment rate of over 9 percent has become the norm, \nwhen some 22 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed, when we \nare experiencing the longest period of long-term unemployment in \nAmerican history since data collection started in 1948, surpassing even \nthe 1982 double-dip recession for the length of unemployment, when the \npercentage of population that is employed has declined to 58.4 percent, \nthe lowest level in nearly 30 years, how could anyone think that \nshuttering or slowing the growth of small businesses is a good idea?\n  Reports show that small businesses lost an estimated $2 trillion in \nprofits and asset valuation since the recession started in December \n2007, while larger companies have been less affected and are recovering \nmore quickly. Combined with the current, on-going economic malaise, the \ntanning tax is certain to accelerate job losses in this industry beyond \nthe 20,000 jobs already lost nationwide. These small businesses need \nour help, not a further hindrance such as this tax.\n  I have heard first-hand of just what a job-killing, growth-preventing \nmeasure this tax is. Sun Tan City, a chain of small business tanning \nsalons based in Augusta, ME, with 125 employees in Maine and another 50 \nin New Hampshire have slowed dramatically the expansion of their \nbusiness. They opened 7 new salons in 2009 but only 4 in 2010 and \nanother 2 in 2011. Sun Tan City remitted $85,000 to the IRS just this \npast quarter, money that would have gone to grow jobs and their \nbusiness.\n  The tanning tax is not just about the money, it is also about the \nburden of compliance. Each store must collect and remit its tanning tax \nliability individually, increasing the paperwork and compliance burden. \nAt an estimated cost of $74 per hour spent complying with paperwork \nburdens, merely remitting the tax imposes yet another enormous burden \non small businesses.\n  Moreover, the tanning tax is imposed in addition to any state tax \nlevies. For instance, New Jersey imposes a 7 percent tax on tanning \nservices, meaning tanning salons in New Jersey are now responsible for \n17 percent in taxes just for this service. We are already hearing that \nthose seeking tanning services are going to other States when possible \nin order to avoid the higher New Jersey and Federal combined taxes. I \nguess that is one way to improve interstate commerce.\n  The worst part of the provision, though, may be the way the IRS has \ninterpreted its implementation, in a way that favors larger businesses \nover smaller ones. The IRS released its tanning tax-implementing \nguidance on June 15, 2010, just two weeks before the tax became \neffective. This guidance contained a gross inequity that will subject \nsome businesses to the tanning tax while exempting others. The guidance \nexempts ``qualified physical fitness facilities,'' which include gyms. \nThat is, a person could pay for a membership at such a facility and be \nable to use that facility's tanning beds without having to pay the tax. \nThus, the tax is having a disproportionate effect on small businesses \nwhile allowing larger, syndicated gyms and similar facilities to go \nuntaxed.\n  There are legitimate concerns about the health of those who engage in \ntanning, whether using natural sunlight or tanning beds. I do not come \nbefore you today to argue the science. But the Food and Drug \nAdministration has been under pressure for years to ban outright the \nuse of tanning beds and repeatedly has declined to do so. The 10 \npercent tanning tax was never designed as a deterrent; it was designed \nsolely to replace the 5 percent tax on Botox injections and elective \ncosmetic surgery as a revenue raiser to pay for the health care bill. \nNo other factor was discussed, nor were there ever hearings on the \nmerits. I am as concerned as any Senator or citizen about the health of \nour fellow Americans, but a dead-of-night job-killing tax increase on \nsmall businesses is not the way to address any health concerns!\n  There are other ways, such as an education campaign, that would be \nfar\n\n[[Page S4103]]\n\nmore effective and less cumbersome than this 10 percent tax to inform \npeople about any tanning risks, especially when the IRS has carved out \nbig businesses from being affected by the tax. Why is it safe to tan in \ngyms but not in salons? That is not a question the IRS should be \nanswering. If the health issue is important enough to merit scrutiny of \nthe industry, then let us have that debate, but the fact that there was \nno debate before this onerous tax was imposed makes it doubly \noutrageous.\n  This bill is supported by the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses and by the Indoor Tanning Association, which is comprised of \nbusiness owners and operators, as well as manufacturers and \ndistributors of tanning equipment. The tanning tax was a painful hit to \nthis sector of our economy and this bill will seek in some way to \nrectify what was done to them by eliminating the onerous tax going \nforward.\n  Finally, I want to thank Glen and Dennis Guerrette, whose father, \nWill, served in the Maine state legislature, and Lewis Henry, all from \nMaine, for bringing this issue and their stories to my attention. I \nwould also like to thank Congressmen Michael Grimm and Pat Tiberi and \nmany others for their leadership in the House on this crucial issue.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport our bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1278\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of \nmusic education in a child's educational journey. As a former music \nstudent myself, I believe every student should have access to this \nvaluable area of study.\n  Three quarters of Americans have been involved in a music program \nduring their time in school. Over half of those participants continue \ntheir involvement with music after the 12th grade. This is a testament \nto the positive impact of music education and why we must continue to \nprovide our students with opportunities to pursue these programs.\n  Music education also provides students with the opportunity to \nexpress creativity and to develop skills that will benefit them \nthroughout the rest of their lives. In addition to its inherent \ncultural value, music education provides a variety of unique avenues \nfor intellectual growth. We also know that musical training has a \nprofound impact on other skills including speech and language, memory \nand attention, and even the ability to convey emotions vocally.\n  I believe music and other arts are among society's most compelling \nand effective pathways for offering our children rich and fulfilling \neducational experiences.

Res. 215\n\n       Whereas congenital Cytomegalovirus (referred to in this \n     preamble as ``CMV'') is the most common congenital infection \n     in the United States with 1 in 150 children born with \n     congenital CMV;\n       Whereas congenital CMV is the most common cause of birth \n     defects and childhood disabilities in the United States;\n       Whereas congenital CMV is preventable with behavioral \n     interventions such as practicing frequent hand washing with \n     soap and water after contact with diapers or oral secretions, \n     not kissing young children on the mouth, and not sharing \n     food, towels, or utensils with young children;\n       Whereas CMV is found in bodily fluids, including urine, \n     saliva, blood, mucus, and tears;\n       Whereas congenital CMV can be diagnosed if the virus is \n     found in urine, saliva, blood, or other body tissues of an \n     infant during the first week after birth;\n       Whereas CMV infection is more common than the combined \n     metabolic or endocrine disorders currently in the United \n     States core newborn screening panel;\n       Whereas most people are not aware of their CMV infection \n     status, with pregnant women being 1 of the highest risk \n     groups;\n       Whereas the American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention recommend that OB/GYNs counsel women on basic \n     prevention measures to guard against CMV infection;\n       Whereas in 1999, the Institute of Medicine stated that \n     development of a CMV vaccine was the highest priority for new \n     vaccines;\n       Whereas the incidence of children born with congenital CMV \n     can be greatly reduced with public education and awareness; \n     and\n       Whereas a comprehensive understanding of CMV provides \n     opportunities to improve the health and well-being of our \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of June 2011 as ``National \n     Cytomegalovirus Awareness Month'' in order to raise awareness \n     of the dangers of Cytomegalovirus (``CMV'') and reduce the \n     occurrence of congenital CMV infection; and\n       (2) recommends that more effort be taken to counsel women \n     of childbearing age of the effect this virus can have on \n     their children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4103-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4103-S4104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 216--ENCOURAGING WOMEN'S POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN \n                              SAUDI ARABIA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. DeMINT) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 24\n\n       Whereas the 75th anniversary of the dedication of \n     Shenandoah National Park corresponds with the Civil War \n     sesquicentennial, enriching the heritage of both the \n     Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States;\n       Whereas in the early to mid-1920s, as a result of the \n     efforts of the citizen-driven Shenandoah Valley, Inc. and the \n     Shenandoah National Park Association, the congressionally \n     appointed Southern Appalachian National Park Committee \n     recommended that Congress authorize the establishment of a \n     national park in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia for the \n     purpose of providing the western national park experience to \n     the populated eastern seaboard;\n       Whereas, in 1935, the Secretary of the Interior, Harold \n     Ickes, accepted the land deeds for what would become \n     Shenandoah National Park from the Commonwealth of Virginia, \n     and, on July 3, 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     dedicated Shenandoah National Park ``to this and to \n     succeeding generations for the recreation and re-creation \n     they would find'';\n       Whereas the Appalachian Mountains extend through 200,000 \n     acres of Shenandoah National Park and border the 8 Virginia \n     counties of Albemarle, Augusta, Greene, Madison, Page, \n     Rappahannock, Rockingham, and Warren;\n       Whereas Shenandoah National Park is home to a diverse \n     ecosystem of 103 rare and endangered species, 1,405 plant \n     species, 51 mammal species, 36 fish species, 26 reptile \n     species, 23 amphibian species, and more than 200 bird \n     species;\n       Whereas the proximity of Shenandoah National Park to \n     heavily populated areas, including Washington, District of \n     Columbia, promotes regional travel and tourism, providing \n     thousands of jobs and contributing millions of dollars to the \n     economic vitality of the region;\n       Whereas Shenandoah National Park, rich with recreational \n     opportunities, offers 520 miles of hiking trails, 200 miles \n     of which are designated horse trails and 101 miles of which \n     are part of the 2,175-mile Appalachian National Historic \n     Trail, more than 90 fishable streams, 4 campgrounds, 7 picnic \n     areas, 3 lodges, 6 backcountry cabins, and an extensive, \n     rugged backcountry open to wilderness camping to the millions \n     of people who annually visit the Park;\n       Whereas the Park protects significant cultural resources, \n     including--\n       (1) Rapidan Camp, once a summer retreat for President \n     Herbert Hoover and now a national historic landmark;\n       (2) Skyline Drive, a historic district listed on the \n     National Register of Historic Places;\n       (3) Massanutten Lodge, a structure listed on the National \n     Register of Historic Places;\n       (4) 360 buildings and structures included on the List of \n     Classified Structures;\n       (5) 577 significant, recorded archeological sites, 11 of \n     which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places; \n     and\n       (6) more than 100 historic cemeteries;\n       Whereas Congress named 10 battlefields in the Shenandoah \n     Valley for preservation in the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields \n     National Historic District and Commission Act of 1996 \n     (section 606 of Public Law 104-333; 110 Stat. 4174), and \n     Shenandoah National Park, an integral partner in that \n     endeavor, provides visitors with outstanding views of \n     pristine, natural landscapes that are vital to the Civil War \n     legacy;\n       Whereas Shenandoah National Park also protects intangible \n     resources, including aspects of the heritage of the people of \n     the United States through the rigorous commitments of the \n     Civilian Conservation Corps and the advancement of Civil \n     Rights as Shenandoah's ``separate but equal'' facilities \n     became the first to desegregate in Virginia;\n       Whereas, on October 20, 1976, Public Law 94-567 was \n     enacted, designating 79,579 acres within Shenandoah National \n     Park's boundaries as wilderness under the Wilderness Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), which protects the wilderness character \n     of the lands ``for the permanent good of the whole people''; \n     and\n       Whereas Congress should support efforts to preserve the \n     ecological and cultural integrity of Shenandoah National \n     Park, maintain the infrastructure of the Park, and protect \n     the famously scenic views of the Shenandoah Valley: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commemorates the 75th anniversary of the dedication of \n     Shenandoah National Park; and\n       (2) acknowledges the historic and enduring scenic, \n     recreational, and economic value of the Park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/23/senate-section/article/S4104-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 513.
