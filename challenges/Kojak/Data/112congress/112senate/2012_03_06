Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to vote in support of Thomas Rice. He has been nominated to \nserve as the next Federal judge for the Eastern District of my home \nState of Washington.\n  Mr. Rice is a distinguished attorney who has dedicated his \nprofessional career to serving the public in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice. In that time he has earned the respect of Federal judges, \nopposing defense attorneys, his fellow prosecutors, and local law \nenforcement officials.\n  Mr. Rice has a deep connection to eastern Washington and its legal \ncommunity. He graduated from Gonzaga University with a degree in \naccounting, and then he returned on a full scholarship to earn his law \ndegree. After earning that degree, Mr. Rice moved directly into public \nservice as a trial attorney with the Department of Justice in \nWashington, DC. He then returned to the Eastern District to work in the \nU.S. Attorney's Office, climbing the ranks to become the first U.S. \nattorney responsible for the management of the Spokane office, and he \nis currently the highest ranking career DOJ official in the Eastern \nDistrict.\n  Over his 20 years of practice, Mr. Rice has tried over 1,000 criminal \ncases dealing with nearly every area of Federal law. He has gone above \nand beyond his duties, volunteering additional hours at the office, \ntaking on extra cases, and establishing the local Antiterrorism \nAdvisory Council, which brings together representatives from every law \nenforcement agency in the Eastern District.\n  As the assistant U.S. attorney, he has earned the reputation of being \ntough on crime but also levelheaded and fair in the conduct of his \nprosecutions. Mr. Rice clearly meets the\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\nstandards of fairness, evenhandedness, and adherence to the law we \nexpect of our Federal judges.\n  I know I speak on behalf of so many in the Washington State legal \ncommunity in supporting his nomination today. Mr. Rice's nomination was \nthe product of a bipartisan selection commission we use in the State of \nWashington, and he received strong endorsements from both sides of the \naisle.\n  We continue to use our bipartisan selection process in Washington \nState, despite the fact that it does take more time and a lot of \neffort, because it works to select judges of the highest quality and \nbecause it is intended to remove partisanship in the selection of our \njudges. You would think someone such as Thomas Rice would be able to \nmove through this process very quickly and get to work on the court. \nUnfortunately, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave slowed down and delayed this vote. Mr. Rice's nomination was \nactually reported unanimously out of the Judiciary Committee in October \nof last year, with strong bipartisan support--almost 4 months ago. But \nhis nomination has sat on the Executive Calendar because some Senate \nRepublicans refuse to consent to debate and vote on nominations just \nlike his. I have not heard any objections from Republicans about Mr. \nRice's qualifications, nor have I heard any Republican claim they have \nbeen unfairly blocked from any process. This delay is the result of an \nunprecedented effort by Senate Republicans to delay and block all of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees.\n\n  There are now 20 judicial nominations reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee that are still sitting in wait on a final Senate \nvote. Fourteen of those nominations have been pending since last year \nand should have been confirmed before the end of last year. Eighteen of \nthose nominations received strong bipartisan support from the Judiciary \nCommittee. They deserve to move through this process in a fair way and \nget a vote here on the floor of the Senate--especially when both sides \nhave agreed they are going to pass--because even though Republicans are \nmaking this about politics here in DC, this does have a real impact on \nour families and the court system throughout America. Nearly 10 percent \nof the Federal judgeships remain vacant right now, and 130 million \nAmericans live in districts or circuits that have a vacancy that could \nbe filled today if the Republican obstruction would end on nominations \nthat have been vetted, considered, and favorably reported by the \nJudiciary Committee, including families in the Eastern District of my \nhome State. This kind of obstruction is not good for our country. It \nhurts families' ability to access the courts in a timely fashion, and \nit puts politics ahead of our judicial system.\n  I urge all of our colleagues today to vote in support of Thomas Rice. \nHe is a great lawyer, and he is a community leader who I believe will \nmake an exceptional Federal judge.\n  I really come today to also call on Republicans to end their \nobstruction and allow us to move forward quickly on debates and votes \non these judicial nominations that have been backlogged for far too \nlong.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/06/senate-section/article/S1402-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1402-S1403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PUBLIC TRUST\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we live in a time when public trust in all \nof our government institutions is at an alltime low and unfortunately \ncontinues to deteriorate. Recent polls indicate public confidence in \nCongress is at 11 percent, which is a record-low approval rating.\n  Americans have been skeptical of politicians in general and Congress \nin particular from the beginning of this Republic. It is a healthy \nskepticism which reflects the freedoms that are part of our democracy \nand the right of people to disagree with leadership with impunity under \nour Constitution, with some limitations. So I take it in historical \ncontext but still cannot escape the reality that the numbers today are \nlower than ever.\n  The legislative branch is not the only branch of government the \npublic holds in low regard. Polls also indicate that the U.S. Supreme \nCourt has recently received its second lowest approval rating in \nhistory.\n  One way those of us who serve in government can increase public trust \nand confidence is to be more transparent about how we operate and the \nstandards to which we are held. The recent passage of the STOCK Act in \nthe Senate is an indication of a continuing effort to alert the public \nto what we do as Members of Congress which bears scrutiny.\n  I make a disclosure each year, which goes beyond the requirements of \nthe law, and many others do as well. The STOCK Act will bring many \nMembers of Congress to an even higher level of disclosure--as they \nshould be. One way we can increase our confidence in the institutions \nof government is to address those aspects which add to transparency and \nadd to trust.\n  I think it is time for the Supreme Court to provide more transparency \nand accountability in two specific areas: First, the Supreme Court \nshould allow live television cameras to broadcast open Court sessions \nso the general public can see firsthand how the Court operates and \narrives at critical decisions that literally change our lives. Second, \nthe Supreme Court should formally adopt the Judicial Code of Conduct, \nwhich currently applies to all other Federal judges but for some \ninexplicable reason does not apply to Justices of the Supreme Court. \nThe Court should also make public the other ethics rules it follows.\n  The Supreme Court decisions impact the lives of every American, but \naccess to open sessions of the Court is incredibly limited. As a \nresult, the Court's proceedings and the way it arrives at decisions are \na mystery. Most Americans will never see the Supreme Court at work \nunless they are willing and able to travel to Washington, DC, and wait \nin line for hours or sometimes sleep outside overnight on the pavement \nin an effort to secure one of 250 seats in the Supreme Court courtroom.\n  In a democratic society that values transparency and openness, there \nis no valid justification for such a powerful element of our government \nto operate largely outside the view of American people.\n  I am pleased to have partnered with Senator Chuck Grassley, my \nRepublican colleague from Iowa, on the Cameras in the Courtroom Act, S. \n1945. He and I continue the work of our former colleague, Senator \nSpecter, on this important issue. Our bill would require televising of \nall open sessions of the Court unless a majority of the Justices \ndetermine that doing so would violate due process rights of one or more \nof the parties before the Court. We give to the Court the last word on \nany given argument or case as to whether it will be public and \ntelevised.\n  In the coming weeks, the Supreme Court is going to consider the \nconstitutionality of one of the most important pieces of legislation to \nbe considered by Congress and signed by the President in decades--the \naffordable care act. During the yearlong congressional debate on health \ncare reform, every hearing, floor debate, and vote was accessible to \nevery American with a television set or a Webcast and a computer, at \nall times. The American people should have the same opportunity to \nwatch the open session of the Supreme Court as it considers the \nconstitutionality of health care reform legislation. On this point, \nthere is bipartisan agreement. Despite our strong disagreements about \nthe substance of the affordable care act, Democrats and Republicans \nfrom both Chambers have written to the Supreme Court, urging them to \npermit live video and audio broadcasts of the health care reform \nargument. The Court should allow live broadcasts of the health care \nreform hearing and all other open sessions of Court since each of the \nCourt's decisions has the potential to have a transformative impact on \nthe lives of so many Americans.\n\n  There are some who say we should not allow cameras in the Supreme \nCourt because only bits and pieces of Court proceedings would be \ntelevised,\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nand they might be taken out of context. That reminds me of an editorial \nfrom a few years ago, and here is what it said:\n\n       Keeping cameras out to prevent people from getting the \n     wrong idea is a little like removing the paintings from an \n     art museum out of fear that visitors might not have the art \n     history background to appreciate them.\n\n  Similar arguments were made when consideration was given to \ntelevising these proceedings. Nevertheless, for two decades the \nlegislative sessions and committee meetings in the Senate and the House \nhave been broadcast live, and the legislative branch is better for it. \nThe majority of States permit live video coverage in some or all of \ntheir courts. It is time the Supreme Court did the same.\n  Mr. President, I am sure you have found when you have gone back home \nthere are people who watch C SPAN nonstop. I have literally had people \nin my hometown of Springfield come up to me in the grocery store and \nsay: Is Senator Bernie Sanders feeling well? I saw him sitting at his \ndesk, and he looked a little bit pale.\n  They follow it with such close regard for the Members and the \nspeeches that it is a surprise to many of us who live in this \ninstitution and work in it every day.\n  In my view, the Cameras in the Courtroom Act is a reasonable approach \nthat balances the public's need for information and transparency with \nthe constitutional rights of those who appear before the court. As in \npast years, the Cameras in the Courtroom Act enjoys bipartisan support.\n  I thank Senators Klobuchar, Cornyn, Schumer, Harkin, Gillibrand, \nBegich, and the Presiding Officer, Senator Blumenthal, for cosponsoring \nthe bill. These Senators, as well as Senator Grassley and myself, \nbelieve public scrutiny of Supreme Court proceedings will produce \ngreater accountability, transparency, and understanding.\n  I thank Senator Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nfor scheduling my bill, the Cameras in the Courtroom Act, for a vote in \nthe Judiciary Committee. It was reported out with a strong bipartisan \nvote, and it is now pending on the Senate calendar. The bill has been \ncleared by every Democratic Senator for a vote by the full Senate. I am \nstill hoping we can bring it to the floor as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, now I would like to touch on a related issue. Just as \nSupreme Court hearings should be televised to the American people, so \ntoo should the Court's ethical standards be available for review by the \npublic. The ethics rules for all branches of government should be clear \nand public. When ethics decisions arise in the Senate--for example, the \nSenate Ethics Committee is responsible for enforcing the rules for \nSenators and our employees. Everyone knows the standards and \nexpectations for Congress because they are a matter of public record. \nThat cannot be said for the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Our Supreme Court has publicly adopted some limited ethics rules but \nnot others. The Court does not have an ethics office, nor is it subject \nto the judicial conference which regulates all other Federal judges \noutside the Supreme Court. Instead, as the highest Court in the land, \nthe Supreme Court polices itself, and it asks the American people to \njust trust them. Of course, I have the highest respect for the \nJustices' abilities and their judgment. It has been my honor to come to \nknow some of these Justices personally over the years. But if the \npublic is asked to trust the Justices to police themselves, we are at \nleast entitled to know the rules by which they play.\n  To its credit, some of the Supreme Court's ethics rules are already \npretty clear. Through an internal resolution, the Supreme Court has \nadopted the same financial restrictions that apply to all other Federal \nemployees. I recently sent a letter--along with Senators Leahy, \nWhitehouse, Franken, and Blumenthal--to John Roberts, the Chief Justice \nof the Supreme Court, asking him to publicly release one of the Court's \nresolutions which says that the Justices will follow the same \nregulations on outside employment, honoraria, and income that apply to \nother justices. The Chief Justice agreed to our requests and publicly \nreleased this resolution for the first time since it was adopted in \n1991. I applaud Chief Justice Roberts' action. I encourage him and the \nother Justices to continue on this path by releasing all of their \nethics rules.\n  Nevertheless, there is more work for the Supreme Court to do to \nincrease transparency and accountability. The Court should either adopt \na court resolution agreeing to follow the judicial code of conduct--the \nsame ethics code that applies to all other Federal judges--or adopt and \npublicly disclose their own ethics code. Many have called for the \nSupreme Court to adopt the Judicial Code of Conduct.\n  In response, Chief Justice Roberts has explained that the Justices \nuse the code as one source of guidance but not the only source to \ndecide ethics questions. Given that they already apply the code in \npractice, it seems a logical next step for the Court to adopt its own \nresolution formally affirming this practice or they can adopt a \nresolution making it clear which ethics rules do or do not apply.\n  All of the Justices deserve respect for the difficult and weighty \ndecisions they face. But as some of the most powerful members of our \ngovernment, it is not too much to ask of them to make their ethical \nstandards open and clear. By making their ethics rules more \ntransparent, the Justices will foster greater public trust and \nconfidence in the Court and its decisions.\n  In conclusion, let me emphasize that I have a high regard for the \nSupreme Court and all of its Justices. I do not intend to question or \nimpugn any Justice with my suggestions. But let's be clear; we live in \nan era where there is a great deal of mistrust in government \ninstitutions, starting with Congress but through all branches of \ngovernment. At the same time modern technology enables us to provide \nthe American people with more access to the workings of government \nwhich could help to reduce some of this mistrust.\n  I, and many of my colleagues in the Senate, have worked for many \nyears to increase openness and transparency in Congress and the \nexecutive branch. I encourage the Supreme Court to take the same \napproach. Televising Supreme Court proceedings and making public the \nCourt's ethics rules would be a good start. The American people deserve \nto be able to watch the Supreme Court arguments and cases that can \naffect their lives, and they deserve to know the ethical standards that \ngovern the Court when it decides cases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/06/senate-section/article/S1403-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1403-S1405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I mentioned yesterday on the Senate floor \nI spent a great deal of time in deep southern Illinois where some \ndevastating and fatal tornadoes hit last week. As I said then and will \nrepeat briefly now, the amazing outpouring of voluntarism and support \nfrom people far and wide was inspiring to me. It is great to know that, \njust as I had hoped, the people in my State rallied to help the \nvictims.\n  There were formal organizations such as the American Red Cross and \ninformal organizations such as Operation Blessing which brought \ntogether churches from all over the area. There was a Methodist church \nfrom Carrier Mills with about 20 of their parishioners. Some were \nchildren with rakes doing everything they could to help clean up the \nmess. It was inspiring to see that. I was happy for that.\n  I will tell you that in addition to the tornado issue we faced, the \none thing that hit people between the eyes in Illinois this last week \nwas gasoline prices. I was in the suburbs of Chicago on Friday evening \nand saw a gas station with regular gasoline for $4.09. I saw some lower \nprices over the weekend, but that was the high watermark or high \ngasoline mark in my State that I observed. People are very sensitive to \nthis. Gasoline prices literally affect the lives of people individually \nand families as well. They also have a direct impact on business.\n  I asked a vice president of Walmart about monitoring retail sales and \nhow to increase retail sales, and he told me that with all of the \nhundreds and thousands of Walmart stores and employees, they literally \nmonitor sales by the second in real time.\n  He said: I can observe the sales pattern in a store somewhere in \nAmerica and tell you within a few pennies or dimes what the price of \ngasoline is in\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nthat community. When gasoline goes up, people put the money into the \ntank instead of on the counter, and they stay home instead of going out \nto shop. That is how the price of gasoline directly impacts economic \nrecovery.\n  I have listened to so many of the comments that have been made on the \nSenate floor by individuals on the other side, their approach on how to \ndeal with the issue of gasoline prices and what to do with it. I see \nthe Senator from California. I sometimes wonder if we are reading the \nsame basic information.\n  The Keystone Pipeline could serve a valuable purpose, but to believe \nthat this is somehow going to have an immediate impact or any major \nimpact on gasoline prices is not realistic. Currently, the pipelines \nfrom Canada that exports these oil sands to the United States are \noperating at less than 50 percent of capacity. So there is plenty of \nroom for more oil sands to come to the United States for refinement. In \nfact, one of the pipelines goes directly to my State to the Conoco \nrefinery in Wood River, and this refinery has the capacity that could \nbe used to process these Canadian oil sands right now. So to argue this \nKeystone Pipeline is somehow holding back the export of Canadian oil \nsands that might have an impact on gasoline prices just does not work.\n  I have noted there has been a significant increase in the amount of \noil exploration and drilling that has taken place under this \nadministration. I believe that is an indication of what we can and \nshould do as a nation to deal with the problem of providing the oil \nresources in an environmentally responsible way. It is 2 years after \nthe BP spill, and I think it is time for us to reflect on the fact that \nwe never ever want that to happen again.\n  The devastation that has been caused to so many lives, to so many \nbusinesses, and to so much in terms of wildlife will not be calculated. \nPerhaps it never will be. But we know we cannot allow that to occur \nagain. We should not exalt speed over safety. We have to make certain \nthat as we move forward to develop our energy resources, both oil and \ngas, we do it in a sensible way. I hope we can gather together and \nagree that is the way to approach it, along with the administration's \nproposals for more fuel efficiency in the vehicles we drive and for the \ndevelopment of alternative fuels which will be environmentally friendly \nand spark new innovation, new businesses, and new jobs in this country \nin the 21st century.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for putting the gas \nprice situation into a larger picture and also note that one other \nfactor playing a role is manipulation due to some of the instability in \nthe world that our President is certainly dealing with, and many of us \nhere, and the instability in Iran; the fact that we have sanctions, the \nfact that there is also a greater demand coming for this product from \nChina and other very high-growth areas.\n  I say to my friend, is he aware--I know he is, but because of the \nrules I have to ask it in a question--that we are producing far more of \nthis resource, oil, in this country than we have done? Since 2008 we \nhave many more rigs out there, and is my colleague also aware that the \noil companies are sitting on well over 50 million acres of leases on \nwhich they are not drilling when they could? And, my last point, is my \nfriend aware that we are exporting more than we ever have from America? \nThat is also a very important point.\n  To those who say, ``drill, baby, drill,'' that is not an answer if it \nis ``export, baby, export.'' The fact is we are drilling more, and more \nis leaving America.\n  So I say to my friend, is he aware of all of these factors, and is he \nas concerned as I am about the other side playing more politics with \nthis because ``drill, baby, drill'' is not the answer? We are drilling \nmore than ever. We only have 2 percent of the world's proven supply of \noil.\n  I wonder if my friend could comment on those points.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. In response, I would \nask consent of the Chair to have printed in the Record the New York \nTimes editorial of Monday, March 5, 2012, entitled ``Drill Baby Drill, \nRedux.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                        Drill Baby Drill, Redux\n\n\n   Republicans' tired remedy for rising gas prices won't fix anything\n\n       It's campaign season and the pandering about gas prices is \n     in full swing. Hardly a day goes by that a Republican \n     politician does not throw facts to the wind and claim that \n     rising costs at the pump are the result of President Obama's \n     decisions to block the Keystone XL pipeline and impose \n     sensible environmental regulations and modest restrictions on \n     offshore drilling.\n       Next, of course, comes the familiar incantation of ``drill, \n     baby, drill.'' Mr. Obama has rightly derided this as a \n     ``bumper sticker,'' not a strategy. Last week, he agreed that \n     high gas prices were a real burden, but said the only \n     sensible response was a balanced mix of production, \n     conservation and innovation in alternative fuels.\n       There are lots of reasons for the rise in gas prices, but \n     the lack of American production is not one of them. Domestic \n     crude oil production is actually up from 5.4 million barrels \n     a day in 2004 to 5.59 million now; imports have dropped by \n     more than 10 percent in the same period. Despite a temporary \n     slowdown in exploration in the Gulf of Mexico after the BP \n     oil disaster, the number of rigs in American oil fields has \n     quadrupled over three years. There have been new discoveries \n     and the administration has promised to open up more offshore \n     reserves. To say that Mr. Obama has denied industry access is \n     nonsense.\n       Equally nonsensical is the Republican claim that Mr. \n     Obama's proposed repeal of $4 billion in annual tax breaks \n     for the oil and gas industry--whose five biggest players \n     posted $137 billion in profits last year--would drive prices \n     upward. As is Newt Gingrich's claim that a proposal now \n     taking shape in the Environmental Protection Agency, and \n     fiercely opposed by refiners, to lower the sulfur content in \n     gasoline would add 25 cents to the cost of a gallon. Agency \n     experts say it would add about a penny.\n       The truth is that oil prices are set on world markets by \n     forces largely beyond America's control. Chief among these is \n     soaring demand in countries like China. Unrest in oil-\n     producing countries is another factor. The Times noted fears \n     in some quarters that gas could jump to $5 a gallon if the \n     standoff with Iran disrupted world supplies.\n       Therein lies the biggest weakness in the Republican litany. \n     A country that consumes more than 20 percent of the world's \n     oil supply but owns 2 percent of its reserves cannot drill \n     its way out of high prices or dependence on exports from \n     unstable countries. The only plausible strategy is to keep \n     production up while cutting consumption and embarking on a \n     serious program of alternative fuels.\n       American innovation is a big part of the answer. Two \n     byproducts of the automobile bailout were the carmakers' \n     acceptance of sharply improved fuel economy and a new \n     commitment to building cars that can meet those standards. \n     The new rules are expected to cut consumption by 2.2 million \n     barrels a day--more than America now produces in the gulf. \n     These and other measures are not nearly as catchy as Drill, \n     Baby, Drill. But they have a far better shot, long term, of \n     lessening this country's dependence on oil imports and \n     keeping gas prices under control.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. It answers specifically what the Senator just raised, and \nI would like to read a portion of it.\n\n       Domestic crude oil production is actually up from 5.4 \n     million barrels a day in 2004 to 5.59 million now; imports \n     have dropped by more than 10 percent in the same period. \n     Despite a temporary slowdown in exploration in the Gulf of \n     Mexico after the BP oil disaster, the number of rigs in \n     American oilfields has quadrupled over 3 years. There have \n     been new discoveries, and the administration has promised to \n     open more offshore reserves. To say that Mr. Obama has denied \n     industry access is nonsense.\n       Equally nonsensical is the Republican claim that Mr. \n     Obama's proposed repeal of $4 billion in annual tax breaks \n     for the oil and gas industry--whose five biggest players \n     posted $137 billion in profits last year--would drive prices \n     upward. As is Newt Gingrich's claim that a proposal now \n     taking shape in the Environmental Protection Agency, and \n     fiercely opposed by refiners, to lower sulfur content in \n     gasoline would add 25 cents to the cost of a gallon. Agency \n     experts say it would add a penny.\n       The truth is that oil prices are set by world markets by \n     forces largely beyond America's control. Chief among these is \n     soaring demand in countries like China.\n\n  The Times noted fears in some quarters that gas could jump to $5 a \ngallon if the standoff with Iran disrupted world supplies.\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       Therein lies the biggest weakness in the Republican litany. \n     A country that consumes--\n\n  As the Senator from California noted--\n\n     more than 20 percent of the world's oil supply but owns 2 \n     percent of its reserves cannot drill its way out of high \n     prices or dependence on exports from unstable countries. The \n     only\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\n     plausible strategy is to keep production up while cutting \n     consumption and embarking on a serious program of alternative \n     fuels.\n\n  Let me add to this conversation a topic which I think we have been \nloathe to address on the floor because of its political controversy \nwhich was driven home to me over the weekend. I believe our energy \nconversation has to parallel an environmental conversation. We have to \ntalk about the consumption of energy and the impact it has on the world \nwe live in.\n  I would say to the Senator from California that in the Midwest, we \nlive in tornado country. I was raised with them. I know how to run to \nthe basement when we hear the air raid sirens, to protect our children, \nwhich rooms to go in, which corner of the house. It is just built into \nour lifestyle in the Midwest. So far this year, we have had over 272 \nreported tornadoes, early in the tornado season. Last year, we had 50; \nso 272 to 50.\n  I would just say to anyone who would like to come challenge me: Is \nthis worth asking a question or two? What is going on with the extreme \nweather patterns we are seeing more and more? In a given year, one \nmight say these things happen. But as these patterns emerge--last year, \nChicago experienced the biggest blizzard in its history in February and \nthen in June the largest rainfall in 1 hour in its history. We think to \nourselves: This is not the world in which we grew up. Things are \ndifferent out there. Are these within our control or beyond our \ncontrol? I think we have to rely on experts and scientists to lead us \nin that conversation. But let's at least embark on that conversation by \nunderstanding the connection between energy and the environment.\n  As we find more efficient ways to move our cars and move our economy, \nas we burn less energy in doing it, there is less damage to the \nenvironment. That is a positive. It also rewards innovation, creation \nand new business and industry so the United States can lead in this \narea as we have led in other areas before.\n  I thank the Senator from California. She is on the floor now with a \nbill which she has spoken of time and time again, the new Federal \nTransportation bill. There is no single piece of legislation that will \ncreate more jobs--specific jobs that can be identified--than this bill. \nWe have spent 2 weeks--2 weeks, if I am not mistaken, or 3--the Senator \nfrom California would know better--3 weeks on the floor of the Senate \narguing about contraception on the Federal highway bill, arguing about \nwhether we are going to embark on a foreign policy amendment to the \nFederal highway bill, so 3 wasted weeks trying to come to a conclusion \nabout a handful of amendments. Unfortunately, this is what gives our \nSenate a bad name. We should have resolved this long ago and moved to \nthis bill so we can say, if we want a real jobs bill--a real jobs \nbill--the Senate is leading the way. To do it, we need bipartisan \nsupport.\n  At noon there will be a vote and those who are following the \nproceedings can take a look to see how many on both sides of the aisle \nwill support moving forward on this bill. I think our earlier vote was \n85. If I am not mistaken, 85 Senators said let's move forward on this \nbill. I hope we can do that again.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/06/senate-section/article/S1405-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1405-S1407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am glad to be able to come to the \nfloor. I wish to talk about a subject that was talked about to me a lot \nduring the Presidents Day break back in Georgia. I spent most of that \nweek traveling in my State, going to townhall meetings, listening to \nGeorgians from Savannah, GA, to Murray County, GA, and everywhere in \nbetween. It was absolutely easy to tell what the No. 1 issue for the \naverage American or the average Georgia family is; that is, what the \nprice of gasoline is doing to their budget.\n  Gasoline prices continue to escalate. In fact, I have a Chevrolet \nSilverado pickup truck that I use from time to time and I had to fill \nit last weekend. It cost $78 to fill it, and it wasn't totally empty. \nThat is a big pricetag to fill a pickup truck. When I think of every \ncarpenter or farmer or landscaper or student taking their goods back to \nschool to their dormitory room and how much they have to pay for \ngasoline to deliver those goods and services or that furniture, I \nrealize how harmful current gas prices are and I fear how high they are \ngoing to go.\n  We need a comprehensive energy policy in the United States of \nAmerica. I was listening to the distinguished majority whip speak \nbefore me. He made an interesting comment about the Keystone Pipeline. \nHe said, even if we approve the Keystone Pipeline, it would not do \nanything for gas prices today. He is right because we have to build the \npipeline. But if we had approved it 2 years ago and it was operating, \nwe would have 700,000 barrels of petroleum more a day coming into the \nUnited States. So to say that just because it would not be ready today \ndoesn't help gas prices is not keeping our eye on the ball.\n  What we have to recognize is, in the absence of a comprehensive \npolicy, in the absence of foresight, in the absence of putting all the \ngeneral items on the table that generate energy, we are putting off the \nday in which the United States of America is energy independent. \nBecause we are not energy independent, then what goes on in Iran, in \nthe Strait of Hormuz, and in Venezuela affects the speculation on \ngasoline and petroleum which affects the prices of gasoline in the \nUnited States.\n  I am not one of these ``burn gas right and left, drill as much as you \ncan, fossil fuels are fine.'' I know we have problems with carbon. I \ndrive a hybrid vehicle, not because I am trying to drive a point but \nbecause it makes sense. Anytime you can reduce carbon, that makes \nsense. But you cannot eliminate it. You cannot eliminate it. What we \nhave to do is we have to put all sources of energy on the table. And \none of those is to continue to explore for gasoline and petroleum in \nthe domestic United States of America--off the Gulf of Mexico, off of \nour coastline, in our national lands that we own where we know we have \nshale oil and where we also know we have natural gas.\n  That exploration ought to be replete throughout the country, so we \nare expanding our supply and reducing our dependence on foreign \nimports. The best way to lower the price of gasoline in the future for \nGeorgians and for Americans is for the Congress of the United States \nand the President of the United States to have a comprehensive energy \npolicy that embraces all forms of energy.\n  To the credit of the President, he approved not too long ago the loan \nguarantees on reactors 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle. They will be the first \nnuclear reactors built in the United States of America since Three Mile \nIsland. Nuclear energy is a safe, reliable, carbon-free--carbon-free--\ngeneration of energy. Every time we can expand our nuclear capability \nwe are lessening the pressure on domestic and foreign oil to be burned.\n  We know in the Haynesville shale and the Marcellus shale, which has \nbeen discovered in Pennsylvania and Louisiana and Texas, that we have \ngone from having a finite supply of natural gas to an infinite supply. \nYet, because there is some contest over whether hydraulic fracturing is \ngood or not good, we are not exploring that gasoline as we should or \nthat natural gas as we should. We should be exploring it as much as \npossible, because it is a cleaner burning fuel than liquid petroleum \nand gasoline. We ought to be doing renewable energy wherever it makes \nsense. But we have seen renewable energy has its limits. We spent $6 \nbillion a year subsidizing ethanol in hopes that it would have reduced \nforeign imports, but it has not. It has had its own problems with two-\ncycle engines. But ethanol has a place. It is scalable on the farm in \nsome cases. That is a good source of energy.\n\n[[Page S1406]]\n\n  Solar is a good source of energy where it works. But it only works as \na supplement. It is not a primary supply or source. And wind, great. \nBut it is only great in the Midwest and down toward the Southwest. But \nwe ought to be using and encouraging it.\n  What we ought to be doing is encouraging all forms of exploration, \nall forms of generation, and all of them domestically in the United \nStates of America. That will bring down gas prices.\n  The distinguished majority whip was right: It will not bring it down \ntoday, because we have put off having an energy policy. But once we \nfinally develop an energy policy, and we stick to it, and we explore \nall forms of renewable energy and all forms of fossil fuel and all \nforms of coal, and we enhance nuclear, then we will have a plethora of \nenergy and we will have a lower price and less competition with foreign \noil and foreign petroleum, which is where the United States of America \nneeds to be.\n  Right now, we all realize what is going on in the Middle East is the \nroot cause of most of the increase in the cost of oil, because of \nspeculation. Every time we can improve our position and be free of \nthose influences is better for the United States of America and, most \nimportantly, it is better for the average citizens we all represent.\n  My message from the people I represent in Georgia, the ones I talked \nto all during the Presidents Day recess and that week is: Do everything \nyou can to expand your supply of energy wherever you can find it. Take \nus out of a dependence on foreign imports and get us independent of \nforeign oil; that will bring down the price of oil. As a byproduct, \nthat will be in the best national security interests of the people of \nthe United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, as February came to a close, it left \nbehind an unfortunate new record, $3.73 per gallon, the national \naverage, for unleaded gasoline, the highest ever recorded during this \nmonth. Prior to this morning's drop of three-tenths of a cent, gas \nprices had been on the rise for 27 straight days. In just 3 years, gas \nprices have doubled, and they are not stopping there. Back home in \nArkansas, the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline is up over \n25 cents from a month ago. Many analysts are predicting we will hit $4 \na gallon by summer.\n  Think about what that does to the economy. For our small business \nowners and farmers, it means much higher overhead. Those costs \nultimately get passed on to the consumers. In very dire cases, which \nmany of our small businesses are facing today due to reduced profit \nmargins, threats of higher taxes and increased regulations, high gas \nprices could be the final straw.\n  It puts extra pressure on budgets of already cash-strapped local \ngovernments. Just the other day I was reading a story from the \nBooneville Democrat that documented the negative effects the price of \ngas has on Logan County, AR. The county judge, Gus Young, noted if gas \nprices reach $4, it is ``going to take away from the other things that \nneed to be done.''\n  In Blytheville, AR, which is a 300-mile trek from Booneville, those \nsame concerns are being voiced. In the Blytheville Courier News, former \nmayor Barrett Harrison described how in recent years, despite efforts \nto use more fuel-efficient vehicles and to cut down on idle time, the \ncity would still end up having to amend the budget at the end of the \nyear due to the high fuel costs.\n  For hard-working Arkansans, it is changing the way they live, and not \nfor the better. It is especially painful for our seniors and single \nparents who live on fixed incomes. The high price of gas is one of the \ntop issues I am hearing about in letters, calls, and during my visits \nacross the State. I also recently posed the question about how the \nrising price of gasoline in Arkansas is affecting them on my Facebook \npage. I want to share a few of the responses I received.\n\n  Tim in Rogers, AR said, ``The more we have to pay for gas, the less \nmoney we have for the other necessities and pleasures of life and \nliving.''\n  Melody in central Arkansas said it costs her family ``nearly sixty-\nfive dollars to fill up their truck'' and said they have limited their \ndriving to only their doctor in Hot Springs and the grocery store.\n  And it goes on from there. Many respondents said that it limits their \nspending at places like the grocery store and will affect their \nvacation plans. The overwhelming common thread in those responses is \nthat Washington needs to do something about the high cost of gas.\n  There is no denying that rising fuel prices are hurting Americans and \nfurther complicating our efforts to revitalize the economy. There is \nalso no denying that we are not moving fast enough to address these \nconcerns. Americans want to know why, while their gas bills mount, \nWashington still does not have an energy policy. It is past time that \nwe move forward on one and that begins with increasing our energy \nproduction here at home.\n  We have the largest recoverable resources of oil, gas and coal of any \nnation on the planet. America's recoverable resources are larger than \nthe combined supply of Saudi Arabia, China and Canada. Despite that, we \ndepend on hostile regimes--and nations that have agendas that are often \nat odds with our own--for much of our oil.\n  The current tension between Israel and Iran only serves to make \nmatters worse. If Israel strikes Iran, there is a good chance that the \nIranians could attack Saudi Arabia's oil fields to retaliate against \nthe West.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. The Keystone XL Pipeline, Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, and drilling in the eastern Gulf of \nMexico alone would produce 3 million barrels of oil per day. The lack \nof will in Washington to increase production here at home is \nunnecessary. It is a literal road block. It prevents our economy from \npicking up, increases the costs Americans pay for fuel, and it creates \nan enormous liability for our national and economic security.\n  President Obama has said that increased domestic oil production is \nunnecessary as he contends it is at the highest it has been in 8 years. \nHowever, you only get those numbers by relying heavily on production on \nprivate lands in North Dakota, Texas and Alaska. We simply are not \nutilizing the resources we have been blessed with on public lands.\n\n  We can make a major dent in the problem simply by opening the Outer \nContinental Shelf and ANWR to drilling in an environmentally \nresponsible way. The Outer Continental Shelf alone is estimated to \ncontain enough oil and natural gas to meet America's energy needs for \nabout 60 years. Energy exploration and production in ANWR would take \nplace on just a small portion of the 1.5 million-acre northern coastal \nplain, yet will allow us to safely produce 900,000 barrels of oil per \nday for the next 30 years. I have been there. I have seen firsthand \nthat this can be done in an environmentally safe way.\n  Similarly, the Keystone Pipeline would transport 700,000 barrels of \noil per day from Canada to U.S. refineries in the gulf coast. And it \ntoo can be constructed and run in an environmentally safe manner. \nTapping into Canada's oil sands--one of the world's largest oil \nreserves--would help ease our dependence on hostile regimes for oil. As \nglobal demand for oil surges and the Canadians increase production, the \naddition of the Keystone pipeline would allow us to get reliable and \nsecure oil from our largest trading partner and trusted ally.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama has punted on every opportunity we \nhave given him to move the Keystone Pipeline forward. That is why I am \nsupporting legislation to approve the project under Congress' authority \nenumerated in the commerce clause. This same Congressional authority \nwas used to move the Alaska Pipeline forward 40 years ago, which has \ndramatically increased the amount of oil produced here at home.\n  I have long supported legislation that puts a heavy investment into \nresearching wind, solar, hydrogen and other\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\ntechnologies. These will ultimately ease our dependence on foreign oil \nand gas. But we need relief now and American oil is necessary and \navailable.\n  For the foreseeable future, our economy will rely heavily on fossil \nfuels. While we certainly need to encourage the market for alternative \nenergy sources, it has yet to be fully developed. But there is no \ndenying that by stalling domestic production, we create an unnecessary \nburden on an already weak economy and are hurting our efforts to meet \nour energy needs. We need to lift the moratorium on offshore oil \ndevelopment, open ANWR for exploration and move the Keystone Pipeline \nforward instead of further postponing the decision.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the people of Arkansas are demanding action \nfrom Washington. They are frustrated by the higher totals that appear \non the receipts every time they go to fill up their gas tank. They are \ntired of seeing more and more of their disposable income being eaten up \nat the pump. Let's start providing them relief by increasing production \nhere at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12 \nnoon will be equally divided and controlled between the two sides, with \nthe final 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the two leaders \nor their designees, with the majority leader controlling the final 5 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are back in our fourth week trying to \nget a transportation bill through this body. To me, it is a very sad \nstatement about the dysfunction of this body that we spent \napproximately 3 weeks dithering over a contraception amendment that has \nnothing to do with the highway bill and other threats to offer foreign \npolicy amendments, and so on.\n  We have a chance today to vote to end this dithering, and the Chamber \nof Commerce is asking us to do that. The AFL CIO is asking us to do \nthat. One thousand organizations are asking us to do that because they \nknow thousands of businesses and well over 1 million jobs are at stake.\n  I wish to say I heard the tail end of Senator Boozman's talk about \nthe Keystone Pipeline. I wanted to make sure it was on the record--this \nis from a conversation I had with Senator Durbin--that under this \nPresident we are drilling now more than we have ever drilled. Anyone \nwho says ``drill, baby, drill'' doesn't understand that the number of \nrigs that are now moving are four times as many as in 2008. They don't \nunderstand we are now exporting oil. They don't understand the fact \nthat we are importing less. Does that mean we are done? No. The oil \ncompanies have more than 50 million acres of approved leases. They \nought to drill there and hands off my coast because my coast is an \neconomic gold mine the way it is because we have tourism and recreation \nand fishing. Those jobs far outweigh any jobs that would come from oil \ndrilling, which would tend to undermine the very economy of my great \nState. If we have to vote on Keystone, we will. If we have to vote on \noffshore drilling, we will. But I will be here to point out that if we \ncare about jobs and about making sure the price of gasoline goes down, \nwhen we have Keystone, let's make sure the oil stays here, that oil is \nmade in America and stays in America. These issues are not one-\ndimensional; they are many sided, as my friend knows. He and I have \nagreed on much and we have disagreed on some.\n  What we need is the kind of balance President Obama brings to the \ntable when it comes to energy. He says we will do ``all of the above,'' \nbut we will do it wisely. Interestingly, on the Keystone Pipeline--we \nnow have the tea party talking about property rights and the fact that \nthey have to be respected as well when we build a new pipeline such as \nthis. So we will have votes.\n  May I make a plea to my colleagues. At noon, just about 50 minutes \nfrom now, we can have a clean vote; 60 of us can vote to move to this \nTransportation bill, to get rid of, as my friend Olympia Snowe has \nsaid, polarizing amendments. Why not move to something that was voted \nunanimously out of our committee, 18 to zero--Republicans and \nDemocrats, all together; Senator Inhofe and myself, together; Senator \nShelby and Senator Johnson, together on the bill; Senator Baucus, \nworking in a bipartisan way with his committee; and Senator \nRockefeller, once they got rid of some bumps, working with Senator \nHutchison. We now have pending an agreed-upon bill, plus we have added \nto the package 37 bipartisan amendments.\n  What more do my friends want? We have a bipartisan bill. We have \nadded more bipartisan amendments to it. All these jobs are at stake, \nand today we can end all this dithering and wasting time. The people of \nAmerica look at us and wonder what we are about. Vote yes for cloture.\n  I wish to talk about what is at stake if we don't invoke cloture and \ndon't wind up with a bill. That is not just hyperbole; these are facts. \nAll our transportation programs expire on March 31.\n  My friend in the chair served as a great Governor of his State of \nWest Virginia. He knows how important the highway bill is. We work \ntogether with the States and with the planning organizations, and we \nget those funds out there. On March 31, we are done. This bill \nreauthorizes that program, and 1.8 million jobs are at stake. As soon \nas we fail, there is no more program. There is no more authority to \ncollect the Federal gas tax that supports the highway program. There is \nno more authority to spend any money on transportation.\n\n  Again, 1.8 million jobs are at stake. Let's go to the next chart. I \ndid a breakdown of the various States. In this time, I am going to \nhighlight a few of the States. These charts will be available for \neverybody.\n  In Alabama, we are talking about only 27,000 jobs; in Alaska, 18,000 \njobs--I am skipping; in California, 164,000 jobs; in Florida, 76,000 \njobs; right here in DC, 18,000 jobs; in Georgia, almost 50,000 jobs; in \nIllinois, 65,000; in Indiana, 34,000; in Iowa, 17,000; in Louisiana, \n25,000; in Maine, almost 7,000.\n  We will go on and give the rest of the States to give a sense of how \nmany jobs will be lost if we do not act to reauthorize this bill.\n  In Maryland, 26,000 jobs; in Massachusetts, 31,000; in Michigan, \n39,000; in Montana, almost 14,000; in Nebraska, 10,000; in Nevada, \nalmost 14,000 jobs; in New Jersey, 50,000; in New York, 118,000; in \nNorth Dakota, 8,000; in Ohio, 50,000; in Oklahoma, 22,000; in \nPennsylvania, 68,000; in Rhode Island, 8,000.\n  I will continue with another chart to show other examples. I will be \nsure to say what West Virginia is when I get to the Ws. In South \nCarolina, 22,000; in South Dakota, 9,000; in Tennessee, 30,000; in \nTexas, 128,000 jobs.\n  I call on Senators to vote yes to stop debate and get to the bill.\n  In Vermont, almost 7,000; in Virginia, 41,000; in Washington State, \n34,000; in West Virginia, 15,133 jobs; in Wisconsin, 27,000; in \nWyoming, 8,400 jobs.\n  When we talk about this as a jobs bill, this isn't some exercise in \nour verbiage; this is a fact of life. These jobs add up to 1.8 million. \nIn our bipartisan bill, we have increased a particular program--this is \na reform bill, and we have taken 90 programs down to 30. It\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\nis a real reform bill. We have done away with every earmark. One \nparticular program we increased is the TIFIA Program, transportation \ninfrastructure financing. We took it up to $1 billion because it \nleverages Federal dollars 30 times. So let's say one of our counties \nvoted to tax themselves one-half cent to build a transit system. We \nwould come in--and the Federal Government, you make an application from \nyour State and we would front that money. So you could build it all in \n1 or 2 years instead of waiting for the funding over 10. This was an \nidea that came from Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and the Chamber of \nCommerce and the labor unions in Los Angeles.\n\n  So the bottom line here is not only are we saving 1.8 million jobs, \nbut we have the potential of creating another 1 million jobs. If we \nfail today to cut off debate and we don't have a path forward--which I \nhope the leaders will figure out--if we abandon this, 2.8 million jobs \nare at stake.\n  Let's look at some other charts of unemployment. Mr. President, you \nknow as well as anyone in your State, and I know in my State, that \nconstruction workers have been hit very hard. The national unemployment \nrate is 8.3 percent. We are hopeful it is on the downtick, but the \nconstruction industry unemployment rate as a whole is 17.7 percent. It \ncould be even worse in some areas, but this is an average. So if we add \nto the unemployment in the construction industry, we are looking at a \ntotal crisis, a total disaster. Right now, we have 1.48 million \nconstruction workers out of work. If we fail to do this bill, we are \nadding another 1.8 million. So you could say this would be a depression \nfor construction workers.\n  It doesn't stop there. The industry is feeling it, the businesses are \nfeeling it, and we have a chart that talks about the thousands of \nbusinesses that would be affected. I don't know if you are aware of \nthis, but there are over 11,000 transportation construction companies \nthat would be adversely impacted by a shutdown on March 31. So in \naddition to the 1.8 million workers who would be laid off, 11,000 \ntransportation construction companies--many of them--would have to shut \ntheir doors. And that is a very modest number.\n  Let me show a picture that I often show when speaking of the \nconstruction workers. I am sure you are a Super Bowl fan--we all are, \nMr. President--and this is a picture of a stadium during the Super \nBowl. Every seat there, about 100,000 seats, is filled. Imagine every \none of these seats filled with an unemployed construction worker, and \nthen close your eyes and envision 14 more of these stadiums filled with \nunemployed construction workers. That is where we are today. Then you \nwould have to envision another 25 or 30 of those. We cannot afford to \ngo down this road. So today, let's vote ``aye'' for cloture.\n  The last thing I want to show is the strong support for this cloture \nvote. We received this yesterday from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The \nChamber of Commerce:\n  . . . strongly supports this important legislation. Passing surface \ntransportation reauthorization legislation is a specific action \nCongress and the administration can take right now to support job \ngrowth and economic productivity without adding to the deficit.\n  Because, as you know, this bill is 100 percent paid for. We also have \na history-making group of organizations supporting this, and I will \ngive you a sense of that as well. We have a coalition of 1,075 \norganizations from all 50 States. They sent us a letter on January 25, \n2012, and they said:\n\n       In 2011, political leaders--Republican and Democrat, House, \n     Senate and the administration--stated a multi-year surface \n     transportation bill is important for job creation and \n     economic recovery. We urge you to follow words with action.\n\n  I want to repeat that: We urge you to follow words with action.\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n       Make transportation job #1 and move immediately in the \n     House and Senate to invest in the roads, bridges [and] \n     transit systems that are the backbone of the U.S. Economy, \n     its businesses, large and small, and communities of all \n     sizes.\n\n  They didn't ask us to take up the Keystone Pipeline, they didn't ask \nus to take up repealing clean air laws, they didn't ask us to take up \ndrilling off the coast, and they didn't ask us to take up \ncontraception. They didn't. They asked us to take up this \ntransportation bill. And I am saying to colleagues, please, you have \nhad 3 weeks to discuss contraception. We disposed of it. We voted. It \nis okay. It is tabled. Let's move on. There are other days we can talk \nabout that but not when we are dealing with building the highways and \nbridges.\n  You know, the state of our highways and transportation system is not \nwhat it should be, with 70,000 bridges deficient. Bridges are falling \ndown. Senator Inhofe is eloquent on the point about a woman taking a \nwalk and having a piece of bridge fall on her and she died. We have \nseen what happened in Minnesota when bridges start to fall into \ndisrepair.\n  When I was growing up, my parents always taught me be responsible--be \nresponsible. I am not always living up to their expectations, but I \ntry. And if somebody tells me there is a problem over here, I try to \nfix it. So when I hear that 70,000 bridges are in trouble and they are \ndeficient, and 50 percent of our roads are not up to standard--I now \nknow this information. If I were ignorant and I didn't know it, that \nwould be one thing. But I now know it--how can I turn my back on this \nbill? I know how many unemployed construction workers there are. How \ncan I turn my back on them? I know businesses--whether it is gravel \ncompanies or cement companies or general contractors--are begging us to \ndo this. These are Republican-leaning groups along with labor and \nDemocratic-leaning groups. Bridges are not partisan. Roads are not \npartisan.\n  This is our moment. We can vote yes on cloture. What does that mean? \nIt means we are not going to debate these very difficult, inflammatory \namendments, but we are going to stick to the highway bill, stick to the \ntransportation bill. This vote is a very important vote for folks \nbecause I think if you don't vote to move to the bill and you vote to \nprolong this debate, you have to answer to your folks back home and \ntell them why you are playing Russian roulette with the highway bill, \nbecause on March 31 it all stops.\n  It is true in the past we have had extensions. This is different than \nusual because the trust fund is short of funds, so you can't just \nextend. If you extend, there is a price to be paid. Because the trust \nfund doesn't have the funds it needs--which is repaired in this bill--\nyou would have an immediate cut of a third--a third--right there, which \nmeans 500,000 jobs, if you did an extension. We don't want that. We \nwant a bill that is a reform bill, that takes this from 90 programs to \n30, that uses leveraging in a smart way, and that is totally \nbipartisan.\n  Let me sum up. In a few minutes we will be voting, and let me say to \nmy friends again, you have all the facts at hand. If you don't know \nwhat your State job loss would be if we fail to act, we have that. We \nwill give it to you. But there is no way you can run away from what you \nknow.\n  We had 85 votes to proceed to this bill. That was a long time ago. It \nseems like ages ago. Yet we can't get off dead center because people \nare offering unrelated amendments. So my hope is we will get to 60. My \nhope is we can, in short order, get this bill done and send a message \nof hope to the people.\n  I heard just now that Speaker Boehner has said he is very interested \nin the Senate bill; that he is going to take a look at the Senate bill \nbecause, at this point, they haven't been able to get a bill that they \nfeel has a chance. This bill, I would reiterate for America, is \nbipartisan, the most bipartisan bill I have ever seen around here, and \nit unites people who fight and argue on everything else. When Inhofe \nand Boxer agree on something, you know that is a real good compromise. \nAnd we do agree. When Vitter and Baucus come in and agree on the same \nthing that Inhofe and Boxer have agreed to, it is a good day around \nhere. And that is what we have before us.\n  So I call on colleagues to vote aye on the cloture vote and let's get \non with this. Let's spare the people the untold suffering that will \ncome if we have to lay off 1.8 million workers and hurt more than \n11,000 businesses.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring these quorum calls be charged to both sides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. We appreciate everyone's patience. The Republican leader \nand I wanted to come and say a few words. The measure before the Senate \ntoday is moderate bipartisan legislation. Its four component parts were \nreported out of four different committees with bipartisan support. \nEighty-five Senators voted to begin debate on this legislation. As \neveryone will remember, we had to file cloture on a motion to proceed \nto this bill, and the Senate agreed we should move forward on this \nlegislation.\n  This bill will create or save 3 million middle-class jobs, and it \nenjoys broad support among rank-and-file members. Over 1,000 different \norganizations support this legislation--from the Chamber of Commerce, \nto the AFL CIO, and AAA. It has the endorsement of one of the Senate's \nmost conservative Members and one of its most liberal Members, the two \nmain managers of this legislation. Democrats and Republicans have \nagreed additionally to 30 other germane and relevant amendments, so \nthere should be nothing standing in the way of progress on this crucial \nlegislation. Yet for weeks Republicans have refused to work with \nDemocrats to finalize a path forward. So in a few moments the Senate \nwill vote on whether to end debate on this measure and to end another \nfilibuster.\n  The bill before this body is a bill that has been generated by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. We have a provision in it from \nthe Commerce Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Banking \nCommittee that is before this body. But in addition to that, we have 37 \namendments that are part of this measure that is before the body.\n  If we did nothing else but invoked cloture on this legislation and \npassed it and sent it to the House where we would have a conference, we \nwould be way ahead because this bipartisan piece of legislation would \nhelp the American people save millions of jobs.\n  It is hard to comprehend that I had to file cloture on such a \nbipartisan bill, a measure Republican President Eisenhower and \nDemocratic President Clinton could have agreed on and would have agreed \non. Forty years after President Eisenhower won passage of the first \nhighway bill, President Clinton said the law had succeeded in bringing \nAmericans closer to each other. President Clinton said:\n\n       We were connected city-to-city, town-to-town, family-to-\n     family, as we had never been before. That law did more to \n     bring Americans together than any other law in this century.\n\n  That was said by Bill Clinton, but it was almost a copy of what \nPresident Eisenhower said in his memoir about the most important thing \nhe did as President of the United States was this piece of legislation, \nand that says a lot coming from President Eisenhower.\n  I had great optimism that the transportation legislation before the \nSenate today would bring our two parties closer together as the \ninterstate highways brought the American people closer together in the \n1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. So it is disappointing that the Republican \nleadership would jeopardize this legislation and 3 million American \njobs to pursue this ideological agenda.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will vote to move this much needed jobs \nlegislation forward. Only seven Republicans are needed to allow us to \ndo this. Only 7 of the 47 have to join us and move forward, but it \nseems more likely that my Republican colleagues will continue to take \norders from the tea party and filibuster this jobs measure. Republicans \nare quite plainly holding up the surface transportation bill when they \nvote against cloture. That is what ``cloture'' means; it means the \nSenate agrees we need to focus on the germane amendments and bring \nendless debate to a close.\n  Senate Republican leaders are taking a page out of the book of the \ncarnival magician. They have been saying since February 9: Look over \nhere; look over here. They have been insisting on votes on \ncontraception, on loosening clean water standards, and on drilling for \noil pretty much anywhere there is water. But as the carnival magician \nsays: Look over here, there is no need to look over there because it is \njust an effort to divert attention from what is really happening. No \none should be fooled by what is going on here.\n  A vote against cloture is a vote against moving forward on this very \nimportant bipartisan legislation, and that is true no matter what \ndiversions anyone might use to try to distract attention from this very \nimportant piece of legislation that is now ours to move forward on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the majority leader indicated, we \nhave had a number of very constructive conversations about reaching an \nagreement on voting on both germane and nongermane amendments to this \nbill. I think we are very close to getting there. My concern is that if \ncloture is invoked right now, we would not get an agreement, and \namendments that we are very close to agreeing to have considered on \nboth sides--the amendments that are sought to be offered are not just \non the Republican side but on the Democratic side as well--will end up \nbeing shut out.\n  If we were not so close, I might have a different view, but we are \nvery close to getting an agreement. If we invoke cloture right now, \nthat agreement will not come together.\n  So I would encourage a ``no'' vote--not to stop the bill. This is a \nbill that is not going to be stopped. It has broad bipartisan support. \nSenator Boxer and Senator Inhofe have worked very hard on this \nlegislation, and we anticipate being able to wrap it up.\n  But just to underscore where we are, I have indicated I would like to \noffer a unanimous consent agreement that kind of summarizes where I \nthink we are.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that the pending Reid amendment be \nwithdrawn, that it be in order to offer a new perfecting amendment \ncleared by both leaders which contains the three titles; further, that \nthe following nonrelevant amendments be in order to S. 1813, and they \nbe subject to the 60-vote affirmative threshold; Senator Collins No. \n1660, Boiler MACT; Senator Vitter No. 1535, OCS; Wyden side-by-side \nrelevant to Hoeven No. 1537; Hoeven No. 1537 related to the Keystone \nPipeline; Levin amendment on offshore tax havens; McConnell or designee \nrelevant to Levin amendment; a Cantwell amendment on energy tax \nextenders; a McConnell or designee amendment relevant to the Cantwell \namendment; Menendez amendment on natural gas; and a Coburn amendment, \nNo. 1738, on duplication.\n\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the following highway-related \namendments also be in order: DeMint No. 1756; Coats No. 1517; Blunt No. \n1540; Paul No. 1556; Portman No. 1736; Portman No. 1742; Corker No. \n1785; Corker, on highway trust fund, No. 1786; Hutchison No. 1568; \nMcCain No. 1669; and 10 highway-related amendments to be offered by the \nmajority leader or his designee.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove-listed amendments and the managers' package of amendments to be \ncleared by both managers of the bill, the bill be read a third time and \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following passage of S. 1813, \nthe bill be held at the desk and that when the Senate receives the \ncompanion measure from the House, the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration, all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of \nS. 1813 as passed be inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill then be \nread three times and passed, the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House, and\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\nthe Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate \nwith a ratio agreed to with the concurrence of both leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I don't know why everything we do has to be a fight--not a \ndisagreement, a fight. This bill was brought up on February 7, and we \nhave been spending the better part of a month dealing with \ncontraception--by the way, an amendment I had to offer because they \nwouldn't bring it up so we could vote on it.\n  My math says this agreement that has been suggested by the Republican \nleader calls for 34 amendments. I understand and I appreciate that some \nof them are related to what is in this bill--some of them are. As I \nindicated earlier, we have been dealing with contraception. There are \namendments dealing with clean water standards and clean air standards. \nNothing in this bill should deal with America having to breathe more \nmercury, more lead, and then, just for good measure, how about some \narsenic? That has nothing to do with the highway bill.\n  As I said before, the amendment I looked at from my friend from \nLouisiana calls for drilling for oil anyplace there is water. Next they \nwill be going to Lake Mead outside Las Vegas. We are producing more \ndomestic oil now than in decades. The President has opened areas in \nAlaska that have never been opened before.\n  Why can't we just invoke cloture on this bill and move forward on it? \nIt is not easy to get to conference--we know that--but we could go to \nconference. The House is doing its best to come up with a bill. They \nare struggling hard.\n  On the first day of April, it will be April Fools' Day for a lot of \npeople in America because we will lose almost 800,000 jobs on April 1. \nIt will be a real April Fools' Day. So if we can't move forward on \nthis--why can't we get seven Republicans to break from the pack over \nhere and say that not everything we do has to be an arm-wrestling \ncontest?\n  I appreciate that we at least have something in writing. I appreciate \nthat. I will take a look at it, but I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, not to continue to debate much further, \nbut I would point out that there are demands for amendments on both \nsides here. We are very close to getting an agreement. I think a ``no'' \nvote on cloture is not the end of this bill but the beginning. It gives \nus an opportunity to go on and wrap up discussions that have been going \non entirely too long, it seems to me, and I know the majority leader \nhas been frustrated by it, and so have I. But we are very close to \ngetting agreement on a list of amendments, and we should be able to \nfinish this bill by the end of the week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am, for lack of a better word, \ndisappointed. These amendments are going to do nothing to advance the \nwork product of almost 3 million Americans--none of them.\n  We should invoke cloture. I ask my Republican colleagues: Break this \nimpasse. Do something that is good for the American people. Invoke \ncloture and stop the filibuster--another one.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Reid amendment \n     No. 1761 to S. 1813, a bill to reauthorize Federal-aid \n     highway and highway safety construction programs, and for \n     other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, Christopher A. Coons, Robert \n           P. Casey, Jr., Tom Harkin, Mark Udall, Richard \n           Blumenthal, Debbie Stabenow, Patrick J. Leahy, Herb \n           Kohl, Frank R. Lautenberg, Max Baucus, Tom Udall, Kent \n           Conrad, Robert Menendez, Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Jeff \n           Bingaman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment No. 1761, offered by the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, to S. \n1813, a bill to reauthorize Federal-aid highway and highway safety \nconstruction programs, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a \nclose?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nconfirmation of two highly qualified, consensus nominees to the Federal \nbench: Mary Elizabeth Phillips to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Missouri and Thomas Owen Rice to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Washington. I thank the majority \nleader for pressing for these votes. These are nominees who were \nreported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary Committee last October, \nalmost 5 months ago. They are both supported by their home State \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans, as are all of the judicial \nnominations of this President been who have been voted on by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Last month the majority leader had to file cloture petitions to end a \n4-month and 2-day filibuster of the confirmation of Judge Adalberto \nJordan of Florida and to end the 5 month filibuster of the nomination \nof Jesse Furman, a former counselor to Attorney General Mukasey. The \nmajority leader should not have had to file cloture petitions for the \nSenate to vote on these outstanding judicial nominees. Senate \nRepublicans have filibustered nine of President Obama's judicial \nnominations despite the fact that he has reached out to both Republican \nand Democratic home State Senators and nominated qualified, \nideologically moderate men and women to fill vacancies on our Federal \ncourts.\n  From the start of President Obama's term, Republican Senators have \napplied a double standard to this President's nominees. Last week, at a \nmeeting of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from Utah conceded that \na ``new standard'' is being applied to President Obama's nominations. \nSenate Republicans have chosen to depart dramatically from the long \ntradition of deference on district court nominees to the home State \nSenators. Instead, an unprecedented number of President Obama's highly \nqualified district court nominees have been targeted for opposition and \nobstruction.\n  The nominations the Senate considers today did not receive a single \nnegative vote in the Judiciary Committee. Still, they have been stalled \nfrom confirmation for almost 5 months. It is good that Senate \nRepublicans are finally allowing them to be considered. But we need to \ndo much more. These are only 2 of the 14 remaining judicial nominations \nvoted on by the Judiciary Committee last year that have been stalled by \nSenate Republicans for months. They all should have been considered and \nconfirmed last December. President Obama's nominees are being treated \ndifferently than those of any President, Democratic or Republican, \nbefore him.\n  Of those 14 judicial nominations still on the calendar from last \nyear, none are the kind of divisive ideological nominees that should \nlead to the kinds of delay we have seen, let alone filibusters. \nPresident Obama should be praised by Republicans and Democrats for \nmaking consensus picks like his two nominations to fill vacancies on \nFederal Circuit courts, Stephanie Dawn Thacker of West Virginia, \nnominated to the Fourth Circuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia, nominated to fill one of the many judicial emergency \nvacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Ms. Thacker, an experienced litigator \nand prosecutor, has the strong support of her home State Senators, \nSenators Rockefeller and Manchin. Judge Nguyen, whose family fled to \nthe United States in 1975 after the fall of South Vietnam, was \nconfirmed unanimously to the district court in 2009 and would become \nthe first Asian Pacific American woman to serve on a U.S. court of \nappeals. Both were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last \nyear, and both should be considered and confirmed by the Senate without \nadditional damaging delays.\n  With 1 out of nearly every 10 Federal judgeships vacant, the Senate \nshould be acting on all of the judicial nominations approved by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee but that Republican objections are stalling \nfrom final action. Regrettably, delay and obstruction have stalled \naction on President Obama's judicial nominees since the beginning of \nhis administration. After the first year of President Obama's first \nterm, only 12 Federal circuit and district court judges were confirmed, \nthe lowest total in 50 years. Senate Republicans allowed the Senate to \nconfirm only 48 circuit and district court nominations the next year. \nThat set a modern record for fewest judicial nominations confirmed \nduring a President's first 2 years in office, the lowest in 35 years. \nAs a result, judicial vacancies rose again over 110 and stayed around \n90 for the longest period of historically high vacancies in 35 years. \nThis is in stark contrast to the 100 confirmations that I oversaw \nduring the last 17 months of President Bush's first 2 years in office. \nThat action led to a significant reduction in judicial vacancies.\n  The truth is that the actions of Senate Republicans in stalling \njudicial nominations during President Obama's administration has led to \nwhat the Congressional Research Service documented as the longest \nperiod of historically high judicial vacancy rates in modern times. At \nthe end of President Obama's second year and again at the end of last \nyear, Senate Republicans opted to obstruct final confirmation votes on \nconsensus judicial nominees for no good reason. Last year it took us \nuntil June to make up the ground we lost when Senate Republicans \nrefused to complete action on judicial nominees at the end of 2010. \nThis year the Senate started with 19 judicial nominees pending on the \nSenate's calendar, all but 1 of them reported with significant \nbipartisan support, and 16 of them unanimously. To date, the Senate has \nonly been allowed to work its way through five. This means that it \ncould again be summer before the Senate is allowed to work its way \nthrough the judicial nominees who could, and should, have been \nconfirmed the year before.\n  The result of the Senate Republicans' obstruction is that the ability \nof our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around the \ncountry is compromised. Millions of Americans, who are in overburdened \ndistricts and circuits, experience unnecessary delays in having their \ncases resolved. One hundred and thirty million Americans live in \ndistricts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled \ntoday if Senate Republicans would just agree to vote on the nominations \nnow pending on the Senate calendar. It is wrong to delay votes on these \nqualified, consensus judicial nominees.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hard-working Americans who turn to \ntheir courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured \nplaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judge hears the \ncase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  In his ``2010 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary,'' Chief \nJustice Roberts rightly called attention to the problem of overburdened \ncourts across the country. Unfortunately, the unprecedented obstruction \nof consensus judicial nominations by Senate Republicans who \ndramatically departed from the Senate's longstanding tradition of \nregularly considering consensus, noncontroversial nominations, marked a \nnew chapter in what Chief Justice Roberts calls the ``persistent \nproblem'' of filling judicial vacancies.\n  If Republican Senators were concerned about ensuring that our courts \nhave the judges they need to administer justice for the American \npeople, they would not have refused consent for the Senate to consider \nthese consensus judicial nominees. The obstruction reminds me of the \nRepublican pocket filibusters that blocked more than 60 of President \nClinton's judicial nominations from Senate consideration.\n  When I became chairman in 2001 and made the committee blue slip \nprocess public for the first time and worked to confirm 100 judicial \nnominees of a conservative Republican President in 17 months, I hoped \nwe were past these partisan tactics. I am disappointed that, after \nworking for more than a decade to restore transparency and fairness to \nthe process of considering\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\njudicial nominations, we see the Senate Republicans again using \nobstruction to block progress at filling judicial vacancies.\n  I wish that the Republican Senators who came to the Senate and the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in 2003 and decried what they characterized \nas a broken judicial confirmation process would acknowledge the 100 \nconfirmations in 17 months that we accomplished in 2001 and 2002 when \nPresident Bush was not consulting closely with home State Senators and, \ninstead, insisted on sending the Senate ideological nominees. I have \ndone my part to fix and to improve the process.\n  By contrast, those Republicans who deemed filibusters \nunconstitutional and demanded up-or-down votes for every judicial \nnominee just a few years ago have now filibustered nine of President \nObama's judicial nominees. What happened to their principle that a \npartisan minority should not be allowed to frustrate the will of the \nmajority? They used to say that judicial nominees ``should not be \nrequired to serve an indefinite period of time in the stocks as targets \nfor these special interest groups that attack them on a regular \nbasis.'' Now these same Republican Senators obstruct votes on \nqualified, consensus nominees and allow reputations to be savaged \nwithout good cause.\n  In 2005, the so-called Gang of 14 adopted a standard for filibusters \nthat require ``exceptional circumstances.'' That standard was abandoned \nby Republicans who filibustered the nomination of Caitlin Halligan last \nyear. The Washington Times' banner headline on December 7, 2011, noted \nwhat had long been apparent to me: ``GOP Ends Truce on Judicial \nHopefuls.''\n  It is wrong to dismiss the delays resulting from the Senate \nRepublicans' obstruction as merely political tit for tat. These are new \nand damaging tactics that Senate Republicans have devised. The standard \nhad been that noncontroversial judicial nominees reported by the \nJudiciary Committee were confirmed by the Senate before the end of the \nyear. That is the standard we should have followed in 2010 and 2011, \nbut Senate Republicans did not. Senate Republicans set a new and \ndestructive standard to hold up qualified, consensus judicial nominees \nfor no good reason. A New York Times editorial from January 4, 2011, \nrefers to Senate Republicans' ``refusal to give prompt consideration to \nnoncontroversial nominees'' a ``terrible precedent.'' In a column last \nweek, the president of the American Bar Association reiterated the call \nfor a ``sustained, concerted and bipartisan effort'' to ``make \nmeaningful progress toward filling vacancies on the federal bench.\n  While consensus judicial nominations are stalled without a final vote \nby the Senate, millions of Americans across the country are being \nharmed by delays. The American people and our Federal courts cannot \nafford these unnecessary and damaging delays. As the ABA president \nnoted last week:\n\n       Backlogs mean justice delayed in cases involving protection \n     of individual rights, advancement of business interests, \n     compensation of injured victims and enforcement of federal \n     laws.\n       Longstanding vacancies on courts with staggering caseloads \n     impede access to the courts. They create strains that, if not \n     eased, threaten to reduce the quality of our justice system. \n     They erode confidence in the courts' ability to uphold \n     constitutional rights and render fair and timely decisions.\n       Delay at the federal courts puts people's lives on hold \n     while they wait for their cases to be resolved. Businesses \n     face uncertainty and costly holdups, preventing them from \n     investing and creating jobs. In sum, judicial vacancies kill \n     jobs.\n       Justice delayed, as the famous maxim goes, is justice \n     denied. It's bad for business, it's unfair to individuals, \n     and it slows government enforcement actions, which ultimately \n     costs taxpayers money.\n\n  The Senate remains far behind where we should be in considering \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations. The Senate had confirmed a \nlower percentage of President Obama's judicial nominees than those of \nany President in the last 35 years. The Senate has confirmed just over \n70 percent of President Obama's circuit and district nominees, with \nmore than one in four not confirmed. In stark contrast, the Senate \nconfirmed nearly 87 percent of President George W. Bush's nominees, \nnearly 9 out of every 10 nominees he sent to the Senate over two terms.\n  The Senate remains well behind the pace set during President Bush's \nfirst term. By the end of President Bush's first term, the Senate had \nconfirmed 205 district and circuit nominees. To date now in the fourth \nyear of President Obama's first term, the Senate has confirmed only 129 \ndistrict and circuit nominees. By this date in 2004, the Senate had \nconfirmed 170 district and circuit nominees. Today the total is more \nthan 40 confirmations shy of the mark.\n  Another way to think about this is that during President Bush's first \nterm, the Senate confirmed the 130th nominee to our circuit and \ndistrict courts in early June of his third year in office. Here we are, \napproaching the spring of President Obama's fourth year, nearly 9 \nmonths later, and we are just reaching that milestone--9 months later. \nIt has taken us far too long to reach this point. That is why the \njudicial vacancy rate remains nearly double what it was at this point \nin the Bush administration.\n  Today we can finally confirm these two highly qualified, consensus \nnominees. Mary Elizabeth Phillips has been nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Missouri. Ms. Phillips is \nthe first woman to serve as the U.S. attorney for the Western District \nof Missouri. Her nomination has the bipartisan support of both of her \nhome State Senators, Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill and Republican \nSenator Roy Blunt. Ms. Phillips previously worked in private practice \nand as a local prosecutor Jackson County, MO. The ABA's Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated her ``well \nqualified'' to serve on the U.S District Court, its highest possible \nrating.\n  Thomas Owen Rice has been nominated to the U.S. District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Washington. Currently the first assistant U.S. \nattorney in the Eastern District of Washington, Mr. Rice has spent his \nentire career in public service as a Federal prosecutor, including as \nchief of the Criminal Division in the Eastern District of Washington. \nBoth of Washington's Senators Senators Murray and Cantwell--support Mr. \nRice's nomination. Both of these nominations were reported by the \nJudiciary Committee by voice vote with no dissent nearly 5 months ago \nin October 2011.\n  I thank the majority leader for his efforts to break through the \nRepublicans' obstructionist tactics. Last Tuesday, several other \nDemocratic Senators also came before the Senate to talk about the need \nfor more action to fill the judicial vacancies that have remained \nhistorically high for far too long. I thank Senators Durbin, Schumer, \nFeinstein, Coons, Cardin, and Klobuchar for their involvement and their \nthoughtful statements.\n  Last Thursday, we had a discussion before the Judiciary Committee, as \nwell. I commended Senator Coburn for the statement he made at that time \nin which he called upon Senators to step back and return to the \npractice of moving forward on consensus nominees and that we need to \nbuild bridges instead of burn them.\n  It is important that we confirm these two nominees so they can serve \nthe people of Missouri and Washington, but we need to do much more. The \nSenate needs to proceed without delay to consider all 20 of the \njudicial nominees currently before it and to promptly consider those \nbeing sent to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee. That is how we can \nfulfill our responsibilities to the American people. That is how we can \nbegin to restore the American's people's confidence in this \ninstitution.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                  Remembering Congressman Donald Payne\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a long-time \nfriend from New Jersey. It is a sad day for all of us from New Jersey \nwho knew Congressman Donald Payne from north New Jersey, and I pay \ntribute to my colleague who died this morning after a battle with colon \ncancer.\n  Congressman Payne was the first African American from New Jersey to \nbe elected to Congress. He was a trailblazer and a fine leader, one of \nthe finest our State has ever known. For more than two decades, \nCongressman Payne served New Jersey with distinction, but the whole \nworld benefited from his leadership. He was a proud son of Newark and \nbecame an expert on foreign relations and led efforts to restore \ndemocracy and human rights around the world, including places as far \naway from one another as northern Ireland and Sudan. President Clinton \nchose Congressman Payne to accompany him on his historic tour of Africa \nin 1998.\n  The Congressman also worked hard. He secured more than $100 million \nto treat victims of malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS, and stopped \nthe spread of these diseases in Africa's poorest nations.\n  Three years ago, against the State Department's advice, Congressman \nPayne went to Somalia to see the turmoil there for himself, narrowly \nescaping with his life when insurgents launched a mortar attack near \nhis airplane when he was leaving.\n  The Congressman also helped with passage of a resolution declaring \nthe killings in Darfur as genocide and raising global awareness of \nthese travesties.\n  At home Congressman Payne was a tireless advocate for his \nconstituents. He brought significant economic development to counties \nin New Jersey, including Essex, Hudson, and Union. He was a former \nschoolteacher and was a leader on education. He worked hard to close \nthe achievement gap, with making college more affordable and bringing \nmore equity to school funding. Congressman Donald Payne was a man of \nconscience and conviction.\n  I knew him for many years, and I was always struck by his soft-spoken \ndemeanor, and that kind of made him a rarity in politics. But \nCongressman Payne knew he didn't need to raise his voice; his ideas \nwere powerful enough. The Congressman put it best when he said: ``There \nis a lot of dignity in being able to achieve things without having to \ncreate rapture.''\n  As I mentioned, Donald Payne was a teacher in the Newark public \nschools, and Newark was a poverty-stricken city. His mission was to \ninspire young people to use education in their lives to\n\n[[Page S1414]]\n\nachieve opportunity. The people of New Jersey sent him to Washington \nfor the first time in 1988, and they continued sending him back by \noverwhelming margins for the next 22 years. He became an inspiration to \nmany, including members of his family who followed him into careers in \npublic service.\n  But most of all, Donald Payne was an inspiration to the people he \nserved. He gave them hope. He gave them some ideas of what they could \nmake of their lives. His voice sounded important and deliberate enough \nto convince people to try harder, and he did succeed many times.\n  In 1988, during his first campaign for the House, Congressman Payne \ntold a reporter: ``I want to be a role model for the kids I talk to on \nthe street corners.'' He used to see a lot of them. He worked hard \nwithin his congressional district. He said: ``I want to see there are \nno barriers to achievement.''\n  Donald Payne achieved this goal. An entire generation of New \nJerseyans has come of age knowing and respecting Congressman Donald \nPayne. He has undoubtedly inspired many young New Jerseyans to enter \npublic service, and I expect we will one day see some of them walking \nthe Halls of Congress and following in Donald Payne's footsteps, but \ntoday these Halls feel emptier without his presence.\n  I am going to miss Don Payne. We will mourn his absence from our \nlives, but we will also take comfort in the knowledge that his legacy \nwill endure for a long time to come, way beyond his life. We thank him \nat this time for all of the good he did and that he brought to our \npeople and our State.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                         Indiana Tornado Damage\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I wish to speak as in morning business on a \nmatter that affects a lot of Hoosiers. I do so with a great sense of \nheartfelt condolence to all who have suffered from the tragic storm and \ntornadoes that swept across the southern part of our State this past \nFriday, gratitude for all of those who responded in such a wonderful \nway to address this situation, and deep pride for the people of Indiana \nfor how they have come together to help one another. Mother Nature's \nunforgiving force Friday afternoon, changed the lives of many Hoosiers. \nImagine, if you would, a stretch of land extending for nearly 50 miles, \nbetween a quarter of a mile and a half mile wide, with everything in \nits path destroyed by tornadoes that touched down and moved with such \nunimaginable force.\n  Most of us from the Midwest are used to tornadoes that usually jump \naround and take out a shed here, a barn there, maybe a home, in perhaps \na short stretch of space, but I have never seen--and most have never \nseen--a tornado that touches down and stays down for miles and miles \nwith 175 mile-per-hour winds crushing everything in its path. On \nSunday, I flew over the path of the tornadoes and walked on the ground \nand saw a site of total destruction. Every home and every business in \nthat path destroyed. Every open field was strewn with debris. Some \ndebris carried for miles before it was deposited. Every tree was \nstripped bare and flattened, every car or truck within that path \ndamaged with either softball-sized hail or turned upside down by 175 \nmile-per-hour winds. A house miraculously still intact was picked up \noff its foundation and moved 100 yards east.\n  Several rural towns--small rural towns in southern Indiana--were \ntotally destroyed by the force of nature. A high school of more than \n1,100 students now lies in complete shambles. Buses stationed at the \nschools and cars were hurled into the buildings across the street. An \nentire family--mom, dad, and children--were killed just because the \nstorm hit seconds before they were able to reach the steps leading down \nto the basement.\n  Yet, through all of these devastating images, I saw and heard \nfirsthand stories of heroism, generosity and resolve that I will always \nremember:\n  Two schoolbus drivers who made a split-second decision to turn around \nand get the kids off the bus and into a shelter--both of those buses \nwere totally destroyed just moments later. The first responders, local \npolice, fire, and rescue teams who searched for victims, helped the \ninjured and did everything they could to offer support in light of this \ntragedy; neighbors who rushed in to help the injured, citizens from \nnearby towns and counties who poured into the area offering food and \ndrink and shelter; people saying: Do you have a place to stay? Do you \nhave something to eat? What can we do to help? Former strangers became \nimmediate friends.\n  On Sunday morning, as I walked through what was the town of \nHenryville, I witnessed a remarkable scene: displaced homeowners \npicking through the rubble of their homes trying to recover lost \nmemories and precious keepsakes; one man planting an American flag on \nthe rubble of his former home. I was deeply moved by the indomitability \nof the American spirit, a spirit still so alive and well in a time of \ntragedy.\n  Soon the first responders will be returning home, if they haven't \nalready, from a job well done, to wait for the next call to action \nwhile the State and Federal assessment teams begin the process of \nrestoration. Piece by piece, day by day, the people of Indiana will \nrebuild their homes, their churches, their schools, and their \ncommunities destroyed by these tornadoes. One woman captured the \nfeeling of Hoosiers' best when she turned to me while standing on the \nremains of what used to be her home and said: We will go on. We will \nrecover. We will make it right again.\n  I am asking all Americans to keep Hoosiers, Kentuckians, and all of \nthe victims of these tragic storms which raced through the Midwest in \ntheir thoughts and prayers. I ask all Americans to remember how quickly \nlife can change, but also to remember the American spirit which compels \nus to reach out and help a neighbor in trouble.\n  I am going to continue to work with Indiana Governor Daniels, his \nhomeland security team, the administration, and FEMA to make sure \nHoosiers and the communities impacted are receiving the help they need.\n  We will never be able to replace the lives of those lost from Mother \nNature's destruction, but Hoosiers will come together to rebuild one \nday at a time. It is the Hoosier way, and thank goodness it is still \nthe American way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the order now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the Transportation \nbill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                         Talk Has Consequences\n\n  Mr. President, several of us in the Senate have run for the office of \nPresident of the United States. Two of us have been our party's \nnominees, and dozens of others have played major roles in tough \ncampaigns. So none of us in the Senate are strangers to the rough and \ntumble of American politics. I think we all understand on a personal \nlevel what the humorist said at the turn of the century when he wrote: \n``Politics ain't beanbag.'' One has to have a thick skin and a strong \nbackbone to survive in this business. One has to be able to take a \npunch and deliver one, and we all understand that.\n  So it is not as an innocent that I come to the floor today to say \nthat I was troubled--deeply troubled--to read an op-ed in this \nmorning's Washington Post by the likely Republican nominee for \nPresident Mitt Romney. It was an attack on the administration's Iran \npolicy, and it was as inaccurate as it was aggressive.\n  Every candidate for the Oval Office has the right to criticize the \nPresident. But, particularly this week, while Prime Minister Netanyahu \nis in Washington meeting with the administration to determine the road \nforward that might mean the difference between war or a diplomatic \nsolution--particularly at that moment when so much is on the line, we \nall ought to remember that the nuclear issue with Iran is deadly \nserious business, and it ought to invite sobriety and serious-minded \nsolutions, not sloganeering and fiction and sound bites.\n  I don't think we should allow Iran to become another party's applause \nline on the Presidential stump. Talk has consequences, particularly \nwhen it is talk about war, and talk of war only helps Iran and others \nat this moment, by increasing the price of Iranian crude\n\n[[Page S1415]]\n\noil that pays for its nuclear program. To create false differences with \nthe President just to score political points does nothing to move Iran \noff a dangerous nuclear course. Worst of all, Governor Romney's op-ed \ndoes not even do readers the courtesy of describing how a President \nRomney would, in fact, do anything different from what President Obama \nand this administration has already done. So if we are going to \ndisagree, let's at least disagree responsibly--and honestly.\n  So examine the op-ed I am talking about. From the very opening \nparagraphs, Mr. Romney garbles history. Going back to the Iranian \nrevolution, he calls President Carter ``feckless,'' saying he did \nnothing for over a year while Iranian revolutionaries held Americans \ncaptive. In fact, it was the months of President Carter's negotiations, \nleading up to an all-night session of negotiation--the very night \nbefore the inauguration of President Reagan on January 20--that \nactually freed the hostages.\n  I bring up the hostage crisis for another reason, because when those \nhelicopters went down in the desert during the failed rescue attempt in \n1980, the United States not only lost the opportunity to get our people \nback sooner but President Carter fundamentally lost any chance he had \nat reelection. Notwithstanding that reality, notwithstanding the lesson \nof Desert One and those helicopters that crashed and the failed \nmission--notwithstanding that--President Obama, whom Governor Romney \ncalls ``the most feckless President since Carter,'' threw that lesson \nout the window, knowing if he attempted to go into Pakistan and failed \nhe would probably lose his chance at reelection--notwithstanding that, \nhe authorized the gutsy and dangerous raid in Pakistan that finally \nkilled Osama bin Laden.\n  Despite everything that could have gone wrong with that raid, the \nmission was ordered with confidence, executed with courage, and the man \nwho plotted the September 11 attacks was finally held accountable for \nthe murder of thousands of Americans. George W. Bush may have said, \n``Wanted: Dead or Alive,'' but it was President Obama who delivered.\n\n  I don't know if Governor Romney has checked the definition of the \nword ``feckless'' lately, but that raid ain't it.\n  The rest of Romney's argument doesn't get any better. In fact, he \ngoes on to propose action after action that President Obama has already \ntaken. Just look at the analysis. Let me read the first sentences from \nan article in today's New York Times:\n\n       To rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions, Mitt Romney says he \n     would conduct naval exercises in the Persian Gulf. . . . He \n     would try to ratchet up Security Council sanctions on Iran, \n     targeting its Revolutionary Guards, and the country's central \n     bank and other financial institutions. And if Russia and \n     China do not go along, he says, the United States should team \n     up with other willing governments to put such punitive \n     measures in place. As it turns out--\n\n  And this is part of the quote--\n\n       As it turns out, that amounts to what President Obama is \n     doing.\n\n  Ambassador Nick Burns, President Bush's lead negotiator on Iran, \nsaid:\n\n       The attacks on Obama basically say, ``He's weak and we're \n     strong.'' But when you look at the specifics, you don't see \n     any difference.\n\n  That is a quote.\n  So let's go point by point through the Romney plan. He writes he \nwould proceed with missile defenses to protect Iran. He ignores the \nfact that one of the very first things the Obama administration did was \nto issue its plans for the phased adaptive approach--so that we would \nbe able to sooner protect our friends and allies against the Iranian \nmissile threat and to provide increasing levels of capability as the \ntechnology advances. During the debate over the New START treaty, the \nSenate heard in great detail--including from the Commander of the \nStrategic Command and the Director of the Missile Defense Agency--how \nthat particular system was going to work and how the administration \nplanned to proceed with it. In fact, the President sent the Senate a \nletter affirming his commitment to missile defense, and over the past \nyear he has stuck by that promise.\n  So then Romney goes on to say that President Obama doesn't understand \nthe seriousness of the threat from nuclear terrorism. Again, just look \nat the record: For the first time, the President set as a national goal \nsecuring all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within 4 \nyears. He won international endorsement of that effort at the 2010 \nNuclear Security Summit.\n  Last year alone, the Department of Energy removed or eliminated over \n250 kilograms of highly enriched uranium from places such as Ukraine, \nBelarus, Serbia, and Kazakhstan. In the budget request before Congress, \nthe administration plans to eliminate highly enriched uranium from nine \ncountries, including Vietnam, Ukraine, and Mexico.\n  That is clearly an administration and leader who understands the \ndanger of nuclear material, far more than any effort previously.\n  Then Romney lays out the single greatest willful avoidance of facts \nin his article. He calls for ever-tightening sanctions on Iran.\n  I don't know what he thinks has been going on around here for the \nlast few years, but when President Obama took office Iran was in the \nascendancy. As the Vice President used to say when he chaired the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee: Freedom wasn't on the march; Iran \nwas on the march. Its reach through proxies such as Hezbollah \nthreatened the United States, its allies, and the region, and \nparticularly, obviously, Israel.\n  The international community was divided; diplomacy--both multilateral \nand bilateral--was stalled. But in June 2010, with a decisive push from \nPresident Obama, the United Nations put in place the most comprehensive \nand biting international sanctions the Iranian Government has ever \nfaced--imposing restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities, ballistic \nmissile program, conventional military exports to Iran, Iranian banks \nand financial transactions, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n  What is more, in coordination with allies such as the European Union, \nJapan, South Korea, Australia, Canada, and others, the Obama \nadministration put in place additional measures, ratcheting up pressure \non the country's petrochemical industry, oil and gas industry, and \nfinancial sector. Recently, Europe announced the ban of oil imports \nfrom Iran, which will further pressure Iran's economy, and that has \ncome with significant leadership effort and diplomacy by Secretary \nClinton and by the administration and Secretary Geithner.\n  That is just on the multilateral front. President Obama also worked \nclosely with Congress to pass the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \nAccountability, and Investment Act, which strengthened existing U.S. \nsanctions. He made it harder for the Iranian Government to buy refined \npetroleum and to modernize its oil and gas sector. Recently, we imposed \ntough new sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran. So one doesn't have to \ntake my word for it.\n  Let me quote Iran's President Ahmadinejad, who is the one feeling the \npressure. Here is what he said last fall: ``Our banks cannot make \ninternational transactions anymore.''\n  Today, all of these sanctions are beginning to bite. Iran is now \nvirtually cut off from large parts of the international financial \nsystem.\n  Almost $60 billion in energy-related projects in Iran have been put \non hold or discontinued. Iran is starting to lose oil sales to key \ncustomers in Europe and Asia. All you have to do is look at the front \npage of today's newspapers and read the stories of Iran hastily running \naround and looking for additional people to buy their oil. In fact, \nthey have lost customers in Asia. Those losses could reach up to 40 \npercent of its daily sales, according to the International Energy \nAgency.\n  Banking sanctions have prevented several of Iran's customers from \npaying for its petroleum products, leaving the Central Bank short of \nhard currency and driving down the unofficial foreign exchange rate by \n40 percent in a single month.\n  Mr. Romney needs to understand what is going on if he wants to run \nfor President. Just yesterday the deputy chief of the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard Corps was quoted as saying, ``The regime is at the \nheight of isolation.'' This is the Revolutionary Guard speaking:\n\n       The regime is at the height of isolation and in the midst \n     of a technological, scientific and economic siege. We are not \n     in a situation of imaginary threats and sanctions. Threats \n     and sanctions against us are effectively being pursued.\n\n\n[[Page S1416]]\n\n\n  Iran is also divided internally and isolated diplomatically like \nnever before. Iran's most important ally, Syria, is facing regime \ncollapse, which a former director of Israel's Mossad recently said \ncould be a bigger strategic setback for Iran than a military strike \nagainst them. That came from the former director of Israel's Mossad.\n  To talk about Israel for a second, we all ought to remember that \nPresident Obama has provided record amounts of security funding to help \nIsrael maintain its qualitative military edge. Prime Minister Netanyahu \nhas spoken of President Obama's ironclad commitment to Israel's \nsecurity. He said, ``Our security cooperation is unprecedented, and \nPresident Obama has backed those words with deeds.''\n  So when you add it all up, Mitt Romney evidently is trying to ignore, \ntwist, and distort the administration's policy. For what purpose? For \nhis own gain--simply to try to drive a wedge in American politics. It \nseems to be that the strategy of his campaign is to just say anything. \nIt does not matter what it is based on--just say it. Put it out there \nwhether or not it is true.\n  I might say that I think that is exactly what the American people are \ntired of and fed up with, what has turned them off of all of our \npolitics, and what threatens the quality of our democracy in this great \ncountry of ours.\n  We should be crystal clear. Yes, we have to prevent Iran from \nacquiring a nuclear weapon. That is not a question of containment and \nnever has been; it is a question of prevention, outright denial of this \nability. That is why President Obama again made that clear in his \npublic comments yesterday, even as he builds pressure for a diplomatic \nsolution.\n  I think it is appropriate to have a President who first seeks a \ndiplomatic solution. I am one of those here in the Senate who, together \nwith a few others of our generation, served in Vietnam--very few--and \nwith one or two, I think, who served in World War II: Senator Inouye, \nSenator Lautenberg, maybe Senator Cochran. I don't recall if there are \nstill more here. But the fact is that I think anybody who has served in \na war first wants leaders who try to find if there is a way to make \nthat war inevitable, if it has to happen, and at least turns over every \nstone possible to find out if diplomacy can find a solution to a \nproblem.\n  President Obama has reiterated that all of the options are on the \ntable. In its long history, Iran has had many amazing moments and has \nprovided great accomplishments, culturally and in other ways, to its \nhistory and to all of us. This regime, many people believe, is \nsomething different and some hope might even become something different \nat some point in time, although it has a long way to go to evidence \nthat. But President Obama has emphasized--in his approach, he has said, \n``I don't bluff.'' I am convinced, as I think all of us are, that the \nPresident means exactly what he says, that Iran cannot have this \nweapon. I think you can ask Osama bin Laden what President Obama means \nwhen he says that he means what he says.\n  I know we are going to have tough debates going forward. That is \nappropriate. And we are going to have a bruising election season. That \nis OK if it is on the up-and-up, if it is really about real differences \nand real issues. And we ought to have those tough fights. That has \nproven to be how we decide the big issues in the United States. We \nalways have. But let's have an honest debate, not a contrived one, not \na phony set of propositions that have nothing to do with the reality of \nthe situation. The American people deserve more than that.\n  Governor Romney can debate the man in the White House instead of \ninventing straw men on the op-ed pages of our newspapers. He ought to \nbe armed with facts instead of empty rhetoric.\n  If we are going to succeed, as the American people want us to do in \norder to avoid a war in Iran, then at some point all of us have to act \nlike statesmen, not candidates. We need to be clear-eyed about what we \nhave accomplished and what we have yet to do. That is precisely what \nAmericans expect from their Commander in Chief, and that is exactly \nwhat Americans deserve--no less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Remembering Congressman Don Payne\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to mourn the passing of a great \nman, a great leader, a proud New Jerseyan, and my friend, Congressman \nDonald Payne. I am saddened beyond words by his death. Personally, I \nhave lost a close friend and the people of New Jersey have lost a \ntireless voice, a true advocate who spent a lifetime fighting for \nfairness, for justice, and for the little guy.\n  Wherever there was injustice, intolerance or suffering, wherever \nsomeone was downtrodden by the more powerful and didn't have a fair \nchance, Donald Payne was there intervening. From his earliest days in \nCongress, he focused on New Jersey, but his influence was profoundly \nfelt around the world. As a senior member of the House Committee on \nForeign Affairs and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa, \nGlobal Health, and Human Rights, Donald Payne followed his passion to \nrestore democracy and human rights in places where the suffering was \ngreatest.\n  If we asked him what his greatest accomplishment was--and there were \nmany--he would tell us it was working on global health issues, \ncofounding the Malaria Caucus that he launched with First Lady Laura \nBush, securing $50 million to fight drug-resistant tuberculosis, and \n$50 billion for HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria that literally--and I have \nheard these stories--literally saved whole villages in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica, because that is the kind of man he was.\n  He built a reputation as chairman of the Africa and Global Health \nSubcommittee for his integrated approach to Africa, combining health, \ndevelopment, economic growth, and improvements for a better quality of \nlife. He once said:\n\n       Malaria, TB and HIV/AIDS are diseases that are caused, as \n     well, by poverty, and until we really start dealing with \n     poverty elimination, we are going to continue to have these \n     diseases that follow poverty. We cannot be serious about \n     development [assistance or engagement] without effectively \n     dealing with these three major diseases.\n\n  He did everything he could to live up to those words.\n  He could not ignore the fact, as he pointed out, that:\n\n       . . . more than 29 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa \n     live with HIV/AIDS . . . that malaria and HIV together kill \n     more than 4 million people each year . . . that 90 percent of \n     them are in Africa . . . that, for millions around the \n     world--particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the global \n     malaria burden is heaviest--the disease is a daily reality, \n     an enduring epidemic that kills millions and impedes the \n     progress of entire nations . . .\n\n  He believed in putting an end to the scourge of these diseases and \nhelped broaden our focus in dealing with poverty, disease, and \ndevelopment as a single issue and always said: ``These are global \nproblems that warrant a global collaborative approach . . . ''\n  On World Malaria Day in 2010 he said: ``This is not an endeavor for \nwhich we lack the knowledge, skills or resources to win . . . ''\n  Donald Payne was determined to win.\n  When he put his mind to it, he could do anything. He believed he \ncould change the world one village at a time, and he did because that \nis the kind of man he was.\n  I served with Donald Payne in the House. I got to know him. I grew to \nrespect his deep and passionate commitment to the institution and the \npeople he served, his belief in the process as it was intended by our \nFounders, to bring all of us together, no matter what our politics or \npersuasion, to make a difference for his district, for New Jersey, for \nthe Nation, and for people around the world.\n  Donald considered himself hugely lucky to serve. He saw it as a honor \nand he made a difference because that too is the kind of man he was. \nDonald Payne was a Congressman's Congressman. To me he was what public \nservice is all about. He embodied the concept of Congress, the assembly \nof a few good people committed to the betterment of all of us.\n\n[[Page S1417]]\n\n  In his passion for these issues, he worked in common cause to bring \ntogether people who were often from totally different ends of the \npolitical spectrum. Many of us would refer to him as ``the great \nconvener'' because he had the unique ability to bring together people \nof disparate beliefs on behalf of these issues he believed in and felt \nso passionately about.\n  Don's career and accomplishments were exemplary. Before he was \nelected to Congress, he was an educator in the Newark and Passaic \nPublic School Districts. He was the former national president of the \nYMCA. He became New Jersey's first African-American Congressman, \nwinning election overwhelmingly in 1988, and was serving, at the time \nof his death, his 12th consecutive term--this year. He was a senior \nmember of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and he \nwas a steadfast vocal advocate for early childhood education. He was \ninstrumental in making K 12 education more successful and for making \ncollege more affordable. He worked to cut in half the cost of the \nStafford loans and increased the Pell grants. He was a tireless \nchampion of working families, always an advocate of increasing the \nminimum wage, always enforcing workforce protections, because that is \nthe kind of man Donald Payne was. Through his life and service, he was \na man of the people, and the people of New Jersey will never forget \nwhat he did for Essex, Hudson, and Union Counties or for the State as a \nwhole.\n\n  In the end Congressman Payne will be remembered for the dignity and \nhonor he brought to this institution and the Congress and the district \nhe represented, always putting the interests of the community, New \nJersey, and humanity first, because that is the kind of man he was. \nDonald made New Jersey proud, and he will forever be missed by all of \nus who were touched by his warmth and compassion. I join my colleagues \nin mourning the passing of a great man.\n  I visited Congressman Payne on Saturday at the hospital and talked to \nhis brother, who said leaders throughout the world had been calling to \ninquire as to how he was. Leaders throughout the world mourn his \npassing. They knew how he touched the lives of their citizens.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to Donald's beloved children and his \nentire family and all of those who were touched by him throughout his \nlife. He will be missed and we certainly hope God will bless this great \nman who gave back much more than he ever received in life.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nindividual who worked tirelessly to strengthen Kentucky's economy \nthrough his contributions to the coal and the banking industries. James \nLawrence ``Jim'' Rose of Lexington, KY, passed away on December 19, \n2011. He was 73 years old. Although Mr. Lawrence may not be with us \ntoday, the legacy he has forged throughout his lifetime will carry on \nfor many years to come.\n  Jim Lawrence was born in Clay County, KY, but received his education \nin the small town of Berea, where he graduated from the Berea \nFoundation High School and Berea College before completing his \neducation at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. Jim was \npassionate about education and made it a priority for himself, and he \nset out to make it one for the youth of the Commonwealth as well. He \nwas in large part responsible for the project to construct Lexington \nChristian Academy's 75-acre ``Rose Campus'' in Lexington, KY.\n  Although Mr. Rose was involved in all sorts of different business \naspects, his most noted business accomplishments were those in the \nbanking and coal industries. Mr. Rose returned to Clay County and \nstarted a small coal company in 1959. Over the next three decades, his \nbusiness would receive numerous national awards for conducting the best \nmining rescues and operating the safest mines in the United States, and \nthe company would eventually grow to be one of the top three producers \nof coal in the State of Kentucky upon his retirement in 1993.\n  Mr. Rose made tremendous strides in the world of banking as well. He \nformed a bank holding company in his hometown of Manchester, KY; the \ntown served as the site where Jim would also open his first bank in \n1978. He went on to open seven more banks throughout central and \nsouthern Kentucky. Mr. Rose was an exceptional consultant and manager, \nand under him the many banks he had acquired flourished.\n  We are all undoubtedly aware that Mr. Rose made a permanent mark on \nthe economy of Kentucky, but let us not forget today that Jim was first \nand foremost a devout man of God and a beloved family man. Mr. Rose was \na husband and a father who is survived by his wife of 49 years, Judy \nSizemore Rose, and by his son James F. Rose and by his daughter Sonya \nRose Hiler. Jim also leaves behind eight grandchildren and three step-\ngrandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son, Dwayne Scott Rose.\n  The legacy left by Mr. Rose is one that will not be easily forgotten. \nHe was able to give so much to the business world, working tirelessly \nfor the people of Kentucky, and he was also able to pour his heart into \nbuilding relationships with his employees and his family members. Mr. \nRose led a life that one could be nothing but proud of.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join \nme in commemorating the life and works of Mr. James Lawrence Rose, an \ninnovative, committed and truly genuine entrepreneur.\n  There was an article recently printed in the Laurel County-area \npublication the Sentinel Echo on the accomplished life of Mr. James \nLawrence ``Jim'' Rose. I ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel Echo, Dec. 23, 2011]\n\n                 Bank, Coal Company Founder Dies at 73\n\n                            (By Carol Mills)\n\n       James ``Jim'' Rose, 73, died Monday of complications from a \n     heart attack in Lexington.\n       Rose, who moved to Lexington in 1988, was a former Laurel \n     Countian. He began his career by starting a small coal \n     company in 1959 in Clay County where he was born. He moved \n     his family to Laurel County in 1975.\n       Over three decades he grew his coal business dramatically, \n     founding Interstate Coal Company, which had several \n     operations in eastern Kentucky, including one in Laurel \n     County on Ky. 192 where College Park is now. The coal stacks \n     are still on the property, which is owned by the city and the \n     county. Rose retired from the coal business in 1993.\n       While Rose was still in the coal business, he entered the \n     banking business by buying a bank in his hometown of \n     Manchester in 1978. He formed a bank holding company, United \n     Bancorp of Kentucky, and acquired seven additional banks in \n     London (London Bank & Trust, now PNC), Danville, \n     Nicholasville, Richmond, Versailles, Corbin, and Harlan. \n     United Bancorp merged with National City in 1995.\n       Lawrence Kuhl went to work for Rose at the London Bank & \n     Trust in 1983 as vice-president and two years later as \n     president.\n       ``He was an outstanding person,'' Kuhl said. ``He was so \n     compassionate for humanity. He loved to help people in need. \n     He hired a number of people throughout southeastern Kentucky \n     to work in his coal mines as well as in his banks, and he was \n     a very, very caring person. He helped a lot of individuals. \n     His whole family is like that. He has given Cardinal Hill \n     millions of dollars to help recuperate people. He was a super \n     fellow, very intelligent, a good businessman.''\n       Charles Elza worked for Rose as president of London Bank & \n     Trust for seven years from 1978 to 1985 before Kuhl took the \n     helm.\n       ``He was a great guy, a hard worker,'' Elza said. ``He was \n     a great family man. He loved his kids. He and his wife really \n     had a heart for people who had a hard time. He worked hard. \n     Before he made a lot of money, I heard\n\n[[Page S1418]]\n\n     he would go to work in the coal business Monday morning and \n     wouldn't come home until Friday. He would sleep on the job. \n     He provided a lot of jobs for people.\n       ``I was in the coal business, too, before working at the \n     bank,'' Elza recalled. ``My brother and I sold coal to \n     Interstate Coal Company, which he (Rose) owned.''\n       Dr. Paul Smith and his wife, Ann, have been friends with \n     Rose ever since he moved his family to London from \n     Manchester.\n       ``We got acquainted through our children,'' Ann Smith said. \n     ``They were all in the band, some played sports. We went to \n     what our children did and they went to what their children \n     did and we just got together. We had the same values in \n     rearing our family.\n       ``Mr. Rose was a wonderful man,'' she added. ``He was \n     absolutely a good man. He was a hard worker, he was always \n     helping someone out, and he walked the talk. He was nice, and \n     so is Judy (wife). They're both very talented musicians. Jim \n     was a classical pianist, just as well as playing boogie, \n     woogie. They're just a wonderful family. Jim was a good \n     person to work for. He was very well liked by his workers. He \n     was very fair and just.''\n       Rose was a graduate of Berea Foundation High School and \n     attended Berea College and the University of Kentucky. He \n     served in leadership positions in numerous coal and banking \n     organizations. He was also active in civic and charitable \n     organizations such as the Scott Rose Foundation, which was \n     formed in memory of his son, Dwayne Scott, who was killed in \n     an automobile crash in Richmond. The foundation helps \n     mentally and physically handicapped people. Rose also started \n     the Scott Rose Games in honor of his late son. The games, \n     which helped raise money for charity, ran its course after \n     several years and was discontinued.\n       Rose had served on the boards of UK., Centre College, Lees \n     College, and the U.K. Medical Center, and was a founding \n     member of Kentucky Educational Television (KET).\n       He leaves his wife Judy Sizemore Rose, a son James \n     ``Jamie'' Rose, a daughter Sonya Rose Hiler, eight \n     grandchildren, and three step-grandchildren.\n       Services were Thursday at the Lexington Christian Academy \n     chapel and a private burial will follow at a later date at \n     A.R. Dyche Memorial Park in London.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/06/senate-section/article/S1418-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING WILLIAM SCHUBERT\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Shortly after his arrival on \ncampus, he was drafted into the U.S. Navy. After his service in the \nNavy, Dr. Schubert graduated from the University of Cincinnati and the \nUniversity of Cincinnati College of Medicine.\n  Bill Schubert's 33 year career at Cincinnati Children's Hospital \nMedical Center included 13 years of service as the center's president \nand chief executive officer. Under his leadership, Cincinnati \nChildren's Hospital Medical Center was ranked within the top 5 best \npediatric medical centers in our country and was also designated as a \nLevel 1 pediatric trauma center. Some of his other notable career \nachievements include establishing new clinical and research divisions \nfor the center and overseeing the opening of the hospital's first two \nsatellite outpatient centers.\n  In addition to his service to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital \nMedical Center, Bill Schubert remained active in the Cincinnati \ncommunity through his involvement in various local and national \norganizations. In 1993, he was named a Great Living Cincinnatian by the \nGreater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.

Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the \n60th anniversary of Young Audiences Arts for Learning and commend it \nfor its contributions to our Nation's school children. Young Audiences \nis the Nation's leading source of arts-in-education services. Comprised \nof 30 affiliates and 5,000 teaching artists, Young Audiences, in 2011 \nalone, reached 5 million children in over 6,000 schools.\n  Specifically, I would like to recognize the Young Audiences affiliate \nin my home state of Ohio, Young Audiences of Northeast Ohio, YANEO. \nServing 18 counties, YANEO has enabled over 2,000 students in urban, \nrural, and suburban Ohio school districts to benefit from arts \neducation through more than 7,000 programs during the 2009 2010 school \nyear.\n  Young Audiences' mission and goal is to help make the arts an \nessential part of education. For this reason, Young Audiences offers \nprograms for students throughout the P 16 pipeline. From integrating \nmusic into a middle school math class to providing poetry writing \nclasses for high school students, Young Audiences takes a comprehensive \nand innovative approach toward strengthening students' academic \nexperiences.\n  According to the Arts Education Partnership, art plays a central role \nin a child's social, emotional, and cognitive development. Over time, \nthis can help make students more engaged in school and thus better \nlearners.\n  Arts education can alter a student's entire school experience. \nInvolvement in the arts fosters creativity and problem solving--both of \nwhich help students during the school day and in their personal lives. \nFrom helping a student find a new social group, to providing a student \nwith a new avenue of achievement, arts-in-education can keep students \nengaged and enrolled in school. Young Audiences has helped numerous \nstudents get back on track in the classroom and on a path towards \nhigher education or the workforce.\n  Young Audiences not only plays a valuable role in our classrooms, but \ncan benefit entire neighborhoods. Members of the Fullerton School \ncommunity in Cleveland participated in the `Parents as Arts Partners' \nprogram. With the guidance of a Young Audience artist, community \nmembers were able to design and install a mural that now brightens the \nCleveland neighborhood. The experience was so positive for the parents, \nstudents, and the Fullerton community, they are now looking for funding \nto create another community mural.\n  To all the students who participate in Young Audiences, thank you for \ntaking a stake in your education and in your community.\n  To the teachers and parents like those in the Fullerton community, \nthank you for your commitment to integrating arts throughout your \nstudents' lives. Even during challenging economic times, you go above \nand beyond your duties to provide your students with a well-rounded \nacademic experience.\n  And to the dedicated artists of Young Audiences of Northeast Ohio, \nthank you for your service to the students throughout the region. Your \npassion and dedication for the arts will help lead to a new generation \nof artists and musicians--and engaged citizens.\n  I am proud to celebrate the work of Young Audiences nationwide.

BRYANT\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the ministry of Bishop John R. Bryant, senior bishop and \npresiding prelate of the Fourth Episcopal District of the African \nMethodist Episcopal, AME, Church. Bishop Bryant is a native of \nBaltimore and a graduate of Baltimore City College and Morgan State \nUniversity. From a young age, he learned the importance of spiritual \nand civic leadership from his father, Rev. Harrison Bryant, who was a \nBaltimore pastor and civil rights activist.\n  After John Bryant graduated from Morgan State, he served in Liberia \nwith the Peace Corps, beginning his lifelong involvement in Africa. He \nreturned to the United States and earned graduate degrees in theology \nand ministry and served as a pastor in Boston before returning to \nBaltimore in 1975, where he took on the mantle of leadership at Bethel \nAME Church, where his father had been pastor. At age 31, he was the \nyoungest pastor in the church's history. He brought incredible energy \nto the pulpit and the congregation grew by the thousands. He was\n\n[[Page S1419]]\n\ncommitted to both spiritual leadership and community development and \ntransformed the church's Labor Day celebration into a job fair for the \nunemployed. He created an outreach center for the poor, 40 specialized \nministries, and a Christian day school for children from kindergarten \nto fourth grade.\n  In 1988, Rev. Dr. Bryant was named Bishop of the AME Church's 14th \nEpiscopal District, which included 101 churches in West Africa and \nshortly added the 10th District, including Texas and the Southwest. In \n2000, he was named bishop of the Fifth District, which included 200,000 \nchurch members in 14 Western States. In 2008, he was appointed senior \nbishop and president prelate of the Fourth Episcopal District, which \nincludes much of the Midwest and Canada.\n  Bishop Bryant's wife, the Reverend Dr. Cecilia Bryant, has been an \nintegral partner in his ministry. She founded the AME Church in the \nRepublic of Ivory Coast, cofounded the AME Church in India, and is \ncurrently serving alongside her husband as supervisor of the church's \nFourth Episcopal District. Their children, the Reverend Dr. Jamal \nHarrison Bryant, pastor of Baltimore's Empowerment Temple, and Dr. \nThelma Bryant-Davis, a psychologist, poet, dancer, and minister, \ncontinue the family tradition of spiritual leadership.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Bishop John R. \nBryant on 50 years of ministry in the African Methodist Episcopal \nChurch. He has built a legacy of outstanding leadership, and he has \ndelivered a message of social reform and economic justice in Baltimore, \nin Maryland, throughout our Nation, and around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/06/senate-section/article/S1419-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING THE 11TH STREET FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES CENTER\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, on January 17, 2012, I visited to \nthe 11th Street Family Health Services Center of Drexel University. The \nCenter is located in north Philadelphia, PA, and provides outpatient \nhealth care services to one of the most underserved communities in the \ncity. As we work to ensure that all Americans have access to quality, \naffordable health care, the 11th Street Family Health Services Center \nserves as a model that is both innovative and effective, and I wish to \nhighlight its efforts today.\n  The Center was born out of a partnership between the College of \nNursing at MCP/Hahnemann University, now Drexel University's College of \nNursing and Health Professions, and the Philadelphia Housing Authority \nto address the community's health concerns. It began as a Center \nfocused on health promotion and disease prevention, but thanks to the \ntireless work of community leaders and Dr. Patty Gerrity, it quickly \nevolved into a comprehensive, nurse-managed, federally qualified health \ncenter.\n  In 1998, the center received a Health Resources and Services \nAdministration grant for over $3 million, which it used to build a \nstate-of-the-art health center that was opened in 2002. That facility \nand the nurses that manage it now provide primary care, behavioral \nhealth, dental health and health and wellness programs to more than \n2,500 adult patients annually. In fact, in 2011, the Center provided \n30,000 patient visits to a section of Philadelphia that has the highest \npercentage of unemployed adults, the highest percentage of families \nliving in poverty and the highest rate of diabetes in Philadelphia.\n  Not only does the Center serve as a creative model to address chronic \nhealth issues in underserved communities, it also serves as a great \neducational tool. As operated by the Drexel University College of \nNursing and Health Professions, the Center encourages employment in the \nhealth care field and provides nursing students with the opportunity to \nlearn, first-hand, the skills needed to work in today's health care \nindustry.\n  As we move forward with the ongoing fight to ensure that quality and \naffordable care is accessible to all Americans, I strongly recommend \nthat we learn from and seek to emulate innovative models like the 11th \nStreet Family Health Services Center. It effectively serves our most \nvulnerable citizens, improves their general health and in doing so \nreduces the burden on our larger hospitals while decreasing medical \ncosts in the long-term.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/06/senate-section/article/S1419-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. MARY PAT SEURKAMP\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the outstanding \nleadership and accomplishments of Mary Pat Seurkamp, Ph.D., president \nof Notre Dame of Maryland University.\n  The College of Notre Dame of Maryland was founded in Baltimore by the \nSchool Sisters of Notre Dame to educate women and the poor. The \ninstitution was chartered in 1895 and was known as the College of Notre \nDame of Maryland until September of 2011, when it was officially \nrenamed Notre Dame of Maryland University. The undergraduate Women's \nCollege of the School of Arts and Sciences remains at the heart of the \nuniversity and is the only women's college in Maryland. Under Dr. \nSeurkamp's leadership, Notre Dame of Maryland has flourished as one of \nthe Nation's strongest women's institutions, fully embracing its role \nin preparing young women to understand and meet society's challenges.\n  Under Dr. Seurkamp's leadership, the college has also found new ways \nto meet society's needs. The Accelerated College was founded to help \nworking women and men earn their undergraduate degrees.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Hosmer, \nSD. The town of Hosmer will commemorate the 125th anniversary of its \nfounding this year.\n  Hosmer was platted on May 9, 1887. The name Hosmer comes from Stella \nA. Hosmer, who was the wife of a railroad agent from Illinois. A great \nmajority of Hosmer's residents claim German-Russian as their ancestry. \nBecause of this heritage, the early settlers were able to thrive in the \nharsh South Dakota conditions which proved to be similar to those of \ntheir home countries.\n  From the beginning, Hosmer has been known to provide excellent \nservices to its citizens. In the 1920s, the town prided itself on its \nfine educational system, as well as a road system that was well ahead \nof its time. Hosmer maintained a strong business reputation in the mid-\n1900s, when Dun and Bradstreet gave its businesses some of the best \ncredit ratings of any Midwestern city. Hosmer's citizens are strong and \ndetermined like their ancestors. They have endured the hardships that \nare common in rural communities and have not only survived but have \nexcelled.\n  Hosmer has been a successful community for the past 125 years, and I \nam confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South \nDakota values and traditions. I would like to offer my congratulations \nto the citizens of\n\n[[Page S1420]]\n\nHosmer on this landmark occasion and wish them continued prosperity in \nthe years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/06/senate-section/article/S1420-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MIKE SHAW\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I want to \nrecognize Mike Shaw, an outstanding Coloradan and this year's recipient \nof the prestigious TIME Dealer of the Year award. This award is given \nto outstanding new-car dealers who have also performed community \nservice and exhibited a commitment to improving the world. Mike is an \nexceptional business owner in Colorado, an active philanthropist, and a \nrole model in his community. I applaud Mike's achievement and would \nlike to take a few moments to share his work with you.\n  Mike has long been devoted to serving his community, a value that was \ninstilled early in his life. He is a veteran of the U.S. Army, having \nserved in Vietnam, and as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I want to extend my gratitude for his service to our \ncountry.\n  After returning home and entering the new-car business, Mike opened \nthe Mike Shaw Chevrolet Saab dealership in the heart of Denver. Today \nhe is the owner of seven dealerships throughout Colorado, Louisiana, \nand Texas. Mike's entrepreneurial spirit serves as a perfect example of \nhow small businesses take root and help drive our economy, creating \njobs and taking care of their customers and communities.\n  The auto industry has served as the backbone of American \nmanufacturing. When it was hit hard by the 2008 recession and neared \nbankruptcy in 2009, thousands of dealerships across the country were at \nrisk of closing. I had the privilege of working with Mike to help give \nthese important Colorado businesses and the jobs they support a second \nchance. He stood up to inform Congress of the actual impacts of closing \nauto dealerships and helped promote solutions to keep them in business. \nHe has been a steadfast leader in Colorado, and we can all learn from \nhis principled approach. As Mike says, ``My mantra in business is that \nquality comes first, customers are always the focus, and integrity is \nnever compromised.''\n  I also want to commend him for his commitment to expanding education \nand opportunity for the youth in our State. His reach has extended to \ncountless organizations and boards on which he has served or \ncontributed to in other ways. The Denver Zoological Foundation, the \nUrban League of Denver, Kempe Children's Foundation, the National \nWestern Stock Show Association, and St. Joseph Hospital Foundation are \njust a few that have felt his impact.\n  His exceptional leadership in the auto industry and involvement with \nthese important community partners has earned Mike the Dealer of the \nYear award. His achievements are far-reaching, and each one of them is \nin the spirit of service to his community.\n  Mike is a determined and selfless community leader whose drive has \nhelped provide our children a brighter future and made Colorado a \nbetter place to live. I extend to him my congratulations for being \nhonored as the 2012 TIME Dealer of the Year, and I look forward to his \ncontinued leadership throughout Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/06/senate-section/article/S1420-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1134.

A bill to establish the Fox-Wisconsin Heritage Parkway \nNational Heritage Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President. I wanted to speak today regarding a bill I \nam introducing to establish the Fox-Wisconsin Heritage Parkway National \nHeritage Area. The Fox-Wisconsin Heritage Parkway would cut diagonally \nacross Wisconsin through parts of 15 counties following the Fox River \nfrom Green Bay to Portage and the Wisconsin River from Portage to the \nMississippi River. This parkway marks the route taken in 1673 by \nexplorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet through Wisconsin.\n  The Fox-Wisconsin Heritage Parkway concept was created in 1991 by the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation and the Wisconsin Department \nof Commerce with the purpose of highlighting and enhancing the unique \nheritage of the State of Wisconsin. The Fox and Wisconsin rivers that \nserve as the pathway of Wisconsin's first explorers will increase \nheritage and recreational tourism to sites within the 280 mile Parkway \nand create awareness of this region's contributions to United States \nhistory.\n  A National Heritage Area designation would revitalize the Parkway as \nan economic, environmental and recreational resource and ensure it for \nfuture generations. This project has the strong support of local towns, \ncities, businesses and non-profits that are located within this \nproposed parkway. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nCongress on this National Heritage Area designation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2159. A bill to extend the authorization of the Drug-Free \nCommunities Support Program through fiscal year 2017; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with Senator \nGrassley to introduce the Drug Free Communities Reauthorization Act of \n2012, a bill to reauthorize the successful Drug Free Communities \nProgram. It is crucial that communities around the country have the \nsupport and resources needed to respond to serious drug problems in a \ncomprehensive and coordinated manner. Drug Free Community, DFC, \ncoalitions have been proven to significantly lower substance abuse \nrates in our communities nationwide.\n  The DFC program encourages local citizens to become directly involved \nin solving their community's drug issues through grassroots organizing \nand data-driven approaches. Since the program's inception, DFC grants, \nwhich must be matched dollar for dollar, have helped to fund nearly \n2,000 coalitions and have mobilized nearly 9,000 community volunteers. \nToday's legislation will reauthorize the DFC Program for an additional \n5 years, at a reduced rate to reflect current fiscal realities. The \ncommunity coalition model has proven extremely effective and has \nachieved impressive outcomes. It is critical that today's bill become \nlaw.\n  The DFC Program strategically invests Federal anti-drug resources at \nthe community level with those who have the most power to reduce the \ndemand for drugs--parents, teachers, business leaders, local media, \nreligious leaders, law enforcement, youth, and others in the community. \nGrantees execute collaborative strategies to address their communities' \nunique substance use and abuse issues. This is the optimal way to \nensure that the entire community benefits from prevention. I have \nconsistently supported funding for these coalitions, and was pleased \nthat last year, eight Vermont coalitions were awarded Drug Free \nCommunity grants totaling $946,852.\n  In Vermont, we have felt the presence of drug abuse and drug-related \ncrime in our communities, and prescription drug abuse is on the rise. \nThe myth persists that drug abuse and drug-related crime are only big-\ncity problems, but rural America is also coping with these issues. I \nhave brought the Judiciary Committee to Vermont several times to \nexamine these problems and gain perspectives to help shape solutions. \nOne thing is clear. Law enforcement, while crucial, cannot solve the \nproblem on its own. Reducing substance abuse requires a comprehensive \napproach with equal attention to law enforcement, prevention and \neducation, and treatment, all with active community buy-in.\n  We see significant results in the fight against youth drug abuse when \nwe have people working together at the local, State, and Federal \nlevels, and in the law enforcement, prevention, and treatment fields. \nWe have seen success driven by DFC coalitions in Vermont and throughout \nthe country, but there is more work to be done. Drug abuse and drug-\nrelated crime is a persistent problem in major metropolitan areas and \nrural communities alike. I hope all Senators will support this \nbipartisan bill so that communities nationwide can sustain effective \ncommunity coalitions to reduce youth drug use.\n\n[[Page S1424]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2159\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, throughout my years in Congress, I have \nworked to keep drugs out of our communities. We have all seen the \ndestructive impact drugs have on our communities, and our families. For \nyears, we have heard tragic stories of the lives impacted by drug \nabuse. These problems plague our society and we must remain united in \nthis struggle to end abuse and addiction.\n  In 1997 I, along with then-Senator Biden, sponsored legislation to \ncreate the Drug Free Communities, DFC, program. I believed then--as I \nstill do today--that one of the most effective ways to prevent drug \nabuse is by supporting community antidrug coalitions to identify, \nprevent and eradicate the sources of abuse at the grass roots. Since \nthe enactment of the Drug Free Communities Act, thousands of community \nantidrug coalitions have received Federal support to further their \nefforts to halt drug abuse in their communities.\n  Coalitions, across the country and in my home State of Iowa, are \nconfronted with unique challenges, but they are leading their \ncommunities in finding ways to overcome them. For example, the Van \nBuren Safe Coalition in Keosauqua, IA implemented comprehensive \ncommunity wide strategies to address the growing marijuana problem in \ntheir community. They conducted town hall meetings to raise awareness \nabout the dangers of drug use; facilitated various community and youth \neducation opportunities; and partnered with local schools to ensure \ndrug policies and codes of conduct were in place. As a result, the Van \nBuren County SAFE Coalition reduced marijuana use among 11th graders by \none-third in a 5-year time span according to the Iowa Youth Survey.\n  The Kossuth Connections coalition, which is headquartered in Algona, \nIA, is also taking action to fight underage drinking and smoking within \nits communities. According to the Iowa Youth Survey, current underage \ndrinking and smoking, although still below the statewide average, has \nincreased slightly between 2008 and 2010 in this county. As a result, \nthe Kossuth Connections coalition has partnered with local businesses \nthat sell alcohol and tobacco to ensure compliance with laws requiring \nage restrictions on selling alcohol and tobacco products. Youth from \nthe county have surveyed area stores, inspected advertisements and \nproduct placements, and helped to determine whether or not the store \ndisplays a ``We ID'' sticker at the counter. These youth are committed \nto ensuring local stores are in compliance with the law and are \nactively working to reduce underage drinking and smoking.\n  These coalitions are a small sampling, but they represent the \nincredible efforts that many are putting into controlling and reducing \ndrug abuse in our communities. Now is not the time to abandon community \ndrug prevention efforts.\n  Unfortunately, recent trends indicate youth drug use nationally is on \nthe rise and new synthetic drugs like K2/Spice and bath salts are \ngaining in popularity. In fact, the latest Monitoring the Future Survey \nindicates that one in nine high school seniors used synthetic drugs \nlike K2/Spice in the past year. This is the first year this survey \ntested students on synthetic drug use. The high number of users in such \na short time span illustrates how rapidly drug use can spread among \ncertain populations and communities. It is discouraging to see these \nsurveys and to read about more tragedies on a daily basis. These \nnegative trends will continue if they are not aggressively addressed.\n  It is vital that communities are made aware of abuse trends and the \nnew drugs coming on the horizon. The actions community antidrug \ncoalitions can take to stem the growing tide of rising drug abuse, like \nsynthetic drug abuse, can and have made a real difference. By holding \ntown hall meetings, launching school programs, and confronting local \nbusinesses that market or sell inappropriate products community \ncoalitions are making a real positive difference.\n  Whether it is a synthetic drug outbreak, a meth epidemic in a \nMidwestern town, or an increase in underage drinking, community \nantidrug coalitions will lead the way to unite their community against \ndrug abuse. It is vital in these tough times that these coalitions \ncontinue to receive support from their communities and from the Federal \nGovernment. That is why I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator \nLeahy, in introducing a bill to reauthorize The Drug Free Communities \nSupport Program for an additional 5 years.\n  This reauthorizing legislation recognizes the good work local \nantidrug coalitions have done over the years, but it also recognizes \nthe fact that resources at the Federal level are tight and that \nauthorizations need to more closely resemble appropriations. Further, \nthis program is part of an ongoing review conducted by the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) that I, along with Senator Feinstein, \nrequested to study the effectiveness of the program. This study will \ntake some time to develop and should not hinder our efforts to \nreauthorize the program, but should also be taken into consideration \nonce the results are available.\n  We must remain vigilant and not relent in our efforts to eradicate \ndrug abuse. Drug abuse flourishes when the problem is ignored. If we \nare going to make a better future for our children and communities, we \nmust face this menace together.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Brown of Ohio, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Begich, Mr. \n        Franken, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 2162. A bill to provide for the redevelopment of abandoned and \nforeclosed-upon properties and for the stabilization of affected \nneighborhoods, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I introduce the Project Rebuild Act today, \nand I thank Senators Durbin, Schumer, Leahy, Akaka, Sherrod Brown, \nWhitehouse, Merkley, Begich, Franken, and Blumenthal for joining me as \noriginal cosponsors of this bill.\n  Rhode Island, like America, is facing a foreclosure crisis. The bill \nwe are introducing offers an opportunity to address this crisis--\ntackling foreclosures and affordable rental housing at the same time.\n  Building upon the successful, proven, and bipartisan Neighborhood \nStabilization Plan, NSP, which has helped put Americans back to work \nstabilizing neighborhoods, the Project Rebuild Act could provide $43 \nmillion for Rhode Island to help create jobs and overhaul distressed \nneighborhoods and commercial properties.\n  Nationwide, about $10 billion would be directed to States and local \ngovernments through a formula modeled after NSP, and $5 billion would \nbe distributed through new competitive grants.\n  We are facing a challenging budget environment, but this is the right \ntime to make smart investments in strengthening our communities, \nputting more construction workers back to work, and bolstering the \neconomy. This initiative will provide a flexible source of funding to \nhelp local communities leverage federal dollars to effectively address \nvacant and blighted properties.\n  In communities across Rhode Island and the country, we have seen how \nthe foreclosure crisis has affected not just those who have lost their \nhomes, but also how it has impacted entire neighborhoods.\n\n[[Page S1425]]\n\n  I helped ensure that Rhode Island would receive additional NSP \nfunding to assist communities hit hardest by the foreclosure crisis. \nBased on my visits to many NSP sites in Rhode Island, the State's NSP \nallotment of $26 million is making a difference in neighborhoods all \nover the State. This crucial investment in Rhode Island has not only \nbegun to help reverse the fallout from foreclosures, but has also \nprovided families with affordable rental housing.\n  But more needs to be done. According to the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, despite three rounds of NSP funding, ``there is \nunaddressed high need in more than 76 percent of high need census \ntracts across the country.'' According to the Federal Reserve's recent \nhousing white paper, the number of new homes that will have completed \nthe foreclosure process could be as high as 1 million properties per \nyear in 2012 and 2013.\n  We need to act to gain traction in our housing market so that we can \nfirmly anchor a sustainable economic recovery that actually reaches and \ntouches all Americans.\n  The Project Rebuild Act takes us in the right direction towards \ngaining this needed traction by making important enhancements to NSP, \nsuch as broadening eligible uses to include commercial vacancies.\n  It would offer new grants for fixing up vacant commercial properties, \ncomplementing the abilities of private developers.\n  It would also increase support for ``land banking.'' Land banks work \nwith communities to buy, hold, and redevelop distressed properties as \npart of a long-term redevelopment strategy. Our bill would help more \ncommunities utilize successful land bank models and provide additional \nresources for Rhode Island Housing's Land Bank.\n  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, estimates \nProject Rebuild could create over 190,000 jobs and renovate 150,000 \nproperties nationwide.\n  Just as NSP was supported on a bipartisan basis, I hope we can build \nbipartisan support for this effort to help revitalize neighborhoods, \ncreate jobs, and accelerate economic growth.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill and other \nefforts to address foreclosures and bolster our nation's recovery.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 2163. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove Medicare benefits for individuals with kidney disease, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am introducing the Kidney Disease \nEquitable Access, Prevention, and Research Act. This legislation \nrecognizes the importance of patient choice, access to care, and \neducational efforts to assist the more than 400,000 Americans with \nkidney failure to manage their disease and understand the treatment \noptions.\n  First, the legislation seeks to maintain patient choice to retain \ntheir private insurance options, even after they qualify for Medicare \nby virtue of their disease state. Under current law, an individual \ndiagnosed with kidney failure, or End Stage Renal Disease, ESRD, has \nthe choice to maintain his/her current group health plan or transition \nimmediately to Medicare. The legislation introduced today would direct \nthe Secretary to clarify that this long-standing requirement also \napplies to group health plans established through Health Benefit \nExchanges, as well as more traditional plans.\n  Second, the legislation seeks to improve access to preventive and \neducational services by expanding access to coverage for kidney disease \neducation services.\n  Finally, the legislation seeks to address barriers to receiving this \nlife-sustaining treatment, including transportation issues and factors \nthat lead to disparities among minority populations. It also calls on \nthe Secretary to report on gaps in quality and care management metrics \nto support ongoing efforts to continue quality improvement in the \nMedicare ESRD program.\n  I call on my colleagues to reaffirm the Congressional commitment to \nAmericans with ESRD by ensuring equitable access to care for \nindividuals with kidney disease, supporting research to improve access \nto high quality kidney care, and improving access to preventive care \nfor individuals with ESRD. The Kidney Disease Equitable Access, \nPrevention, and Research Act is a comprehensive bill that improves upon \nthe Medicare ESRD program. I urge my colleagues to join with me in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/06/senate-section/article/S1425-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 389--DESIGNATING THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL 2012 AS \n                  ``NATIONAL ASBESTOS AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Mr. Durbin, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Tester, Mr. Isakson, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 253, S. 1886.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1886) to prevent trafficking in counterfeit \n     drugs.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will act today \nto combat the increasing problem of counterfeit pharmaceuticals. I \nthank Senators Grassley and Bennet, and the other cosponsors, along \nwith the bipartisan sponsors of the House companion bill. This is \nimportant legislation to deter the influx of counterfeit medication. \nThe bill will not only support the American economy and job creation by \nprotecting American intellectual property, but it will protect the \nhealth and safety of American consumers.\n  The illegal counterfeit pharmaceutical trade is a multi-billion \ndollar criminal industry. The Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies wrote \nin support of this legislation that ``criminals are drawn to \ncounterfeit drugs because of the significantly higher profits in \ncomparison to the very low risks and penalties.''\n  We cannot allow the counterfeiting of life-saving medicine to be just \none more low-risk venture from which international organized criminals \ncan profit. The Counterfeit Drug Penalty Enhancement Act raises the \nmaximum sentences for trafficking in counterfeit pharmaceutical \nproducts and requires the United States Sentencing Commission to \nconsider amending its guidelines to account for the harm to the public \nand need for an effective deterrent.\n  We should not expect that enactment of this or any legislation will \ncompletely deter the serious problem of counterfeit medication entering \nthe American supply chain, but it is an important step in the fight.\n  Passage of this legislation today by the Senate is also evidence that \nCongress can work together in a bipartisan manner to protect American \nconsumers and promote American industries. I urge the House of \nRepresentatives to act quickly on this legislation and send it to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Leahy-\nGrassley substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on the \npassage of the bill, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 1808) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.
