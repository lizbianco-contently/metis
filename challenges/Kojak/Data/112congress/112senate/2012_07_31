Mr. President, we are already on S. 3414, which is the \ncyber security bill. The time until 2:15 p.m., is for debate only, and \nthe time until 12:30 p.m. will be equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees. The majority will control the first hour \nand the Republicans the second hour.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly \ncaucus meetings.\n  I will alert everyone to this: I hope those people, led by Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins, will work to come up with a finite list \nof amendments so we can move on the cyber security bill.\n  I spoke to the Republican leader yesterday and have been very patient \nand tried to get a list of amendments we can agree on. I hope that can \nbe done soon. It is very important that we make a determination of \nwhether we are going to be able to get a bill. There is not a lot of \ntime left to tread water, so to speak.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. All one needs to do is \nlook at what is going on in India today. There are no cyber problems \nthere that I am aware of, but one-half of the country of India is \nwithout electricity today. Transportation has been shut down, financial \nnetworks in India, which are significant, are down, and it is a chaotic \nplace. There are 600 million people in India who are without \nelectricity. As we have been told time and time again, the most \nimportant issue we have facing this country today for security is \ncyber. We have been told that by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by the \nhead of the CIA. We have been told that by Democrats and Republicans. \nIt is an issue that is important, and we have been told it is something \nwe can prevent.\n  If we don't do this bill, it is not a question of if there will be a \ncyber attack that will be devastating to our country, it is only a \nquestion of when. It can be stopped. I hope the chamber of commerce \nwill get some sense.\n  There was a big meeting in the Chamber yesterday. They were moving \nforward on all that was bad about the bill. The problem is they were \ndealing with the wrong bill. So I hope we can get something done. It is \nextremely important that we do.\n  There will be a Senators-only briefing today at 5 p.m. in the Visitor \nCenter today in SVC-217.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5691-7", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5691-S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 3457 AND H.R. 4078\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am going to spend a few minutes talking \nabout the Affordable Care Act. I wonder how many people on the \nRepublican side today are going to talk about ObamaCare. If they do, \nthey should be in a very positive state. We know that as a result of \nthis bill, the Affordable Care Act, people are getting or soon will get \na rebate. One of the things we did--led by Senator Franken and others--\nwas make sure that 80 percent of the money paid for premiums goes to \npatient care and any amount that doesn't has to be refunded to the \npatients. That is in the process now. In the month of August, all those \nmoneys will come back in a significant amount to Americans who, in \neffect, are part of programs that spend too much on salaries for \nbosses.\n  Also, we are going to talk a little bit today about what this \nAffordable Care Act does for women in America. As I said, I am going to \nspeak very briefly, but we are going to have people come--as soon as I \nand the Republican leader finish--to talk about good things in this \nbill for women. I will touch on them very briefly.\n  There is no question this bill that was signed by President Obama is \na landmark piece of legislation. It signaled an end to insurance \ncompany discrimination among many but especially against those who are \nill, those with a preexisting condition, and especially against women.\n  As a result of this bill we passed, being a woman is no longer a \npreexisting disability in America. For many years, insurance companies \ncharged American women higher premiums. Why? Because they are women. \nFor years, American women have unfairly borne the burden of the high \ncost of contraception as well. Even women with private insurance often \nwind up spending hundreds of dollars more each year for birth control. \nToday, women of reproductive age spend two-thirds more out of their own \npockets for health care costs than men, largely due to the high cost of \nbirth control. But starting tomorrow--Wednesday of this week--new \ninsurance plans must cover contraception and many other preventive \nhealth services for women. How much? No additional pay at all. Under \nhealth care reform, about 47 million women, including almost 400,000 \nwomen in Nevada, will have guaranteed access to those additional \npreventive services without cost sharing.\n  Many on the other side downplayed the importance of these benefits or \nfought to repeal them altogether. It is hard to comprehend but true. \nForcing American women to continue struggling with the high price of \ncontraception has very real consequences. Every year millions of women \nin the United States put off doctors' visits because they can't afford \nthe copay and millions more skip pills or shots to save money.\n  It is no mystery why the United States has one of the highest rates \nof unintended pregnancies of all industrialized nations. Half of all \npregnancies in America are unplanned. Of those unintended pregnancies, \nabout half wind up in abortion. Increasing access to contraception is \nthe most effective way to reduce unintended pregnancies and reduce the \nnumber of abortions, but the high cost is often a barrier.\n  That is why, in 1997, Olympia Snowe and I began a bipartisan effort \nto prevent unintended pregnancies by expanding access to contraception. \nIt has not been an easy path, but we did make a start. As part of this \neffort, we helped pass a law ensuring Federal employees access to \ncontraception. It was a big issue. That was 15 years ago or more. It is \nan issue that is still important, but we started it, and I am very \nhappy about that. Olympia Snowe was terrific to work with.\n  When this benefit took place in 1999, premiums did not go up one \nsingle dime because neither did health care costs--not one penny. It \nwas rewarding to note that a pro-life Democrat and pro-choice \nRepublican were able to confront the issue with a practical eye rather \nthan a political eye. It is unfortunate that over the last 15 years an \nidea that started as a common-ground proposal has become so polarizing \nin Congress. The controversy is quite strange when we consider that \nalmost 99 percent of women have relied on contraception at some point \nin their lives, and many have struggled to afford it. The Affordable \nCare Act will ensure that insurance companies treat women fairly and \ntreat birth control as any other preventive service.\n  Prior to Senator Snowe and me doing this, anything a man wanted they \ngot. Viagra, fine; we will take care of that. Anything a man wanted \nthey got--but not a woman. The law doesn't just guarantee women's \naccess to contraception, it assures their access to many other \nlifesaving procedures as well.\n  Thanks to the health care bill--the Affordable Care Act--insurance \ncompanies are already required to cover preventive care such as \nmammograms. For a person who is able to have a mammogram, it is \nlifesaving. Most people in the Senate know my wife is battling breast \ncancer. She had a mammogram in December and in August discovered a lump \nin her breast. Think of what would have happened if she had waited 1 \nyear because she couldn't afford that mammogram. Frankly, the thought \nof it is very hard for me to comprehend because even though she had \nthat mammogram in December, she had found it and was in stage 3 of \nbreast cancer. It has been very difficult. What if she waited an extra \nyear? Many people wait a lot longer than an extra year.\n  Colonoscopies save lives. I was talking to one of my friends in the \nSenate who is going to have his done. They do it every 5 years. It \ntakes at least 10 years for polyps to develop into cancer, and some \npolyps develop into cancer if they are not taken out. People need to \nhave this done.\n  Blood pressure checks, childhood immunizations without cost sharing \nis part of what is in this bill. It used to be a bill; now it is the \nlaw.\n  Starting tomorrow--again, Wednesday of this week--women will no \nlonger have to reach in their pockets to pay for wellness checkups. \nThey can do screening for diabetes, HPV testing, sexually transmitted \ninfection counseling, HIV screening and counseling, breastfeeding \nsupport, domestic violence screening and counseling. That is all in the \nlaw starting tomorrow. All women in new insurance plans will have \naccess to all forms of FDA-approved contraception without having to \nshell out more money on top of their premiums. Ending insurance company \ndiscrimination will help millions more women afford the care they need \nwhen they need it. It will restore basic fairness to the health care \nsystem. Sometimes the practical thing to do is also the right thing to \ndo, and that is what the legislation we worked so hard to pass is all \nabout. It is about doing the right thing for everyone. Today we are \ngoing to focus on women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5692-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I might say to my friend the majority \nleader before he leaves the floor that I listened carefully to his \nspeech about what most Americans refer to as ObamaCare. Given the fact \nthat our friends on the other side are going to focus on that bill this \nparticular week, I think it might be a good idea to have a vote on it, \non the pending bill.\n  It would be my intent to offer an amendment that I know my friend \ndoes not support, but nevertheless many Americans would like to know. \nSince we have spent a good deal of time positioning over the last few \nmonths on various and assorted issues, I think it would be appropriate \nto have a vote on the repeal of ObamaCare, and I hope to be able to \noffer that amendment during the pendency of the bill on cyber security, \nwhich we believe will be open to amendments. I wonder if my friend \nthinks that might be something both sides might agree would be a good \nidea.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wonder if the official reporter could show \nthe big smile on my face. Can my colleagues imagine how ridiculous my \nfriend the Republican leader's statement is. Listen to what he said. We \nare doing cyber security. We have talked about the dangers of cyber \nsecurity if we don't do something about it. He is now telling me he \nwants a vote to repeal all the stuff I just talked about on the cyber \nsecurity bill? That is very difficult to comprehend.\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\n  I think we should understand that I don't think a woman getting \ncontraception has a thing to do with shutting down the power grids in \nAmerica or the financial services in America or our water systems or \nour sewer systems. That is what cyber security is all about, not \nwhether a woman can have contraception or whether she can have a \nwellness check to find out if she has cancer from not having had a \nmammogram.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the majority leader, do I remember \ncorrectly that the very first amendment on the Transportation bill was \noffered by Senator Blunt of Missouri on family planning? So is there a \nfamily planning amendment available on every bill now that will be \noffered by the Republican side?\n  I know the House Republicans have had 30 or 33 votes to repeal \nObamaCare. Are we going to try to match them with similar efforts in \nthe Senate?\n  Mr. REID. My response to my friend is this: I try to be very calm \nabout things in life generally, especially things here on the floor, \nbut I can't remain very calm about this. I have, as do a lot of people \nI know, 16 grandchildren. They are evenly divided between boys and \ngirls. I want my granddaughters to be treated so that if they want to \ngo get some contraception, have some contraceptive device while in \nschool at New York University or Berkeley--I am bragging that they got \ninto those schools--they should have the ability to do that.\n  I just can't imagine what we are talking about here on the Senate \nfloor. Cyber security is one of the most important--it is the most \nimportant issue, as I have already said. If my colleagues want to talk \nto General Petraeus, he will tell us about what it is, or General \nDempsey will tell us what the important issue is. The No. 1 issue today \nis whether we are going to have bad people attack our country and shut \nit down. Now we are here being asked if we are going to have a vote, on \ncyber security, as to when my grandchildren can have contraception.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I guess the answer is no.\n  My friends are going to spend the week lauding the advantages as they \nsee them of an immensely unpopular bill that was passed a couple of \nyears ago on a straight party-line vote--ObamaCare. Yet, in a week in \nwhich, apparently, they are going to laud the various positions of it, \nthey are not willing to have a vote in support of it. So I gather that \nis a vote we will not have. I will request the opportunity to do that \nagain. After listening to my good friend the majority leader, I \nanticipate such a request would likely be blocked.\n  On another matter----\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend asked me a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. OK. I won't answer the question then.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5693-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5693-S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEFENSE SEQUESTER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 4 years after the great recession \nbegan, millions of Americans are still looking for work, millions more \nhave literally dropped out of the workforce altogether, and uncertainty \nabout our Nation's future continues to spread. The stories of \ndisappointment and of loss haven't diminished; they have, in fact, \nmultiplied.\n  What is worse, a President who was elected on a pledge that he would \nturn all those things around is still pointing the finger at his \npredecessor. Three and a half years after he took office, he is acting \nas though he just showed up. I think most Americans are smart enough to \nknow he has made things worse. He has hammered small businesses with a \nbarrage of new regulations, with dozens more in the pipeline. He \nexpects them to plan for the future without even knowing what their tax \nand health care liabilities will be. Last week he even spearheaded a \nlegislative effort to take even more of what nearly 1 million of these \nsmall businesses earn, and then he told Republicans that if we don't go \nalong with it, he will raise taxes on everybody else.\n  That was the message last week: Either give me what I want--raise \ntaxes on 1 million of our most successful small businesses--or we will \nlet everybody's taxes go up, is what he said at the end of the week. In \nother words, he used small businesses as little more than a bargaining \nchip. The week before that he told business owners that they are not \nreally responsible for what they have built. Listen to that. To \nbusiness owners, the President said: You are not really responsible for \nwhat you have built. No amount of White House spin or manufactured \noutrage can change what the President said in Roanoke, and no amount of \nfinger-pointing can change the fact that his policies have actually \nmade things worse.\n\n  But what is most upsetting to a lot of us is the fact that the \nadministration pretends its policies would help the economy or create \njobs when it knows they won't. It knows these policies are not going to \ncreate any jobs. What is most upsetting is the deception that lies at \nthe heart of so many of the sales jobs, from health care to the \nstimulus.\n  Americans wanted the President to focus on jobs, and he focused on a \nhealth care bill that we now learn not only includes a tax on the \nmiddle class but will lead to hundreds of thousands of fewer jobs. Now \nthe President claims he is fighting for the middle class, but 3\\1/2\\ \nyears into his Presidency their wages are still stagnant while their \ndependency on government assistance actually continues to rise. Wages \nare stagnant, and dependence on government assistance continues to \nrise.\n  In some cases the President doesn't even bother with the sales jobs; \nhe just keeps his plans a secret. That is what we are now seeing with \nthe defense cuts he demanded during last year's budget negotiations. \nLiterally for weeks, Republicans asked the President to tell the \nAmerican people how he planned to carry out these cuts. He refused.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As I was saying, for weeks Republicans asked the \nPresident to tell the American people how he plans to carry out these \ncuts. He simply refused to do so. So last week Congress passed \nlegislation requiring him to do so. In fact, it cleared the Senate, I \nbelieve, unanimously.\n  Then yesterday there was this: An Assistant Secretary down at the \nDepartment of Labor is now telling people they are under no legal \nobligation to let employees know if they will lose their jobs as a \nresult of these cuts. Let me say that again. We have an Assistant \nSecretary of Labor who just yesterday said that employers are under no \nlegal obligation to tell their employees they may lose their jobs as a \nresult of these cuts. In other words, the President is trying to keep \nthose folks in the dark about whether they can expect to lose their \njobs. Why? Well, I think it is pretty obvious: to insulate himself from \nthe political fallout that will result. The President doesn't want \npeople reading about pink slips in the weeks before his election, so \nthe White House is telling people to keep the effects of these cuts a \nsecret--don't tell anybody, he says, keep it a secret--until, of \ncourse, after the election. Once again, a President who holds himself \nout as a great defender of the middle class and the goals of organized \nlabor is putting his own political goals ahead of the hard-working \nAmericans who will be affected by these policies. Rather than let those \nwho will be affected by the cuts know about them, he will make \neverybody nervous.\n  For 3\\1/2\\ years--3\\1/2\\ long years--this President has pushed an \nideological agenda without regard for the consequences it would have on \nthe very middle-class Americans he purports to defend.\n  The President may not want to admit it, but the economic mess we are \nin is his legacy--his legacy. After 3\\1/2\\ years of finger-pointing--\n3\\1/2\\ years of finger-pointing--he owes it to the American people to \nbe straight about it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5694-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5694-S5705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       CYBERSECURITY ACT OF 2012\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, every Senator has to decide what they \nare going to do every day when they wake up in the morning. For some in \nthis Chamber, they wake up every day thinking about how they are going \nto stop President Obama, how they are going to stop his agenda, and how \nthey are going to do everything they can to stop him from having a \nsecond term. Some spend their time waking up every day thinking about \nhow they want to stop America from moving forward.\n  That is not how I spend my day. I try to look at two things every \nday: the needs of my people--their day-to-day needs for a job, for an \nopportunity, for health care--and how that translates into national \npolicy; then I try to look at the long range needs of our country. That \nis why I am excited about being on the Intelligence Committee, where I \nam working on protecting America from the cyber attacks that are \nhappening every day to our country, including the stealing of identity \nand the stealing of trade secrets. I want to move America forward. I \nhave worked very hard to do that.\n  One of the areas I am most proud of that I have worked on with the \nmen and women in this Chamber from both sides of the aisle is the whole \narea of women's health care. Many want to talk about repealing Obama \nhealth care. Well, I don't want to repeal it. They talk about replacing \nit. They never have an idea. So let me tell my colleagues one of the \nareas we fought for.\n  One of the things we knew as we embarked upon the health care debate \nwas that we wanted to save lives and we wanted to save money. One of \nthe areas where we wanted to do both was to look at how to utilize the \nnew scientific breakthroughs in prevention, particularly early \ndetection and screening. We could identify those diseases with early \nintervention and save lives as well as money and counteract escalating \ndisease that ultimately costs more and can even cost a life.\n  Nowhere was it more glaring than with the issue of women's health \ncare. My hearings revealed that women were charged more for their \nhealth care and got less than men of equal age and health care status. \nWe found that we had barriers to health care because everything about \nbeing a woman was treated as a preexisting condition. If a woman had a \nC-section for the delivery of her baby, that was counted. In eight \nStates, they even counted domestic violence as a preexisting condition. \nThen what we saw during this debate was the fact that they even wanted \nto take our mammograms away from us. Well, that just went too far.\n  So during the health care debate, while everybody was being a bean \ncounter, I wanted American women to know they could count on the Senate \nand the women and men of the Senate to stand up for them. So we came to \nthe floor. We suited up, and we fought for a preventive health care \namendment that not only passed but goes into effect tomorrow, on August \n1. It will be a new day for women of all ages, who will be able to get \nhealth care coverage for preventive health care at no additional cost, \nno copays, no deductibles, and no discrimination where they are charged \nmore and get less. That is what ObamaCare is. If somebody wants to \nrepeal that, then bring it on. We are ready to fight. We want to fight \nfor that annual health care checkup that will involve mammograms, Pap \ntesting, and pelvic exams. We want to be able to do the screening for \nthat dread ``C'' word, for colorectal cancer and lung cancer. We want \nto make sure that if a person thinks they are possibly a victim--a \ndoctor suspects domestic violence--we can screen and counsel. We want \nwomen to be able to have that access, to be able to know early on what \nare those illnesses they are facing.\n\n  August 1 means our long-fought battle will actually go into effect. \nWhere does it go into effect? Well, it is already in effect on the \nFederal law books. Now it will go into effect in doctors' offices. \nWomen will have access to the health care their doctor says they need, \nnot what an insurance company says they need or what some rightwinger \nwants to take away from them.\n  We are pretty mad about this. We were mad 2 years ago when they \nwanted to take our mammograms away from us, and we are going to be \npretty mad if they try to take our health care away from us. But what \nwe are happy about--what we are happy about--is that for over more than \n50 million American women tomorrow it will be a new day. They will be \nable to walk into their doctor's office. In the doctor's office they \nwill say: Good morning. Can I help you? And when they say: When was the \nlast time you had a mammogram, and the patient says: Well, I never had \none because I could not afford it, they will say: Oh, we can sign you \nright up for that. Tell me about your family history. Is it true that \nyour father had colon cancer? Well, listen, we worry about that for \nyou. You could be at high risk. We are going to take a look at that and \nmake sure you are OK.\n  For young women, we are going to make sure you have other kinds of \ncounseling and services you need in order to have a productive family \nlife. This is what this health care bill is all about. It is about \npeople. It is about access. It is about preventing dread diseases.\n  People will come to this floor and they will pound their chest and \ncomplain about the President. We want to pound the table and make sure \nwomen have gotten the health care they need.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to be very excited when we keep the doors of \ndoctors' offices open to the women of America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to give two thank-yous: \nfirst, to my colleague from California for letting me go ahead of her--\nI have a Finance Committee meeting--and second, to both my colleague \nfrom Maryland and my colleague from California, whose voices are so \nclear and clarion. I love to listen to the Senator from Maryland. She \nspeaks right to the people. She has it. She gets it. And do you know \nwhat. If we could get every American in a giant football stadium and \nthey could listen to Senators Mikulski and Boxer on health care, 80 \npercent would be for it. So I want to salute them and salute \nparticularly Senator Mikulski for putting both the event earlier today \nand these speeches together.\n  I heard the minority leader speak, and it meant two things. First, it \nmeant the Republican party does not want to do cyber security. It means \nthe greatest threat to our Nation--probably even greater than \nterrorism, if you speak to some of our intelligence and military \nexperts--will not be dealt with because we know what he is doing. He is \nasking for an unreasonable demand, unrelated to cyber security, to go \non the floor, knowing that will stop us from moving forward.\n  It is a sad day. We have some of our colleagues from the other side \nof the aisle talking about that we must not abandon defense. Well, one \nof the strongest things the defense of our Nation needs is a strong \ncyber security bill. Because special interests--the Chamber of Commerce \nand others--do not want it, even though every military and intelligence \nleader has said how vital it is, it seems the other party's tea leaves \nshow that the other party is going to block us from going forward. It \nis unfortunate and it is sad.\n  Then, second, the way he chose to block cyber security could not be \nworse in terms of substance and in terms of timing. Today, July 31, the \nminority leader wants to put on the floor the repeal of so many things \nthat are going to happen tomorrow to women and to men across America \nthat benefit them. So his timing could not be worse. The very day \nbefore we are going to see huge benefits for the American people, he \nwants us to debate repeal. Why don't we let the American people see the \ngood parts of health care before we repeal it. And we are not going to \nrepeal it.\n  I want to talk about this day--or tomorrow, actually--where so many \nportions of the Affordable Care Act go into effect.\n  Three million women in my home State of New York will benefit. From\n\n[[Page S5695]]\n\nBuffalo to Montauk, in Albany and in Manhattan, 3 million women will \nreceive free basic preventive care for themselves and their children. \nSo many women and men do not get preventive services because it is \nexpensive to them. These services are free. But not only will they make \nthose people healthier--the No. 1 goal--but they will reduce the costs \nof health care because every expert--Democrat, Independent, Republican; \nmoderate, liberal, conservative--says if you do more prevention, you \nare going to save money.\n  Tomorrow, so many of those preventive services go into effect. More \nwomen will go in for annual preventive care visits to screen for \ncervical, ovarian, and breast cancers. More women will receive \npreconception and prenatal services, so their children can grow up \nhealthy, active, and strong. More women will have access to \ncontraception and its additional health benefits, such as reduced risk \nof breast cancer and protection against osteoporosis.\n  New mothers will have access to support and supplies for \nbreastfeeding, and more women will be screened for domestic and sexual \nviolence, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV.\n  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: When we say there is \na war against women and they get their backs up--they want to repeal \nthis and put nothing in its place, no preventive services, no access to \ncontraception, none of the things I have mentioned--yes, it is a war on \nwomen. Because if they cared about women and they did not like \nObamaCare, they would still have a proposal on the floor to keep these \nfine pieces of the legislation going forward so they are not cut off \ntomorrow, which is what they intend to do, but, of course, thank God, \nwill not happen.\n  The change we are making helps every woman--who said: I would but I \ncannot afford it; it is just too expensive--finally get health care.\n  Removing the copays is a great thing. Cutting the costs of preventive \ncare is something we long wished to do in America and can happen \ntomorrow.\n  What about all the other benefits that affect men and women alike: \n2.5 million young adults who can stay on their parents' insurance; 5.2 \nmillion seniors--men and women--in the doughnut hole who save $3.7 \nbillion on prescription drugs?\n  What about the idea that when your insurance company charges you too \nmuch, the money goes to profits and salaries and trips and advertising \nand not enough goes to health care? Starting tomorrow, you can get a \nrebate. We know our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--to them \nthat is anathema, to make insurance companies give people a rebate.\n  So bottom line: We want to move forward on a cyber security bill, and \nwe regret that the leader is putting logs in its way. And even more \nimportantly, we want benefits to millions of women and millions of men \nto go forward, as was intended, as was voted for, as is the law of the \nland, and we will not let them deter us from bringing people those \nbenefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nputting this into context for America.\n  What has happened here this morning is, instead of celebrating with \nus because tomorrow, August 1, an entire list of preventive services \nfor women goes into effect because of ObamaCare--yes, our health care \nlaw--the Republican leader says he wants to repeal all those benefits.\n  Not only does the Republican leader, on behalf of the Republican \nminority, want to repeal the benefits that go into effect tomorrow for \nwomen, he wants to repeal the entire health care bill. He wants to have \nan amendment to the cyber security bill--which is so critical to our \nnational security--he wants to put an amendment on there to repeal a \nlaw that the U.S. Supreme Court found was constitutional and whose \nbenefits are beginning to take hold in this country, benefits that mean \nright now people are receiving refund checks in the mail because their \ninsurance company overcharged them, and under ObamaCare you cannot do \nthat, and hundreds of millions of dollars are going out to our people. \nThe Republicans want to, I assume, force those people to send back \ntheir refunds because they want to repeal ObamaCare.\n  Look at the list of preventive health benefits I have on this chart \nthat are already in effect because of the legislation. Already because \nof health reform--and I see Senator Harkin in the Chamber, who \nshepherded this through, as our dear friend Ted Kennedy became sicker \nand sicker with brain cancer. I will never forget how Senator Harkin \nstepped up to the plate, Senator Dodd stepped up to the plate, Senator \nMikulski stepped up to the plate, and they were the lieutenants who got \nit done. And the Republicans want to take it away. I can only imagine \nhow Senator Harkin feels, having been in that fight. But I am here to \nsay I am your supporter. I know what you did.\n  I know my people in California--the largest State in the Union--are \ngetting breast cancer screenings now, with no copays. They are getting \ncervical cancer screenings, hepatitis A and B vaccines, measles and \nmumps vaccines, colorectal cancer screenings, diabetes screenings, \ncholesterol screenings, blood pressure screenings, obesity screenings, \ntobacco cessation, autism screenings. How important is that? In my \nState, they say there is an epidemic of autism. They are getting \nhearing screenings for newborns, sickle cell screenings for newborns, \nfluoride supplements, tuberculosis testing for children, depression \nscreenings. How important is that? They are getting osteoporosis \nscreenings. I watched as my mother was in agony from osteoporosis. \nThere are things you can do now to avoid it. But you need the \nscreening. You need to know whether those bones are losing their \ndensity. They are getting flu vaccines for children and the elderly.\n  This list goes into effect tomorrow. So let's take a look at the list \nthat goes into effect tomorrow that my Republican friends want to \nrepeal today.\n  Tomorrow, women will get access to all of these things without copays \nor coinsurance: contraception, well-woman visits, STD screenings and \ncounseling, breastfeeding support and supplies, domestic violence \nscreenings, gestational diabetes screenings, HIV screenings, and HPV \ntesting.\n  I am stunned that on the eve of the broadest increase in benefits in \nmy lifetime, the Republicans want to repeal these benefits for women. \nThis is a continuation on their part of the war on women. They can get \nup and stand on their head and deny it and everything else. How else \ncan you explain why, on the eve of the day that women are going to get \nall these benefits, they want to now cancel ObamaCare and stop all this \nfrom happening?\n  If you think it does not matter--let me say to you, Mr. President, I \nknow you know it matters whether women get free contraception to cut \nback on unintended pregnancies and abortion and well-woman visits and \nbreastfeeding support. How about domestic violence screenings--so \ncritical. Some women are in these terrible relationships, and they go \nto the doctor, and they say: Well, I do not want to talk about it. \nDoctors will be taught how to spot domestic violence, and there can be \nan intervention that will save lives.\n  So here we stand. We have this list of benefits, women's preventive \nhealth benefits, that are going to go into effect tomorrow.\n  We are here to celebrate that. And instead of our Republican \ncolleagues coming on the floor and joining us and saying how wonderful \nthis is, and by the way, at the end of the day this saves money--we all \nknow that. We all know it saves money when you have screening and \ncounseling for STDs and you head off an illness. We all know it saves \nmoney. The health care bill saves money, and it reduces the deficit \nbecause of this investment in prevention. I cannot think of a more \nridiculous situation than after a bill has become law for how many \nyears now, Senator Harkin? Is it a couple of years since we passed it? \nYears. It went to the Supreme Court. It was upheld. And now, just as we \nare about to see these great benefits for women go into place, the \nRepublican leader says: Let's repeal ObamaCare today. Let's have an \namendment on the cyber security bill, he said, to repeal the entire \nhealth care law.\n  The House voted 33 times, at least, to repeal it. So I am wondering, \nwhat is with this idea of repealing? Do you want to take away these \nbenefits from\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\nwomen? From children? From men? From families? Yes, I guess you do. I \nguess you stand for going back to the old days when people could hear \nfrom their insurance company that they were cut off, when insurance \ncompanies could spend 70 percent on themselves, on their own perks, and \nCEOs getting hundreds of millions of dollars and you, the patient, \ngetting hardly anything. They want to go back. They want to take away \nthe refunds. They want to take away the funding our seniors are getting \nas they deal with the high cost of prescription drugs. And we fixed \nthat in this bill.\n  So I have to say, we make an investment in prevention, in keeping \npeople healthy. We make sure being a woman is not a preexisting \ncondition. And the Republicans today have relaunched their war against \nwomen. They are holding up the Violence Against Women Act that we \npassed over here in a bipartisan way. They will not take up the Senate \nbill and pass it. Why? They want to take away coverage in that bill \nfrom 30 million Americans.\n  They do not care about the immigrant population, obviously, the most \nvulnerable women there. They do not care about the college students, \napparently. Because we get extra protections for them on college \ncampuses. We protect the LGBT community. Clearly they are not \ninterested in that. And they are not interested in protecting the \nNative American women.\n  So while the Speaker says: Oh, I will send conferees to a nonexistent \nconference on the Violence Against Women Act, he could simply pass the \nbill and make sure everyone is protected. Instead of celebrating today \nbecause women are getting all these wonderful benefits without a copay, \nthey want to repeal all these benefits. They want to repeal this law.\n  Truly, I do not know what motivates them. I do not speak for them. \nBut if they say it is to save money, that is simply not true. Because \nthis bill saves money. This law saves money. Because we are investing \nin prevention. So the only thing I can think of is they want to hurt \nthis President.\n  The Republican leader said his highest priority was making sure that \nPresident Obama is a one-term President. So I guess if it means \nattacking the health care law to hurt this President, he is willing to \ndo it and hurt all my constituents who are getting these benefits and \nall of our constituents who are getting these benefits, hurting the \nAmerican people.\n  Well, I say put politics aside. Let's see the Republicans come down \nhere and celebrate the fact that finally our people are getting the \nhealth care they deserve and that they pay for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues on the \nfloor today--I thank Senator Boxer and Senator Harkin for their \nleadership--just as I was proud back in December of 2009 to join \nSenator Mikulski in sponsoring the women's health amendment to the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  We are here today celebrating the fact that tomorrow, August 1, women \nwill have access to important health services at no cost. Senator Boxer \nshowed very clearly what a number of those preventive services are. \nThanks to the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that go into effect \nthis week, women will have access to a broad range of preventive \nservices from well woman and prenatal visits to gestational diabetes \nscreening, and they will have access to those services without \ncopayments or deductibles. So finances will no longer stand in the way \nof women getting the preventive health care they need.\n  This also has the potential to save our health system money in the \nlong run. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 75 percent of \nour health care spending is on people with chronic diseases. So by \ntaking these preventive measures, we can slow this growth and the \nassociated cost of disease.\n  One of those preventive measures I want to talk about this morning is \nscreening for gestational diabetes. As cochair of the Senate Diabetes \nCaucus, I understand the importance of gestational diabetes screening \nand the impact it can have on both the mother and the baby. Gestational \ndiabetes affects almost 18 percent of all pregnancies in the United \nStates. Unfortunately, the number of those cases is increasing. The \nconsequences of gestational diabetes are real. Not only are there \nsignificant health effects for the mother and baby during pregnancy, \nbut researchers have found that both the mother and baby may be at risk \nfor developing type 2 diabetes later in life. By getting screened, both \nthe mother and child can be alerted to potential long-term health \nrisks.\n  I want to tell the story of one of my constituents, Megan from \nPanacook, NH, because she is a great example of why this screening is \nso important. During her 28th week of pregnancy, Megan was diagnosed \nwith gestational diabetes. The screening she had alerted her to the \npotential related health issues and they allowed her to get the \nnecessary treatment. I am happy to report that Megan gave birth to a \nhealthy baby girl, Grace. She is now 8 weeks old. Under the Affordable \nCare Act, all pregnant women will now be able to receive the \ngestational diabetes screening for free.\n  Tomorrow also marks an important milestone in women's health for \nanother preventive service. Women, beginning tomorrow, will have access \nto contraception at no cost. Birth control is something that most women \nuse, and it is something the medical community believes is essential to \nthe health of a woman and her family. For some 1.5 million women, birth \ncontrol pills are not used for contraception but for medical purposes. \nThey can reduce the risk of some cancers. With costs as high as $600 a \nyear, birth control can be a serious economic concern for many women. \nBeing able to now receive birth control for no cost will bring \nfinancial relief to so many of those women.\n  Again, I have a story of a young woman from New Hampshire who I think \nillustrates so clearly why these are such important provisions. Keri \nWolfe from Swanzey, NH, is a full-time graduate student at Dartmouth. \nShe is going to benefit from this provision because Keri takes birth \ncontrol as a medical necessity for treating a health issue that affects \nher adrenal gland. While Keri is lucky to have insurance, she has to \npay her plan's full deductible and then a monthly copay for her birth \ncontrol. As a student who is trying to balance academic and living \nexpenses, her prescriptions come at a significant cost annually. When \nher new insurance plan goes into effect, Keri is going to be able to \nget the full price of her birth control covered. That is great news in \nmaking sure she gets the health care she needs.\n  As Governor of New Hampshire, I was proud to sign legislation that \nrequired insurance companies to provide contraceptive coverage to women \nwith no religious exemption. At that time it was understood by people \non both sides of the aisle of all religious faiths that requiring \ncontraceptive coverage was about women's health, and it was a basic \nhealth care decision. Yet over the last several months, opponents have \ncontinued to roll back contraceptive coverage at both the State and \nFederal level. Every woman should be able to make her own health care \ndecisions. She should not have to have her boss stand in the way. The \nprovisions that go into effect tomorrow ensure that women can make \nthese decisions.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Harkin for their leadership on \nwomen's health. I join them in celebrating these important provisions \nthat are going to make a huge difference for women's health, that are \ngoing to be good for women, for families, and for everyone in this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me commend the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for her great leadership as a Governor and as a \nSenator in this whole area of health care for women especially. She is \nproviding great leadership in this area, continues to provide that \nleadership. I want to join with the Senator from New Hampshire in \nsaying we are not going to let these provisions that now are expanding \ncoverage for so many women--47 million women in America--we are not \ngoing to let these roll back. We are not.\n  Again, if the people of this country elect Mr. Romney to be President \nand they turn over the Senate to the Republicans, there it goes. It is \ngone. It is\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\ngone. I did not hear this this morning, but I understand the Republican \nleader said this morning--I stand to be corrected. As I understand, he \nsaid they wanted the first amendment that would be offered on the cyber \nsecurity bill that I think is now before the Senate--he wanted the \nfirst amendment to be a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n  What timing. What timing, I say to the Republican leader. On the eve \nof when we are expanding preventive health care services for 47 million \nwomen in America, the Republican leader gets up and says: We want to \nvote to repeal this tomorrow. Tomorrow. Repeal it tomorrow.\n  Does that not kind of give you some idea of how they feel about the \nwomen of America and the health care of our mothers, our sisters, our \ndaughters? That is what they want.\n  We have already voted 33 times to repeal portions of the health care \nact. I think we voted twice in the Senate to repeal the whole thing. \nThey want to have another vote. I think it is more than curious that \nthe Republican leader wants to vote to repeal it on the very day when \nwe are expanding health care coverage for the women of America. \nInteresting.\n  Tomorrow is an important day for American women, thanks again to key \nprovisions of the Affordable Care Act. I do want to commend Senator \nMikulski for her great leadership in this area, Senator Dodd, Senator \nBingaman. Senator Kennedy, when he became ill, asked us to take the \nleadership on different provisions of the Affordable Care Act on the \nHELP Committee and to get it through.\n  We had wonderful support from our colleagues here on the floor of the \nSenate and our committee. These provisions that we put in to move us \nfrom a sick care system to a health care system--I have often said that \nin America we do not have a health care system, we have a sick care \nsystem. If you get sick, you will get care one way or the other, \nusually in the emergency room if you are poor, or maybe not at all if \nyou do not make it to the emergency room. But there is very little in \nour country to keep you healthy in the first place. Yet we know, we \nhave good data that shows preventive services upfront save you a lot of \nmoney and a lot of lives, a lot of pain and suffering later on. So in \nthe Affordable Care Act we put in a big provision on preventive \nservices. We said basically that what the Preventive Services Task \nForce of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention--what they \nlisted as their A and B, those that had the, if I can use their term, \n``best return on investment'' or the ``biggest impact,'' that those \nwould be free, there would be no copays or deductibles.\n  Senator Mikulski reminded us of what is obvious but not too often \ntaken into consideration in legislation; that is, women are different \nfrom men. So we asked the Institute of Medicine to come up with \nprovisions that applied to the preventive health care of women. That is \nwhat goes into effect tomorrow.\n  Senator Boxer very eloquently talked about that and had the chart \nshowing all of the different things that will start tomorrow--an all-\nnew plan that would cover women in this country--again, to keep women \nhealthy in the first place, preventive services to keep women healthy \nwithout copays and deductibles.\n\n  Right on the eve of this wonderful expansion of health care coverage, \nof making sure women are not second-class citizens when it comes to \nprevention and wellness--on the very eve of saying to women that no \nlonger can insurance companies sort of say, because you are a woman you \nhave a preexisting condition--the Senate Republican leader gets up and \nsays he wants to have the next vote on repealing the health care bill.\n  Talk about a slap in the face to the women of this country. Well, I \nthink women know what they are facing coming up this fall. I point out \nthat tomorrow about 520,000 women in Iowa will have expanded health \ncare coverage, preventive services. We fought very hard to put these \ninto law, and we are not going to let them repeal it. We have the \nvotes--let's face it--in the Senate to stop that. The Republican leader \ncan bring it up again, and it can be voted on, but I think it is \nindicative of where they want to take this country.\n  We can stop it now, but if Mr. Romney is elected President, he said \non day one he wants to repeal it. When he is first sworn in he will \nsend up legislation to repeal it, and if the Senate and the House are \nin Republican hands, we can kiss it goodbye. It is gone. We will not be \nable to stop it then.\n  It is hard to believe, but prior to the Affordable Care Act essential \nservices that were unique to women, such as maternity care, were not \noften included in health plans. Tomorrow, we include preventive care \ncheckups, screening for gestational diabetes, and breast-feeding \nsupport and supplies.\n  How many low-income women in this country would know that the best \nthing for their babies is breast milk? Breast feeding, we know, is the \npreferred method of starting off babies, but sometimes these supplies \ncan be expensive, especially if women are working at a low-wage job and \nthey may need these supplies, but they can't afford it, so, therefore, \nthey turn to another method, to formula for the babies. I am not saying \nformula is bad, but as we know, and doctors will tell us--every \npediatrician will tell us that breast feeding is the best. But women \nwould be forced to choose the less best option if they didn't have \nthese breast-feeding supports and supplies.\n  Let me take head on, if I can, this idea of contraception. As the \nSenator from New Hampshire pointed out, this can be pretty expensive--\nup to $600 a year or more. For one of us who is making $172,000 a year \nand have great health care coverage, that is not a big deal. But to a \nlow-income woman with a couple of kids, working at a minimum wage job, \ntrying to scrape enough just to get by, $600 a year is a lot of money.\n  Let me point out another facet of this issue. Somehow people think, \nfor example, birth control pills are only to prevent a pregnancy. There \nare many young women of childbearing age in this country who take birth \ncontrol pills on the advice of their doctor not to avoid a pregnancy \nbut because their monthly cycles are so painful that they can't even \nwork. So what are we saying? A young woman who gets a prescription from \nthe doctor and says it is not for birth control but is for other \nphysical problems, she has to take that in and show it to her employer \nnow or her insurance carrier? That makes women second-class citizens \nagain. Nonsense.\n  I respect religious freedom as much as anyone, but despite the \nRepublican propaganda, this law doesn't mandate that any woman has to \nuse contraception, and it doesn't force employers to provide it. It \ngives women affordable access to birth control for a variety of reasons \nshould they and their doctor decide it is right for them or their \nfamilies. As for religious organizations that object to contraception, \nthe President has issued a very sensible compromise to accommodate \ntheir beliefs, while ensuring that women still have access to this \ncritical service.\n  I respect the views of all people on these often divisive issues, and \nI would oppose any measure that threatens the fundamental religious \nliberties of people or institutions. But the Republicans are not \nmotivated by a genuine desire to protect religious liberty; rather, \nthey are determined to undo these and other benefits for women in the \nAffordable Care Act. They have repeatedly introduced legislation, \napproved by the House Appropriations Committee, that allows anyone to \nopt out of providing services to which they have any religious or moral \nobjection.\n  Well, one might say that sounds reasonable on the face of it, but \nthink about this. Any employer with any religious or moral objection \ncould opt out of any coverage. They could say, well, they object not \nonly to contraception but to mammograms, prenatal screening. They just \nhave a moral objection to that based upon their religious beliefs.\n  I respect Christian scientists--I always have--and their beliefs. Can \nthey say, well, they are not going to cover insurance for an employee \nwho goes to see a doctor for allopathic medical care, that is not their \nreligious belief?\n  We have to have reasonable compromise, and I believe the President \nhas come up with that. So what the Republicans would do, according to \ntheir leader, is rob 47 million women of these new preventive services. \nThey would rob 1 million young women of the insurance they have already \ngained\n\n[[Page S5698]]\n\nthrough the Affordable Care Act, of an extension of dependent coverage. \nAmerica's women will not be dragged backward. They are not going to \nallow health insurance companies to return to the policies and abuses \nthat hurt them and their families prior to the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Tomorrow marks another step forward in transforming our current sick \ncare system into a true health care system, and many women will now \nexperience this firsthand. We are going forward. The Republicans can \nbring it up time and time again. They have sent a very clear signal to \nthe women of America that whatever they gain out of the Affordable Care \nAct--all these benefits--they are going to take them away from women if \nthey put them in office.\n  I think the women of America need to have some deep soul searching \nabout who they want deciding their fate in the future, after this next \nelection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I thank my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, \nfor the clarity of his statement, for his sincerity and, most \nimportantly, for his leadership. We have the Affordable Care Act \nbecause of Tom Harkin, Chris Dodd, Barbara Mikulski, and others who \nworked hard to make sure it was here to help families all across \nAmerica, particularly those in low-income situations.\n  Like Senator Harkin, I was stunned this morning when the Republican \nleader came to the floor and said: The first thing we want to do is to \nrepeal all of this health care preventive care that will be available \nacross America, including the provisions that go into effect tomorrow \nprotecting 47 million of our women and family members all across the \nUnited States--2 million in Illinois, I might add, will be helped by \nthis. They insist on bringing up on the pending bill on the Senate \nfloor this amendment to basically remove the protection for these women \nthat is built into the Affordable Care Act.\n  I have to say to Senator Harkin, we can't be too surprised at this. \nDoes the Senator remember the very first amendment the Republicans \noffered on the Transportation bill--a bill that we wanted to pass to \nbuild highways and airports? Remember what Senator Blunt, the \nRepublican from Missouri, offered as the first Republican amendment to \nthe Transportation bill? It was on family planning. Family planning on \ntransportation? I guess some late night comedian can make a connection, \nbut I don't get it.\n  Now we have the pending cyber security bill to protect America from a \ncyber attack that could cost American lives--something we are told is \nthe No. 1 threat to America--and Senator McConnell comes to the floor \non behalf of the Republicans and says: This bill won't go forward \nunless we can offer an amendment to repeal the Affordable Care Act--\nrepeal the protections that are there for families and women across \nAmerica.\n  It is stunning that no matter what issue we go to the Republican \nSenators return to this issue of denying health care coverage and \ndenying protection and preventive care to our families. In a way--the \nSenator touched on it--it is pretty easy for a Senator to come to the \nfloor and talk about somebody else's health care because, as you and I \nknow, and Senator McConnell knows, the health care we have as Members \nof the Senate--American families would die for the health care we have. \nWe have the best health care insurance in the world, and we have it in \na government-administered plan that protects every Senator and their \nfamily. We are lucky. We are in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nPlan. I believe people across America should have the same opportunity \nfor the same type of health care.\n  I am still waiting for the first Republican Senator who gets up on \nthe floor and denounces government-administered health care to walk to \nthe well and say: As a proof of my sincerity, I am going to abandon my \nown health insurance as a Senator. Not one has done that, not a single \none.\n  So for the Senators who come to the floor, their wives will still be \nprotected by our health insurance, and their daughters will still be \nprotected. The question we have to ask is, Should the protection we \nhave as Senators for our families be available to others all across \nAmerica? That is what this is about.\n  Tomorrow is the launch of an amazing development in health care \nprotection for our families. I applaud it. My wife and I are still \ncelebrating because our daughter gave birth to twins in November. We \nhave twin grandchildren--now 8 months old. They got through the \npregnancy well; she was cared for and did just great. We are so proud \nof our daughter, our son-in-law, and their family. I think about the \nprovision that will go into effect tomorrow. The Senator from Iowa \nknows that pregnant women in danger of gestational diabetes that could \nthreaten their lives and the lives of the babies they are carrying will \nhave preventive screening to protect them.\n  Don't come to the floor and tell me you are pro-life and pro-family \nand you oppose that. If you want a healthy mom and baby, this screening \nthat starts tomorrow for millions of American women is going to be a \nstep forward, a positive step toward uneventful births and healthy \nbabies. Think about the care and screening for cancer and for all of \nthe problems that women face.\n  I see Senator Murray on the Senate floor. She has been an \nextraordinary leader on this issue. I will yield to her in a moment.\n  All those who are on this campaign to repeal ObamaCare--that was \ntheir slur on that, and we accept it. It was accomplished under \nPresident Obama, and I was proud to vote for it. It is one of the most \nimportant votes I ever cast as a Member of the Senate. Those who want \nto repeal this so-called ObamaCare--as Senator McConnell called for \nagain today on behalf of the Republicans--would repeal a few basic \nthings we should not forget. Every family in America has a child with a \npreexisting condition. Think of asthma, diabetes, or a history of \ncancer.\n  Under our law, they cannot be denied health insurance coverage. We \nprotect those kids, and we protect their families. The Senate \nRepublicans want to repeal it. Seniors across America who are paying \nfor prescription drugs and going into their savings to fill the \ndoughnut hole each year are getting a helping hand from the affordable \nhealth care act. The Senate Republicans want to repeal it. Families \nacross America with kids fresh out of college looking for jobs and \ncan't find them or have a job without good health care can still be \ncovered under their parents' policy until the young person reaches the \nage of 26. That is what the affordable health care act does. The Senate \nRepublicans want to repeal it. And tomorrow 47 million women in America \nwill have preventive screening so they can be healthy on an affordable \nbasis and be mothers giving birth to healthy babies. That is in this \nnew law, and the Senate Republicans want to repeal it.\n  This isn't just a war against the pill. This isn't just a war against \nfamily planning. It is literally a war against women. And the \nstatements of the Senate Republican leader on the floor today are proof \npositive that they have one focus, and that is to take away these \nprotections we built into the law.\n  I am happy to yield the floor for our leader on this issue, my \ncolleague from Washington State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today very excited \nabout the great progress America is going to make tomorrow, August 1, \nfor women across this country and to share the outrage I just heard \nfrom the Senator from Illinois and others that before those even go \ninto effect tomorrow, on the eve of this great opportunity for so many \nwomen, the Republican leader has come to the floor and said: We want to \nrepeal it--first amendment, on an issue not related at all to cyber \nsecurity but to take those away before they even begin.\n  It is an exciting moment for women in this country. Two years ago \nhealth insurance companies could deny women care due to so-called \npreexisting conditions such as pregnancy or being a victim of domestic \nviolence--denied. Two years ago women were legally discriminated \nagainst when it came to insurance premiums and were often paying more \nfor coverage than their male counterparts.\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\nTwo years ago women did not have access to the full range of \nrecommended preventive care, such as mammograms or prenatal screenings, \nthat the Senator from Illinois talked about. Two years ago insurance \ncompanies had all the leverage. Two years ago, too often, women paid \nthe price. That is why I am so proud today to come to the floor with so \nmany of our colleagues to highlight just how far we have come for women \nin the past 2 years and the new ways women will benefit from health \ncare reform starting tomorrow, August 1.\n  Since the Affordable Care Act became the law of the land, women have \nnow been treated more fairly when it comes to health care costs and \noptions. Deductibles and other expenses have been capped, so a health \ncare crisis won't cause a family to lose their home or their life \nsavings. Women can use the health care exchanges to pick quality plans \nthat work for themselves and their families. And if they change jobs or \nhave to move, which so many people have to do today, they can keep \ntheir coverage.\n  Starting tomorrow, August 1, additional types of maternity care are \ngoing to be covered. Women will be armed with the proper tools and \nresources in order to take the right steps to have a healthy pregnancy. \nStarting tomorrow, women will have access to domestic partner violence \nscreening and counseling, as well as screening for sexually transmitted \ninfections. Starting tomorrow, women will finally have access to \naffordable birth control so we can lower rates in maternal and infant \nmortality and reduce the risk of ovarian cancer and improve overall \nhealth outcomes and encourage far fewer unintended pregnancies and \nabortions, which is a goal we all share.\n  I also wish to note that the affordable contraceptive policy we put \nin place preserves the rights of all Americans while also protecting \nthe rights of millions of Americans who do use contraceptives, who \nbelieve that family planning is the right choice for them, and who \ndon't deserve to have politics or ideology prevent them from getting \nthe coverage they deserve and want.\n  Starting tomorrow, women will be fully in charge of their health \ncare, not an insurance company. That is why I feel so strongly that we \ncannot go back to the way things were. While we can never stop working \nto make improvements, which we all know are important, we owe it to the \nwomen of America to make progress and not allow the clock to be rolled \nback on their health care needs.\n  Despite the recent Supreme Court decision upholding this law, I know \nsome of our Republican colleagues are furiously working to undo all the \ngains we have made in health care reform for women and families. We \nheard the minority leader this morning come to the floor, and he wants \nto offer an amendment on the next bill that is now coming up on \ncybersecurity to repeal all of these important protections for women, \nthat women are taking advantage of today, and certainly something we \nall should want for our families and our daughters and for the women in \nthis country. I know they apparently think repealing the entire health \ncare law would be a political winner for them, but the truth is that \nthis law is a winner for women and for men and for children and for our \nhealth care system overall.\n  So I am proud to be out here with my colleagues today who are \ncommitted to making sure the benefits of this law do not get taken away \nfrom the women of America because politics and ideology should not \nmatter when it comes to making sure women across America get the care \nthey need at a cost they can afford.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as the Senate now turns its attention \nto the pending legislation that aims to enhance our Nation's cyber \ndefenses, I would like to take a few moments to review where we are \nbecause I think the bill we now have on the floor brings us closer than \never to an agreement on a way to better defend our country, our \nprosperity, and our security against what is emerging as the most \nsignificant threat we face today, bigger than a conventional attack by \na foreign enemy, bigger even than Islamist terrorism, a threat that is \nvery different from anything we have faced before and so probably hard \nfor most Americans to conceptualize but, trust me, it is here. That is \nwhy it is so important. We have come closer than ever to an agreement, \nbut we are not there yet.\n  I have come to the floor to say to my colleagues that those of us who \nsponsor the pending legislation--Senators Feinstein, Rockefeller, \nCollins, and I--are eager to continue to work with our colleagues \ntoward a broad bipartisan solution to this urgent national security \nthreat--crisis. Obviously, to do that we have to begin processing \namendments, and they have to be what the majority leader has said: \ngermane or relevant. The majority leader has said we will have an open \namendment process, and I thank him for that. No filling of the tree \nhere. But the amendments have to be germane or relevant. We are dealing \nwith a national security crisis unlike any we have faced before.\n  A broad bipartisan group of us met with the leaders of our cyber \ndefense agencies yesterday--not political people, not partisan people--\nand they urgently appealed to us to pass this legislation in this \nsession of Congress. It gives them authority to protect us that they \ndon't have now. Frankly, they worry that without that authority to \nshare information with the private sector, for the private sector to \nshare cyber threat information with each other without fear of \nliability, for the government to have the ability to create some \nstandards for the private owners of cyber space and then give them the \nvoluntary option to abide by those standards--that all of those add-\nons, all of those realities that will be created by passage of this \nbill are desperately needed now. The fact is they were needed \nyesterday. They were needed last year.\n  That is why I am so disheartened to hear this morning that our \nfriends in the Republican caucus are talking about introducing an \namendment to this bill that will repeal ObamaCare, as they call it. \nThere is a day for that, but it is not this week on this bill. Frankly, \nI feel the same way about some of the gun control amendments that have \nbeen submitted by members of the Democratic caucus. Those amendments \ndeserve debate at some point but not this week on this bill.\n  We can get this bill done and protect our security. Nobody believes \nthat we are going to repeal ObamaCare this week or that we are going to \nadopt gun control legislation. Those are making a statement. They are \nsending a political message. And they will get in the way of us \nprotecting our national security.\n  So I appeal to my colleagues on both sides, pull back these \nirrelevant amendments. Let's have a full and open debate on cyber \nsecurity, and let's get it done this week. There are already more than \n70 amendments filed that are germane or relevant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the majority has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask my friend from Kansas if I could have 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  There are already 70 amendments filed, so we don't have time to sit \nhere staring at each other while we could be working through them. The \ntruth is that we have a number of amendments on which we are ready to \ntake votes, but of course we need cooperation from both sides in order \nto nail down that agreement with the consent that is required.\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to underscore that while there are \nimportant issues we still need to work through this week, the reality \nis that because Senators on all sides have been willing to compromise, \nwe have a golden opportunity to prove we can work together when it \ncounts the most, which is in defense of our security and prosperity. \nLeading sponsors of the pending bill, leading sponsors of the leading \nopposition bill, SECURE IT, and leaders of the peacemakers in between \nled by Senators Kyl and Whitehouse  have been meeting for the last week \nand making progress. And I would say that what was once a wide chasm \nseparating us is now a narrow ridge, which we can bridge--and I firmly \nbelieve we will--with good faith on all sides, in a willingness to \ncompromise. You can rarely get 100 percent\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\nof what you want in a democratic--small ``d''--legislature such as \nours, but if each side can get 75 or 80 percent and we can begin to fix \na problem and close the vulnerabilities that exist in our cyber \ninfrastructure this week, we will have done exactly what the American \npeople want us to do. That is my appeal to my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I wish to thank my distinguished friend \nand colleague, Senator Lieberman, for his leadership and for urging \nMembers of Congress to bring amendments down that are germane on very \nserious national security issues. So I again thank him for his comments \nand his leadership.\n\n\n                          Honor Flight Network\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a distinguished \ngroup of World War II veterans from Kansas who are now visiting their \nNation's Capital this week as part of the Honor Flight Network.\n  The Honor Flight Network is an organization with the main mission to \ngive veterans the opportunity to visit their memorials on the National \nMall, free of cost to the veteran. The veterans who participate are \nmany times unsung heroes of World War II, and in many cases their \nremembrances and their stories are shared for the first time and become \npublic for the first time for families and hometowns. In many cases, \nyoung people traveling with these veterans hear the stories and can put \nthe stories of these famous battles that protected our country in their \nlocal newspapers and in their school newspapers. It is history--it is \nhistory shared, lessons learned, and certainly renewed thanks to the \n``greatest generation.''\n  Many of these veterans are in their eighties and nineties. There are \nfewer than 20,000 World War II veterans in Kansas. As time marches on, \nthat number only decreases. Nationwide, the VA estimates that \napproximately 740 members of the ``greatest generation'' pass each \nday. So I am especially pleased that this Tuesday a group of 28 \nveterans will fly in to our Nation's Capital from Kansas to see their \nWorld War II memorial, and other memorials, and allow us the privilege \nto pay homage to their heroism. With five regional hubs in Kansas, \nthere is a steady stream of veteran groups making their way to our \nNation's Capital. The leaders of these groups include Brian Spencer and \nBill Patterson leading the Honor Flight Kansas Student Edition from \nLyndon, KS; Adrianne McDaniel and Peggy Hill, who lead the Jackson \nHeights Honor Flight; Beverly Mortimer and Denise Cyr head up the North \nCentral Kansas Honor Flight out of Concordia, KS; Mike Kastle and Jeff \nTrue guide the Southern Coffey County High School Honor Flight out of \nLeroy, KS; and finally, the leaders of this group coming in on Tuesday \nare Mike VanCampen and Lowell Downey.\n\n  These hub leaders and the many volunteers deserve our recognition for \nthe hours of work, organization, and fundraising that go into planning \nthese trips. Thank you for what you do and for setting such a fine \nexample in remembering and honoring the sacrifices made by those who \nstood in defense of our country in World War II.\n  Kansans and all Americans should know that this program--as a matter \nof fact, the World War II Memorial itself would not even exist without \nour former Senate majority leader, the senior Senator from Kansas and a \nWorld War II veteran himself, Bob Dole. Bob was instrumental in \nbringing the World War II Memorial to the National Mall. And even now \nBob meets personally with Honor Flight groups who make their way out to \nsee their memorial. When veterans learn that Bob Dole is at the World \nWar II memorial, there is a crush of veterans like a flock of chickens \ngoing to the mother hen. I am not sure Bob Dole will appreciate that \nallegory, but at least I think that indicates everybody comes to hear \nhim and thank him for his efforts.\n  Finally, I wish to recognize each member of this Honor Flight trip \nfrom Kansas visiting their memorial, and I ask unanimous consent that \ntheir names be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Kansas Honor Flight Network Trip--July 31-Aug. 2, 2012--World War II \n                        and Korean War Veterans\n\n\n                         World War II Veterans\n\n       Dwight E. Aldrich; William Henry Bernard; Eugene H. Brown; \n     Thomas Dale Coffman; Glenn J. Compton; Richard D. Ellison; \n     Perry L. Garten; Bob F. Holdaway; Edwin D. Jacques; Paul H. \n     Koehn; Jay Edwin Kramer; Howard Russell Krohn; Howard Logan; \n     Ralph Lundell; John L. Meyer; Richard Morrow Mosier; Charles \n     G. Niemberger; Harvey L. Peck; Donald L. Revert (Don); John \n     Russel Roberts; Rix D. Shanline; Lowell L. Smart; Norbert E. \n     Stigge (Doc); John D. Topham; Delmar L. Yarrow; George A. \n     Yohn; Keith R. Zinn.\n\n\n                           Korean War Veteran\n\n       Richard D. Wood.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I know under the order this hour is \nreserved for Members of the Republican caucus, and although I am an \nIndependent, I don't qualify exactly under the terms of the agreement \nto speak now. But seeing no Member of the Republican caucus on the \nfloor, I thought I would take the opportunity to continue to speak \nabout the pending item, S. 3414, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, and if \nany of my colleagues arrive, I will yield to them immediately.\n  Before I yielded to Senator Roberts a short while ago, I made a \nstatement that the two sides, if I can put it that way; that is, the \nsponsors of the pending legislation, Senators Collins, Feinstein, \nRockefeller, and myself, and the sponsors of essentially the alternate \napproach, SECURE IT, sponsored by Senators McCain, Chambliss, \nHutchison, and others--have been meeting. We have particularly been \nassisted by the bridge builders here--blessed are the peacemakers--\nSenators Kyl, Whitehouse, and others, and we have been making progress. \nI said what was once a chasm separating us is now a narrow ridge that \nwe are close to bridging. Let me explain what I mean by that.\n  The sponsors of S. 3414, the pending legislation, strongly believe \nthat owners of critical cyber infrastructure--and this is a unique \naspect of our free society, thank God; 80 to 85 percent of the critical \ninfrastructure in our country is privately owned, including cyber \ninfrastructure. That is the way it ought to be. But it means when \ncritical cyber infrastructure in a new world becomes a target of cyber \nattack and cyber theft, that we--the rest of us Americans--represented \nby the government, have to enter into a partnership with the private \nsector owners of critical cyber infrastructure so they will take steps \nto protect the cyber space that they own and operate because, if they \ndon't, the whole country is in jeopardy. If an electric grid is knocked \nout, the kind of awful experiences we have all had at different times \nwhen the power grid has been out in our area of the country will be \nfelt perhaps for weeks and weeks.\n  Think about it. What if the financial cyber system, Wall Street, the \nhub of the systems that handle millions--trillions, really--of \ntransactions over and over again, were knocked out? It would have a \ndevastating effect on our economy, let alone the most nightmarish, \nwhich is that some enemy breaks into the cyber-control system of a dam \nholding back water and opens the dam and floods surrounding communities \nwith a terrible loss of life. We could go on and on with the nightmare \nscenarios, but they are out there, and we are vulnerable to them.\n  So the sponsors of S. 3414 have felt that private sector owners of \ncritical infrastructure should be mandated--that is only the owners of \nthe most critical infrastructure--to adopt the standards that would be \nset under our legislation to protect their systems and our country. \nSponsors of the SECURE IT Act started this debate firmly convinced that \nthe only thing we need to do is to enhance our cyber security \ninformation-sharing between private sector operators and between the \ngovernment and the private sector. We have a section in our bill that \ndoes exactly that, but we feel that is not\n\n[[Page S5701]]\n\nenough. We feel there also needs to be these standards set for the \nprivate operators of the electric grid, of the transportation system, \nof the financial system, et cetera. If both sides had just stuck to \ntheir guns, no legislation would be possible. But when it comes to \ncyber security, no legislation, which is to say the status quo, is not \nonly unacceptable, it is dangerous. Some of our real--really most of \nour national security leaders in this country from the last two \nadministrations, the George W. Bush administration and the Barack Obama \nadministration--have warned, as if in a single voice, that we are \nalready facing the equivalent of a digital Pearl Harbor or a 9/11 if we \ndon't shore up and defend our exposed cyber flanks. The same is true of \nthe impact of our vulnerability in cyber space to cyber theft.\n  GEN Keith Alexander, the head of the Defense Department Cyber Command \nand the National Security Agency, made a speech a week or two ago in \nwhich he estimated that more than $1 trillion has been stolen over \ncyber space from America. He called it the largest transfer of wealth \nin history. That results from moving money out of bank accounts that a \nlot of us never hear about because the banks believe it would be \nembarrassing if we knew, the theft of industrial secrets to other \ncountries that then builds from those industrial secrets and creates \nthe jobs in their countries that our companies wanted to create here. \nSo there is a unified position among national security leaders, apart \nfrom which administration they served under, that we need this \nlegislation, and we need it urgently.\n  Several of us met with the leaders of the cyber security agencies of \nthis administration yesterday. These are not political people; these \nare professionals from the Department of Homeland Security, the \nDepartment of Defense, the FBI, and others. They warned us again that \nthe cyber systems that are privately owned and that are critical to our \nNation's security remain terribly vulnerable to attack. They said to \nus, and I am paraphrasing, that we need this legislation to respond \nurgently and effectively to an attack on infrastructure as critical as \nthe electric grid or Wall Street itself.\n  One of the leaders in our government, uniformed leaders, said to him \ntoday is a little bit like 1993 when it comes to cyber security; when, \nas we will remember, al-Qaida launched a precursor attack on the Twin \nTowers in New York with a truck bomb that blew up in the parking \ngarage. We all know there was a loss of life then, but the damage was \nrelatively small. But al-Qaida persisted and, of course, on 9/11 \nsucceeded in bringing down the two towers of the World Trade Center. \nThis leader of cyber security efforts in our government said our \nadversaries in cyber space are just about where al-Qaida was in 1993 \nwhen they blew up that truck bomb in the parking garage of the World \nTrade Center.\n  What I was impressed with yesterday, I will say parenthetically, is \nthough there is some controversy out here about who is capable of what \nin our Federal Government--and let me speak frankly. Some people don't \nhave much respect for the Department of Homeland Security. I don't \nunderstand why because they do a great job, in my opinion, in so many \ndifferent areas, including the one that is relevant here, cyber \nsecurity. But it was clear that the Department of Homeland Security, \nthe Department of Defense, and the FBI are working as a team--really, \nlike a seamless team--24/7, 365 days a year to leverage each other's \ncapabilities to provide for the common defense. They all agreed \nyesterday we need to pass this legislation to give them the tools they \nurgently need, that they don't have without this legislation, to work \nwith one another and the private sector.\n\n  I wish to again give thanks to Senators Kyl and Whitehouse, joined by \nSenators Mikulski, Blunt, Coons, Graham, Coats, and Blumenthal, who \nhave come together with a compromise proposal after a series of good-\nfaith negotiations and, as a result, Senators Collins, Rockefeller, \nFeinstein, and I have made major and difficult compromises in our \noriginal bill in order to move the legislation forward, to get \nsomething started, to protect our cyber security.\n  I think we now have a broad agreement on a bill containing those same \ncyber security standards that were in our original bill that resulted \nfrom a collaborative public-private sector process and negotiation. But \nnow, instead of mandating them, we are going to create incentives for \nthe private sector to opt into them. We are going to use carrots \ninstead of sticks. We have added some compromises also from the \noriginal legislation to guarantee Members of the Senate and millions of \npeople out in the country that when we act to share information from \nthe private sector to the government, we are going to have due regard \nfor the privacy of people's data in cyber space--personal information--\nwithout compromising our national security at all.\n  There are advocates on both sides of both the information-sharing \nprovision and the critical cyber-standards provision that think we have \ngone too far, and some think we haven't gone far enough. But while \nadvocates on the outside of the Senate can hold fast to their \nparticular positions, legislators on the inside of the Senate need to \ntake all of these deeply held views into account. Ultimately, our \nresponsibility is to get something done to protect our security--it is \nour responsibility to pass a law--and we have done that here.\n  I wish to first review some of the broad areas of agreement and then \noutline the differences that remain because I want my colleagues to \nunderstand how much progress has already been made. Sometimes the news \nstresses the differences between us.\n  Let me start with title I of the bill, which is the one on critical \ninfrastructure. I think there is a growing, broad agreement now that \nthe private sector owners of critical infrastructure should work with \nthe government to develop what somebody yesterday called the best cyber \nhygiene or standards of defense that are needed to safeguard their \nfacilities and the rest of us.\n  In the original bill we had the Department of Homeland Security \nplaying the singular role for the government. We broaden that now in \nresponse to, particularly, recommendations from the Kyl-Whitehouse \ngroup, and we have created a new interagency council we call the \nnational cyber security council, which will consist of the Department \nof Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of \nCommerce, the FBI, and the Director of National Intelligence, as well \nas relevant primary regulators when that sector of cyber structure is \nput forth in the council.\n  What do I mean by that? If they are dealing with the cyber security \nof the financial sector of our government, then on those standards we \nwould expect the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Treasury \nDepartment, for instance, among others, to be seated at the table to \ncome up with an agreement on those standards.\n  We have also agreed that adoption of these practices will be \nvoluntary and that there will be no duplication of existing regulations \nor any new regulatory authorities that will be added to law.\n  We have also agreed that incentives need to be created--the carrots I \nspoke about, such as liability protection--to entice private sector \nowners to adopt these practices once they have been developed--totally \nvoluntary. But I think if we build this right, they will come. Although \nit is not mandatory, we will set a standard, and private sector \noperators of critical infrastructure will want to meet that standard \nbecause they will want to act in the national interests to protect \ntheir customers, but also because when they do they will receive very \nvaluable immunity from liability in the event of an attack or a theft.\n  Look, I decided that we needed to make the system voluntary in order \nto get something passed this year. I think it has a good chance of \nworking as a voluntary system. But if it doesn't, and the cyber threat \ngrows as much as I think it will, then some future Congress is going to \ncome along and make it mandatory.\n  So there will be an incentive on both the public and private sector--\nparticularly the private sector--to make this voluntary system work. \nGod forbid between now and then there is a major cyber attack against \nour country; Congress will come flying back and adopt mandatory \nregulations. That is not what we want to happen. This is the time for \nrational, thoughtful discussion and legislation that will begin a\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\nprocess that will go on for years because the cyber threat is not going \naway.\n  So that is title I. That is the compromise we offered on title I, \nwhich deals with cyber infrastructure. I go now to title VII. In \nbetween there are some very good titles, titles II through VI, but the \ngood news is--maybe I should stress this--there seems to be broad \nbipartisan agreement on those titles.\n  Title VII is the one on information sharing, and there is some \ndisagreement on that. But we have come to agree that private sector \ncompanies must be able to share cyber-threat information with the \ngovernment and each other, with protections against liability that will \nincentivize--really allow--that sharing; that this sharing must be \ninstantaneous.\n  In other words, to protect--to respond to concerns about private data \nbeing shared when a private sector operator of cyber security shares \ninformation with the government, we are requiring in this bill, the \npending legislation, that the first point of contact for cyber sharing \nand reporting cyber attack is with a civilian agency--not a military or \nlaw enforcement agency or an intelligence agency but a civilian agency, \nsuch as the Department of Homeland Security or some other approved \ncivilian exchange.\n  Some people have worried that if we did that, it would delay the \nreferral of that information to the law enforcement and intelligence \nand military parts of our government, almost as if when the information \nof a cyber attack is sent to the Department of Homeland Security, \nsomebody is going to have to go find the Secretary of Homeland Security \nto make sure she sees it before it goes to the Department of Defense, \nFBI. The world we are in is very different from that. It has been \nexplained to me and others who met with, particularly, General \nAlexander, the head of Cyber Command at the Department of Defense that \neverything travels instantaneously, at cyber speed. That means that \naccording to preset programs, cyber attack, if this bill is passed, \nwill automatically--notification of it--go to the Department of \nHomeland Security or a civilian exchange, and at the same instant it \nwill go to the Department of Defense, the FBI, and the intelligence \ncommunity.\n\n  But when it first goes to the civilian exchange, there will be \nsoftware in there to screen out--to prevent the possibility that any \npersonal data--e-mails, private financial information--will not be sent \nto the law enforcement and defense branches of our government. That is \nanother reason sharing will have to be instantaneous--that existing \ninformation-sharing relationships will continue undisturbed; that is, \nfor instance, between the defense contractor and the Defense \nDepartment, and that there should be no stovepipes among government \nagencies. Agencies that need information should have access the instant \nit is provided to the government.\n  I know some colleagues want more assurance that while a lead civilian \nagency will serve as the hub for immediate distribution of cyber-threat \ninformation, it will do so without slowing down DOD's and NSA's \nabilities to access and act on that information. I have just told my \ncolleagues that would be the case. Others want to add further privacy \nprotections. I do want to say in this regard that we have already \nsignificantly strengthened the privacy protections, thanks to a lot of \ngood negotiation with a group of Senators--Senators Franken, Durbin, \nCoons, Wyden, and others--and a broad range of privacy and civil \nliberties groups ranging, really quite remarkably, from the left to \nright and in between, who seem generally pleased with what we have done \nto protect privacy under our legislation.\n  Here is the good news: The people in charge of cyber security in our \ngovernment say the privacy protections we have added in the underlying \nbill to the information-sharing section of this bill will not stop them \nfor a millisecond from receiving the information they need and \nprotecting our national security. So, to me, this is the Senate at its \nbest.\n  We are not there. My dream--because this is--we are legislating here. \nWe are not in the midst of some traditional sort of government \nregulation controversy. We are legislating actually in the midst of a \nwar because we are already being attacked every day over cyber space. \nWe have been lucky that it hasn't been a major attack that has actually \nknocked out part of our cyber infrastructure, but that vulnerability is \nthere.\n  A few months ago there was a story in the Washington Post about a \nyoung man in a country far away that launched an attack against a small \nutility--I believe it was a water company--in Texas. He got into their \nsystem and actually had the ability to totally disrupt the water supply \nin that area of Texas. What the hacker did instead--and he just had a \ncomputer and was smart--what he did instead was post proof that he had \nbroken into the industrial control system in that small utility in \nTexas just to show the vulnerability. In a sense, he might have been \nbragging he could do it, but it also was a warning to us. What if the \nnext time that happens it is a larger utility or a group of smaller \nutilities around the country--maybe water, maybe electricity, maybe \ngas--and this time they are not just warning us or showing us our \nvulnerability, but they are actually going to disrupt the flow of \nelectricity or water to people who depend on that? That is the kind of \ncrisis we face and why it is so urgent that we deal with this.\n\n  So let me come back to my dream. My goal here is that as we go on \nthis week, we are able to submit a managers' amendment, but it is not \njust from the managers--Senators Collins, Rockefeller, Feinstein, and \nme--that we are joined by a much broader group and we form a broad \nbipartisan consensus to protect our country from a terrible danger that \nis real, urgent, and growing.\n  I always like to think back at these moments--and I was thinking \nabout it again in this case, and since I do not see anybody else on the \nfloor, I will indulge myself and go back--to a hot July day in \nPhiladelphia, over 225 years ago, when the U.S. Senate was created as \npart of the--I am glad to say, proud to say--Connecticut Compromise \noffered to the Constitutional Convention by two of Connecticut's \ndelegates to that convention, Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsworth. It \npassed by just a single vote, but it helped keep the convention \ntogether and to enable our new government, including our Congress, to \ntake shape because the Connecticut Compromise guaranteed the small \nStates that their interests would be protected--small-population \nStates--in the Senate because every State, no matter how big or small \nits population, would have two Senators, and it guaranteed the larger \nStates that they would have a greater say in the House of \nRepresentatives, whose membership would be reflected, as it still is \ntoday, by population. Not everyone got everything they wanted that day, \nbut they found a common ground that allowed them to go forward and \nfinish writing our Constitution. That is the kind of position we are in \ntoday.\n  Shortly after the Connecticut Compromise was adopted at the \nConstitutional Convention, James Madison, as you know, Mr. President, \noften referred to as the father of the Constitution, wrote--and I am \nparaphrasing a little bit here--``the nature of the senatorial trust'' \nwould allow it to proceed with ``coolness'' and ``wisdom.'' I think \nthese negotiations on the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 show thus far that \nwe have the ability to put ideological rigidity, partisanship, and \npolitics aside when our security is at risk and move beyond gridlock \nand fulfill our Founders' vision of what this body can do when it comes \nto debating the great challenges of our time, with ``coolness'' and \n``wisdom,'' as Madison said.\n  So over the next couple of days, let's debate all the relevant and \ngermane amendments. Let's start voting as soon as we can on them. But \nthen, for the good of the country, let's each compromise some, \nacknowledging that none of us can get everything we want and we cannot \nafford to insist on everything we want because if we do, nothing will \nhappen and our country will remain vulnerable to cyber attack until the \nnext opportunity Congress has--which I would guess will be sometime as \nnext year goes on--to deal with this challenge. We cannot wait. We \nsimply cannot wait. I know we can do this. I urge my colleagues, \ntherefore, to come to the floor. I urge the leaders of\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\nboth parties to agree that the amendments submitted should be germane \nand relevant and that we can and will finish our work on this \nlegislation this week.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Cotton Trust Fund/AGOA\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with the majority leader, Senator Reid, and the distinguished \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, let me begin by clearly stating I \nunderstand the majority leader later today will issue a unanimous \nconsent request to move forward on the AGOA, the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act trade bill, and the Burma sanctions package as well as \nCAFTA-DR. Those are all efforts I supported as a member of the Finance \nCommittee and voted for and ultimately want to see passed.\n  I believe trade is an effective development tool and that by \ninvesting in people we can make a long-term and sustainable change in \ndeveloping countries. But at the same time, I am very concerned about \nour failure to reauthorize the cotton and wool trust funds which are \ncrucial to sustaining jobs in the United States and jobs in my State of \nNew Jersey.\n  For some time now I have been working tirelessly to reach an \nagreeable resolution on the issue, one that enables us to pass AGOA and \nCAFTA-DR and Burma sanctions while simultaneously protecting dwindling \napparel sector jobs in the United States, hundreds in my home State, \nthousands across the country, and ensuring that our trade is not just \nfree but is also fair.\n  That is not the case right now. So I come to the floor to enter into \na colloquy with the distinguished majority leader and the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee to ask for their help and commitment to \naddressing this domestic jobs issue, the cotton and wool trust funds \nthis year, so we can seek to move this legislation and do right by \nAmerican workers as we are trying to also help African workers.\n  I yield to the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from New \nJersey coming to the floor to discuss this issue. As my friend from New \nJersey knows, as the chairman of the Finance Committee knows, I support \nthe wool and cotton trust funds. That is very clear in the record of \nthis body for what I believe was wrong with the Olympic uniforms. It is \nsuch a shame our athletes over there are wearing clothes made in China. \nI think that is too bad. I support the wool and cotton trust fund. I \nsupport the citrus trust fund. There are only three of them. I support \nall of them. I agree with my friend from New Jersey that we need to \nfind a way to move these forward and ensure that American manufacturers \nare placed on equal footing with foreign manufacturers so there is an \neasier place for people to go if they want products made in the United \nStates.\n  I am happy to work with Senator Menendez and Chairman Baucus to find \na vehicle to ensure that these trust funds and these American jobs are \na priority that is addressed this year. So my friend has a commitment \nthat I will do everything within my abilities to make sure we have an \nagreement on extending these very important trust funds this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I strongly endorse the suggestions made by \nthe majority leader as well as by the Senator from New Jersey and also \nthank the Senator from New Jersey for pushing these measures so \naggressively, the cotton trust fund and wool, and also, to some degree, \nthe citrus which is part of this.\n  I support these provisions. I support the cotton trust fund, support \nit strongly. I am working diligently to try to find the right vehicles \nso we can get this passed--the cotton trust fund passed this year. I \ndeeply appreciate the strong passion on this by Senator Menendez. He \nhas come to me many times in looking for an opportunity to pass this.\n  I deeply appreciate that. This place works on basic comity. Sometimes \nthe pathways to get to a result are not well known and difficult to \nsee, initially. But I am quite confident we are going to find a way to \nget this cotton trust fund passed this year. The Senator has my support \nto make that happen.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before I yield to my friend from New Jersey, \nI wish to also state on the record that no one is a better advocate for \nan issue they believe in than Senator Menendez from New Jersey. This is \nan issue he has spoken loudly and clearly about. So I reiterate what I \nsaid: I feel very compelled to do something to satisfy my friend from \nNew Jersey on such a worthy cause.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to thank and appreciate the \nmajority leader's and the chairman's ongoing commitment to this issue. \nI look forward to continuing to work with them on the issue to protect \nAmerican workers and American manufacturers from the negative effect of \ncertain trade policies and tariffs that threaten their livelihood.\n  I appreciate them both coming to the floor and for their commitment. \nI just wish to take a minute or two for those who have asked me--I have \nhad a whole host of our colleagues who have come and said to me: What \nare you trying to achieve? So we can move quickly to try to achieve the \npassage of AGOA and CAFTA-DR, Burma sanctions, all which I support.\n  I know colleagues, such as Congressman Rangel, who was the original \nauthor of AGOA, has called, among many others. You know, very simply, \npursuant to the passage of NAFTA and CAFTA and AGOA and other trade \npreference programs, Congress has eliminated duties on, for example, \nimported shirts from other countries. In some cases such as AGOA, it \nhas also allowed the use of third-country fabrics to make those \nimported shirts.\n  Our tariff policy, however, has not changed. While foreign-made dress \nshirts are entering the United States duty free, we are charging \nAmerican manufacturers a duty as high as 13\\1/2\\ percent on cotton \nshirting fabric. So not surprisingly, this made-in-America tax resulted \nin American manufacturers moving production offshore where shirting \nfabric is not subject to those high duties and where the finished \nproduct can come back to the United States duty free.\n  Six years ago, Congress recognized that, in fact, is simply unfair. \nWhy should an American manufacturer have to pay a duty when those \nabroad using the same fabric can send it to the United States without \nany duty? They created the cotton trust fund to provide a combination \nof duty reductions and duty refunds to shirt manufacturers that \ncontinue manufacturing in the United States.\n  That program expired in 2009. Since then, these businesses have \nsuffered and dwindled. I am just simply trying, as we promote jobs in \nAfrica and in the Caribbean, to promote jobs in the United States. I \nwant the women in the factories I have visited--this is the essence of \nhow they sustain their families--to be able to continue to have those \njobs.\n  That is why I appreciate the effort by the chairman and by the \nmajority leader to try to get us to that point, so we can have free \ntrade, but it also has to be fair to Americans who are here and can \ncompete. They cannot compete when they have to pay a 13\\1/2\\-percent \ntax and people sending it from all over the world have to pay nothing. \nThat is the essence of what I am trying to accomplish.\n  I will not object later today when the majority leader proposes his \nunanimous consent request and will support the effort to move those \ntrade bills.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Would the Senator yield.\n  Let me thank Senator Menendez for his leadership on this issue. He \nhas been very articulate about preserving jobs and creating jobs in New \nJersey and in America.\n  I thank him for once again standing for American workers. I thank \nSenator\n\n[[Page S5704]]\n\nReid, the majority leader, for his commitment to bring up the trust \nfund and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, I thank \nhim for his leadership.\n  Senator Menendez has laid out the issue very clearly. This is an \naverted tariff. It works against American workers. Cotton, mainly on \nshirts but other commodities, such as wool and suits--as the Senator \npointed out, if someone manufactures the suit or the shirt out of \nAmerica and imports it into America, costing us jobs, they pay less \ntariff than if they are an American manufacturer that imports the \nproduct to manufacture the product in America. They pay a heavier \ntariff, which costs us jobs, which makes no sense whatsoever.\n  I thank Senator Menendez for his leadership. I thank Senator Reid and \nSenator Baucus for understanding this and giving us an opportunity \nbefore this expires on the wool trust fund. It is making sure it works \neffectively. I took the floor last week to talk about English-American \nTailoring, located in Westminster, MD. There are 380 union jobs in \nWestminster, MD. I showed a photograph of seamstresses making suits in \nAmerica. I think most people thought that photo was taken decades ago, \nbut it was taken this month. This is about how we can preserve jobs in \nAmerica. They are making the best suits in the world. They are \nexporting their suits to other countries, but they can't do it unless \nwe have a level playing field.\n  The leadership of the Senator from New Jersey on bringing to the \nattention of the American people the need to extend and make effective \nthe cotton and wool trust fund is critically important to preserving \njobs in Maryland, New Jersey, and in our Nation.\n  Again, I thank Senator Menendez, on behalf of American workers, for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield to me for 1 minute?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \ndebate on S. 3414, the cyber security bill, be extended until 5 p.m. \nand at that time I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland, a fellow member of the Finance Committee. Senator Cardin has \nbeen a passionate voice on this as well. I am thrilled to have him as \nan ally in this endeavor.\n  All we want is for Americans to stay employed. They can compete with \nanybody in the world but not when they have to pay a tariff or tax that \nnobody else has to pay who sends the same product back into the United \nStates. That is our goal. I appreciate his work, his passion, and his \ncommitment. I look forward to working with the majority leader and the \nchairman of the Finance Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may have a few moments, the Senate \nis not in a quorum call, is it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no quorum call.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Very briefly, Mr. President, I have just received a \ncopy of a letter that has been sent this morning to the majority \nleader, Senator Reid, and the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, \nfrom GEN Keith Alexander of the United States Army, Director of the \nNational Security Agency and Chief of Cyber Command at the Department \nof Defense. He is a distinguished and honored leader of our military, \none of the people who has the greatest single responsibility for \nprotecting our security, both in terms of the extraordinary \ncapabilities the National Security Agency has but now increasingly for \nthe defense of our cyber system.\n  This is a career military officer, not a politician. He is somebody \nwho has a mission, and it is from that sense of responsibility that \nGeneral Alexander has written to Senator Reid and Senator McConnell. He \nwrites--and I will ask to have it printed in the Record--to express his \n``strong support for passage of a comprehensive bipartisan cyber \nsecurity bill by the Senate this week.'' Why? I continue to quote:\n\n       The cyber threat facing the Nation is real and demands \n     immediate action. The time to act is now; we simply cannot \n     afford further delay.\n\n  He adds:\n\n       Moreover, to be most effective in protecting against this \n     threat to our national security, cyber security legislation \n     should address both information sharing and core critical \n     infrastructure hardening.\n\n  Then he explains both of those in very compelling language. He also \nsays:\n\n       Finally, any legislation needs to recognize that cyber \n     security is a team sport. No single public or private entity \n     has all of the required authorities, resources, and \n     capabilities. Within the federal government, the Department \n     of Defense and the Intelligence Community are now closely \n     partnered with the Department of Homeland Security and the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation. The benefits of this \n     partnership are perhaps best evidenced by the Managed \n     Security Service (MSS) program, which affords protection to \n     certain government components and defense companies. The \n     legislation will help enable us to make these same \n     protections available widely to the private sector.\n\n  I cannot thank General Alexander enough. He ends by saying this:\n\n       The President and the Congress have rightly made cyber \n     security a national priority. We need to move forward on \n     comprehensive legislation now.\n\n  He urged Senators Reid and McConnell ``to work together to get it \npassed.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this very compelling letter from GEN \nKeith Alexander be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         National Security Agency,\n\n\n                                     Central Security Service,\n\n                                         Fort George G. Meade, MD.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for passage of a comprehensive bipartisan cyber \n     security bill by the Senate this week. The cyber threat \n     facing the Nation is real and demands immediate action. The \n     time to act is now; we simply cannot afford further delay. \n     Moreover, to be most effective in protecting against this \n     threat to our national security, cyber security legislation \n     should address both information sharing and core critical \n     infrastructure hardening.\n        Both the government and the private sector have unique \n     insights into the cyber threat facing our Nation today. \n     Sharing these insights will enhance our mutual understanding \n     of the threat and enable the operational collaboration that \n     is needed to identify cyber threat indicators and mitigate \n     them. It is important that any legislation establish a clear \n     framework for such sharing, with robust safeguards for the \n     privacy and civil liberties of our citizens. The American \n     people must have confidence that threat information is being \n     shared appropriately and in the most transparent way \n     possible. This is why I support information to be shared \n     through a civilian entity, with real-time, rule-based sharing \n     of cyber security threat indicators with all relevant federal \n     partners.\n        Information sharing alone, however, is insufficient to \n     address the vulnerabilities to the Nation's core critical \n     infrastructure. Comprehensive cyber security legislation also \n     needs to ensure that this infrastructure is sufficiently \n     hardened and resilient, as it is the storehouse of much of \n     our economic prosperity. And, our national security depends \n     on it. We face sophisticated, well-resourced adversaries who \n     understand this. Key to addressing this peril is the adoption \n     of minimum security requirements to harden these networks, \n     dissuading adversaries and making it more difficult for them \n     to conduct a successful cyber penetration. It is important \n     that these requirements be collaboratively developed with \n     industry and not be too burdensome. While I believe this can \n     be done, I also believe that industry will require some form \n     of incentives to make this happen.\n        Finally, any legislation needs to recognize that cyber \n     security is a team sport. No single public or private entity \n     has all of the required authorities, resources, and \n     capabilities. Within the federal government, the Department \n     of Defense and the Intelligence Community are now closely \n     partnered with the Department of Homeland Security and the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation. The benefits of this \n     partnership are perhaps best evidenced by the Managed \n     Security Service (MSS) program, which affords protections to \n     certain government components and defense companies. The \n     legislation will help enable us to make these same \n     protections available widely to the private sector.\n        The President and the Congress have rightly made cyber \n     security a national priority. We need to move forward on \n     comprehensive legislation now. I urge you to work together to \n     get it passed.\n\n                                           Keith B.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am so glad the Presiding Officer is in \nthe chair while I am making these remarks. I wish to salute the \nPresiding Officer for his service in the Senate and his service to the \nNation. One knows he is a member of the U.S. Marine Corps although he \nno longer wears the uniform. I believe once a marine, always a marine. \nAnd his service in Vietnam and to the Nation as Secretary of the Navy \nis well known and well appreciated. The Presiding Officer has served as \na marine in the Marine Corps and as Secretary of the Navy and now in \nthe Senate as a Member of the Democratic Party. The Presiding Officer \nreally serves the Nation.\n  I come to the floor today to talk about cyber security and the need \nto pass cyber security legislation this week, in this body. And I come \nto the floor not as a Democrat, I come to the floor as a patriot.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate that this week, on this floor, \nthe Senate has a rendezvous with destiny. We have pending before us \ncyber security legislation, a framework to protect critical \ninfrastructure of the dot-com world against cyber attacks from those \nwho have predatory, hostile intent to the United States of America. We \nare bogged down. We are not moving. We are once again following what \nhas become a usual pattern in the Senate: when all is said and done, \nmore is going to get said than gets done.\n  But I say to anyone listening and anyone watching, we cannot let that \nhappen. The United States of America is in danger. And this danger is \nnot something in the future. It is not something written in science \nfiction books. This is not the wave that is going to come. It is \nhappening right now in cyber attacks on our banking services, our \npersonal identity, our trade secrets, and things I will talk about \nmore.\n  The naysayers here say: We can't pass this bill because it will be \noverregulation and it will lead to strangulation, and, oh my gosh, we \ncan't ask the private sector to spend one dime on protecting itself.\n  Well, I respect healthy criticism, but let me say to my friends, \nbecause I want them to know that if anything happens to the United \nStates of America--if the grid goes down, if NASDAQ goes down, if our \nbanking system goes down, if we will not be able to function because \nthe streetlights won't be on and we won't be able to turn the \nelectricity on--I will tell you what will happen. Once again, \npoliticians will overreact, we will overregulate, and we will \noverspend.\n  In a very judicious, well-thought-out, well-discussed process, we \ncould come up with a legislative framework that would defend the United \nStates of America and at the same time balance that sensible center \nthat another great patriot, Colin Powell, calls us to do: Always look \nfor the middle ground while we look at where we want to go.\n  There is a cyber war, and I want everybody to know about it. Cyber \nattacks are happening right now. Cyber terrorists are thinking every \nsingle day about attacking our critical infrastructure. There are \nnation states that want to humiliate and intimidate the United States \nof America and cause catastrophic economic destruction. How do they \nwant to do it? They want to take over our power grids. They want to \ndisrupt our air traffic control. They want to disrupt the financial \nfunctioning of the United States of America. Cyber spies are working at \nbreakneck speed to steal many of our state secrets. Cyber criminals are \nhacking our networks. So what are we talking about in this bill? We are \ntalking about critical infrastructure.\n  Now, I am a Senator from Maryland, and the Presiding Officer is a \nSenator from Virginia. Does he remember that freaky storm a couple \nweeks ago? Remember Pepco? Oh, boy. I still have my ears ringing from \nmy constituents calling about Pepco. I can tell you what it was like in \nBaltimore when that freaky storm hit. You couldn't get around when the \nstoplights were down. It was like the Wild West getting around. You \ncould go into stores--if they were open--and nothing functioned. The \nlights weren't on. The refrigeration was off. Businesses were losing \nhundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars. There were families, \nlike a mother with an infant child and another child, with no \nelectricity for 5 days who went to hotel rooms.\n  Now, they want to talk about this bill costing too much money? Just \nlook at what it cost the national capital region of the United States \nof America because of a freaky storm.\n  It took us 5 days to get the utilities back on because of the utility \ncompany, but what happens if our destiny is outside of our control, if \ncyber terrorists have turned off the lights in America and we can't get \nthem turned back on? It is going to cost too much? Wait until this kind \nof thing happens. I don't want it to happen, and we can prevent it from \nhappening, and we can do it in a way that understands the needs of \nbusiness.\n  I want to understand the needs of small business, but I sure \nunderstand the needs of families.\n  For those who say it is going to cost too much and they have the \nconcerns of the chamber of commerce, fine. I don't want to trash-talk \nthem. My father owned a little neighborhood grocery store. I know what \nit is like when the electricity goes down. My father lost thousands of \ndollars because the frozen food melted, lost thousands of dollars when \nwe had a freaky storm because of the refrigeration and his meats and \nproduce went bad. My father lost thousands of dollars years ago in a \nfreaky storm.\n  This bill means that if we come up with the kind of legislation that \nwe want, we can deal with it. Just remember what critical \ninfrastructure means. It means the financial services. It means the \ngrid. So when there is no power, schools are shut down, businesses are \nshut down, public transit is crippled, no traffic lights are working. \nBy the way, in Virginia didn't 9-1-1 stop working, and they are still \ninvestigating? Don't we love to investigate? Well, right now I don't \nwant to investigate and I don't want to castigate, but I sure want the \nSenate to be able to get going.\n  Then there is the issue of financial services. The FBI is currently \ninvestigating 400 reported cases of corporate account attacks where \ncyber criminals have made unauthorized transfers from bank accounts of \nU.S. businesses. The FBI tells me they are looking at the attempt to \nsteal $255 million and an actual loss of $85 million. Hackers are \nalready going into the New York Stock Exchange, they are already going \ninto NASDAQ in an attempt to shut down or steal information. Gosh, if \nwe allow this to continue, they could attack and cost us billions of \ndollars.\n  Does the Presiding Officer remember that in 2010 we had a flash \ncrash? New vocabulary, new things out there. The Dow plunged 1,000 \npoints in a matter of minutes because automatic computer traders shut \ndown. This was the result of turbulent trading. But just imagine if \nterrorists or nation states that really don't like us--and I am really \nnot going to name them, but we really know who they are--really create \nflash crashes?\n\n  I know there are patriots in this Senate who have been the defenders \nof the Nation in other wars. They have said themselves that they worry \nabout the Asia Pacific, they worry about China. I worry about China \ntoo. So while we are looking at the Defense authorization and \nappropriations--and people want more aircraft carriers to defend us in \nthe blue waters against China. But what happens if there is a cyber \nattack? Now, we do know how to protect dot-mil, but don't we also want \nto protect dot-com in the same way? I think so.\n  I salute Senators Lieberman and Collins. They have come forth with a \nbill that does two things from a national security perspective. First \nof all, it tells business: You can come in voluntarily. There is no \nmandate to participate. But if you do come in, you will get liability \nprotection.\n\n[[Page S5706]]\n\n  Wow. In other words, we are actually going to offer incentives. We \nare actually going to offer good-guy bonuses. We are not going to do it \nthrough tax breaks or more things that add to the deficit or debt. We \nare going to say: Come on in. Participate in both the setting of \nstandards--we want you at the table--and then living by the standards, \nand for that, you will get liability protection.\n  There are also those who say: We just don't like Department of \nHomeland Security being in charge. We worry about a cyber Katrina.\n  I worried about that too, but I must say that in all of our meetings, \nwe can see that the Department of Homeland Security has made tremendous \nadvances. I have been one of their sharpest critics in this area, and I \nhave been skeptical from the beginning. But now, as we have moved along \nand listening to Secretary Napolitano and General Alexander, the head \nof the National Security Agency, on how they can work together honoring \nthe Constitution and civil liberties, I think we have a good bill.\n  Why do we need this bill? General Alexander, who heads up the \nNational Security Agency and the Cyber Command, says that we are facing \nattacks and the potential of attacks that are mind-boggling. He talks \nabout the stealing of trade secrets that amounts to the greatest \ntransfer of wealth the country has ever seen. He worries about the \nsecurity of the grid. He worries about financial services, while he \nalso worries very much about the dot-com.\n  But we live in the United States of America. We have a constitutional \ngovernment. Our military, no matter how powerful and how strong, has a \nresponsibility to certain areas, but we need a civilian agency in \ncharge of how to protect dot-com, a civilian agency benefiting from the \nincredible turbo intellectual and technical power of the National \nSecurity Agency.\n  So we have a bill that offers the framework. I would say, let's have \nthe bill, let's vote for cloture, and let's have regular order with \nactual germane amendments. We have patriots here, but who are we for? \nAre we for protecting America or are we for coming up with the same old \nplatitudes that resist any activity of government at all to protect the \nAmerican people?\n  I am no Janie-come-lately to this bill. I represent one of the \ngreatest States in America. We are home to the National Security \nAgency. I have the high honor of being on the Intelligence Committee. I \nhave been working on this topic for almost a decade, and I have watched \nthe threat grow as I watched the technology against us grow in power \nand the number of people who could attack us in this area.\n  I sit on the Appropriation Committee, where, as a member of the DOD \nappropriations, I have been proud to work with both the authorizers and \nSenator Inouye to stand up for Cyber Command, the Tenth Fleet, which is \nthe cyber fleet, and others relating to it. But also what I have been \nproud of is being able to take a look at what we do need to do here in \nterms of everything from workforce to protecting others.\n  My subcommittee funds the FBI. Working with Director Mueller, I have \nbeen able to see up close and personal the growing threats right here \nin the United States of America, whether cyber criminals can literally \ninvade large banking. I could give example after example. Working also \nwith other departments, we can see that there are cyber-attacks. We \nneed to be able to do this.\n\n  I could give other examples and I will do so in the debate, but let \nme summarize. The attacks are now. The question is, are we going to \nbuild a cyber bomb shelter? This is not like the bunkers of old. This \nis where we work with the private sector. Remember, our grid and our \ntelecommunications are owned and operated by the private sector. We \ncannot do this without the private sector. We, your government, come \ntogether with a legislative framework that is constitutionally sound \nand legally reliable. The fact is that we will make the best and \nhighest use of our military under that rubric. But at the end of the \nday we will be able to have a voluntary framework bringing the private \nsector together with incentives around liability that invite them to \nparticipate in the formulation of the regulation, the implementation of \nthe regulation, and living by it. This is not regulation that leads to \nstrangulation, this is regulation that helps them be able to protect \nthe United States of America.\n  Let me conclude. Everybody says: Gee, what could I do? Could I have \nprotected against an attack on the United States of America? What is \nthe name of that little-known group you didn't know how to spell years \nago? Al-Qaida? Would we have done everything in the world to protect \nagainst the al-Qaida attack? I certainly would. I say today, if you \nwant to protect against the next big attacks on the United States of \nAmerica, vote for cloture. Let's have an informed debate. Let's find at \nthe end of the day the sensible center that will give us a \nconstitutional but effective way of defending America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I do week \nafter week--as a doctor who has practiced medicine in Wyoming and taken \ncare of families in Wyoming across our State for a quarter of a \ncentury--to give a doctor's second opinion about the health care law.\n  One of the central claims of President Obama and Democrats in \nWashington who voted in this Senate Chamber was that the health care \nlaw would extend insurance coverage for millions of Americans. That was \ntheir goal. They claim that is actually what has happened. The \nPresident claimed repeatedly that 30 million more Americans would \nreceive health coverage because of the health care law.\n  Well, after practicing medicine for 25 years, I understand there is a \nhuge difference between health coverage and health care. When people \nhave a health insurance card, then they have coverage. When people have \naccess to a doctor, nurse, nurse practitioner, or physician's \nassistant, then they can receive health care.\n  The New York Times actually pointed that out this Sunday morning. It \nwas the front page, above the fold. They proclaimed in the first \nparagraph of an article that the President's health care law delivers \ncoverage but not care. As a matter of fact, when I take a look at this \narticle dated Sunday, July 29, 2012, of the New York Times, page 1, \nabove the fold, ``Doctor Shortage Likely to Worsen with Health Law,'' \nunderneath it says that primary care is scarce, in bold letters, and \nbeyond that it says: Expanded coverage but a greater strain on a \nburdened system.\n  The story highlights a study from the Association of American Medical \nColleges, which found that in 2015, just 3 years from now, the country \nwill face a shortage of over 60,000 doctors. By 2025, the shortage is \nexpected to expand to approximately 130,000.\n  So while the Nation was already facing this shortage, the article \npoints out it has been made worse by the President's health care law. \nThe shortage of providers is very important because, as the article \nstates, ``Coverage will not necessarily translate into care.'' This is \nespecially true for those individuals who are supposed to receive their \nhealth care through Medicaid. Let's remember, a huge expansion of \nMedicaid was part of the President's health care law. It was part of \nthe discussion in the Supreme Court, the decision they came out with. \nOf course, Medicaid is the program that provides health care for low-\nincome Americans.\n  The President's health care law contained one of the largest \nexpansions of Medicaid in the program's history. The President chose to \nexpand the program despite the fact that fewer than half of the primary \ncare clinicians would accept new Medicaid patients as of 2008. Fewer \nthan half of the primary care clinicians were accepting new Medicaid\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\npatients. Yet that is from where the President chose to build his \nhealth care reform.\n  Some might ask: Why is it that so many primary care physicians are \nnot seeing Medicaid patients? It is because the reimbursements provided \nto doctors are so low that many can't afford to see Medicaid patients \nand continue to keep their doors open. Unfortunately, the outlook for \nMedicaid in this country has not improved.\n  USA Today reported in July that 13 States are moving to cut Medicaid \neven further by doing a couple of things. They want to reduce benefits, \nthey want to pay health providers less, or tighten eligibility for the \nprogram. So the program the President highlights as one of the cores of \nhis health care law is already in significant trouble, is not \nfunctioning, and is getting worse.\n  The State of Illinois has imposed a new limit on the number of \nprescription drugs that a patient who is on Medicaid can receive. This \ncap was imposed as part of a plan to cut $1.6 billion from the States' \nMedicaid Program.\n  Mark Heyrman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, \ntold the Chicago Tribune that the prescription drug limits amount to a \ndenial of service. So that is what we are looking at now. Yet this is \nthe basis upon which the President has built his health care law.\n  According to the most recent estimate by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, over one-third of the people expected to gain insurance \ncoverage under the President's health care law are supposed to do it \nthrough this Medicaid Program. Clearly, with States being forced to cut \nback their existing Medicaid Program, there are many people who are not \ngoing to get the care they were promised through the President's health \ncare law. For those who can find a physician, many of these patients \nwill have to commute longer distances and will also have to endure \nlonger waiting times just to get the treatment they are seeking.\n  Some experts have described this as an invisible problem, and they \nsay that is because people may still get care, but the process of \nreceiving that care will be more difficult.\n  The chief executive of the California Medical Association says, ``It \nresults in delayed care and higher levels of acuity''--the seriousness \nof the injury or illness to that patient when they finally get the care \nthey need. When care is delayed, medical problems can become much more \nserious, and that forces patients to seek treatment through other \nsettings. One of the prime examples of that is heading to the emergency \nroom.\n  Well, the whole goal, I remember, of the debate on the Senate floor \nin listening to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle was that \npatients under the President's health care law, the Democrats claimed, \nwould be able to get to see a primary care doctor and would not have to \ngo to the emergency room. However, that is not what we are finding \nunder the President's health care law. We are finding just the opposite \nof what the President promised.\n  That is why the Medical College of Emergency Physicians told the Wall \nStreet Journal:\n\n       While there are provisions in the law to benefit emergency \n     care patients, it is clear that emergency visits will \n     increase, as we have already seen nationwide.\n\n  So the President says one thing and the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians is telling us what they are seeing on a daily basis in \nemergency rooms across the country.\n  To put it another way, since the President's health care law \nexacerbated the shortage of providers, more patients are seeking \ntreatment in emergency rooms. This is not what the American people were \nlooking for in health reform. Instead of making empty promises, \nsupporters of the health care law should have dealt with the issues \nthat are already causing many doctors to rethink their medical career.\n  For example, supporters of the law absolutely refused to deal with \nthe crushing burden of the medical lawsuit abuse. It is an abusive \nsituation that is forcing doctors to practice a significant amount of \ndefensive medicine, which is very expensive. It is expensive for \nindividual patients as well as expensive for the system.\n\n  The Harvard School of Public Health found that these costs amount to \n2.4 percent of annual health spending in the United States or $55 \nbillion in 2008. That is the Harvard School of Public Health. There are \nother estimates out there which go with much higher numbers. Apparently \nsupporters of the law thought it was more important to help trial \nlawyers instead of patients.\n  As a matter of fact, Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic National \nCommittee, has said they left lawsuit abuse out of the health care law \nbecause of the significant impact that trial lawyers have as \ncontributors to the Democratic Party. So here we are.\n  Additionally, the health care law does nothing to stop the crushing \nburden of government regulations and paperwork that is consuming the \nhealth care profession.\n  Finally, many people choose to become doctors because they enjoy \nbeing able to innovate and create the next generation of devices and \ntreatments. Unfortunately, that is changing as a result of the \nsignificant taxes that are part of the health care law.\n  In an article published on Friday, we have learned that Cook Medical, \nwhich is a medical device company in Indiana, announced that it was \nscrapping plans to expand because of the President's health care law. \nThere are similar companies in States all across the country, many with \nlarge medical institutions who have a history of the best innovation in \nthe land--and actually in the world--that are faced with these medical \ndevice taxes, not on profit but on the gross amount of money sales. The \ncompany said the 2.3-percent medical device tax contained in the law \nwould stop the company from opening five new plants in the United \nStates and add approximately 300 new good-paying jobs.\n  The Senate should also know that this Cook Medical Company produces \nmedical devices that address women's health issues. Specifically, the \ncompany produces products related to gynecologic surgery, obstetrics, \nand assisted reproduction, to name a few. Therefore, the President's \nhealth care law is actually hurting the ability of Cook Medical and \nother companies to provide American women with access to cutting-edge \nmedical technology. Why? Because of the device tax, which I believe--I \nbelieve we should repeal the entire law, but clearly we have introduced \nlegislation to repeal the medical device tax. It is a bipartisan piece \nof legislation supported from both parties and should be passed \nimmediately.\n  It seems Democrats are reluctant to look at parts of the health care \nlaw and repeal the law.\n  All this means medicine is becoming less of an attractive career \nchoice for many young people across the country. As CNN stated in a \nheadline from July 29, just 2 days ago, ``Your health care is covered, \nbut who's going to treat you?''\n  The President and Washington Democrats did not seem interested in \naddressing this question when the health care law was passed. More \neffort was put into hiring IRS agents to look into whether a person had \ninsurance than to actually see if there were doctors, nurses, nurse \npractitioners, physician assistants, and others to care for patients. \nInstead of focusing on policies that would give incentives for more \npeople to become health care providers, they filled their law with \nempty promises the American people know today have not been kept.\n  It is time for Congress to repeal the President's health care law and \nreplace it with real reforms that will improve the ability of patients \nto get the care they need from the doctor they choose at a lower cost.\n  That is why I come to the floor with a doctor's second opinion about \na health care law which as the front page of the Sunday New York Times \nsaid: ``Doctor Shortage Likely to Worsen with Health Law.'' Primary \ncare is scarce. Expanded coverage but a greater strain on a burdened \nsystem.\n  As I have been saying for a number of years on the Senate floor, \ncoverage will not necessarily translate into care.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the bill pending before us is the \nCybersecurity Act of 2012, as it is known, and for most people it is a \nterm which they may have heard but may not fully understand.\n  It was about 2 months ago that Members of the Senate, including the \nPresiding Officer, were invited to a classified briefing. It was a \nbriefing that Senator Mikulski of Maryland asked for to explain what \nthis was all about because we had been hearing over and over again from \nthe defense establishment in America that the No. 1 threat to America's \nsafety and security was no longer just terrorism; it was cyber security \nthreats and terrorism. For most people, they are not quite sure they \nhave seen any examples of it that could make a difference.\n  So here is what we saw. They took us down to this classified room, \nclosed the door, took away our BlackBerries and iPhones, and put them \nin a separate place--and I will explain why they did that in a moment--\nthey took us in the room and briefed us on an example, just a theory. \nWhat if? What if a subcontracting company that supplied a major public \nutility in a city such as New York had a problem and someone stole a \nlaptop from one of the employees, and that theft went unnoticed or \nunreported for a number of days, and then the laptop either reappeared \nor did not, what could happen?\n  Well, what could happen was, if that laptop computer had certain \ninformation in it that not only told you how to get into the computer \nsystem of the subcontracting company but also the public utility, bad \nthings could occur. So getting inside that computer laptop, getting \ninside the technology of the subcontractor, and then finding that \ninformation bridge into the public utility could create an opportunity \nto turn out the lights in the city of New York.\n  That was the exercise we went through. God forbid it would ever \noccur, but they said: When you turn out the lights in a major American \ncity such as New York, terrible things happen. Not only do traffic \nsignals stop, and lights do not go on at night, and the New York Stock \nExchange is not operating, hospitals are on emergency generators and \nproblems start popping up in every single direction--water \npurification; the pumps that keep the subway system under the city of \nNew York going so that the subway tunnels are not flooded--all of these \nthings on top of one another. While this tragedy is occurring, the \npeople in our government are trying to figure out: What happened? And \nhow do we put things back into place and get them moving again?\n  That was one example.\n  There was another example. It was an example at one of our defense \nresearch laboratories. Top secret. Nobody can get in. Right? They told \nus of an example--and I will not even tell you the State where it was \nlocated--they told us of an example where the employees at our top \ndefense research laboratory--who were trying to figure out \ncountermeasures to stop attacks against the United States, and to \ndevelop our own weaponry--had what appeared to be a harmless e-mail \nsent to the employees saying: Explanation of Your New Health Care \nBenefits. Just Click Below. It turned out that click brought the \nhackers into the system.\n  So what we are talking about here has consequences that go far beyond \nthe harassment of some teenage hacker who is trying to get into some \ncompany computer or even the school's computer.\n  I was on a plane yesterday with a gentleman who is working for the \nNational Institutes of Health. I asked him about cyber security.\n  He said: We think about it every day--every day--because hackers are \ntrying to get into the National Institutes of Health technology and \ncomputer system.\n  I said: What for?\n  He said: Well, some of them are in there for insidious reasons. But \nsome of them are childish hackers.\n  I said: What do they do?\n  He said: Well, they will come in, for example, and change our \npublished list of antidotes to certain poisons, so we always have to \nkeep an eye on it to make sure they have not changed what people, \ndoctors, should use across America.\n  Think about it. Think about all of the possibilities. What we are \ntrying to do today is to come up with a line of defense for America. We \nare trying to establish a working relationship between all levels of \nour government and the private sector of the United States to keep us \nsafe. Because what they told us was, every single day, China, Russia, \nIran are on the attack--cyber security attacks into the United States--\nnot just the ones I have mentioned but far beyond. Defense contractors \nbuilding the planes and the armaments and all the artillery and the \nlike have to worry about whether their secret plans, their patented \ninformation is being stolen right from under them, stolen by someone \nwho wants to compete with them or perhaps wants to go to war with them. \nThat is what is at stake.\n  So for a long time we have been warned and forewarned to do something \nabout it. The bipartisan consensus among defense and intelligence \nexperts in the public and private sector is that our Nation is \ndangerously vulnerable to cyber-attack at this moment.\n  FBI Director Bob Mueller--an extraordinarily great public servant--\nsays the threat our Nation faces from a cyber-attack will soon equal or \nsurpass the threat from al-Qaida and more traditional forms of \nterrorism.\n  Navy ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said: ``The cyber \nthreat has no boundaries or rules, and the reality is that cyber \nattacks can bring us to our knees.'' According to our Director of \nNational Intelligence, James Clapper, countries such as Russia and \nChina are already exploiting our vulnerability. His unclassified \nassessment--what he told the public--is that entities within these \ncountries are already ``responsible for extensive illicit intrusions \ninto U.S. computer networks and theft of intellectual property.''\n  We have to respond to this. We have to do it quickly. I wish to thank \nSenators Lieberman, Collins, Feinstein, and Rockefeller for putting \ntogether this bill, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. They have introduced \nan approach that is balanced, bipartisan, and responsive to legitimate \nconcerns raised by the intelligence community, private industry, and \nprivacy advocates. The Cybersecurity Act of 2012 will help make us \nsafer.\n  Our Nation's critical infrastructure--powerplants, pipelines, \nelectrical grids, water treatment facilities, transportation systems, \neven financial networks--are increasingly vulnerable to attack. Bad \nactors in other countries have already demonstrated their ability to \nuse the Internet to take control of computer systems.\n  Last year, there was a 400-percent increase in cyber attacks on the \nowners of critical infrastructure. This act has provisions that will \nreduce our vulnerability and shore up our defenses. In response to \nconcerns raised by some in the private sector and some on the other \nside of the aisle, Senators Lieberman and Collins revised a section of \nthe bill. The bill now creates a voluntary, incentive-based system of \nperformance standards. Private companies and government agencies will \nwork together to determine the best practices in each sector to prevent \na cyber attack. Companies that voluntarily implement those standards \nwill be rewarded with immunity from punitive damages in a lawsuit, \nreceipt of real-time cyber threat information, and expedited security \nclearances, among other things.\n  This voluntary arrangement replaces the mandatory system in an early \nversion of the bill. Many of us supported that approach. But in the \nspirit of compromise and responding to concerns expressed by the \nbusiness community, the managers have included this voluntary approach. \nThe Cybersecurity Act of 2012 also authorizes voluntary information \nsharing. The sharing provision will allow government agencies and \nwilling private companies to enhance the mutual understanding of the \nreal threat and our vulnerabilities.\n  Sharing this information on effective responses and recent cyber \nthreats will enable both the government and the private sector to \nunderstand the threat and to respond. A handful of industries have \nalready adopted this approach, and it significantly enhances their \nability to identify and respond to cyber threats. We should empower the \ngovernment to share its knowledge with\n\n[[Page S5709]]\n\nthese and other industries. We should make it clear the private \ncompanies can share cyber threat indicators with the government. That \nis exactly what this Act does.\n  I wish to thank the Presiding Officer, Senator Franken of Minnesota, \nas well as Senators Coons, Blumenthal, Sanders, and Akaka for working \nwith me and the managers to ensure that we protect privacy and civil \nliberties. The Presiding Officer is chair of the Privacy Subcommittee \nof the Judiciary Committee. He has been a real leader on these issues. \nI was happy to work with him. As a result of his efforts and our \nefforts, the willingness of Senators Lieberman, Collins, Rockefeller, \nand Feinstein, we were able to significantly enhance the privacy and \ncivil liberties protections in the revised bill. I believe--I have \nalways believed and I will continue to believe--we can keep America \nsafe and free. We can establish in our democratic society the \nappropriate defense to any threat without sacrificing our fundamental \nconstitutional rights.\n  The revised bill, after we negotiated with them, now requires that \nthe government cyber security exchanges be operated by civilian \nagencies within the Federal Government. Our thinking was that these \nagencies are more prone to oversight, and any excesses by them will be \ncaught earlier than if this is done on the military side, to be very \nblunt.\n  Military and spy agencies should not be the first recipients of \npersonal communications such as e-mails. But from time to time, they \nwill need to be informed and we need to rely on their expertise. That \nis why the bill requires that relevant cyber threat information be \nshared with these agencies as appropriate in real time.\n  The revised bill eliminates immunities for companies that violate the \nprivacy rights of Americans in a knowing, intentional or grossly \nnegligent manner. To ensure that cyber security exchanges are not used \nto circumvent the fourth amendment, the bill requires law enforcement \nto only use information from the cyber exchanges to stop cyber crimes, \nprevent imminent death or bodily harm to adults or prevent exploitation \nof minors.\n  The revised bill creates a vigorous structure for strong, recurring, \nand independent oversight to guarantee transparency and accountability. \nIt gives individuals authority to sue the government for privacy \nviolations, to ensure compliance with the rules for protecting private \ninformation. These commonsense reforms improve the information-sharing \nsection of the bill, and they protect privacy. That is why they have \nbeen widely embraced across the political spectrum from left to right. \nI think we have found the sweet spot. I think we have found the right \nbalance. That kind of endorsement across the political spectrum \nsuggests that is the case.\n  We are very vulnerable in the United States at this very moment. Our \ncritical infrastructure is at risk, and billions of dollars' worth of \nintellectual property is being stolen. Our national security is \ncompromised. To put the cyber threat in perspective, GEN Keith \nAlexander, Director of the National Security Agency, was asked: How \nprepared is the United States for a cyber attack on a scale of 1 to 10, \nwith 10 meaning we are the most prepared. What was his answer? Three--\nthree out of ten. That is an alarming assessment. It is a failing grade \nby any standard.\n  If we do not act now, we will continue to be at risk for not only the \nloss of information and economic loss but even worse, mass casualties, \na crippled economy, the compromise of sensitive data. I know this bill \nhas some controversy associated with it. I know there are some in the \nbusiness sector who think we have gone too far. I would plead with \nthem, work with us. Let us do this and do it now. To let this wait is \nto jeopardize the security of this country. We did not think twice to \nrespond quickly after the 9/11 attacks to make America safe. We see it \neverywhere we turn. If one can even imagine what life was like in the \nUnited States before 9/11, before we took our shoes off when we went to \nthe airport, before searches were commonplace in American life, before \narmed guards stood outside the U.S. Capitol--those are the realities of \nwhat we face today because of that attack.\n\n  Let's be thoughtful. Let's be careful. Let's come together, the \nprivate and public sector. Let's do this the right way to keep America \nsafe. The people who sent us to represent them expect no less.\n\n\n                          For-Profit Colleges\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate HELP Committee released a report after \ncompleting a 2-year investigation of for-profit colleges. The 1,096-\npage report is the most comprehensive analysis yet. It provides a broad \npicture of the for-profit college industry. What Senator Tom Harkin and \nthe committee discovered and carefully documented is an industry driven \nby profit, which too often has limited concern for the students or the \nactual learning process.\n  The report profiles 30 of the biggest for-profit colleges, virtually \nfrom every State in the Union, including Illinois. There are good \nschools there, make no mistake, and my colleague Senator Harkin has \nbeen careful to point them out. But there are also some that are not \nmaking an effort. Some are trying to improve student outcomes. But \nunfortunately there are many of these for-profit schools that are just \ntaking in, soaking in Federal subsidies in the form of student aid so \nthey can pay their shareholders extra money.\n  DeVry is the third largest for-profit college in the country. It is \nbased in my State of Illinois. DeVry operates 96 campuses and offers \nclasses online. In 2010, DeVry had over 100,000 students, an increase \nof 250 percent of enrollment in 10 years since the year 2000. It \nderives almost 80 percent of its revenue from the Federal Government.\n  Similar to the other companies profiled in the report, DeVry's \ntuition is significantly higher than that of public colleges. The cost \nof tuition for a bachelor of science in business administration at \nDeVry's Chicago campus is $84,320--for a bachelor's degree--\nconsiderably more than the same program at the University of Illinois, \nwhere the 4-year tuition is $75,000.\n  DeVry looks good compared to many of its peers in the for-profit \nsector. Unlike some other schools, DeVry's internal documents reveal \nthe school has chosen not to use aggressive price increases in the \nfuture. I salute them for that. I have spoken to their leadership and \ntold them that if they want to distance themselves from the pack of bad \nfor-profit schools, they have do it by making decisions and \nimplementing them to demonstrate they are a different kind of for-\nprofit school.\n  There are still areas where DeVry can make improvements. DeVry's \ninstitutional loan program, a private loan program, charges a 12-\npercent interest rate--12 percent. The Federal Government student loan, \n3.4 percent in contrast. So this rate is roughly three times the \nFederal loan.\n  The HELP Committee estimates that in 2009, when all sources of \nFederal funds, including military and veteran's benefits are included, \nthe 15 largest publicly traded for-profit education companies received \n86 percent of their revenue from taxpayers--86 percent. They are 14 \npercent away from being totally Federal agencies.\n  Perhaps this would be acceptable if students were learning and \ngaining skills to succeed, but what the committee found is troubling. \nOne of the main reasons student outcomes are so poor at these schools \nis that the schools do not provide students with basic support services \nthat they need to find a job and succeed. Student support services are \nessential to helping students adapt and do well while they are in \nschool and find a job. What happens instead? They drop out or, if they \ngraduate, they cannot find a job.\n  In 2010, the 30 for-profit colleges examined employed 35,000-plus \nrecruiters--35,000 recruiters. The same schools collectively employed \n3,500 career service staff and 12,452 support staff. So by a margin of \n2\\1/2\\ to 1, the schools had more recruiters than support service \nemployees.\n  So we cannot be shocked when we learn that one-half million students \nwho enrolled in 2008-2009 left without a degree or certificate by mid-\n2010. Among 2-year associate degree holders, almost two-thirds of the \nstudents in these for-profit schools departed without a degree, just a \ndebt.\n  The report also highlighted a growing problem among for-profit \ncolleges, the use of lead generators. For-profit colleges gathered \ncontact information on perspective students or leads, as they call \nthem, by paying third-party companies known as lead generators.\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\nThese generators specialize in gathering and selling information--in \nthis case, very personal information.\n  Here is how it works. A student browsing the Internet searches for \nterms such as ``GI bill,'' ``student loan,'' ``Federal student aid'' or \nany variation. They are directed to various Web sites that are owned by \nthese lead generator companies. The Web site then claims to pass the \nprospective student contact into an appropriate school for the student \nonline. Typically, there is no disclosure to the student that their \npersonal information is being sold to for-profit colleges.\n  When a perspective student does give their contact information, watch \nout. They will be bombarded with calls and e-mails from aggressive \nrecruiters at these for-profit schools. Remember that 35,202 people are \nemployed as recruiters. This is what they do. One of the Web sites, \ngibill.com, was owned by a company called QuinStreet until last month, \nwhen 23 attorneys general across the United States did what Congress \nshould have done first. As part of an agreement, QuinStreet gave up its \nright to the Web site to the Veterans' Administration where it belongs. \nSo gibill.com is no longer a deceptive Web site, at least in these 23 \nStates where there has been an agreement. Other Web sites used the name \nof Federal student aid programs and misled students into believing this \nwas a real government program.\n  One of the HELP Committee's recommendations is to further regulate \nthe private student line market. Senator Harkin and I introduced the \nKnow Before You Owe Private Student Loan Act this year. Our bill \nrequires private student loan lenders to verify the prospective \nborrower's cost of attendance with the school before disbursing the \nloan.\n  It also requires the schools to counsel students as to whether they \nare still eligible for Federal student loans at a much lower interest \nrate. Federal student loans have flexible payment plans, consumer \nprotections, and as I said, less cost. But many times students who have \nnot exhausted their Federal student loan aid are steered into private \nloans with interest rates three and four times higher. There is money \nto be made off those young and sometimes uninformed students.\n  I urge the private lenders and the for-profit schools that keep \ntelling me ``we are doing the right thing,'' do not wait for this law. \nDo it now. Make this a policy at their school and prove it.\n  One of the students I wanted to mention is Mirella Tovar from Blue \nIsland, IL. She graduated from Columbia College in 2010 with a B.A. in \ngraphic design and with $90,000 in debt and with a 10.25-percent \ninterest rate. Her balance started to grow. She did not take out any \nFederal loans. She thought all the loans were the same. She did not \nknow the difference.\n  No one told her about the consumer protections in the Federal loans. \nAfter she used her 6-month forbearance permitted by her lender, Mirella \nwas expected to pay $1,500 a month. Unable to get a full-time job in \nher field, she thought about filing for bankruptcy.\n  It would not have done any good; student loans are not dischargeable \nin bankruptcy even if they come from for-profit colleges. Her dad \nwanted to help, so he cosigned her private student loans. Guess what. \nHe is now on the hook for the payments too.\n  Mirella says that if the school counselor would have told her more \nabout what her monthly payment would be like, she would not have taken \nout so much, and she may have never been steered to a private student \nloan.\n  I thank Senator Harkin for his leadership and his amazing work on \nthis issue. I plead with my colleagues, on behalf of these students and \ntheir families and on behalf of the taxpayers who are subsidizing these \nschools, join us in setting standards so there is an opportunity for \nyoung people to get the education they need without inheriting the \ndebts that can drag them down for a lifetime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering R. Timothy Stack\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, this morning I got some very sad news. \nThe State of Georgia and the people of my State lost a giant in the \nhealth care industry.\n  Tim Stack was my friend. He was the president of the hospital that 2 \nyears ago treated me well, which is why I am here today. He was a giant \nin health care not just in Georgia but in America. On behalf of myself \nand all the citizens of my State and the countless thousands of \npatients whose lives have been made better or even saved by Tim Stack, \nI send my condolences to his wife Mary and his three sons: Ryan, Tim, \nand Matthew.\n  Tim Stack grew up in Pittsburgh, PA, working in the steel mills. When \nthe mills closed, he looked to find a job, and he worked in central \nsupply at the Eye & Ear Hospital of Pittsburgh, PA. He was working and \nstudying to be a teacher and a football coach. By working in the \nhospital, he became fascinated with the complexity of hospital \nadministration and was challenged by the love of caring for people who \nwere ill. Tim Stack changed his major to hospital administration and \nbecame a leader in the United States in the administration of \nhospitals.\n  Let me read from a press release on his record in Atlanta, GA, alone:\n\n       Under his leadership, Piedmont grew from two hospitals and \n     eight physician practices to a $1.6 billion organization that \n     includes five hospitals, more than 50 primary care and \n     specialty physician practices and a 900-member clinically \n     integrated network.\n\n  He also helped develop the Piedmont Heart Institute, which treated me \n2 years ago and is the reason I am standing here today, which is the \nleading heart institute not just in Atlanta and in Georgia but \nthroughout the United States.\n  Tim was one of a kind. His loss will be felt by countless thousands \nof Georgians. To his family, his friends, and all who knew him, I \nexpress my sympathy.\n  I want to read a quote from him that was written in 2006 when he was \ninterviewed by Atlanta Hospital News for a profile. Tim wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       The attributes of a good leader are universal. You need to \n     love what you do, be open and inquisitive and persistent, not \n     afraid to make waves if you have to. You should also be \n     personally productive and work well with others. Be \n     innovative and allow others to innovate. Finally, be a \n     certifiable member of the human race. Cultivate a light \n     touch, be passionate about your career, but be sure to \n     balance it with the rest of your life.\n\n  That expresses better than I can what Tim was all about. I shall miss \nhim greatly, as will all of my State. Again, I send my sympathy to his \nwife Mary and his three sons: Tim, Ryan, and Matthew.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the issue of cyber \nsecurity, one where there have been a dozen speeches given earlier \ntoday, and one where I am concerned that there is not enough \ndetermination, not enough will on the part of this body to work \ntogether, to listen to each other, to cross the small differences that \nremain between camps and competing theories of a bill that we should \ntake up, and I am here to urge our colleagues in this body to address \nwhat we have been told is one of the greatest security threats facing \nour country, to bear down, to file amendments, to clear amendments, to \nlisten to other Members and be willing to do the job for which we were \nhired, which is to pass tough, broad, bipartisan legislation to protect \nthis country we love.\n  In my short 20 months in the Senate, I have increasingly become more \nand more persuaded that we face a constant, steadily rising, \nincreasingly dangerous threat that foreign nations, foreign actors, \nwhether they be terrorists or enemies of the United States, are not \njust studying the possibility of some day attacking the critical \ninfrastructure of the United States, they are not just writing position \npapers or theorizing about it or training in some camp in an obscure \ncountry, they are today actively engaged in thousands of efforts to \ncompromise the critical infrastructure of this country.\n  How Members of this body can ignore the importance of this threat \nwhen the majority leader and the Republican leader have twice, in my \nshort time here, closed the Senate and urged every one of us to go to a \nsecure, classified\n\n[[Page S5711]]\n\nbriefing, where we have heard from a dozen four-star generals and \nleaders of three-letter agencies who have told us in great detail about \nhow grave this threat is. Why in the face of repeated and publicly \ncited assertions by Secretaries of Defense, heads of the NSA, leaders \nof our homeland security agency, and leaders responsible for our first \nresponder community from the Federal, State, and local levels, from the \nprivate sector to this government, who have said over and over that \nthis is a very real, very present threat--how we can ignore that threat \ntoday is beyond me.\n  The bill that is before us is S. 3414. This is a compromise bill. In \na series of meetings with other Members of this body, I have been \nstruck to hear others say that we need more time, we need to study this \nfurther, we need to pass the narrow portions on information sharing \nthat are easy and everybody can now agree on, and we need not pass a \nbroader or stronger bipartisan bill that deals with infrastructure.\n  As you know well, Mr. President, for years critical committees in \nthis body have been working on this issue. Senators Lieberman and \nCollins, the chair and the ranking member on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs, have been engaged in working their way through \ndifficult issues for years. The relevant committees, from Energy to \nCommerce to Intelligence, have been engaged in hearings and studies and \nin legislating for years before I became a Senator.\n  In the last few months there has been some important and strong work \nto build a bipartisan consensus around the bill that is before us \ntoday. I, like you, I believe, Mr. President, had some real concerns \nabout the information-sharing portions of the bill, title VII, which \nhave to do with permitting private companies to share information with \neach other about the threats of attacks.\n\n  One of our big problems right now, we are told, is that companies of \nall different sectors of our economy hesitate to share publicly or to \nshare with our national security infrastructure information that is \ncritical to knowing when we are being attacked, how we are being \nattacked, and how it might spread. Title VII of the bill gives them \nliability protection to encourage the broad and regular sharing of that \ninformation.\n  But those of us who are concerned about the balance between privacy \nand security, about protecting civil liberties and whether we have gone \ntoo far in seeking security at the expense of liberty, offered a whole \nseries of revisions and changes to this bill--changes that have been \naccepted. So too in a different section of the bill--title I, which \ndeals with critical infrastructure--folks from the private sector \nraised alarms and concerns months ago that this bill was too \nprescriptive, too heavyhanded, was involved too much in regulation and \nin demanding certain actions by the private sector. Those concerns, \ntoo, have been addressed in a broad way.\n  I have been impressed with how many changes Senators Lieberman and \nCollins have been willing to accept out of a broad working group of \nmore than a dozen Senators of both parties who over the last few months \nhave come forward with suggestions that have made that portion of the \nbill truly voluntary for the private sector, in a way that balances the \nrole of civilian agencies with parts of our national security \napparatus, in a way that provides enough liability protection but not \ntoo much, and in a way that allows the private sector to have a leading \nrole in setting standards.\n  My point, then, is to say to my colleagues that when they say we need \nmore time to study it, I say we need to come to this bill, we need to \ncome to the floor, and we need our colleagues to be clear--what are \nyour remaining concerns? In a meeting last Friday with several Senators \nand representatives of industry, I had read every word of title VII and \nurged them to be concrete with us about what their concerns were. I \nleft unsatisfied. I left concerned that some were simply scaring the \nprivate sector and scaring our citizens into thinking this bill is not \nready.\n  So for those who still have concerns--and there may very well be \nbroad and legitimate concerns about the bill and about its direction--\nlet's take these 2 days. I understand that more than 90 amendments have \nbeen filed. I think it is the challenge before us to make the \namendments germane, narrowly focused, and relevant to improve the bill \nrather than distracting us into issues that are more partisan or tied \nto the campaign and to focus on the work that is left before us.\n  If I could, I am gravely concerned about those who would urge us to \nsplit off the portion of the bill on information sharing and ignore the \nportion of the bill that has to do with protecting our critical \ninfrastructure. As speaker after speaker has come to the floor today \nand made clear, our electricity grid is at risk, our dams and our \npowerplants are at risk, our highways and financial system are at risk. \nThere are all sorts of areas in the United States where there have been \nreal cyber attacks, online attacks, in other countries that have \ndemonstrated the devastating potential power of our opponents and \nenemies around the world.\n  In the face of the cautionary notes we have heard from leaders of \nthis body and around the country and in the face of that very strong \nreality, why we wouldn't pass a broad and tough bill that facilitates \ninformation sharing and protects our critical infrastructure and \nstrikes a fair balance in the middle is beyond me. It is not that this \nbody has been too busy. It is not that we are exhausted by having \npassed too many broad and strong, bipartisan bills. We have gotten good \nwork done this session. There are things, from the farm bill to the \nTransportation bill, where this body has shown an ability to listen to \neach other across the differences of party and region and craft strong, \nbalanced, bipartisan bills. It is on this topic of cyber security that \nwe have heard over and over that there is no more pressing challenge.\n  Why, if our adversaries are not going to be taking the month of \nAugust off, if our adversaries are not going to cease from now until \nNovember to attack us, would we not bear down and focus on getting done \nthe work that is before us as the U.S. Senate? We are called at times \nthe world's greatest deliberative body. I will say to you as a member \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, in other parts of the world there \nare folks who are striving toward democracy who question whether this \nis the model they should follow.\n  In the remaining days before we all go to some recess, why not bear \ndown, do our homework, do our reading, be forthcoming with clear and \nconcise concerns, and hammer out our differences?\n  I extend an invitation to any colleague, any industry group, or any \ngroup of concerned citizens: I am happy to meet with anybody to hear \ntheir concerns and try to do my level best to convey them to the bill \nmanagers and the leaders, who have done a remarkable job of hearing and \naccepting compromise provisions of this bill on privacy, on the role of \nthe private sector, on making voluntary what was mandatory and striking \na fair balance.\n  I urge our colleagues to take this moment seriously, to not allow the \ndays to slip, the month to pass, and the moment to pass us by. How will \nwe answer our constituents, our communities, and our families following \nan attack that has been so frequently predicted? Do we not believe we \nwill end up regulating in a more heavyhanded, more reactionary, and \nmore ill-informed way after a successful massive attack than now when \nwe have the time to listen to each other and craft a balanced and \nresponsible and bipartisan bill?\n  Mr. President, I will close. I am convinced that this is the gravest \nthreat facing our country today, graver than that of terrorism from \noverseas. In fact, GEN Keith Alexander of the NSA has clarified just in \nthe last few days to a group of us how grave a threat this is.\n  I renew my offer to any Member of this Chamber: Come and meet with \nme. Come and meet with Senators Lieberman and Collins. Come and meet \nwith the leaders of the relevant committees, take up your cause, and \ngive an amendment that is narrow and focused and relevant, and let us \nhammer out a better defense for this Nation.\n  There are those who question the purpose and purposefulness of this \nbody. It has no greater purpose than finding a bipartisan way to craft \na strong and vibrant solution to a clear and growing national threat.\n\n[[Page S5712]]\n\n  Just a few weeks ago, I had the honor of sitting for lunch with \nSenator Daniel Inouye. He is the one Member of this body to have earned \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor in combat. I asked his advice, as the \nmost senior member of my party: What issues, Senator Inouye, do you \nthink I should be focused on? What is the thing you might urge me--a \nfreshman--to invest my time and effort into? His answer was simple, his \nanswer was profound, and his answer, I hope, will be heard by this \nbody.\n  He said to me: I am the only Senator who was at Pearl Harbor. Our \nnext Pearl Harbor will come from a cyber attack for which we are today \nunprepared. Let's do our duty. Let's listen to each other, come \ntogether, hammer out a strong and bipartisan bill, and honor the \nservice and sacrifice of that ``greatest generation''--both in this \nChamber and our country--and do our duty.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I want to acknowledge the \npowerful and eloquent words of my colleague from Delaware. I know our \ncolleague Senator Collins is also on the Senate floor, and I have to \ntell the viewers and all of my colleagues I couldn't agree more. The \ntime is now to act on cyber security.\n  I just came to the floor from an Intelligence Committee briefing. \nGeneral Alexander was there. As the Senator from Delaware knows, he is \nforthright, he is well-versed, he is passionate, and he is as \nnonpartisan as they come. General Alexander is urging us to act now.\n  So I thank my colleague from Delaware for his compelling and \nimportant words.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  The matter that brought me to the floor has a link to cyber security, \nand that is energy security. I want to talk about one of the new and \nexciting technologies that is resulting in the production of many \nhomegrown electrons, and that is wind power.\n  I have come to the floor on a daily basis to urge my colleagues to \nwork with me to extend the production tax credit for wind.\n  The PTC has created literally tens of thousands of jobs across our \ncountry and has the potential to create even more. But if Congress--\nthat is us, the Senate and the House--doesn't act to extend it, tens of \nthousands of jobs, literally, will be lost. The Presiding Officer has a \nrobust wind energy sector in her State, and she knows the extent to \nwhich it is important for business in the great State of New Hampshire. \nIt is important to the businesses in every State in our country.\n  The production tax credit is an investment in a clean energy future. \nIt is a critical investment in American jobs. Frankly, we are about to \nlose that investment. I fear, in fact, that through our inaction we \ncontinue to create real harm to our wind industry in America. But it is \nnot too late to act.\n  Today I am going to focus my remarks on Idaho, a State that is known \nfor its wide open spaces, its mountains, its potatoes, and for great, \nfriendly people. One doesn't have to look any further than Senator \nCrapo and Senator Risch to know that the people of Idaho are very good \npeople.\n  Idaho is a State with a vast untapped potential for wind energy. The \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory, which we host in Colorado, has \ncalculated that Idaho's wind resources could potentially provide more \nthan 218 percent of Idaho's electricity needs. It ranks 23rd in our \nNation's wind resource potential. Most of this potential is in the high \nplains of the southern half of the State.\n  Idaho is already working to take advantage of what is a bountiful \nresource. There are more than 20 separate wind projects either online \nor under construction across the State. In southeastern Idaho near Twin \nFalls, Invenergy's Wolverine Creek wind farm covers about 5,000 acres \nand pays royalties to almost 30 different landowners.\n  In 2011, Idaho's installed wind capacity grew by nearly 75 percent. \nThat growth created hundreds of temporary construction jobs as well as \npermanent jobs in the operation and maintenance of these facilities. \nRight now, Idaho's wind resources provide power for nearly 160,000 \nhomes without releasing the nearly 1.1 million metric tons of carbon \ndioxide that traditional power sources would.\n  Wind supports close to 500 jobs in the State of Idaho--jobs that \nwouldn't exist if the wind industry had not been enticed to invest in \nIdaho because of the production tax credit, the PTC. Wind energy \nprojects are an investment in local and State economies. Wind energy \nproducers provide nearly $2.5 million to the State in property tax \npayments every year and over $2 million annually in land lease payments \nto local Idahoans who go on to invest that money back into their local \ncommunities. Those are real dollars these communities count on.\n  The point I am trying to make is that we in Congress should be \nworking to help create more projects like Wolverine Creek for the jobs \nand the clean energy they create. Instead, Congress is standing idly \nby.\n  I can't help but mention there have been some on the campaign trail \nwho have suggested that we should let the wind production tax credit \nlapse at the end of this year, and that wind power should not be given \nthe same help other industries have received. I could not disagree \nmore.\n  Great States such as Idaho, Colorado, and New Hampshire make things. \nGreat countries such as the United States generate their own energy. \nLetting the wind production tax credit lapse would be irresponsible. \nThe PTC equals jobs. We should pass it as soon as possible. We should \nnot waiver, and we should not wait. Every day that we let this \nunanswered question hang over our country may be another project and \nanother job that gets shipped overseas.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me to support manufacturing in \nrural communities in America. Let's extend the production tax credit as \nsoon as possible. It is common sense. It has bipartisan support. Let's \nextend the production tax credit.\n  I will be back tomorrow to continue this discussion and talk about \nanother one of our great States. I am at 13 States. I am going to keep \ncoming back until we get this right.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Medical Loss Ratio\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, over the last few weeks hundreds of \nthousands of Minnesotans have received letters or postcards in the mail \nfrom their health care insurers. These notices are letting people know \nwhether their insurer met a new rule in the health care law--a rule \nthat I championed--called the medical loss ratio, sometimes called the \n80-20 rule. It could also be called the 85-15 rule, but it is known as \nthe 80-20 rule, and I will explain.\n  This provision, which I based on a Minnesota State law, requires \nlarge group insurers to spend 85 percent of the premiums they receive \nfrom their beneficiaries on actual health care services, not on \nmarketing or administrative costs or CEO salaries. Eighty-five percent \nof their premium dollars have to be spent on actual health care. For \ninsurers in a small group and individual markets, this threshold is 80 \npercent; hence, the 80-20 rule.\n  This summer, across the country Americans are getting notices from \ntheir insurers that the insurer met or did not meet this 80 or 85 \npercent threshold. When those notices say the insurer failed to meet \nthe medical loss ratio, Americans are also getting something else in \nthe mail--a check or lower premiums for next year because under my \nmedical loss ratio provision, insurers who do not spend at least the 80 \nor 85 percent of premiums on actual health care services for their \nbeneficiaries have to rebate that money to their consumers.\n  August 1 was the deadline for insurers who didn't meet the MLR \nthreshold to rebate the difference to their consumers, and because of \nthe medical loss ratio more than 123,000 Minnesotans got rebates from \ntheir insurer. Those rebates added up to an average of $160 per \nhousehold. It was more in other States.\n  This isn't unique to Minnesota. Across the country 12.8 million \nAmericans got rebates from their insurers who overcharged them, and \nother insurers lowered their premiums for last\n\n[[Page S5713]]\n\nyear to comply with the medical loss ratio. Aetna in Connecticut \nlowered premiums by 10 percent last year because of the MLR.\n  Minnesota has a culture of high-quality low-cost care. In fact, the \nAgency for Health Care Research and Quality recently announced that in \n2011, Minnesota's health care quality was the highest in the Nation. We \nwere again No. 1. We are always No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3. The medical \nloss ratio, which was first passed as a Minnesota State law, is yet \nanother example of Minnesota's leadership in bringing down health care \ncosts while preserving quality.\n  Minnesota's unique health care culture includes the Mayo Clinic, \ncooperative models such as HealthPartners, and visionary public health \nleadership from State legislators. Health care in our State is also \ndistinguished by the fact that 90 percent of Minnesotans are served by \na nonprofit health plan. These plans outperform their national peers \nand are able to put 91 percent of every premium dollar toward actual \nhealth services. In other words, they have a 91 MLR.\n  By taking profits out of the health insurance industry, Minnesota \nhealth plans do a better job helping our residents live longer, \nhealthier lives and deliver the No. 1 quality care in the Nation. The \nmedical loss ratio within the health reform law is holding all health \nplans to the same standards we have set in Minnesota by requiring that \n80 to 85 percent of premium dollars actually pay for health services.\n  Before this year, in other plans throughout the Nation, less than 60 \npercent of the premiums were put toward health care. The rest was being \nused for administrative costs, for marketing, for bonuses, and for \nprofits. In fact, one study of insurers in Texas a few years ago showed \nMLRs, medical loss ratios, as low as 22 percent--meaning that of all \nthe premiums families were paying in to their insurers, the insurers \nwere spending only 22 percent on actual health care services for them.\n\n  That is why my medical loss ratio provision is so important. It \nsqueezes the fat out of the health insurance market and makes your \npremium dollars go farther. For many families it is actually lowering \ncosts, delivering $1.1 billion a year in rebates. Those checks, $1.1 \nbillion, are in addition to lowering the premiums. For example, the 10-\npercent reduction by Aetna in Connecticut. This was an incredibly \nimportant step because we know premiums were going up way too fast, a \nlot faster than those families' income. This is just one way the health \ncare law is already changing the culture of care in our country.\n  One of the other things the law did was move toward rewarding quality \nof care, not quantity of care. It specifically directed Medicare to \nstart paying doctors based on the value of the care they provide, not \nthe volume. This is a provision that I and Senator Klobuchar and \nseveral other of our colleagues championed, called the value index. \nThat is because when Minnesota doctors get paid less for providing \nhigher quality care, everyone else loses. Minnesota loses because \nMinnesota reimburses 50 percent less per Medicare patient on average in \nMinnesota than for each patient, on average, in Texas. So Minnesota \nactually gets punished for being No. 1. It gets punished for higher \nquality care with lower reimbursements. Patients in Texas lose because \nthey are not getting the highest value care for their health care \ndollar. And all taxpayers lose when Medicare pays for unnecessary or \noverpriced service in Texas or other low-value States.\n  This is not about pitting Minnesota against Texas or other low-value \nStates. It is about incentivizing the Texases to be more like \nMinnesota--which, again, has the highest health care quality in the \nNation. That will begin to happen when the value index kicks in under \nthis law.\n  It would be an understatement to say the law has received some \nattention this year, and I know there is a lot of uncertainty among our \nconstituents about how the law will affect them. That is because \nsometimes there is a little misinformation put out there. I just had a \ncolleague say there is nothing in the bill to address paperwork. That \nis certainly not true. In fact, I authored a provision on simplifying \nbilling.\n  There is some misinformation on why IRS agents are there to look into \nyour insurance--and anything done in the law to address workforce \nshortages. That is not true. There is an entire title on workforce. \nSometimes people have to sort out what is being said on this floor. So \nthere is some uncertainty.\n  Let me take a moment to talk about a few of the other things the law \nis already doing for the people of Minnesota. This is all in the law \nand happening. I am just telling what is going on right now.\n  First of all, starting tomorrow, August 1, 900,000 women in Minnesota \nand 47 million women around the country will have free access to \npreventive health services, including gestational diabetes screenings, \npreventive health visits with their doctors, and FDA-approved \ncontraceptives. Because of the health care law, women, not their \ninsurance companies, can now make decisions about their health care and \ncan access the services that will keep them healthy.\n  The health care law is also helping families in Minnesota and across \nthe country by prohibiting insurers from denying health coverage for \nchildren who have preexisting conditions. I have met children who are \nalive today because of this provision. As a parent, I know how grateful \ntheir parents are. Parents around the country can now sleep a little \neasier, knowing that if their child gets sick they will still be able \nto get the health care coverage they need. We should be celebrating \nthat. This is not about putting the government between you and your \ndoctor, as I hear sometimes. This is about getting an insurance company \nout of the way and making sure that children can get coverage.\n  And adults. We have seen the limitation of lifetime limits on care. \nYour insurance company can no longer put an arbitrary cap on your care. \nI have seen a gentleman whose life was saved because of this. Before \nthis law came into being they could drop you--and they did. That is \nover. That is done. People do not have to worry about hitting an \narbitrary limit and then being thrown off their insurance--because they \nhave. We should be celebrating that. That is something that should be \nbringing a lot of relief to people. That is why we are going to be \nhaving far fewer bankruptcies.\n  Parents will also be relieved to know that young adults can now \nstay--they had been able to stay on their parents' health insurance \nplan until they are 26. Because of this provision, 35,000 young adults \nin Minnesota are now insured on their parents' policies.\n  I was at a senior center in Woodbury the other day. Seniors are very \nhappy with the changes that the health care law has made. When I visit \nsenior centers in Minnesota, I hear relief from seniors who now can pay \nfor their medications thanks to the provision in the health care law \nwhich is closing the doughnut hole. The provision has already allowed \n57,000 seniors in Minnesota to receive a 50-percent discount on their \ncovered brandname prescription drugs when they hit the so-called \ndoughnut hole, an average of $590 savings per person.\n  I can see the Presiding Officer nodding. I know she goes to senior \ncenters in New Hampshire and knows when seniors hear that people want \nto repeal this they are miffed. I have actually been at a senior center \nwhen they said, What can we do? And they wanted to get up and go out \nand start being activists for the health care law when they heard that \nsome of my friends want to repeal this.\n  Some of them are making it just on Social Security. Now the doughnut \nhole is closing and they like that. It means they can take their \nmedication and it means they do not have to take it every other day or \nthey don't have to cut it in half. My friends on the other side want to \nrepeal it.\n  Seniors are also getting free preventive health services under the \nhealth care law, such as mammograms, colonoscopies, as well as free \nannual wellness visits to their doctor--and, boy, do they like that.\n  I could go on and on, but I will not. The point is, because of the \nlaw more people are getting care, the quality of care is better, and we \nare lowering costs. I am proud of that. As we here in the Senate head \nhome to spend August in our States, I urge my colleagues to listen, as \nI do, when constituents tell\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\nus about the rebates they received. I was on a plane two weekends ago. \nA woman showed me her check. The woman I was sitting next to showed me \nher rebate check.\n  I urge my colleagues to listen to constituents talk about the rebates \nthey receive, the kids who are able to stay on their parents' \ninsurance, the health screenings that save the lives of grandparents. I \nhope they will listen to the stories of kids with preexisting illnesses \nwho were finally able to get coverage and seniors who were able to \nafford both their prescriptions and their dinner. I urge my colleagues \nto acknowledge these benefits and to support the continued \nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, there are several people who wish to be \nrecognized. If Senator Collins is ready to go, I will yield to her and \nthen ask unanimous consent to speak immediately after her, then to be \nfollowed by Senator Alexander, if that is the will of the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first let me thank the Senator from \nDelaware for his graciousness. In light of the fact that there are so \nmany people who are waiting to speak, I will be brief. But I want to \ntalk about the legislation that is before us, the cyber security bill. \nThis bill represents the Senate's best chance this year to pass \nurgently needed cyber security legislation.\n  Why do I say it is urgent? Virtually every national and homeland \nsecurity expert, from President Bush's administration including \nPresident Obama's administration, has warned us repeatedly that a cyber \nattack is coming and it is an attack that is going to be aimed at our \ncritical infrastructure. For us to let disagreements over exactly how \nto counter this threat prevent the passage of this bill would be a \ntragedy and could lead to a tragedy. This is serious.\n  Yesterday we had a meeting with the FBI, with the Department of \nHomeland Security, with GEN Keith Alexander, who is the head of cyber \ncommand, and the head of the National Security Agency. They were \nunanimous in warning us that Congress must act and must act now. Every \nsingle day nation states, terrorist groups, hacktivists, persistent \nhackers, transnational criminal gangs, are probing our cyber defenses. \nIntrusions are rampant. As one expert told me, there are really only \ntwo kinds of large companies in this country: those that know they have \nbeen hacked and those that do not know they have been hacked. It is so \nimportant that we act. I must say we are working very hard to try to \naccommodate the concerns that have been raised by some of our \ncolleagues and by some in the business community. We, therefore, have \naltered our bill in a significant way.\n  Another charge I have heard thrown loosely around here is that \nsomehow there has not been enough study; somehow there is not enough \nprocess; somehow we need more hearings. Our homeland security committee \nalone has had 10 hearings on cyber security--10 hearings. The Senate, \nas a whole, has had 25 hearings and numerous classified briefings. How \nmany more briefings, hearings, and reports do we need? The head of the \nFBI, Robert Mueller, has told us that in his judgment the threat of a \ncyber attack will soon exceed the threat of a terrorist attack. Of \ncourse, they may be combined. It may be a terrorist group using cyber \ntools to launch an attack on this country. There is a Web site video \nthat shows an arm of al-Qaida which encourages cyber attacks and talks \nabout how easy it would be to conduct it.\n\n  Senator Lieberman and I, along with our three principal cosponsors: \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Carper, have made \nsignificant changes in our bill to respond to concerns that have been \nraised. Most notably we have gone from having a mandatory framework to \na voluntary approach to enhance the security of our most critical \ninfrastructure. The underlying concept of this approach, which was \nsuggested in a very constructive way by our colleagues Senator Kyl and \nSenator Whitehouse, is to encourage owners of our most critical \ninfrastructure to enhance their cyber security by providing them with \nvarious incentives, the most important of which is liability \nprotections. We have also made changes to improve the privacy \nprotections and the information-sharing title of our bill.\n  The bill establishes a multiagency council, the National Cyber \nSecurity Council, to respond to concerns that too much power was being \ngiven to the Department of Homeland Security. So now we have an \ninteragency body that includes the Department of Defense, the \nDepartment of Justice, represented by the FBI, the Department of \nCommerce, the intelligence community--undoubtedly it would be the \nDirector of the National Intelligence Office--and appropriate sector-\nspecific Federal agencies, such as FERC, if we are talking about how \nbest to protect our electric grid.\n  The council would work in partnership with the private sector and \nwould conduct risk assessments to identify our Nation's most critical \ncyber infrastructure. What do we mean by that? We hear that term. What \nexactly is critical cyber infrastructure? It is that which, if damaged, \ncould result in mass casualties, mass evacuations, catastrophic \neconomic damage to our country or severe harm to our national security. \nDon't we want to safeguard critical national assets that if damaged \nwould cause numerous deaths, people to flee their homes, their \ncommunities, a disaster for our economy, or a severe blow to our \nnational security? I can't believe there is even any discussion about \nthe need for us to have robust systems to protect us against mass \ncasualties, a devastating blow to our economy, and catastrophic \nconsequences. That is a high bar in our bill for defining what is \ncritical cyber infrastructure. It isn't every business in this country. \nThose who are implying that it is and that this is sweeping are not \naccurately reading the bill. We would be irresponsible if we did not \nact when the warnings are so loud and are coming from so many respected \nsources.\n  We have had the Aspen Institute Group on Cyber Security Issues \nendorse our bill and urge us to go toward its consideration. That is \nchaired by President Bush's Homeland Security Secretary Michael \nChertoff and by a renowned expert on the other side of the aisle, \nformer Congresswoman Jane Harman. It also includes people such as Paul \nWolfowitz, not exactly a liberal activist the last time I checked, but \ncertainly one who commands great respect for his knowledge in this \narea.\n  I am amazed we are letting the clock tick down when we know it is not \na matter of if there is going to be a cyber attack on this country, it \nis a matter of when.\n  Let me very briefly address another issue. Is there some opposition \namong the business community to this bill? Yes, there is. But there is \nalso a great deal of support from the business community. We have, for \nexample, a letter from the NDIA, which represents 1,750 defense firms. \nWe have letters of endorsement from Sysco, Oracle, the Silicon Valley \nLeadership Group, the Business Software Alliance, from Semantec, EMC \nCorporation, the Center for a New American Security, endorsements from \nindividuals in the previous administration such as General Hayden, Mike \nMcConnell, and Asa Hutchinson. There are many supporters for this bill. \nIt is not surprising because they know how important it is that we act.\n  Ms. COLLINS. In closing, I wish to read a little from General \nAlexander's letter, which is dated today. In it he says:\n\n       I am writing to express my strong support for passage of a \n     comprehensive bipartisan cyber security bill by the Senate \n     this week. The cyber threat facing the Nation is real and \n     demands immediate action--\n\n  Not action next year, not action next Congress, not action even after \nthe recess we are about to take. As General Alexander says:\n\n       The time to act is now; we simply cannot afford further \n     delay. Moreover, to be most effective in protecting against \n     this threat to our national security, cyber security \n     legislation should address both information sharing and core \n     critical infrastructure hardening.\n\n  That is exactly what the bill we have brought before the Senate would \ndo. I urge our colleagues to join us. If they have other ideas, offer \namendments, but let's get on with the task before us\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\nbefore we are looking back and saying: Why didn't we act? Why didn't we \npay attention to all of those warnings?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, while the Senator is still on the floor, \nI wish to engage in a brief colloquy, ad-libbing this or, as I recall \nin football, an audible. We have the two people who are most key to \nthis, Senator Lieberman, chairman of our committee, and Senator \nCollins, our ranking member, who worked very hard with their staff and \nour staffs to fashion this legislation.\n  In recent years when we heard opposition to doing something on cyber \nsecurity, the concern we had was there was going to be a top-down. \nThere was going to be Homeland Security, which in its early days did \nnot have a very good reputation. The idea was that somehow Homeland \nSecurity was going to be running this top down without a whole lot of \ninput from industry. Basically we have taken even the second most \nrecent version of our bill, and we changed that. What we said is it is \nnot going to be top-down, it is not going to be Homeland Security \nsaying these are the best practices, these are the standards to protect \ncyber security. Instead we said: Industry, what do you want to tell us? \n``Us'' being Homeland Security, ``us'' being the Department of Defense, \n``us'' being the National Security Agency, ``us'' being the FBI. What \ndo you think those best practice standards should be? Give us a chance \nto work on those together.\n\n  Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think the deal here is for \nHomeland Security to say: You have to throw those away; those make no \nsense, we will do it our way. That is not what is going to happen here.\n  In our meeting yesterday with the folks from the FBI and the National \nSecurity Agency, that is not the way it is going to work. It is not the \nway it works today and it is not the way it is going to work in the \nfuture. What does the Senator think?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, if I could respond through the Chair to \nmy colleague from Delaware, he is absolutely correct, this is a \ncollaborative partnership with the private sector, and indeed, it has \nto be. Eighty-five percent of the critical infrastructure is owned by \nthe private sector, so it makes sense to have their involvement. We \nrestructured the bill to require that, and there is another safeguard. \nSince this is a voluntary system we have now devised, adopting the Kyl-\nWhitehouse approach, if the private sector decided not to participate, \nit essentially invalidates the standards that are developed. So why \nwould this interagency council, which has developed the standards based \non the recommendations of the private sector, not adopt reasonable \nstandards? They want industry to participate. That is the ultimate \nsafeguard, I say to my colleague from Delaware and my colleague, the \nchairman from Connecticut, who also may want to add to this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I am going to direct this question to our chairman \nthrough the Chair. One of the other criticisms of the early version of \nthe bill was not only was it top-down oriented and directed by Homeland \nSecurity, but also there were just sticks involved. We were not going \nto incentivize anybody to comply with the standards that might be \ndeveloped, but we would just hammer somebody. That is not the way it \nturned out. I commend the chairman for doing that.\n  Will the chairman lay out for us in a minute or two how it would \nwork? I think it is a much smarter approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Delaware for the question. This \nis now a voluntary system and there is a lot to be said about that.\n  I want to go back to that meeting yesterday. We had a broad \nbipartisan group of Senators who have been most active, but from \ndifferent perspectives, on this question of cyber security legislation \nwho met yesterday with the key cyber security officials in our \ngovernment from the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland \nSecurity, FBI, and the National Security Agency. I am going to explain \nwhy we went to the carrots and took out the sticks by saying, in \ngeneral terms, these experts--not political people, these are pros who \ndeal with cyber defense--were asked by one of the Senators: What will \nhappen if we don't adopt this legislation or something like it this \nsession?\n\n  The cyber security professionals said to us: Our Nation will be more \nvulnerable to cyber attack.\n  In other words, this legislation contains authority to share \ninformation between the government and the private sector, between two \nprivate sector companies, that can't be done now. That is critically \nnecessary to improve our defenses. The requirement of standards being \npromulgated as a result of a--or resulting from a public-private \ncollaborative operation and then offering the carrot of immunity from \nliability is something that doesn't exist now. All the experts say, \nthough some of the private sector operators of critical cyber security \ninfrastructure--we are talking, again, about the companies that run the \nelectric grid or the telecommunications system or the entire financial \nsystem or dams that hold back water; we are not talking about ma-and-pa \nbusinesses back home--some of them are doing a pretty good job at \ndefending that cyber infrastructure, but most of them are not doing \nenough. That is where the government has to come in and push them in \nthat direction.\n  Why did we change it from mandatory to voluntary, from sticks to \ncarrots? Because we didn't have the votes to adopt the mandatory, which \nI think is necessary. Because of the urgency of the threat, as I just \nreflected that we heard yesterday from the professionals in this area, \nwe said--Senator Collins and I, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Carper--OK, we are not going to get 100 percent of what we want \naround here, and we understand that, so let's settle for 80 percent. \nPerhaps the other side will feel they got 80 percent. But what is most \nimportant is that we will get something done to protect our security.\n  I must tell my colleagues we are at a point now in this debate, with \nthe kind of never-ending questions about every detail, not withstanding \nall the compromises Senator Collins, Senator Carper and I have made and \nthe filing of an amendment by Senator McConnell to repeal ObamaCare--we \ncan have a position on ObamaCare, but to put it on this cyber security \nbill is not fair, not relevant, not constructive.\n  I think we are coming to a moment where we are going to have to face \na tough decision. I have talked to the majority leader about filing for \ncloture soon so we can draw this to a choice: Do our colleagues want to \nact to protect our cyber systems in this session or do they not? That \nis a tough choice, particularly if a Senator votes no, to have to \nexplain, in light of all the evidence of the constant cyber attacks \ngoing on now and the cyber thefts of hundreds of billions of dollars \nfrom our industries and tens of thousands of jobs lost as a result to \nforeign countries, if the Senate is going to say, no, we don't want to \ntake that up now. I hope and pray that is not the case.\n  The way this is moving right now, this last week of the session \nbefore we break, I am afraid we are headed in the wrong direction, and \nwe don't see the kind of willingness to compromise that ought to be \nthere. We are tested again in this Chamber: Are we going to fix \nnational problems? It is hard to do on some of the fiscal issues we \nhave turned away from, but on this one, traditionally, when it came to \nour national security, we have put the special interests aside and \ntogether dealt with the national security interests. I fear at this \nmoment, in response to my friend from Delaware, that is not the \ndirection in which we are going. I hope I am wrong. I am, by nature, an \noptimist, but right now I am a pessimist.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. My colleagues have heard me say this before. We have been \njoined by Senator Rockefeller, who has done great work, Senator \nFeinstein, and others, Democratic and Republican, who have done fine \nwork on this legislation.\n  But I love asking people who have been married a long time: What is \nthe secret to being married a long time?\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\nThis is especially important for me to say this with Senator Collins \nsitting on the floor. She and certainly her husband to be anticipate \ntheir coming marriage. But I love asking people who have been married a \nlong time: What is the secret to be being married a long time? I get \ngreat answers, funny answers but also some very profound ones, and the \nbest thing I ever got was the two Cs. What are the two Cs? Communicate \nand compromise. That is not just the secret for a long marriage, a \nunion between husband and wife, but it is also the secret for a vibrant \ndemocracy.\n  I think the two Cs characterize what is going on with this \nlegislation because I have been here a while--11 years--and I don't \nknow that I have ever seen better communication on an issue of this \nimportance than I have in this instance. It was very dramatic, very \nsatisfying, and frankly, compromise, the kind of compromise we have \ntalked about over the last 15 minutes or so, needed, given, done \nwillingly, to lead us to this point today.\n  It has been said before, and I will say it again. The reason we are \non this bill today, why we have taken it up today, this week, is \nbecause our economy and our national security are under attack. This is \nnot the kind of war that some of us served in during our youth. This is \nnot the kind of war we have read about in history books. It is not the \nkind of war we have seen and watched on TV. This war is occurring in \ncyber space, and it is occurring in real time.\n  Literally, as I speak, it is being carried out by sophisticated \ncriminals, by terrorists, and even by other countries. While some \nhackers just want to cause mischief or make a political point, others \nwant to hurt people, our people. Still others want to steal our ideas, \nour intellectual property, as well as other sensitive information. From \nclean energy technologies and defense systems to medical research and \ncorporate mergers, cyber spies are looking to steal some of the very \ninnovations that fuel our economy and help make us a great nation.\n  GEN Keith Alexander, the commander of U.S. Cyber Command, has called \nthese efforts the greatest transfer of wealth in history. Those of us \nwho have tried to put a dollar figure on how much intellectual property \nwe are losing to cyber theft have put the pricetag at about $\\1/4\\ \ntrillion per year. It is not just valuable information we are losing. \nTo put it bluntly, it is American jobs, and it is our competitive edge.\n  Of course, the same vulnerabilities being exploited to steal our \nintellectual property can be used by those who want to attack us to do \nphysical harm. With a few clicks of a mouse, cyber terrorists or a \nsovereign nation could shut down our electric grid, they could shut \ndown manufacturing, they can release dangerous chemicals into our air, \nthey can release dangerous chemicals into our water supply. They could \ndisrupt our financial systems. At the very least, any one of these \nattacks could further slow the economic recovery of our country or \ndisrupt it altogether.\n  In a worst-case scenario, a particularly lethal cyber attack could \nthrow parts of our country into chaos or even lead to widespread loss \nof life. If my colleagues don't believe that, look at the impact the \nrecent summer storms and the resulting power outages had on this \nregion. If we don't become more vigilant and soon, a sophisticated \nhacker can succeed in replicating that kind of power outage, putting \nmany lives in danger and severely undercutting the productivity of our \nworkforce.\n  The revised bill we take up today takes a number of bold steps to \nbetter secure our critical infrastructure and share cyber threat \ninformation. It will go a long way toward bringing our cyber \ncapabilities into the 21st century. It represents a good-faith effort \nto address legitimate concerns of business and privacy groups of our \nintelligence community and of Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  None of this bill's five original cosponsors is suggesting our bill \nis perfect. As my colleagues hear me say from time to time, if it isn't \nperfect, make it better. With that thought in mind, we look forward to \nworking together with all our colleagues to find common ground to make \nthis legislation even better.\n  For example, many of my colleagues and I are concerned that we don't \nhave the proper safeguards in place when private information, ranging \nfrom Social Security numbers to financial records, are compromised. The \nAmerican public expects that government agencies and private businesses \nholding our tax information, our medical records, and other sensitive \ndata will take every precaution necessary to ensure that sensitive \ninformation is secure and well protected. Too often those expectations \nare not met.\n  That is why I have introduced a bipartisan amendment with my \ncolleague Senator Blunt to address concerns regarding data breaches \nwhich occur all too often. Our amendment would ensure that Americans \ncan be confident that their private and sensitive information is made \nmore secure. As our Nation becomes increasingly reliant on \ntechnological advances to do just about everything, it is imperative \nthat we not let technology outpace our ability to prevent fraud and \nidentity theft.\n  However, with the recent breach within the Federal employees \nretirement program--the Thrift Savings Plan--over 100,000 Federal \nparticipants know all too well that their sensitive private information \nis not always safeguarded as it should be.\n  The amendment Senator Blunt and I are offering seeks to ensure that \nall entities holding personal sensitive information have to adhere to a \nnational standard that is designed to keep that information safe while \nensuring that both consumers and law enforcement are promptly notified \nin the event of a breach. This requirement would replace the current \npatchwork of 46 separate State laws while ensuring that consumers have \na uniform set of protections they can understand. By adopting this \ndata-breach amendment and passing the broader cyber security bill, we \nwill enable the United States to lead by example both in preventing \ncyber attacks from occurring in the first place and in responding \nswiftly and effectively to protect consumers in the unfortunate event \nof an attack or a breach.\n  As we consider our amendment, the Blunt-Carper amendment, let's \nremember that this bill is not the finish line. If I can paraphrase \nWinston Churchill, this is not the end. This is not the beginning of \nthe end. This bill really represents the end of the beginning. And as \nbeginnings go, it ain't bad.\n  Although we are still working out a compromise, I want to close by \ntalking very briefly about some of the features of the underlying bill \nwe are considering.\n  First--I will reiterate what has been said before; it bears \nrepeating--we have elected not to direct the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to mandate new cyber security regulations for private owners \nof critical infrastructure. We said we are not going to do that. \nInstead, we have endorsed an approach that relies on a public-private \npartnership and a voluntary cyber security program to strengthen the \nelectronic backbone of our most sensitive systems. Instead of \ngovernment penalties, our bill calls for using incentives such as \nliability protection to encourage critical infrastructure owners to \nadopt voluntary cyber practices developed by industry.\n  Second, our revised bill provides a framework for the sharing of \ncyber threat information between the Federal Government and the private \nsector while offering liability protection and better privacy \nprotections for all Americans.\n  Third, to ensure that Federal agencies are better equipped to stop \ncyber attacks on them, the bill includes a number of security measures \nthat I have worked on for years with Senator Collins and others to \nbetter protect our Federal information systems. In particular, this \nbill will help replace our outdated, paper-based security practices \nwith a real-time security system that can actively monitor, detect, and \nrespond to threats. For example, agencies will be required to \ncontinuously monitor their systems the way a security guard would watch \na building through a video camera rather than just taking a snapshop, \ndeveloping the film, and reporting on the results once a year.\n  Finally, our bill makes a number of important investments in \ndeveloping the next generation of cyber security professionals. This is \nworkforce development. For example, the bill provides stronger cyber \nsecurity training and\n\n[[Page S5717]]\n\nestablishes better cyber security programs in our schools and in our \nuniversities. This legislation also makes research and development for \ncyber security a priority so we can develop cutting-edge technologies \nhere at home and bring jobs to our country. Doing so will not only make \nus safer as a nation, it will help ensure that America's workforce is \nbetter prepared for tomorrow's job market, and tomorrow is just around \nthe corner.\n  I wish to conclude my remarks here today with something that one of \nour colleagues, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, introduced to me several years \nago. Mike calls it the 80-20 rule. He used it at the time to explain to \nme how he, one of the most conservative Republicans in the Senate, and \nthe late Ted Kennedy, one of the most liberal Democrats in the Senate, \nwere able to accomplish so much prior to Ted's death when they were the \ntwo senior leaders on the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee.\n  I said to Senator Enzi: How come the two of you, very different \npeople--one a Democrat and one a Republican--were able to get so much \ndone?\n  Senator Enzi said to me: Ted and I agreed on about 80 percent of what \nneeded to be done on most issues, and we disagreed on the other 20 \npercent. Somewhere along the way, we just decided to focus on the 80 \npercent we agreed on and set the other 20 percent aside for another \nday.\n  The cyber security legislation we are debating here today this week \nis an 80-20 bill. I think it is worth asking, is it worthwhile to pass \na bill that achieves maybe only 80 percent of what we want to do or \neven only 70 percent of what we want to do? I would just say, well, \ncompared to what? Compared to doing nothing? Compared to zero? Given \nall that is at stake in today's dangerous world, you bet it is \nworthwhile. That much we ought to be able to agree on, so let's get it \ndone.\n  Like many of my colleagues who have worked on the legislation for \nyears, I welcome the opportunity this week to legislate--to legislate--\non an issue of great importance to our Nation, to offer our amendments, \nto debate them, to defend them, to vote on them, make this bill better \nby doing so, and in the end adopt this bill as amended by a bipartisan \nmargin. A lot of people in this country of ours question today whether \nwe are still able to set aside our partisan and other differences when \nthe stakes are high and summon the political will to do what is best \nfor America. Let's show them by our actions this week that, yes, we \ncan. Let's seize the day. Carpe diem.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nperiod for debate only on S. 3414, the Cybersecurity Act, be extended \nuntil 6:30 p.m.; further, that the majority leader be recognized at \n6:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to salute my colleague from \nDelaware. We have a number of people in this body who will take on the \nvery tough issues--issues, frankly, that can only succeed when there is \nbipartisan agreement but that are deep and complicated and take day \nafter day, week after week, even month after month of effort--and there \nare not many who can craft that type of legislation. The Senator from \nDelaware is one of them. He did it on the postal bill. He is doing it \nhere on cyber security. I believe on both of them he will have ultimate \nsuccess, and we thank the Senator. We thank him for his good work.\n  Now I would like to discuss the cyber security bill. I am very \nhopeful that we will pass a bill that will find a good and workable \nbalance--one certainly that ensures that our critical infrastructure \nhas the most effective countermeasures to prevent cyber attacks but one \nthat will also encourage our dynamic technology industry to continue to \ninnovate, and protect freedom of expression and privacy on the \nInternet.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Internet was originally \ndeveloped as a way for universities, governments, and companies to \ncollaborate on research and other projects. The whole purpose of the \nInternet was meant to stimulate the open exchange of ideas, and as a \nresult it has changed the world. We have seen it in Egypt, in Russia, \nin China. We have seen the Internet--people's ability to communicate, \nunfettered by government or other strong forces--create huge amounts of \npower--good power, positive power.\n  Just ask the entrepreneurs who developed whole new ways of selling \nproducts and developing services about how the Internet was made to \nstimulate the open exchange of ideas. It has given the opportunity to \nsomeone with an idea to actually take that idea and turn it into a \nbusiness because it so reduces the transaction costs of doing so. Just \nask the inventors and creators who have fostered new means of \nexpression, allowing us to communicate in real time, efficiently and \ninexpensively, with our colleagues all over the world.\n  I am an efficiency bug. I like to use ``I am a busy fella.'' I love \nthe work I do, and I like to use it as efficiently as possible--the \nfact that I can have a laptop or an iPad in the car while the car is \ndriving forward. I am not driving; I am sitting there working. In the \nold days, you could not do that. It is amazing how it has improved our \nefficiency. It is sort of, in a certain sense, Adam Smith's dream \nbecause it reduces transaction costs and allows us to focus effectively \non producing what people want and need.\n  In short, our cyber world is one we could have never imagined 30 \nyears ago. It is both simple--it can be accessed through a few \nkeystrokes or screen touches--and yet it is enormously complex in its \ninfrastructure. We have to do everything we can to protect that free \nand open access--that is the theme of my speech today--although we \nalso, of course, have to protect the critical infrastructure behind it.\n  We are all aware of the national security risks if we do not do a \ncyber bill. Many of us have sat up in the Visitor Center, in the secure \nroom, and heard leaders of our military and intelligence agencies tell \nus that the greatest threat to America is a cyber attack on our \ncritical infrastructure--in many of their estimation, even more \ndangerous than terrorism.\n  Hackers broke into the Pentagon's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter project, \nstealing the aircraft's design and electronic-related schematics. It is \nnot hard to imagine a scenario where hackers break into a gas refinery \nor a nuclear powerplant to wreak havoc with the control computer \nsystems, nor is it hard to see a scenario where Iran attempts to learn \nsome of our nuclear secrets. So it is very important to deal with the \ncritical infrastructure piece.\n  Mr. President, let me commend you for your hard work in this area, \nalong with the Senator from Arizona. We are still hoping and praying \nyou guys can come to an agreement, along with the help of many. I know \nSenator Mikulski has been very active and many other of my colleagues, \nbut the Presiding Officer's leadership has been exemplary as well, and \nI would apply the same words to you that I applied to the Senator from \nDelaware before in terms of working on complex, difficult projects and \nmoving forward with them.\n  Anyway, it is so very important that we protect our infrastructure, \nbut at the same time--and this is what makes the legislation even more \ndifficult--we have to be aware of the risk to a critical part of our \neconomy if we do not do it right, if we do not do it carefully, if we \ndo not do it thoughtfully, and if we do not balance the need to protect \ninfrastructure with legitimate rights of the freedom of the Internet \nand of privacy.\n  To be perfectly frank, I have a big dog in this fight. You see, the \nSilicon Valley may have given us the semiconductor, but New York City, \nin my opinion, will be the birthplace of the next great generation of \nInternet giants. New York entrepreneurs started Foursquare, Tumblr, and \nKickstarter. CodeAcademy, TechStars, and General Assembly are training \nthe next generation of Internet entrepreneurs. Venture capital is \nflocking to New York to help these startups. For the first time, we are \ngetting engineers and scientists who want to be in New York. We are \nstill not at the level of the Silicon Valley, but we are probably No. 2 \nin the country in this regard, and, like all New Yorkers, we want to be \nNo. 1 at some point.\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\n  What is more, the existing Internet giants--Facebook and Google and \nTwitter--have all opened major offices in New York City. Google has \nover 3,000 people. I was proud to be at the opening of Facebook, and \nthey are so happy with their office, they are expanding its role \nalready. These companies know the talent and energy that are unique to \nNew York, and they do not want to miss out on the next great idea. \nThat, as I said, is likely to come from New York.\n  These ideas are not just important for New York but for America. \nInternet and tech companies around the country have ushered in a new \nera of change. They have made our world a drastically and dramatically \ndifferent place than it was even 10 years ago--a better world, a more \nopen world, a more productive world.\n  But one thing remains the same: We do not have a coherent and \ncomprehensive national strategy to protect the critical networks that \npower our everyday lives--our homes, our businesses, and our computers. \nIt is akin to protecting the Taj Mahal with a chain link fence and a \nbike lock. These networks protect our water systems and our financial \ninformation, the electric grid and our e-mail accounts.\n\n  This bill goes a long way in establishing a set of principles and \nprograms that will make these vulnerable networks safer, but there are \nsome parts of the bill I fear go a step too far in the name of security \nover privacy, and there has to be a balance. The same minds who have \ngiven us the great Internet innovations of the 21st century have told \nme, convinced me, educated me that we cannot cede too much power to one \nside of this equation.\n  We all know that in this very complex cyber world, we do give up some \nof our privacy, but unabated authority to stifle innovation in the name \nof cyber security is a bridge too far. That is why I am happy to \ncosponsor the amendment of my colleague from Minnesota Al Franken. He \nhas become an expert on trying to figure out how we can preserve the \ndynamism, the effectiveness, the efficiency of the Internet but at the \nsame time preserve our privacy.\n  As more and more of our economic lifeblood has shifted into the cyber \nworld, we have an obligation to ensure that the infrastructure that \nvalidates credit card purchases, directs planes, and controls \nelectricity is well protected against cyber attack. It is not a secret \nthat people want to disrupt our way of life, and it is easy to imagine \na world where terrorists attempt to take control of railroad switches \nand traffic lights to cause incredible disruption to our everyday \nlives. However, we must make sure that in protecting what we have, we \ndo not stifle innovation, we do not trample on people's privacy rights. \nWe have to leave room for the creation from the next Steve Jobs, Bill \nGates, or whomever, while protecting the security the average middle-\nclass family, the Baileys, feel when they go online to buy birthday \npresents for their grandchildren.\n  So in the final bill, we must find the right balance to preserve the \neconomic viability of the Internet; otherwise, there will be no \ncritical infrastructure to protect. But we must protect privacy rights, \nand I think the Franken amendment--and I commend it to my colleagues; a \nlot of work has gone into it--puts the balance in the right place.\n  I hope that as we move forward on this bill--either now or in \nSeptember when we return--we will get broad bipartisan support for that \namendment because it enables us to, in a certain sense, have our cake \nand eat it too: protect our infrastructure but at the same time \nprotect, nurture our creativity and the openness of the Internet and \nprotect our privacy.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, the worst drought in 50 years \nhas hit Nebraska and the entire Midwest hard. Every single one of \nNebraska's 93 counties is in a state of severe drought.\n  If you look at the chart I have in the Chamber, you can see that the \ndrought is throughout the Midwest, into the Middle East, down into the \nSoutheast, down into Texas and the West, even drought conditions in \nHawaii, and it is abnormally dry up in the northern part of Alaska. The \nUSDA has already declared more than 40 Nebraska counties as natural \ndisaster areas. If you take a look at this picture, you can see the \ncornfields that are just completely dirt fields now; pasture that is \nnothing more than dried grass, where there is still grass and dirt; the \nsoybean fields are decimated; and corn is in many areas not only \ndwarfed in its growth but is not producing ears of corn. The bone-dry \nconditions continue to damage corn, soybeans, pastures, and rangeland, \neven as we speak.\n  Just last week a small blaze quickly spread over the parched land in \nnorth central Nebraska. It rapidly grew into a fire that consumed tens \nof thousands of acres, 14 houses, and forced many others from their \nhomes.\n  Nebraska is fortunate to have had hard-working firefighters in our \nState and others to put out those flames. Hopefully, we will not need \nto utilize their talents in the near future. Now what Nebraska needs is \ndisaster relief. And we are not alone. If you look at this chart, you \nwill see that a good part of the rest of the country needs disaster \nrelief as well. Unfortunately, the disaster programs in the 2008 farm \nbill have already expired.\n  While the Senate passed the 5-year farm bill in June, the House is \nnot even expected to take action on it. The Senate's 5-year farm bill \nstrengthens and improves the 2008 farm bill, particularly the natural \ndisaster relief provisions. It beefs up and rehabilitates livestock \ndisaster programs, it provides tools to help reduce fire risk and \nimprove forest health, it improves and increases access to crop \ninsurance to protect against future natural disasters, it authorizes \ndirect and guaranteed loans for recovery from wildfires and drought, \nand the list goes on--all important programs necessary to deal with \nthis disaster we are facing in our country today.\n  The Senate's 5-year farm bill makes necessary upgrades to the \npolicies in the 2008 farm bill to help Americans recover from natural \ndisasters, and it does it without digging the country deeper into debt. \nThe Senate passed this bipartisan farm bill in June, but the House will \nnot take action on it. Plus, the House is expected to move a separate \nbill, essentially a 1-year extension of the old 2008 farm bill. A 1-\nyear extension of outdated and inefficient policies is not adequate, it \nis irresponsible. We need the substantial reforms in the Senate's 5-\nyear farm bill now. A 1-year extension of current policy does nothing \nto help those who need the farm bill and its disaster relief the most. \nWhen you can do better, you should do better.\n  Congress passed a 5-year farm bill in 2008, 2002, 1996, 1990, 1985--\nyou get the picture--just about every 5 years between 1965 and today. \nSurely the House can pass a proper 5-year farm bill. And the need to is \nall the more apparent in the face of the nationwide drought, with the \ndisaster relief provisions in the 2008 farm bill having expired on \nSeptember 30 last year, 2011.\n  Now, instead of passing a 5-year extension of the farm bill, they \nhave held a lot of political messaging votes and they put off doing \nwhat should have been done at the very beginning. And now, while \nAmerica is getting hit by drought and fire, while American farmers and \nranchers do not have the disaster relief because there is no farm bill, \nthe House is merely going to pass a 1-year extension of current \npolicies. They want to buy some time, kick the can down the road.\n  Well, now it is time for the House to do its job. Do what is right \nfor the country. Do not take the easy way out. Show the American people \nthat you remember why you are here and what you need to do and can \nactually do it. Americans do not want a flimsy 1-year extension of \ninadequate coverage and outdated policies. Americans want a dependable, \nmodern, and economical 5-year farm bill that cuts Federal spending. \nThat is what the Senate gave the House. That is what the House \nAgriculture Committee gave the House to work with--its own 5-year plan. \nSure, there are real differences between the Senate bill and the House \nAgriculture bill, but there should be room for consensus. So the House \nmust pass the bill or pass our bill, but do not pass a 1-year extension \nof outdated policies that will not work for modern American \nagriculture. Do not try to just coast along without a 5-year farm bill.\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\n  The lack of a 2012 farm bill will fail to provide certainty to \nfarmers and ranchers and lead to higher prices for all consumers at the \ngrocery store. And this is on top of the already predicted 3 to 4 \npercent rise in food prices caused by the drought. We do not want that \nand America deserves better. Nebraska's farmers and our American \nfarmers and ranchers and all those affected by the drought are \ndepending on Congress to do our job right and fairly debate this issue. \nSo do not kick the can down the road.\n  I urge the House to bring a 5-year farm bill to the House floor as \nsoon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to continue the discussion on \nthe cyber security legislation, and particularly S. 3414, the pending \nbusiness before the Senate, which is the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, the \nbipartisan piece of legislation to deal with an urgent national crisis.\n  I want first, again, to speak to our colleagues about the seriousness \nof the threat. I think sometimes that because most people haven't \nexperienced the consequences of a cyber attack--and most are not aware \nof the constant cyber theft going on with moving money from bank \naccounts and stealing industrial secrets--frankly, a lot of the \nbusinesses that are victims of the theft don't want to acknowledge them \nor announce them for fear of exposing their own lack of adequate cyber \ndefenses, but also a kind of general embarrassment. Yet we now know as \na public matter--whether it has sunk into the consciousness among most \nof the American people--that some great companies that are very tech \nsavvy, cyber savvy, have been the victims of cyber attacks.\n  Sony, RSA, Google, and others have come momentarily to public \nattention, but I think what this has meant has been unclear to people. \nIt may, in fact, be unclear to many of the leaders of the private \ncorporations that control so much of our critical cyber infrastructure.\n  In America, 80 to 85 percent of the critical infrastructure is \nprivately owned. That is the American way. That is the way it ought to \nbe. But it means when the private sector owns critical infrastructure \nwhich can, and will be, a target of hostile action, enemy attack in \nthis new world of ours, then we have to create a partnership with the \nprivate owners of this critical infrastructure to raise our defenses \nbecause it is not just their businesses they are defending, it is the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  A chief information officer at one of the businesses that owns part \nof our critical infrastructure said to me at one point that it is hard \nto get the attention of the CEO on this problem. The CEO is balancing a \nlot of considerations, looking at annual budgets and quarterly profits. \nFor the average CEO, the threat of cyber attack is distant. For the \naverage chief information officer, it is not so distant.\n  As the majority leader pointed out earlier, I think it may help to \nlook at something very difficult to look at, which is what is happening \nin India today where the power system has collapsed for hundreds of \nmillions of people. That is a breakdown, as far as we know--and I \nbelieve that is what is the fact--that is a breakdown in parts of the \nelectric grid.\n  Let me give another example. Last year, in Connecticut, we had a very \nserious early winter storm where there were still a lot of leaves on \nthe trees; the branches were heavy. A lot of trees fell and took out a \nlot of power lines in our State. A lot of people were without power for \ndays and days and days. Public buildings were used as shelters for the \nhomeless. Elderly people, particularly, were affected with food \nspoiling in the refrigerators, the lack of lights in their dwelling, et \ncetera.\n  Just imagine for a moment if that was not the result of a weather \nevent but of a cyber attack. Cyber systems are controlling the electric \npower grid, and I believe they are vulnerable. I think the same of a \nlot of the other cyber systems that control critical infrastructure in \nour financial system. The computer systems we depend on for the \nmovement of money from one account to the other, the direct deposits we \ndo, the money in our accounts, the billions of dollars that move \nbetween financial institutions every day--what would happen to our \ncountry if those systems were knocked out or what would happen if Wall \nStreet and the stock exchanges were knocked out?\n  Again, as I said earlier today, think about the real nightmare \nsituation, which is that a dam controlled by a cyber system is \npenetrated by an enemy who opens the dam and unleashes water, and \ntorrents of water knock out communities in the path of that water and \nkill a lot of people. That is all, unfortunately, the age that we live \nin and the vulnerability we have.\n  There was a story in the Washington Post--I believe I talked about it \nbefore in this debate, but I will repeat it--about a young man on the \nother side of the world sitting at his computer at home. He was nothing \nspecial, but he was smart and computer savvy. He broke into the \ncomputer-controlled system--the cyber system controlling a small water \nutility in Texas. He had the ability to disrupt the functioning of that \nentire utility. He didn't do it, thank God. He posted online what he \nhad done--a warning at least, perhaps a bit of bragging that he was \nable to do it. But think about an enemy who had hostile intent against \nthe United States who would launch similar attacks against several \nsmall utilities around the country--or large utilities, for that \nmatter.\n  Mr. President, last week, the people who are the real experts on \ncyber space gathered in Las Vegas at the annual--and this is an \ninteresting title--Black Hat Computer Security Conference. They issued \nyet more warnings.\n  The conference opened with a very strong warning from Shawn Henry \nwho, until recently, was the Assistant Director of the FBI in charge of \nthe FBI's considerable cyber program. Some people call Shawn Henry the \nNation's top cyber cop. He said this at the Black Hat Conference:\n\n       The adversary knows that if you want to harm civilized \n     society--take their water away, do away with their \n     electricity. There are terrorist groups that are online now \n     calling for the use of cyber as a weapon.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       People will not truly get this until they see the real \n     implications of a cyber attack. For example, people knew \n     about Osama bin Laden prior to 9/11, but that awareness had \n     risen by several orders of magnitude after the attacks.\n\n  Mr. Henry, former director of cyber programs at the FBI, concluded:\n\n       I believe something like that will have to happen in the \n     cyber world before people truly get it.\n\n  Obviously, we all hope and pray not, but at this moment in this \ndebate, in the Senate's consideration of the Cybersecurity Act, there \nare a lot of inflexible positions that are being taken. People are not \nwilling to come together across ideological and political divides to \ndeal with a problem and a threat that faces us all. I fear that Mr. \nHenry may well have been right.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, don't run the risk that it will \ntake a cyber 9/11 to bring us rushing back here to adopt cyber security \nlegislation. It doesn't take much to imagine what will happen if we are \nthe victims of a major cyber attack. Minor cyber attacks are happening \nevery day. Major cyber thefts occur regularly in America every day. \nLet's heed the warning and come together over special interests to meet \na national security interest and challenge.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, there is such an important \nsubject that is looming over the country right now that Congress can do \nsomething about; that is, the possibility of\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\ncyber attack. We have had this discussed by a number of people in very \nhigh and responsible positions and the threat is real.\n  What the threat means to all of us in our everyday lives is that \nelectrical systems could be shut down, water systems could be shut \ndown, the banking system could be shut down, sewer systems could go \nawry, and we can go on and on. For months we have been stymied from \npassing anything because of a disagreement in the business community, \nwhich is going to be one of the main recipients of a potential cyber \nattack.\n  I will choose my words very carefully as a member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee and say this potential attack is real. It is \nreal not only from rogue players but also some state actors, and we \nneed to get this legislation up and going. I am most encouraged to \nthink we are at a position to get agreement; that the chairman and vice \nchairman of our Intelligence Committee are going to come together in an \nagreement. We need to pass this--this week--because this is deadly \nserious.\n  I refer to a letter that has been made public from the commander of \nCyber Command, a four-star general, GEN Keith Alexander. He is also the \nhead of the National Security Agency. He has done a remarkable job. He \nsent a letter, dated today, to the majority leader imploring the Senate \nto move.\n  Whatever disagreements there have been over the concern of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security being the interfacing agency can be \nworked out. The National Security Agency--which almost all of us have \nenormous confidence in--is going to be directly involved.\n  It is my hope and I am expressing optimism that we are going to get \nthis legislation out of here and to the House. If they can't pass it \nbefore this August recess, at least we can have some items over the \nAugust recess start to be informally conferenced to iron out any \ndifferences between the House and the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to speak \nabout the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, the measure that is on the Senate \nfloor right now. This important bill addresses a serious and immediate \nthreat to our Nation's security. I served 4 years on the Intelligence \nCommittee during which I worked hard to understand the cyber security \nthreat. I helped Senator Mikulski and Senator Snowe write the Senate \nIntelligence Committee Cyber Security Report. I am the chairman of the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism that has jurisdiction \nover cyber security. As I have explained before on the floor of the \nSenate, the cyber threat against our Nation--against our intellectual \nproperty, against our privacy, and against our safety--is vast and it \nis upon us. It is a national security threat. It is a national economic \nthreat. We cannot afford to wait to pass legislation to respond to this \nthreat. The leading national security experts in each party agree: Now \nis the time to pass comprehensive cyber security legislation.\n  The Cybersecurity Act of 2012 is a strong, comprehensive bill that \nwill make our Nation safer. It will provide for the sharing of threat \ninformation between the government and private sector, and it will \nprovide for the hardening, for the protection of the networks of the \nprivate companies that operate America's critical infrastructure--that \nrun our electric grid, that run our financial networks, that run our \ncommunications systems and the other infrastructure that is essential \nto conducting the day-to-day way of life Americans enjoy, that is \nessential to our national security and to our economic well-being.\n  The Senate voted to proceed to this bill in a very broad, bipartisan \nmanner--84 votes, as I recall. It has been disappointing in the wake of \nthat that some elements within the business community are failing to \ncooperate, are failing to, for instance, provide constructive \nsuggestions in areas where they have disagreement with this important \nlegislation. Indeed, some appear intent on just preventing the Senate \nfrom passing legislation that would make us all safer.\n  In some cases these interests are not negotiating to get a bill that \nprotects their interests. They are blockading to stop a bill that will \nprotect all of our interests. To put this blockade into context, \nconsider the views of GEN Keith Alexander, the Director of the National \nSecurity Agency and of United States Cyber Command. General Alexander \nis the most senior and respected cyber security expert in our Nation's \nmilitary. He runs our two most technically sophisticated and skilled \ncyber operations. Today he wrote:\n\n       The cyber threat facing the Nation is real and demands \n     immediate action. The time to act is now; we simply cannot \n     afford further delay. Moreover, to be most effective in \n     protecting against this threat to our national security, \n     cyber security legislation should address both information \n     sharing and core critical infrastructure hardening.\n\n  The Cybersecurity Act addresses both of those issues, information \nsharing and core critical infrastructure hardening. It does what our \nmilitary's leading cyber security expert says is necessary to be done \nto protect the Nation.\n  That, then, is the view of the leader of our military cyber warriors \nand cyber defenders based on both deep experience and access to the \nmost deeply classified information held by the U.S. Government.\n  In contrast, industry arguments against cyber security legislation \nappear to have been developed with little or no awareness of the threat \nfacing our Nation. Kevin Mandia of the leading security firm Mandiant \nhas explained, for example, that ``in over 90 percent of the cases we \nhave responded to, government notification was required to alert the \ncompany that a security breach was underway. In our last 50 incidents, \n`` he said, ``48 of the victim companies learned they were breached \nfrom the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Defense, or \nsome other third party.''\n  The FBI's experience was similar. When the FBI-led National Cyber \nInvestigative Joint Task Force informs the corporation it has been \nhacked, 9 times out of 10, the FBI reports, the corporation had no \nidea.\n  In Operation Aurora, the cyber attack which targeted numerous \ncompanies, only 3 out of the approximately 300 companies attacked were \naware that they had been attacked before they were contacted by the \ngovernment.\n  These are not unique incidents. Globally, I have said, General \nAlexander has said, and others have said that America is right now on \nthe losing end of the largest illicit transfer of wealth in human \nhistory through cyber attack and through the theft through cyber attack \nof our intellectual property. So this is an industrywide problem.\n  Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been the completely unwitting \nvictim of a long-term and extensive cyber intrusion. Just last year the \nWall Street Journal reported that a group of hackers in China breached \nthe computer defenses of the U.S. Chamber, gained access to everything \nstored on its systems, including information about its 3 million \nmembers, and remained on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's network for at \nleast 6 months and possibly more than a year. The chamber only learned \nof the break-in when the FBI told the group that servers in China were \nstealing its information.\n  Even after the chamber was notified and increased its cyber security, \nthe article stated that the chamber continued to experience suspicious \nactivity, including a ``thermostat at a townhouse the Chamber owns on \nCapitol Hill . . . communicating with an Internet address in China . . \n. and . . . a printer used by Chamber executives spontaneously . . . \nprinting pages with Chinese characters.'' These are the people we are \nsupposed to listen to about cyber security.\n  A recent Bloomberg News article makes it clear that this was not an \nisolated incident. It describes how hackers linked to China's army have \nbeen seen on the networks of a vast array of American businesses. The \narticle describes how what started as assaults on military and defense \ncontractors have widened into a rash of attacks from which no corporate \nentity is safe. Among other cyber attacks, Bloomberg News reported, the \nnetworks of major oil companies have been harvested for seismic maps \ncharting oil reserves--it saves work if you can steal that information \nrather than find it yourself--\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n\npatent law firms have been hacked for their clients' trade secrets--\nagain, free access to valuable information--and investment banks have \nbeen hacked into for market analysis that might impact the global \nventures of certain state-owned--nation-state-owned, foreign-country-\nowned operations.\n  After having been victimized repeatedly by cyber attacks and having \nlearned about them only when the government arrived to help them fix \nthe problem, one would think critical infrastructure operators or their \nrepresentatives would be keenly aware of the urgent need for cyber \nsecurity legislation. One would think they might come to this issue \nwith some sense of humility based on the patent inadequacy of their \ndefenses. One would think that elected officials sworn to the \nprotection of this country might view with some caution and some \nskepticism claims by folks who are hacked and penetrated virtually at \nwill, usually without even knowing about it, that they can handle this \njust fine on their own. Yet industry opposition remains, even after the \nbill has been revised to include a very business-friendly, voluntary, \nincentive-based approach to hardening up critical infrastructure that \nwe all depend on. Unfortunately, some colleagues can only hear the \nsiren song of the industry lobbyists, even with plain and ominous \nnational security threats staring them in the face.\n\n  Some in industry claim that a bill with only information sharing \nbetween the government and business would be sufficient and that \nprotection of critical infrastructure is not necessary. This premise is \nwrong. Statements to the contrary are simply false. Such assertions \nhave been repudiated by the people who lead the charge with our \nNation's defense, and who have been confirmed in these roles by the \nSenate who have repeatedly, and as recently as today, emphasized the \nneed to protect critical infrastructure. These officials include \nSecretary of Defense Panetta, Director of National Intelligence \nClapper, Attorney General Holder, Secretary of Homeland Security \nNapolitano, and others.\n  Indeed, it is not just this administration that holds this view. A \nwide range of national security experts from previous Republican \nadministrations have emphasized the vulnerability of our critical \ninfrastructure, including former Director of National Intelligence and \nNSA Director ADM Mike McConnell, former Secretary of Homeland Security \nMichael Chertoff, and former assistant attorney general OLC, and now \nHarvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith. These people know what \nthey are talking about, they are not kidding around, and they deserve \nto be listened to.\n  Secretary Chertoff has explained that the existing status quo is not \ngenerating adequate cyber security for our critical infrastructure. The \nmarketplace, former Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff has explained, \nis likely to fail in allocating the correct amount of investment to \nmanage risk across the breadth of the networks on which our society \nrelies. One example of this type of market failure is the decision of \ngas, electric power, and water utility industries to forgo \nimplementation of a powerful new encryption system to shield \nsubstations, pipeline compressors, and other key infrastructure from \ncyber attack because of cost concerns. It should be noted the costs in \nthis case would be approximately $500 per vulnerable device, and they \nstill would not do it.\n  The unwillingness of industry to adopt necessary security standards \nis particularly troubling when we consider the scope and scale of the \nrisks associated with a failure of critical infrastructure. The current \nelectricity grid knocked down in India--leaving 600 million people \nwithout power--shows how bad things can get when critical \ninfrastructure fails. The cause of this massive failure is not clear, \nand there is not yet any evidence that it was caused by a cyber attack, \nbut it vividly illustrates the vulnerability of humankind when the \ncritical infrastructure we depend on is knocked down and of the \nterrible possible consequences of the failure of that critical \ninfrastructure.\n  The scale of the threat we face, the plain inadequacy of current \nsafeguards in the corporate sector, and the consequences of failure in \nthis area of critical infrastructure all join together to demand \npassage of comprehensive cyber security legislation. This is a matter \nof national security. It is our responsibility here in this building to \ndo what we can to make the Nation safer regardless of any parochial \ninterests. Now is the time for us all to come together to get this \nimportant job done.\n  I will conclude by saying we are tantalizingly close to having an \nagreement. If people will take one last step forward to get that \nagreement, I think we can do it. If people back away because of the \nurging of parochial interests, we will fail at this opportunity.\n  I want to conclude by expressing my congratulations to the chairman \nof the committee on Homeland Security and his ranking member who have \nworked hard and who have given an enormous amount. We began with a \ntraditional government-run regulatory procedure, which is one that \neverybody is familiar with and has lots of checks and balances in it, \nbut it is also a fairly mandatory and top-controlled procedure. As a \nresult of considerable bipartisan discussions, a new model emerged that \nallows the industry immense independence and control in this area.\n  The regime it has been moved to is a huge step by the chairman and \nthe ranking member and begins with the rule that originates in the \nprivate sector, has it vetted by experts from the private sector, has a \nnational institute for science and technology review as well, ends up \nwith an array of government agencies approving or disapproving that, \nand whatever standard is ultimately approved by the government council \nof agencies, the industry companies are free to opt in or opt out. If \nthey think the regulation is unreasonable, they are at liberty to opt \nout entirely. A comprehensive liability protection structure has been \ncreated as an inducement for companies to participate, but it is a \nstrong and powerful check on the standard-setting apparatus that \nultimately the industry can choose to opt out if it is unreasonable. An \nenormous step has been taken by the authors of the current bill toward \na compromise. We need a step coming back the other way in order to get \nthis done.\n  I see my distinguished colleague from Tennessee is here. Let me take \none moment as I yield to express my appreciation to Nick Patterson of \nthe Department of Justice who has been on my staff on assignment from \nthe national security division for months and months working on this \nissue. Today is his last day. I want to thank him for his work on this \neffort. I want to thank the Department of Justice for loaning him to me \nand having them lose this valuable member of their national security \ndivision to help us develop this legislation. He has been a valuable \npart of an immensely capable team in my office, led by Stephen Lilley, \nthat has gotten us to at least where I am today on this legislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank the Senator from Tennessee \nfor his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the majority leader is coming to the \nfloor at 6:30, and I will yield to him at that time.\n  I would like to thank Neena Imam, who is sitting with me, for serving \non my staff for the past two years as a fellow with the Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratory. She has done a terrific job working for me on \nenergy and environmental policy.\n  Mr. President, today is the 100th anniversary of Milton Friedman's \nbirthday, the Nobel Prize Laureate. One of his most important \nstatements, in my opinion, was this, ``Nothing is so permanent as a \ntemporary government program.'' It was reported by several media \noutlets that Governor Mitt Romney has taken the position that the wind \nproduction tax credit should be allowed to expire at the end of the \nyear. He must have known Milton Friedman's birthday was coming today. I \nwouldn't presume to speak for Milton Friedman, but I think he would \napplaud Governor Romney's position. It shows his seriousness about our \nfiscal problems in the United States. It's time to end a temporary tax \ncredit that was put into law in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush \nwas in office and when Milton Friedman was\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\nonly 80 years old. The wind production tax credit was a temporary tax \nbreak, in 1992 to encourage wind power. We give wind developers 2.2 \ncents for every kilowatt-hour of wind electricity produced. And now \nit's about to expire at the end of the year. It needs to be extended \nagain the developers say. Nothing is so permanent as a temporary \ngovernment program. They tell us just one more time. But it is an \nargument like this that has got us into the fiscal mess we have as a \nNation.\n  The United States of America, according to the Joint Tax Committee \nand the U.S. Treasury, is spending $14 billion on subsidizing giant \nwind turbines over a five-year period, $6 billion of it is this \nproduction tax credit. That's why I am so pleased to see Governor \nRomney support the idea of more responsibility in our spending. We \nspend too much money in Washington that we do not have, and it has to \nstop. There are many reasons we don't need this particular provision of \nthe tax code.\n  First, we can't afford it. From 2009 through 2013, the tax credit \nwill cost taxpayers $6 billion over five years, and the grants will \ncost another $8 billion over that same five years. At a time when the \nfederal government is borrowing 40 cents of every dollar it spends, we \ncannot justify such a subsidy, especially for what the U.S. Energy \nSecretary calls a ``mature technology.''\n  Second, despite all the money, it produces a relatively small amount \nof electricity, producing only 2.3 percent of our electricity in the \nUnited States. We're a big country. We use 25 percent of all the \nelectricity in the world. We're not going to operate our country \nthrough windmills.\n  Third, these massive turbines too often destroy the environment in \nthe name of saving the environment. Some are 50 stories high--taller \nthan the Statue of Liberty--with blades as long as a football field, \nweighing seven tons and spinning at 150 miles an hour, with blinking \nlights visible for 20 miles. These aren't your grandma's windmills. \nThese gigantic turbines are three times as tall as the sky boxes at \nUniversity of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium in Knoxville. There is a new \nmovie called ``Windfall'' about residents in upstate New York who are \nupset and have left their homes because of these big wind turbines.\n  Mr. President, the majority leader has come to the floor, and I will \nforgo my remarks at this time so he has a chance to say what he wishes \nto say.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the senior \nSenator from Tennessee wishes to speak for another 10 minutes, is that \nright?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 5 minutes would do it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period for \ndebate only on S. 3414, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, be extended \nuntil 6:40, and that at 6:40 I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the majority leader for his courtesy, and I \nwill continue.\n  The fourth reason that we don't need to allow these production tax \ncredits for wind to be renewed is that they have not created as many \nAmerican jobs as expected. An American University study reported in \n2009 that the first $1 billion of stimulus grants to wind went to \nforeign manufacturing companies.\n  And what did we get in return for these billions of dollars of \nsubsidies? A puny amount of unreliable electricity generated mostly at \nnight when we don't use it.\n  I mentioned a little earlier that our country is a big country. It \nuses lots of electricity. The Senator from Rhode Island was talking \nabout the problems in India that are being caused by failure of the \ngrid. We need large amounts of reliable baseload electricity to power \nthis country. We're very fortunate that we have, through unconventional \nnatural gas discoveries, found that we're going to have a lot of cheap \nnatural gas in the United States, and we can make electricity from \nnatural gas power plants at a low cost and with very little air \npollution.\n  Nuclear power produces 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity, and \n20 percent of the total electricity generated in the U.S. It needs to \nbe a part of our future energy mix. Coal should also be part of our \nenergy future, as long as coal plants have pollution control equipment \non them to reduce the sulfur, nitrogen and mercury. I was one of those \nsenators who voted to require coal plants that operate in the future to \nhave pollution control equipment on them. This means in a few years \nevery operating coal plant in the United States will be clean except \nfor carbon, and I am convinced that such programs as ARPA-E at the \nDepartment of Energy will find what I think is the holy grail of energy \ntechnologies.\n  One of the companies that ARPA-E invests federal research dollars in \nis experimenting with growing micro-organisms on electrodes. These \nbacteria can turn carbon dioxide into fuel. In other words, they create \na commercial energy use for the carbon that comes from our coal plants. \nAnd when that happens, the United States will have massive amounts of \ncheap, clean, reliable electricity. And we won't be powering our \ncountry with windmills.\n  We should congratulate Dr. Friedman for his great career, for his \nwisdom in pointing out to us that nothing is so permanent as a \ntemporary government program, and applaud Governor Romney for \nrecognizing that and calling for the end of this tax credit.\n  We're coming upon something we call the fiscal cliff. I know the \nsenator from Colorado is very interested in this, spending a lot of \ntime working in a bipartisan way to try to find a way to deal with it. \nMy friend, the Foreign Minister of Australia, is a great fan of the \nUnited States, and he said to the United States that we're one budget \nagreement away from restoring our global preeminence--One budget \nagreement away from restoring our global preeminence.\n  Now, to get that agreement what do we have to do? We have to deal \nwith appropriations bills at the end of the year, a problem we may have \nsolved today with a solution the leaders recommended. We have to deal \nwith the Bush tax cuts, and multiple items that expire at the end of \nthe year such as the tax extenders that need to be renewed or not, and \nthe alternative minimum tax which started out as a tax on rich people \nand now threatens to impact millions of Americans. There's appropriate \npayment to doctors who provide medical care, we call this the doc fix. \nThere is the sequester that none of us likes. There's the problem of \nthe debt limit, the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits. All of \nthis is happening at the end of the year.\n  This is a good time to get serious about with dealing with the fiscal \ncliff, and let a 20 year, temporary tax break to encourage wind \nenergy--which costs the American people $6 billion over five years--to \nexpire and let wind stand on its own. I would suggest that for the $6 \nbillion in savings we put $2 of every $3 we save into reducing the debt \nand $1 into energy research to see if we can find even more amounts of \ncheap, clean energy.\n  So it is a good occasion to celebrate Milton Friedman's 100th \nbirthday, and it is a good occasion to applaud Governor Romney for \nfollowing Milton Friedman's advice: ``Nothing is so permanent as a \ntemporary government program.''\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank the majority leader for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss three amendments to \nthe Cybersecurity Act of 2012 that I am introducing today with Senator \nMikulski. This important piece of legislation, which was introduced by \nSenators Lieberman, Collins, Feinstein, Rockefeller, and Carper, \nresponds to the serious and growing cyber security threat facing our \nNation. It will strengthen our national security, our economic well-\nbeing, the safety of our families, and our privacy. The three \namendments Senator Mikulski and I are introducing today would ensure \nthat the bill also harnesses law enforcement agencies' cyber \nauthorities and capabilities as effectively as possible.\n  I am very honored that Senator Mikulski is introducing these \namendments with me today. She has a long record of continued leadership \non law enforcement and national security issues. It has been a \nprivilege to work with her on the challenge of protecting Americans \nagainst cyber security threats, first on the Intelligence Committee and \nmore recently in a series of\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\ndiscussion and working groups. As the chairman for the Commerce, \nJustice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, her assessment of the right approach to law \nenforcement issues in cyberspace draws from a wealth of experience and \nexpertise. I am very grateful to her for her leadership on these \nissues.\n  The first amendment we have introduced addresses the scale and \nstructure of law enforcement's cyber resources. Law enforcement \nagencies have vital roles to play against cyber crime, cyber espionage, \nand other emerging and growing cyber threats. Congress must ensure that \nlaw enforcement agencies are organized and resourced in a manner that \nallows them to fulfill these important responsibilities. To date, \ninvestigatory responsibilities for cyber crime have been assigned \nwithin existing agencies, with some held by the FBI and others by the \nSecret Service or other agencies. Prosecutorial responsibilities have \nbeen distributed among the National Security Division, the Computer \nCrime and Intellectual Property Section, and U.S. attorneys' offices \nacross the country. Law enforcement has had some important successes \nwith this model, such as the FBI's takedown of the Coreflood botnet, \nbut these successes need to be achieved with much greater frequency.\n  FBI Director Mueller stated that a ``substantial reorientation of the \nBureau'' will be necessary to achieve that goal. It is Congress's \nresponsibility to ensure that any reorientation of law enforcement \nmaximizes law enforcement's effectiveness against the cyber threat and \nuses Federal resources as efficiently as possible. This will require \nCongress to consider important issues such as whether cyber crime \nshould have a dedicated investigatory agency akin to the DEA or ATF, \nwhether existing task force or strike force models are well suited for \naddressing the cyber threat, and how cyber resources should be scaled \ngiven the future threat.\n  To address these questions, our amendment would require an expert \nstudy of our current cyber law enforcement resources. This study will \nevaluate the scale and structure of these resources, identifying \nstrengths and weaknesses in the current approach and providing \nrecommendations for the future. This amendment thus will provide \nCongress a necessary expert assessment to guide our work in the years \nahead.\n  The second amendment we have introduced would ensure that existing \nand effective cyber law enforcements efforts are not unintentionally \ndisrupted by changes made in title II of the bill, which covers \n``Federal Information Security Management and Consolidating \nResources.'' This title makes a number of valuable changes and reforms \nto current law, including the creation of a center within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security that will lead efforts to protect \nFederal Government networks. The creation of this center is an \nimportant step forward in protecting Federal networks, but we must \nensure that its operations do not disrupt law enforcement relationships \nand activities that currently are making our country safer. For \nexample, the FBI-led National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, \nNCIJTF, must be allowed to continue its much needed and effective work \non cyber law enforcement and intelligence.\n  Our amendment would clarify that the new center is focused on the \nprotection of Federal networks and that its responsibilities do not \nextend to law enforcement. Specifically, the amendment would add a \nsavings clause indicating that the title does not pertain to law \nenforcement or intelligence activities. It also would add definitions \nthat help provide a clearer picture of the new center's role in \nprotecting Federal Government networks and responding to cyber threats, \nvulnerabilities, or incidents.\n  The final amendment we are introducing today is to title VI, which \ncovers international cooperation. This title, which incorporates \nlegislation first introduced by Senator Gillibrand and Senator Hatch, \nwill help clarify and strengthen the ability of the Federal Government \nand particularly the Department of State to develop international cyber \nsecurity policy. Language in the title, however, could be read to \ndisrupt existing and effective working relationships between American \nand foreign law enforcement agencies, interfere with the exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion, and to limit the Department of Justice's \naccountability to Congress for the law enforcement decisions it makes. \nOur amendment would ensure that the Department of Justice works \ncollaboratively with the Department of State as it exercises its \nprosecutorial discretion and that it is accountable to Congress for \ncyber crime issues for which it is responsible and regarding which it \nhas particular expertise.\n  I look forward to working with the managers of S. 3414 and any \ninterested colleagues on these important issues. I thank Senator \nMikulski for her cosponsorship.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to say I am disappointed is a tremendous \nunderstatement. This body is debating a measure that would prevent what \nnational security experts on a bipartisan basis have called a serious \nthreat to our Nation since the dawn of the nuclear age. Senator McCain \ncalled this danger an existential threat to our Nation.\n  Democrats were prepared to work on a bipartisan basis to pass this \nlegislation. I, personally, have convened many meetings, going back 2 \nyears ago, to have a piece of legislation that we could pass through \nthis body. In that 2 years' time, things have gotten worse, not better, \nas far as threats to our country. We have been prepared to address \nconcerns raised by the private sector, and I think it is only fair to \nsay that for the leaders of the committees involved in this issue, \nthere has been real cooperation, from both Democrats and Republicans.\n  I have said on the Senate floor many times that the work of Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins has been exemplary. The major part of \nthis bill is within their jurisdiction dealing with homeland security. \nI have always envisioned they have been prepared to engage in a robust \ndebate and to consider amendments designed to perfect the bill. I know \nthat is how I feel. Above all, I thought we had all been prepared to \nput national security above partisan politics to address this urgent \nmatter.\n  I was surprised this morning to hear Senator McConnell say he would \nlike a vote on repealing ObamaCare on this bill. That is really not \nappropriate. Some Republican Senators have said this matter is going to \nbe filibustered unless they have the right to vote on an amendment to \nrepeal health care reform. Obviously, that is it. The Republican leader \nsaid that, but then I thought that might fade away.\n  Every Tuesday after our caucuses--the Republicans have one and the \nDemocrats have one--Senator McConnell and I meet at the Ohio clock, as \nit is called, and both of us make a statement and answer questions the \npress gives us. It is not a jump ball, as in whoever gets there first \ngets to make the first presentation. We wait, and if one of us is not \nready, the other goes first.\n  Sometimes he goes first; sometimes I go first. But the important \npoint in the one today is that--and I am paraphrasing but the point is \ncertainly valid--the Republican leader said out here, with the entire \npress corps and his leadership team with him, that cyber security--\nremember, I am paraphrasing--is something we should do, but it will \ntake several weeks to do it. Not this week.\n  Compare that to the words of GEN Keith Alexander, commander of the \nU.S. Cyber Command, who wrote Senator McConnell and I today. And here \nis what he said. This is a quote:\n\n       The cyber threat facing this Nation is real and demands \n     immediate action. The time to act is now. We simply cannot \n     afford further delay.\n\n  I have tried to figure out a way of describing how I feel about \nthis. I said ``disappointed,'' and that is certainly true; \n``flummoxed,'' that is certainly true. I cannot understand why we are \nin this position. I am so disappointed that Leader McConnell and his \ncolleagues--some of his colleagues--would\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\nprevent us from acting on this urgent threat. I am particularly \nastounded they would rather launch yet another attack, for example, on \nwomen's health than work to ensure the security of our Nation.\n\n  I have no choice but to file cloture on this matter. I would hope we \ncould get cloture, but I am a realist, as I have learned after having \ntried to work through 85 different filibusters in this congressional \nsession. I remain hopeful that they will come to their senses and \nrealize the urgent need for action on this matter.\n  There was a really inspirational presentation made in our caucus \ntoday by Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. Again, I am \nparaphrasing, but I am pretty direct in remembering what she said. I \nwas not present when Senator McConnell made his statement. Senator \nMikulski said: I have served on the Intelligence Committee for 10 \nyears. And she said: This legislation creates a rendezvous with destiny \nfor our country. We have to do something, and we have to do it soon.\n  I have stated to Senator Lieberman, to Senator Collins--anyone who \nwill listen--this is not a partisan piece of legislation. It should not \nbe. I am happy to work on an agreement to consider relevant amendments, \nbut this matter has been pending since last Thursday. Today is Tuesday, \nand basically the slow walk that I am so used to around here has taken \nplace.\n  I hope we can find a final path forward. Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle have come to me personally and said they have invested time--\nlots of time--in this matter, and they are trying to forge a consensus. \nI take them at their word, but they all seem powerless to buck the \nfilibuster trend we have.\n  So I hope when the dust settles we can set aside crass politics and \nwork together for the good of our Nation and can achieve a strong, \neffective, bipartisan cyber security bill.\n  Mr. President, Tom Donohue, head of the Chamber of Commerce, is my \nfriend. He really is. But I am terribly disappointed in the Chamber of \nCommerce. We started out with having a requirement that businesses in \nthe private sector would be required to do certain things. Senators \nLieberman and Collins backed off from that, and now it is kind of a \nvoluntary deal. It is much weaker than I think it should be. Why in the \nworld would they oppose that--``they'' meaning the Chamber of Commerce, \nwhich has sucked in most all of the Republicans on this. That is really \nunfortunate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2731\n\n  So, Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Lieberman, Collins, and \nothers, I call up amendment No. 2731, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Cyber Security Legislation\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to respond to the statement of \nthe majority leader--first, to say that I share his sadness and \ndisappointment that he had to file a cloture motion on this \nCybersecurity Act, but I totally agree with the decision he has made. I \ndo not think he had any choice.\n  I think we are facing on the one hand an urgent, real, and growing \nthreat to our security and our prosperity because we are vulnerable; \nthat is, the privately owned cyber infrastructure of our country is \nvulnerable to attack from foreign enemies, from nonstate actors such as \nterrorist groups, from organized criminal gangs who are just out to \nsteal billions of dollars over the Internet, and from hackers.\n  So we are dealing with a real problem that all the nonpolitical \nsecurity experts from the last administration, the Bush administration, \nand this one, the Obama administration, say is rising rapidly to being \nthe No. 1 threat to American security. Over the Internet now, because \nof our vulnerability over cyber space, a foreign enemy can do us more \ndamage than the terrorists did to us on 9/11. It is that stark. So that \nis one reality.\n  The other reality is that Senator Collins and I, Senator Rockefeller \nand Senator Feinstein, have been working literally for years. As \nSenator Reid said, because of the urgency of the problem, we decided we \ncannot just fight for 100 percent of what we thought was best to \nprotect our security. We pulled back; we made it not mandatory. We have \nstandards being set for the private sector to defend itself and us \nbetter, and we are creating carrots and not sticks to encourage them to \nopt into those cyber security standards. That is one reality.\n  The other reality is that in our government--notwithstanding \ncontroversy here--all the Departments are working like a team. As \nGeneral Alexander, the head of Cyber Command at the Department of \nDefense says, cyber security is a team sport--the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Department of Defense, the FBI, the intelligence \ncommunity all working together to protect our country. But they do not \nhave the tools they need, and they urgently need this bill.\n  Yet the other reality is, in the Senate, where once again we are \ngridlocked, we cannot even get the consent necessary to take up \namendments to vote on. Senator Collins and I have said all along: Just \nget this bill to the floor. Let the Chamber, the 100 Senators, work \ntheir will on germane and relevant amendments, and something good will \nresult for the country. So here is the bill on the Senate floor, and \nyet Members are blocking us from taking up those amendments. And I am \nafraid the consequence is that they are running out the clock.\n  A lot of good work done by those of us who have sponsored the pending \nlegislation, in a very constructive, bipartisan group, led by Senator \nKyl and Senator Whitehouse--including three additional members of the \nDemocratic Caucus and Republican Caucus--have worked very hard to \nbridge the gaps. We have come closer together, but we are not going to \nwork this out unless we can vote.\n  I wish we had not come to this point, but Senator Reid has made the \ncorrect and necessary decision, and it will confront the Members of the \nSenate on Thursday with a decision: Are you going to vote for cloture \nto at least allow the Chamber to consider all the amendments on this \nbill that are germane and relevant or are you going to say: No, I will \nonly settle for exactly what I want, and I do not want this bill; \ntherefore, I am going to vote against cloture and run the risk--which \nall the independent cyber security experts in our Nation tell us we \nwill run if we do not do anything--that we will suffer a major attack \nor at least we will continue to suffer major cyber theft.\n  So I am saddened. We have worked very hard on this. But that is not \nthe point. The point is, there is an urgent necessity to pass this \nlegislation. It ought to be nonpartisan. It ought not to be the victim \nof special interest pleading. It ought to be all of us coming together, \nas we usually have on national security matters, to put the national \nsecurity interests of the American people ahead of special interests, \nto resolve our differences, to settle for less than 100 percent, and to \nget something done to protect our country or is this going to be \nanother case where the Senate fails to bridge the gaps, fails to be \nwilling to make principled compromises and therefore fails not only to \nfix a problem but, in this case, to protect our country from a very \nclear and present danger of cyber attack and cyber theft?\n  So Thursday will be the day of decision. I hope perhaps meetings can \noccur tomorrow in which we can reconcile our differences and agree on a \nmethod to go forward. If not, every Member of the Senate is going to \nhave to decide whether they want to block action on cyber security \nlegislation or whether they want to go forward and consider the \namendments on both sides that have been filed.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it strikes me, as I call you, Mr. \nPresident, that I once had the high honor to support a man who shared \nyour name, indeed your father, for President of the United States. So \nit is nice to be able to call you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5725-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an honored \nKentuckian and veteran of World War II, Mr. Ned Moore. Mr. Moore \nvisited the Nation's capital several months ago with Honor Flight, the \ngroup that helps bring veterans to Washington, D.C., to see the \nmemorials that were built in their honor. Mr. Moore was able to see the \nWorld War II Memorial that he and his fellow sailors inspired.\n  Ned's grandson, Mr. Tres Watson, is a good friend of mine, and when \nhe made me aware of his grandfather's visit, I thought it worth a \nmoment to share Ned's story with my colleagues. Ned Moore was born in \nMarydell, MS, on February 27, 1927. He joined the Navy in Jackson, MS, \non August 1, 1944, at the age of 16, without his mother's consent. He \nwas assigned to the USS Coronis, a landing-craft repair ship, on \nChristmas Day 1944.\n  While Ned was aboard the Coronis, it saw action throughout the \nPacific Theater, including acting as a support ship during the battle \nof Okinawa.\n  In 1945, Ned was assigned to the United Nations, where among his \nduties he served as personal driver for UN delegates including Eleanor \nRoosevelt, who was a UN delegate at the time. She presented Ned with a \nRoosevelt dime after making his acquaintance.\n  In March 1946, Ned was assigned to the USS Wright, a Saipan-class \nlight aircraft carrier, where he served as an aircraft mechanic. While \nthe Wright was stationed in Pensacola, FL, functioning as a training \nship, Ned married Margaret Daly in 1948.\n  In October 1952, Ned was assigned to the USS Bennington, an Essex-\nclass aircraft carrier that had been\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\nrecomissioned as an attack carrier. While the Bennington was stationed \nin Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in February 1953, then-U.S. Senator John F. \nKennedy obtained leave for Ned to return to the United States for the \nbirth of his first child.\n  In 1958, Ned was assigned to the USS Wasp in Boston after it had been \noverhauled to become the hub of a special anti-submarine group of the \nSixth Fleet. While aboard the Wasp, Ned sailed through the \nMediterranean and participated in Operation Blue Bat, a U.S. military \nintervention into Lebanon. The Wasp was responsible for transporting \nsick and injured Marines from Lebanon so they could receive care.\n  In 1960, Ned was transferred to NAS, Naval Air Station Memphis. While \nin Memphis, Ned established the Naval Air Maintenance Training Group \nLibrary. He was also a courier between Memphis and Washington, carrying \nplans for jets under design.\n  He retired from the Navy in Memphis on December 31, 1964, as a senior \nchief petty officer.\n  After leaving the Navy, Ned and his family moved to Mayfield, KY, \nwhere he worked as a maintenance manager at the General Tire \nmanufacturing facility. There, he raised three children, Debbie, Richy, \nand Mike. After retiring from General Tire in 1983, Ned and his wife \nkept their house in Mayfield while traveling the country in a motor \nhome in the spring, summer, and fall and wintering in Florida. They \ntravelled to all 50 States. They moved to Lillian, AL, in 2005.\n  At this time I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in honoring \nMr. Ned Moore for his service to country and his devotion to the \ndefense of freedom. When World War II ended, he laid down his arms to \nbecome a productive, successful member of the community who was admired \nby his family, neighbors, and State. He has been a role model to Tres \nWatson and many other Kentuckians. I wish him all the best in his \nretirement and a happy future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5726-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WOOL TRUST FUND\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am happy to hear there is a commitment \nto pass the extension and modification of the Wool and Cotton Trust \nFunds this year. As my colleagues noted, the Wool Trust Fund \ncompensates for the competitive damage caused by the fact that duties \nare higher on imports of raw materials, like wool fabric, than on \nimports of finished products, like trousers and suits. This ``tariff \ninversion'' gives foreign manufacturers a significant cost advantage \nover U.S. manufacturers like Rochester, NY's Hickey Freeman.\n  Hickey Freeman has been operating in Rochester, NY since 1899. Wool \ncloth imported by Hickey Freeman is cut and sewn into wool clothing \nwhich, in turn, is sold in stores across the United States and around \nthe world. I am particularly proud to note--while our athlete's \nuniforms sadly were made in China, our announcers on NBC are wearing \nHickey Freeman at the 2012 London Olympic Games.\n  The Wool Trust Fund is a successful program in curbing job losses and \nallowing American textile and apparel companies to expand their own \nexport markets. Without the technical fix that we are asking for here \ntoday, the health of the Wool Trust Fund will be in peril.\n  I thank Senator Menendez for his tireless leadership in extending and \nmodifying the Wool and Cotton Trust Funds and the Leader and Chairman \nBaucus for agreeing to work with Senators Menendez, Cardin and myself \nto ensure these important programs are dealt with by the end of the \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5726-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     6-MONTH CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

It means a longer period of uncertainty for government agencies \nand the people they serve, more spending on ineffective programs and \noutdated priorities, and inadequate investment in programs that merit \nadditional resources.\n  My preference is that we complete our work and make specific spending \nchoices based on the relative merits of government programs. There is \nno excuse for the Senate not to be considering the appropriations \nbills. Our committee members have done the work of scrutinizing \nbudgets, holding hearings, and drafting bills. Those bills deserve to \nbe considered by the Senate, negotiated with the House and sent to the \nPresident as soon as possible.\n  I congratulate the distinguished chairman of our Committee on \nAppropriations, Mr. Inouye, for his dependable leadership on getting us \nto this point. I look forward to continuing our efforts to extend our \nappropriations authority for the balance of the fiscal year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5726-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5726-S5727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WEAR AMERICAN ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, in cities and towns across the \nNation, workers have the proud tradition of manufacturing products that \nare made here at home.\n  Manufacturing helped us become an economic superpower and build a \nstrong, vibrant middle class.\n  Ohio manufacturers and workers are some of the most industrious, \ninnovative, and competitive in the Nation.\n  Our companies and the hard-working people who fill our factories can \ncompete with anyone in the world.\n  But this competition is getting tougher as our Nation is facing \nongoing and unfair competition from countries like China.\n  It does not help when U.S. companies and organizations either \noutsource jobs, production, and purchases overseas.\n  As has been reported in the news recently, the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee's use of Chinese-made apparel was a missed opportunity to use \ndomestic apparel manufacturers.\n  The public outrage about this decision created was predictable.\n  It is unconscionable that the U.S. Olympic Committee would hand over \nthe production of uniforms worn by our proud athletes to a county that \nflouts international trade laws, manipulates its currency, and cheats \non trade.\n  It makes no sense that an American organization would place a \nChinese-made beret on the heads of our finest athletes when we have the \ncapacity to make high-end apparel here.\n  I am encouraged that, after speaking with the chief executive and \nchair of the U.S. Olympic Committee, uniforms designed by Ralph Lauren \nfor the 2014 Olympic Games will be made in the United States.\n  I also applaud USOC's decision to further ensure, as a matter of \npolicy, that they are going to make Buying American a priority.\n  But this incident reminds us of the consequences of passing a trade \ndeal without real accountability and enforcement.\n  Congress passed a trade deal with China more than 10 years ago, which \nhas contributed to the loss of more than 5 million U.S. manufacturing \njobs between 2000 and 2010.\n  While some lawmakers and economists have written off our \nmanufacturing sector including textile and apparel production they need \nto think again.\n  According to the National Council of Textile Organizations, the \nUnited States is the third largest exporter of textile products in the \nworld.\n  The textile sector put more than 500,000 people to work at plants in \nlarge cities and mills in rural towns.\n  Do some lawmakers and economists really think we should turn our \nbacks these working Americans?\n  No. It is not right that U.S. workers get overlooked when it comes to \nshowcasing that American apparel workers in Ohio towns like Brooklyn \nand Aracanum can make things.\n  We've seen this time and time again: whether it is Olympic uniforms \nor U.S. flags, products all too often are not made here.\n  We can and we must stop this disturbing trend.\n  That is why I am introducing the Wear American Act to make certain \nthat the Federal Government purchases apparel that is 100 percent \nAmerican-made.\n  That means all textiles and apparel purchased with U.S. tax dollars \nwill be invested in U.S. businesses and communities not China.\n  The textile industry has been a staple of our Nation's economy since \nits founding and it will be important in the future.\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\n  The United States is the world leader in textile research and \ndevelopment.\n  American companies and universities are developing new textile \nmaterials such as conductive fabric with antistatic properties and \nhigh-tech textiles that monitor movement and heart rates.\n  When consumers in the United States and around the world demand our \nproducts, we deliver.\n  The United States textile industry is the third leading exporter of \nproducts worldwide. In fact, recently total textile and apparel exports \nreached a record $22.4 billion.\n  This legislation makes sense plain and clear. Why shouldn't our \nnational policies support American companies and workers?\n  We should be in the business of creating policies that reward hard \nworking Americans who work hard every day rather than supporting a Tax \nCode and trade policies that help big companies send U.S. jobs \noverseas.\n  Right now, the stakes couldn't be higher.\n  That is why the Wear American Act and supporting American workers is \nso important.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5727-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                U.S.-MOROCCO PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President: I would like to take this occasion to \nextend congratulations to His Majesty King Mohammed VI and the people \nof Morocco on the 225th anniversary of the Treaty of Peace and \nFriendship between the United States and the Kingdom of Morocco.\n  Negotiations for this treaty began in 1783 and the draft was signed \nin 1786. Future Presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson were the \nAmerican signatories. The treaty was then presented to the Senate, \nwhich ratified it on July 18, 1787, making it the first treaty to \nreceive U.S. Senate ratification.\n  The treaty represented the second time that Morocco and the United \nStates affirmed diplomatic relations between the two countries. It is \nalso worthy of mention that that Sultan, Mohammed III, was the first \nhead of state, and Morocco the first country, to recognize the new \nUnited States as an independent country in 1777.\n  The Treaty of Peace and Friendship, whose anniversary we commemorate \nthis month, provided for the United States' diplomatic representation \nin Morocco and open commerce at any Moroccan port on the basis of \n``most favored nation.'' It also established the principle of non-\nhostility when either country was engaged in war with any other nation.\n  Most importantly, the treaty provided for the protection of U.S. \nshipping vessels at a time when American merchant ships were at risk of \nharassment by various European warships. The treaty specifically \nstated:\n\n       If any Vessel belonging to the United States shall be in \n     any of the Ports of His Majesty's Dominions, or within \n     Gunshot of his Forts, she shall he protected as much as \n     possible and no Vessel whatever belonging either to Moorish \n     or Christian Powers with whom the United States may be at \n     War, shall be permitted to follow or engage her, as we now \n     deem the Citizens of America our good Friends.\n\n  A further indication of the early and close relationship between the \nUnited States and Morocco can be seen in a letter President George \nWashington wrote to Sultan Mohammed III on December 1, 1789. President \nWashington wrote:\n\n       It gives me pleasure to have this opportunity of assuring \n     your majesty that I shall not cease to promote every measure \n     that may conduce to the friendship and harmony which so \n     happily subsist between your empire and these . . . This \n     young nation, just recovering from the waste and desolation \n     of long war, has not, as yet, had time to acquire riches by \n     agriculture or commerce. But our soil is beautiful, and our \n     people industrious and we have reason to flatter ourselves \n     that we shall gradually become useful to our friends.\n\n  United States relations with Morocco have strengthened in the decades \nand centuries following the historic treaty. For example, during World \nWar I, Morocco was aligned with the Allied forces, and in 1917 and \n1918, Moroccan soldiers fought valiantly alongside United States \nMarines at Chateau Thierry, Mont Blanc, and Soissons.\n  During World War II, Moroccan national defense forces aided American \nand British forces in the region. Morocco hosted one of the most \npivotal meetings of the Allied leaders in World War II. In January \n1943, United States President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime \nMinister Winston Churchill and Free French commander Charles De Gaulle \nmet for 4 days in the Casablanca neighborhood of Anfa to discuss \nstrategy against the Axis powers. It was during this series of meetings \nthat the Allies agreed to launch their continental counter push against \nAxis aggression through a beach head landing on the French Atlantic \ncoast.\n  Following Morocco's independence in 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower \ncommunicated to King Mohammed V that ``my government renews its wishes \nfor the peace and prosperity of Morocco.'' The King responded by \nreassuring President Eisenhower that Morocco would be a staunch ally in \nthe fight against the proliferation of communism in the region.\n  The United States Agency for International Development, USAID, and \nits predecessor agencies, as well as the Peace Corps, have been active \nin Morocco since 1953. Currently, there are more than 200 volunteers in \nMorocco working in the areas of health, youth development, small \nbusiness and the environment.\n  Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, Morocco was one of the \nfirst nations to express its solidarity with the United States and \nimmediately renewed its commitment as a strong ally to combat \nterrorism. Cooperation between the United States and Morocco on these \nissues includes data sharing, law enforcement partnerships, improved \ncapabilities to oversee strategic checkpoints, and joint efforts to \nterminate terrorist organization financing.\n  It is important to extend our warm congratulations to His Majesty \nKing Mohammed VI as well as to the people of Morocco on the anniversary \nof the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which set the stage for \ncontinued and sustained engagement between our two countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5727-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5727-S5728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING JOHN W. MAHAN\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \nremarkable Montanan and American. John W. Mahan, or Jack as we all knew \nhim, died peacefully on Independence Day, July 4, at his home in \nHelena, MT. He was my neighbor and friend. I ask my colleagues in the \nSenate to join me in honoring Jack and offering condolences to his \nfamily and loved ones.\n  The Fourth of July was a fitting day for this World War II veteran \nand lifelong national veterans' advocate to leave this world. Majority \nleader Mike Mansfield, a veteran of World War I, once said that Jack \nMahan ``has done more for the veterans of Montana and the nation than \nany other man I know.''\n  Jack was born into a family dedicated to national service. His \nfather, John Senior, served as the national commander of the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans as a brigadier general. John Senior later served as \nMontana's adjutant general. Jack's mother Iola served as president of \nthe American Legion Auxiliary in Helena.\n  After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Jack enlisted in the Navy \nAir Corps. Jack went on to bravely serve as a dive bomber pilot in the \nPacific during World War II.\n  After the war, Jack took the lead on tackling challenges facing his \nfellow World War II veterans in Montana and across the country.\n  Jack fought for bonuses for WWII veterans--a practice that was done \nafter WWI to help get returning troops back on their feet.\n  Although, the Montana Supreme Court declared these ``bonus'' payments \nunconstitutional, Jack worked with veterans groups and Montana \nofficials to build popular support and eventually secured an \n``honorarium'' payment instead of a ``bonus.'' Jack's ``honorarium,'' \npaid for by a 2-cent tax on cigarettes, raised $22 million for World \nWar II veterans. In today's dollars, that is $226 million.\n  In the late 1950s, Jack led the way in establishing the veterans \nhospital at Fort Harrison, west of Helena.\n  Again, Jack worked with Montanans, veterans groups, and Members of \nCongress to raise $5.4 million to begin the first phase of building for \nthe hospital.\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\nToday, Montana veterans still rely on the hospital in Fort Harrison for \ntheir basic medical needs.\n  During his work, Jack met the acquaintance and earned the respect of \nPresidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, \nRichard Nixon, and Gerald Ford.\n  Jack had a truly remarkable life and career of service to our \ncountry. He served as the national commander-in-chief of Veterans of \nForeign Wars from 1958 to 1959.\n  He served as the national chairman of the Veterans for John F. \nKennedy's Presidential campaign committee in 1960. He also served as \nthe under secretary to the VA Memorial Services and Director of the \nNational Cemetery System in the Nixon administration.\n  On this very day, we have brave Americans patrolling the mountains of \nAfghanistan. May Jack's memory be a reminder of the obligation we owe \nto these brave warriors when they come home. His legacy is a reminder \nof what dedicated public service can deliver for our Nation's finest. \nWe will miss you, Jack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5728-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DES R. GOYAL\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Des R. Goyal \nas he completes a long and distinguished career with the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers, USACE. Mr. Goyal was born and educated in India, \nwhere he eventually received his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in \nMechanical Engineering. In 1970, he came to the United States to \nfurther his studies while earning his U.S. citizenship. Mr. Goyal \nstarted his career with the Corps in 1978 as a project engineer on \nnavigation locks in the Corps of Engineers Huntington District. Since \nthat time, he has held numerous assignments with the Corps of \nEngineers, including working on military construction projects in Saudi \nArabia and serving in Germany as Chief of the Mechanical/Electrical \ndesign branch for the Corps of Engineers Europe Division. In 1999, he \nwas assigned the job of Chief, Operations Division, Kansas City \nDistrict of the Corps of Engineers.\n  2011 was arguably the most challenging year in the 114-plus-year \nhistory of the Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District. While \nexecuting the challenging Operations and Maintenance program, the \nDistrict battled an epic 145-day flood in the Missouri River Basin and \nestablished a Recovery Field Office in Joplin, MO to respond to the \nfifth deadliest tornado in U.S. history. As an integral part of the \nOperations Division, Mr. Goyal led the effort to ensure his Emergency \nManagement and Contingency Operations were fully manned by competent \npersonnel from throughout the District. These additional missions \ncomprised approximately 25 percent of the Kansas City District's \nworkforce at various times, placing significant stress on the \norganization. However, Mr. Goyal remained poised and calm, responding \nwith a plea for volunteers, and was instrumental in the success of \nthese efforts. During these challenges, he clearly demonstrated strong \nleadership and technical competency. His past experiences significantly \naugmented the success of the mission during this timeframe.\n  Throughout his career, Des Goyal has promoted leadership and mission \nexecution. He has mentored many USACE employees and military personnel \nwhile leading the efforts on large, complex projects and programs \nthroughout the world. He has tremendous passion for the advancement of \nhis colleagues and those they serve. He championed the use of the \nStudent Career Employment Program, SCEP, in the Corps of Engineers \nNorthwest District, which serves as a valuable tool in providing \ncollege students the critical experience and networking opportunities \nto encourage employment in a public service career. Mr. Goyal continues \nto press for positive change through a focus on good government, \nprofessional organizations and community service.\n  I thank Des Goyal for his service to his adopted country and wish Des \nand his wife, Usha, an enjoyable retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5728-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NORTHWEST KIDNEY CENTERS\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nNorthwest Kidney Centers on its 50th Anniversary. Northwest Kidney \nCenters was established as the first out-of-hospital dialysis program \nin the world, opening its doors in Seattle, WA, on January 8, 1962.\n  Just 2 years after the development of the Teflon shunt at the \nUniversity of Washington, community leaders in Seattle came together to \nraise money and find a space to establish a center to deliver dialysis \ntreatments outside of a hospital, which led to the creation of the \ncommunity-based Northwest Kidney Centers.\n  Chronic kidney disease is now an epidemic, affecting one in seven \nAmerican adults. Northwest Kidney Centers is working to reverse this \ntrend, focusing on community education and prevention. Each year, \nNorthwest Kidney Centers allocates funding toward public health \neducation about kidney disease and organ donation, participating in \noutreach events and reaching more than 12,000 people with kidney \ninformation. It also developed a ``Living Well with CKD'' program which \noffers classes on treatment options and good nutrition. This program \nreaches nearly 1,000 pre-dialysis patients and family members each \nyear, at no cost to the participants.\n  I take great pride in the fact that Seattle is the birthplace of \nchronic dialysis treatments and that Northwest Kidney Centers continues \nto take the lead on developments in the field. Northwest Kidney Centers \nhosted clinical trials to develop the anti-anemia drug Epogen, and set \nup the Northwest Organ Procurement Agency. In 2008, Northwest Kidney \nCenters spearheaded the creation of the Kidney Research Institute, a \ncollaboration with the University of Washington Medical School which \nhas become a scientific leader focusing on ways to prevent, detect, \ntreat, and eventually cure kidney disease.\n  I applaud Northwest Kidney Centers for its contributions to the State \nof Washington and the kidney disease and dialysis field as a whole. As \nthe organization celebrates its 50th Anniversary, I extend my \ncongratulations to the entire Northwest Kidney Centers community--\npatients, physicians, employees, supporters and volunteers--and thank \nthem for their dedication and commitment to improving the lives of \nkidney patients in my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5728-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5728-S5729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE MIDCOAST AREA VETERANS MEMORIAL WALL\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and recognize \nwith the highest esteem the many volunteers, veterans' organizations \nand civic and municipal entities responsible for establishing the \nMidcoast Area Veterans Memorial Wall in Rockland, Maine, that honors \nthe extraordinary service and sacrifice of all our Nation's military \nveterans.\n  Established and managed by the Midcoast Area Veterans Memorial \nCorporation, a nonprofit corporation comprised of members from the \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), the Marine Corps \nLeague, Rockland Rotary, Rockland Kiwanis, the Benevolent and \nProtective Order (BPO) of Elks, and the City of Rockland, the Memorial \nWall is located on upper Limerock Street in Rockland on property owned \nby the American Legion Post No. 1. The location of the Memorial is, \nappropriately, also the site of an 1861 Civil War encampment of the \nlocal Fourth Regiment of Maine Volunteers.\n  Undeniably, nothing unites us more as Mainers and Americans than the \nlimitless pride we take in our revered and noble veterans. Indeed, in \nMaine, we also cherish the tremendous distinction of having, on any \ngiven day, the second most veterans per capita of any State in the \nNation. Such devotion to country is the embodiment of the self-\nsacrificing principles that Mainers live by and have passed down from \none generation to the next. This selfless way of thinking also inspired \nand motivated a small group of individuals more than 16 years ago to \nbegin formulating plans to establish a memorial to honor our veterans \nin Midcoast Maine. After a long, dedicated effort and several site \nlocation changes, the Midcoast Area Veterans Memorial Wall has finally \nsecured a permanent home.\n  The Midcoast Area Veterans Memorial Wall is by all accounts a \nbeautifully designed and landscaped tribute\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\nto the unfathomable service and sacrifice of the many Americans \nexceptional enough to wear the uniform--not only the 21.8 million \nveterans alive today, including more than 134,000 from the State of \nMaine, but also those who are no longer with us. Featuring stunning \nblack granite tiles etched with digitized pictures of veterans, the \nwall serves as a fitting and moving tribute to those who so ably and \ncourageously served under the Stars and Stripes to protect and preserve \nthe cherished principles that have made our nation the greatest on \nearth. And, while new tiles are added twice yearly--at Memorial Day and \nVeterans Day--the Midcoast Area Veterans Memorial Wall is always open \nand provides an opportunity for each of us to express our boundless \ngratitude to those who have placed service above self not just on \nnational holidays, but on every day of every month of every year.\n  On August 3, 2012, the Midcoast Area Veterans Memorial Wall will \nofficially be dedicated and will feature remarks from Maine's esteemed \nFirst Lady Ann LePage, as well as officers and representatives of USCGC \nAbbie Burgess, USCGC Tackle, USCGC Thunder Bay, USS San Antonio, the \nUnited States Marine Corps, and the Maine Army National Guard.\n  On the occasion of the official dedication of the Midcoast Area \nVeterans Memorial Wall, I convey my deep and abiding appreciation to \nthe many dedicated volunteers who have worked tirelessly over the past \n16 years to bring this day to fruition. This faithful and successful \neffort exemplifies the very best of what it means to be a Mainer and an \nAmerican.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5729-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALLYSON BURNS\n\n Mr. THUNE.

(IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``order'') that takes additional steps with \nrespect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of \nMarch 15, 1995.\n  In Executive Order 12957, the President found that the actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran threaten the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States. To deal with that \nthreat, the President in Executive Order 12957 declared a national \nemergency and imposed prohibitions on certain transactions with respect \nto the development of Iranian petroleum resources. To further respond \nto that threat, Executive Order 12959 of May 6, 1995, imposed \ncomprehensive trade and financial sanctions on Iran. Executive Order \n13059 of August 19, 1997, consolidated and clarified the previous \norders. To take additional steps with respect to the national emergency \ndeclared in Executive Order 12957 and to implement section 105(a) of \nthe Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of \n2010 (Public Law 111-195) (22 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.) (CISADA), I issued \nExecutive Order 553 on September 28, 2010, to impose sanctions on \nofficials of the Government of Iran and other persons acting on behalf \nof the Government of Iran determined to be responsible for or complicit \nin certain serious human rights abuses. To take further additional \nsteps with respect to the threat posed by Iran and to provide \nimplementing authority for a number of the sanctions set forth in the \nIran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172) (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) \n(ISA), as amended by CISADA, I issued Executive Order 13574 on May 23, \n2011, to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to implement certain \nsanctions imposed by the Secretary of State pursuant to ISA, as amended \nby CISADA. I also issued Executive Order 13590 on November 20, 2011, to \ntake additional steps with respect to this emergency by authorizing the \nSecretary of State to impose sanctions on persons providing certain \ngoods, services, technology, or support that contribute either to \nIran's development of petroleum resources or to Iran's production of \npetrochemicals, and to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to \nimplement some of those sanctions. On February 5, 2012, in order to \ntake further additional steps pursuant to this emergency, and to \nimplement section 1245(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81), I issued Executive Order 13599 \nblocking the property of the Government of Iran, all Iranian financial \ninstitutions, and persons determined to be owned or controlled by, or \nacting for or on behalf of, such parties. Most recently, on April 22, \n2012, and May 1, 2012, I issued Executive Orders 13606 and 13608, \nrespectively. Executive Orders 13606 and 13608 each take additional \nsteps with respect to various emergencies, including the emergency \ndeclared in Executive Order 12957 concerning Iran, to address the use \nof computer and information technology to commit serious human rights \nabuses and efforts by foreign persons to evade sanctions.\n  The order takes additional steps with respect to the national \nemergency declared in Executive Order 12957, particularly in light of \nthe Government of Iran's use of revenues from petroleum, petroleum \nproducts, and petrochemicals for illicit purposes; Iran's continued \nattempts to evade international sanctions through deceptive practices; \nand the unacceptable risk posed to the international financial system \nby Iran's activities. Subject to certain exceptions and conditions, the \norder authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \nState, as set forth in the order, to impose sanctions on persons as \ndescribed in the order, all as more fully described below.\n  Section 1 of the order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to impose financial sanctions \non foreign financial institutions determined to have knowingly \nconducted or facilitated certain significant financial transactions \nwith the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) or Naftiran Intertrade \nCompany (NICO), or for the purchase or acquisition of petroleum, \npetroleum products, or petrochemical products from Iran.\n  Section 2 of the order authorizes the Secretary of State, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of \nCommerce, and the United States Trade Representative, and with the \nPresident of the Export-Import Bank, the Chairman of the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, and other agencies and \nofficials as appropriate, to impose any of a number of sanctions on a \nperson upon determining that the person: knowingly engaged in a \nsignificant transaction for the purchase or acquisition of petroleum, \npetroleum products, or petrochemical products from Iran; is a successor \nentity to a person determined to meet the criterion above; owns or \ncontrols a person determined to meet the criterion above, and had \nknowledge that the person engaged in the activities referred to \ntherein; or is owned or controlled by, or under common ownership or \ncontrol with, a person determined to meet the criterion above, and \nknowingly participated in the activities referred to therein.\n  Sections 3 and 4 of the order provide that, for persons determined to \nmeet any of the criteria specified in section 2 of the order, the heads \nof the relevant agencies, in consultation with the Secretary of State, \nshall implement the sanctions imposed by the Secretary of State. The \nsanctions provided for in sections 3 and 4 of the order include the \nfollowing actions: the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank \nshall deny approval of the issuance of any guarantee, insurance, \nextension of credit, or participation in an extension of credit in \nconnection with the export of any goods or services to the sanctioned \nperson; agencies shall not issue any specific license or grant any \nother specific permission or authority under any statute that requires \nthe prior review and approval of the United States Government as a \ncondition for the export or reexport of goods or technology to the \nsanctioned person; for a sanctioned person that is a financial \ninstitution: the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System and the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New \nYork shall take such actions as they deem appropriate, including \ndenying designation, or terminating the continuation of any prior \ndesignation of, the sanctioned person as a primary dealer in United \nStates Government debt instruments; or agencies shall prevent the \nsanctioned person from serving as an agent of the United States \nGovernment or serving as a repository for United States Government \nfunds; agencies shall not procure, or enter into a contract for the \nprocurement of, any goods or services from the sanctioned person; the \nSecretary of the Treasury shall take actions where necessary to: \nprohibit any United States financial institution from making loans or \nproviding credits to the sanctioned person totaling more than \n$10,000,000 in any 12-month period unless such person is engaged in \nactivities to relieve human suffering and the loans or credits are \nprovided for such activities; prohibit any transactions in foreign \nexchange that are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and \nin which the sanctioned person has any interest; prohibit any transfers \nof credit or payments between financial institutions or by, through, or \nto any financial institution, to the extent that such transfers or \npayments are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and \ninvolve any interest of the sanctioned person; block all property and \ninterests in property that are in the United States, that come within \nthe United States, or that are or come within the possession or control \nof any United States person, including any foreign branch, of the \nsanctioned person, and provide that such property and interests in \nproperty may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or \notherwise dealt in; or restrict or\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\nprohibit imports of goods, technology, or services, directly or \nindirectly, into the United States from the sanctioned person.\n  Section 5 of the order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to block all property and \ninterests in property that are in the United States, that come within \nthe United States, or that are or come within the possession or control \nof any United States person, including any foreign branch, of any \nperson upon determining that the person has materially assisted, \nsponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support \nfor, or goods or services in support of, NIOC, NICO, or the Central \nBank of Iran, or the purchase or acquisition of U.S. bank notes or \nprecious metals by the Government of Iran.\n  I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all \npowers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry \nout the purposes of sections 1, 4, and 5 of the order.\n  The order was effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on July \n31, 2012. All agencies of the United States Government are directed to \ntake all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the \nprovisions of the order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, July 30, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5731-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 3457.

The \n     United States of America understands that by its terms the \n     Convention can be read to require broad regulation of private \n     conduct. To the extent it does, the United States of America \n     does not accept any obligation under the Convention to enact \n     legislation or take other measures with respect to private \n     conduct except as mandated by the Constitution and laws of \n     the United States of America.\n       (3) Article 15 of the Convention memorializes existing \n     prohibitions on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment contained in Articles 2 and \n     16 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other \n     Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) \n     and in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights (ICCPR), and further provides that such \n     protections shall be extended on an equal basis with respect \n     to persons with disabilities. To ensure consistency of \n     application, the obligations of the United States of America \n     under Article 15 shall be subject to the same reservations \n     and understandings that apply for the United States of \n     America with respect to Articles 1 and 16 of the CAT and \n     Article 7 of the ICCPR.\n       (b) Understandings.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     to the ratification of the Convention is subject to the \n     following understandings, which shall be included in the \n     instrument of ratification:\n       (1) The United States of America understands that this \n     Convention, including Article 8 thereof, does not authorize \n     or require legislation or other action that would restrict \n     the right of free speech, expression, and association \n     protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States \n     of America.\n       (2) Given that under Article 1 of the Convention ``[t]he \n     purpose of the present Convention is to promote, protect, and \n     ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities,'' with \n     respect to the application of the Convention to matters \n     related to economic, social, and cultural rights, including \n     in Articles 4(2), 24, 25, 27, 28 and 30, the United States of \n     America understands that its obligations in this respect are \n     to prevent discrimination on the basis of disability in the \n     provision of any such rights insofar as they are recognized \n     and implemented under U.S. Federal law.\n       (3) Current U.S. law provides strong protections for \n     persons with disabilities against unequal pay, including the \n     right to equal pay for equal work. The United States of \n     America understands the Convention to require\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\n     the protection of rights of individuals with disabilities on \n     an equal basis with others, including individuals in other \n     protected groups, and does not require adoption of a \n     comparable worth framework for persons with disabilities.\n       (4) Article 27 of the Convention provides that States \n     Parties shall take appropriate steps to afford to individuals \n     with disabilities the right to equal access to equal work, \n     including nondiscrimination in hiring and promotion of \n     employment of persons with disabilities in the public sector. \n     Current interpretation of Section 501 of the Rehabilitation \n     Act of 1973 exempts U.S. Military Departments charged with \n     defense of the national security from liability with regard \n     to members of the uniformed services. The United States of \n     America understands the obligations of Article 27 to take \n     appropriate steps as not affecting hiring, promotion, or \n     other terms or conditions of employment of uniformed \n     employees in the U.S. Military Departments, and that Article \n     27 does not recognize rights in this regard that exceed those \n     rights available under U.S. Federal law.\n       (5) The United States of America understands that the terms \n     ``disability,'' ``persons with disabilities,'' and ``undue \n     burden'' (terms that are not defined in the Convention), \n     ``discrimination on the basis of disability,'' and \n     ``reasonable accommodation'' are defined for the United \n     States of America coextensively with the definitions of such \n     terms pursuant to relevant United States law.\n       (6) The United States of America understands that the \n     Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, \n     established under Article 34 of the Convention, is authorized \n     under Article 36 to ``consider'' State Party Reports and to \n     ``make such suggestions and general recommendations on the \n     report as it may consider appropriate.'' Under Article 37, \n     the committee ``shall give due consideration to ways and \n     means of enhancing national capacities for the implementation \n     of the present Convention.'' The United States of America \n     understands that the Committee on the Rights of Persons with \n     Disabilities has no authority to compel actions by states \n     parties, and the United States of America does not consider \n     conclusions, recommendations, or general comments issued by \n     the committee as constituting customary international law or \n     to be legally binding on the United States in any manner.\n       (7) The United States of America understands that the \n     Convention is a non-discrimination instrument. Therefore, \n     nothing in the Convention, including Article 25, addresses \n     the provision of any particular health program or procedure. \n     Rather, the Convention requires that health programs and \n     procedures are provided to individuals with disabilities on a \n     non-discriminatory basis.\n       (8) The United States of America understands that, for the \n     United States of America, the term or principle of the ``best \n     interests of the child'' as used in Article 7(2), will be \n     applied and interpreted to be coextensive with its \n     application and interpretation under United States law. \n     Consistent with this understanding, nothing in Article 7 \n     requires a change to existing United States law.\n       c. Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     the ratification of the Convention is subject to the \n     following declarations:\n       The United States of America declares that the provisions \n     of the Convention are not self-executing.\n       The Senate declares that, in view of the reservations to be \n     included in the instrument of ratification, current United \n     States law fulfills or exceeds the obligations of the \n     Convention for the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5732-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. \n             Durbin):\n       S. 3459.

A bill to amend the Department of Energy High-End Computing \nRevitalization Act of 2004 to improve the high-end computing research \nand development program of the Department of Energy, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Department \nof Energy High-End Computing Improvement Act of 2012, along with my co-\nsponsors, Senators Alexander and Durbin. This bipartisan bill addresses \nthe need for ongoing high performance computing and the establishment \nof an exascale program within the Department of Energy, DOE.\n  America's leadership in high performance computing, HPC, is essential \nto a vast range of national priorities in science, energy, environment, \nhealth, and national security. For decades the U.S. was the leader in \nHPC through collaborative efforts led by the DOE between national \nlaboratories, academia, and industry. Investments in HPC have \nfacilitated extraordinary scientific and technological advances that \nhave enabled a wide range of simulation and analysis saving time, \nmoney, energy and fuel, which has strengthened the U.S. economy and \ncontributed to national security.\n  U.S. leadership in HPC has recently been challenged through \nsignificant governmental investment in HPC programs in Japan, China, \nSouth Korea, Russia, and the European Union, and the race to exascale \ncomputing is on. Exascale computers will be able to perform 10 to the \n18th power floating point operations per second making them 1000 times \nmore powerful than the most advanced computers today. These new \ncomputers will require the development of new software and computer \narchitectures with improved power consumption, memory, and reliability.\n  This bipartisan bill updates the Department of Energy High-End \nComputing Revitalization Act of 2004 to preserve DOE HPC and to \ndistinguish the exascale initiative from other high-end computing \nefforts. Based on input from the DOE, appropriate funding levels are \nestablished through this bill to support the exascale initiative \nthrough fiscal year 2015. This bill will ensure that the U.S. remains \ncompetitive in the race to exascale and as with previous generations of \nHPC systems, the resulting technological advances will further support \nFederal priorities like research and national security and will be \nintegrated into electronics industries strengthening high-tech \ncompetitiveness and driving economic growth.\n  I would like to conclude by taking a moment to acknowledge the \nexceptional efforts of a few staff members who have worked diligently \nto help craft this important piece of legislation. Jonathan Epstein, a \nformer staff member on my Energy and Natural Resources Committee and \ncurrent staff member on the Armed Services Committee and Jennifer \nNekuda Malik, a AAAS Science Policy Fellow on my Energy and Natural \nResources Committee worked with Neena Imam, a Legislative Fellow on \nSenator Alexander's staff and Tom Craig, a staff member on the \nAppropriations Committee, to update the DOE's high-end computing \nprogram to account for changes since the Department of Energy High-End \nComputing Revitalization Act of 2004 and establish the exascale \ncomputing program. I appreciate the efforts of these staff members and \nI thank them for their work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3459\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor startup businesses to use a portion of the research and development \ncredit to offset payroll taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, to fuel American economic growth and job \ncreation, we have to make sure our tax policy is as smart as the \ninnovators who power our economy.\n  American ingenuity has always been at the core of our economic \nsuccess. Behind nearly every game-changing innovation, from the light \nbulb to the search engine, has been critical research and development \nthat transforms an idea into a market-ready product. The challenges of \nthe global economy may be new, but the solution is the same--supporting \nand sustaining American innovators.\n  That is why I joined with my friend and colleague, the Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Enzi, to draft legislation that gives innovative \nstartup companies the opportunity to take advantage of the successful \nresearch and development tax credit, which would support their efforts \nto invest in innovation and create jobs.\n  Senator Enzi and I are proud to be joined by Senator Schumer of New \nYork and Senator Rubio of Florida in introducing the Startup Innovation \nCredit Act of 2012, which allows qualifying companies to claim the R \ntax credit against their employment taxes instead of their income \ntaxes, thereby opening the credit to new companies who don't yet have \nan income tax liability. We are also grateful to our colleagues in the \nHouse, who are working to introduce a bipartisan companion bill this \nweek.\n  Over the past three decades, the research and development tax credit \nhas helped tens of thousands of successful American companies create \njobs by incentivizing investment in innovation. But with America's \nglobal manufacturing competitiveness at stake, it is time Congress \nshows the same type of support for entrepreneurs and young companies.\n  Small and startup businesses are driving our Nation's economic \nrecovery and creating jobs by taking risks to turn their ideas into \nmarketable products. Over the past few decades, firms that were younger \nthan 5 years old were responsible for the overwhelming majority of new \njobs in this country.\n  The tax code is a powerful tool in the government's toolbox, but tax \ncredits can't help emerging companies that don't yet have tax \nliabilities. That takes the R tax credit off the table for countless \npromising startups and small businesses.\n  Over the last two years, I have talked with dozens of business \nleaders and experts in tax policy to refine an idea to create a new \nsmall business innovation credit that would help those young companies. \nMy commitment to this concept has only strengthened since I introduced \na version of it in my very first bill as a Senator, the Job Creation \nThrough Innovation Act. This work continued, along with Senator Rubio, \nin the subsequent AGREE Act and Startup Act 2.0.\n  The reason I am so doggedly pursuing this idea is because it is \ncritical for young, innovative companies in my home state of Delaware. \nTake, for example, DeNovix, a small company based in Wilmington. With \njust six employees, they design, manufacture and sell laboratory \nequipment that helps scientists innovate and achieve results. As a \nbrand-new company, all of DeNovix' products are in the research and \ndevelopment phase. So at this point, they can't take advantage of the \nR tax credit. A new, innovative company, shut out of support they \nneed at the time they need it most. That seems counterproductive for \nour economy. So let us fix it. Under the Startup Innovation Credit Act \nof 2012, DeNovix and companies like them across Delaware and across the \ncountry could grow and create jobs with the help of the R tax credit.\n  We can't let tough economic times slow down the power of American \ningenuity, especially when history has taught us that now is exactly \nthe time we need to be investing in our innovators. More than half of \nour Fortune 500 companies were launched during a recession or bear \nmarket, so a small business founded this year could become the next \nGeneral Electric or DuPont if it gets the support it needs.\n  America's researchers, business leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs \nare already working to help create jobs and ensure American \ncompetitiveness in the global economy. We just have to support and \nsustain their hard work, and we cannot take the rest of the year off \njust because there is an election coming up. Even in this difficult, \npartisan atmosphere, we have to find ways to work together and get \nthings done.\n  Innovation will drive American economic competitiveness for \ngenerations to come, and our job is to help our innovators and \nentrepreneurs do their jobs. I urge my colleagues to join Senators \nEnzi, Schumer, Rubio and I in strong support of the Startup Innovation \nCredit Act of 2012.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN of Ohio (for himself, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Blumenthal, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 3461. A bill to amend title IV of the Public Health Service Act to \nprovide for a National Pediatric Research Network, including with \nrespect to pediatric rare diseases or conditions; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, over the last few years, our \ncountry has grappled with rising health care costs.\n  While we are making strides, there is one area of health care that is \nlagging behind: pediatric research.\n  Children comprise 20 percept of the U.S. population, but only about 5 \npercent of the National Institutes of Health, NIH, extramural research \nis dedicated to pediatric research.\n  If this rate of investment is not expanded, discoveries of new \ntreatments and therapies for some of the most devastating childhood \ndiseases and conditions will be hindered, and the next generation of \nresearchers will be discouraged from entering into the field of \npediatrics.\n  That is why I have introduced the National Pediatric Research Network \nAct. This act seeks to reverse this trend by strengthening and \nexpanding NIH's investments into pediatric research.\n  This expanded investment will help accelerate new discoveries and \ndirectly affect the health and well-being of children throughout our \nNation.\n  My home State of Ohio is home to world-class researchers at topnotch \nresearch hospitals and universities.\n  We must give these institutions, including Cincinnati Children's, \nRainbow Babies, Children's Hospital, and Nationwide Children's \nHospitals, the resources to partner with other leading researchers \nacross the country.\n  This legislation creates such an opportunity.\n  The centerpiece of the legislation will be the authorization of up to \n20 National Pediatric Research Consortia.\n  They are modeled after the exemplary National Cancer Institute, NCI, \nCenters to help finance efficient and effective, inter-institutional \npediatric research.\n  While NIH is working to advance translational research through \nClinical & Translational Science Awards, those centers are far-reaching \nand focused primarily on adult diseases and clinical research. In \ncontrast, these pediatric centers would be solely dedicated toward \npediatric research.\n  Unlike existing NIH initiatives in which only the largest research \ninstitutions receive funds, the legislation envisions that each center \nwill operate in a ``hub and spoke'' framework with one central academic \ncenter coordinating research and/or clinical work at numerous auxiliary \nsites. Encouraging collaboration can help ensure efficiency.\n  Furthermore, this legislation will encourage research in pediatric \nrare diseases.\n  While each rare disease or disorder affects a small patient \npopulation, it is important to note that 7,000 rare diseases--such as \nepidermolysis bullosa, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, \nDown syndrome, Duchene's muscular dystrophy, and many childhood \ncancers--affect a combined 30 million Americans and their families.\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\n  What is even more devastating is the fact that children with rare \ngenetic diseases account for more than half of the rare disease \npopulation in the United States.\n  As anyone with a rare disease or disorder knows, these patient \npopulations face unique challenges.\n  It is my hope the National Pediatric Research Network Act will \nincrease our understanding of pediatric diseases, improve treatment and \ntherapies, and create better health care outcomes for our nation's \nchildren.\n  I thank Senators Wicker, Whitehouse, Kerry, Blumenthal, and Begich \nfor joining me as original cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 3462. A bill to provide anti-retaliation protections for antitrust \nwhistleblowers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Grassley \nand today introduce the Criminal Antitrust Anti-Retaliation Act. This \nlegislation will provide important protections to employees who come \nforward and disclose to law enforcement price fixing and other criminal \nantitrust behavior that harm consumers. Senator Grassley and I have a \nlong history of working together on whistleblower issues, and I am glad \nwe can continue this partnership today.\n  Whistleblowers are instrumental in alerting the public, Congress, and \nlaw enforcement to wrongdoing. In many cases, their willingness to step \nforward has resulted in important reforms and even saved lives. \nCongress must encourage employees with reasonable beliefs about \ncriminal activity to report such fraud or abuse by offering meaningful \nprotection to those who blow the whistle rather than leaving them \nvulnerable to reprisals.\n  The legislation we introduce today was inspired by a recent report \nand recommendation from the Government Accountability Office which, \nbased on interviews with key stakeholders, found widespread support for \nanti-retaliatory protection in criminal antitrust cases. It is modeled \non the successful anti-retaliation provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley \nAct, and is carefully drafted to ensure that whistleblowers have no \neconomic incentive to bring forth false claims.\n  I have long supported vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws, \nwhich have been called the ``Magna Carta of free enterprise.'' Today's \nlegislation is a necessary complement to them. It has bipartisan \nsupport and was recommended by the Government Accountability Office. I \nurge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3462\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nreduce the incidence of diabetes among Medicare beneficiaries; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleagues, Senator Franken, Senator Lugar, Senator Collins, Senator \nShaheen, Senator Wyden, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Brown of Ohio, \nto introduce an important piece of bipartisan legislation, the Medicare \nDiabetes Prevention Act of 2012. Our legislation makes a wise \ninvestment in seniors' health by extending the proven\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\nsuccess of the National Diabetes Prevention Program to Medicare. Nearly \n26 million American adults have diabetes, and if this disturbing trend \ndoesn't stop, over half of the adult population will either have Type 2 \ndiabetes or its precursor, ``prediabetes,'' by 2020.\n  Sadly, my home State of West Virginia has one of the highest diabetes \nrates in the Nation. In 2009, approximately 174,000 adults, which is 11 \npercent of West Virginia adults, had diabetes. According to Centers for \nDisease Control estimates, as many as 50 percent of the nearly 380,000 \npeople with Medicare in West Virginia may be at risk of developing this \nserious, but preventable, illness. If current trends continue, one in \nthree children born in West Virginia after the year 2000 will develop \ndiabetes within his or her lifetime and people with diabetes risk \ndeveloping terrible complications down the road, including heart \ndisease, stroke, blindness, and amputations.\n  Diabetes is also one of the main cost drivers in our health care \nsystem. The direct economic burden of diabetes was $116 billion for \nmedical expenses and indirect costs totaled $58 billion due to \ndisability, work loss, or premature death in 2007. The costs associated \nwith this preventable disease for Medicare beneficiaries are expected \nto grow to $2 trillion over the 2011 to 2020 period.\n  We simply cannot stand idly by in the face of such overwhelming \nstatistics--and fortunately, there is a way to prevent Type 2 diabetes. \nThe National Diabetes Prevention Program, NDPP, is an innovative \napproach that has demonstrated its effects in preventing the onset of \nType 2 diabetes. The NDPP is a proven, community-based intervention \nthat focuses on changing lifestyle behaviors of prediabetic overweight \nor obese adults through activities that improve dietary choices and \nincrease physical activity in a group setting. In a large-scale \nclinical trial that has been replicated in community settings, NDPP \nsuccessfully reduced the onset of diabetes by 58 percent overall and 71 \npercent in adults over 60.\n  Because of the impressive success of the National Diabetes Prevention \nProgram, I believe our seniors should have access to its benefits. The \nMedicare Diabetes Prevention Act of 2012 will help seniors prevent Type \n2 diabetes by allowing Medicare to provide the National Diabetes \nPrevention Program through community settings like the YMCA, local \nhealth departments, or even the local church, reaching people with \nMedicare wherever they live. In the past, physicians have had few tools \nfor their patients who are found to be at risk of diabetes. Under this \nbill, if a senior is found at risk for diabetes, for example, through \ntheir annual wellness visit, their doctor will be able to refer them to \nan NDPP program in their area.\n  Unlike Medicare, which needs a Federal legislative change to cover \nthis program, State Medicaid programs already have the authority to pay \nfor this innovative initiative, and it is my hope that more states will \ndo so. By 2020, Medicaid is expected to cover 13 million people with \ndiabetes and about 9 million people who may have pre-diabetes, and \nstates will spend an estimated $83 billion on individuals with diabetes \nor pre-diabetes. The National Diabetes Prevention program presents an \nopportunity for States to reduce the incidence of diabetes among \nindividuals enrolled in their Medicaid programs, an especially \nstrategic investment when combined with the expansion of the Medicaid \nprogram under health reform.\n  The coverage of proven solutions under Medicare is nothing new. Yet, \nrather than providing a traditional drug or procedure, NDPP allows at-\nrisk individuals to change their lifestyles through a community \nintervention. Implementing NDPP is a unique response to the alarming \nand escalating rates of diabetes. This public health solution has \ndemonstrated tangible results that can enable our country to prevent \ndiabetes, while reducing health care costs. The NDPP is a strategic and \ncost-effective intervention that costs less than $500 per person to \ndeliver, compared to the estimated $15,000 per year spent on each \nMedicare beneficiary with diabetes. According to the Urban Institute, \nimplementing the NDPP nationally could save $191 billion over the next \n10 years, with 75 percent of the savings, $142.9 billion, going to the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs.\n  Better yet, the National Diabetes Prevention Program is a job \ncreator, bringing diabetes trainers to more communities nationwide to \nprovide the program. West Virginia has already received funding from \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through a Community \nTransformation Grant that will allow the State to train at least 100 \ncommunity health workers to help disseminate the Diabetes Prevention \nProgram in the State over the next 5 years.\n  The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Act has been endorsed by the \nAmerican Diabetes Association, American Heart Association, American \nPublic Health Association, National Association of Chronic Disease \nDirectors, National Association of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman \nPrograms, National Council on Aging, Novo Nordisk, Trust for America's \nHealth, the YMCA of the USA, and State YMCA affiliates in over 45 \nStates. With so many Americans at risk for developing diabetes and its \npotentially severe complications, today is the right time for Medicare \nto extend the proven National Diabetes Prevention Program as a covered \nbenefit to seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this timely and important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota:\n  S. 3464. A bill to amend the Mni Wiconi Project Act of 1988 to \nfacilitate completion of the Mni Wiconi Rural Water Supply System, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I introduced \nlegislation to facilitate completion of the Mni Wiconi Rural Water \nSystem. The Mni Wiconi Project provides quality drinking water to three \nIndian Reservations and a non-tribal rural water system in western \nSouth Dakota that have historically faced insufficient and, in too many \ncases, unsafe drinking water.\n  I have been involved with this project for the entirety of my 25 year \ncongressional career, including sponsoring authorizing legislation that \nwas ultimately enacted in 1988. In authorizing the project, Congress \nfound that the United States has a trust responsibility to ensure that \nadequate and safe water supplies are available to meet the economic, \nenvironmental, water supply, and public health needs of the Pine Ridge \nIndian Reservation, Rosebud Indian Reservation, and Lower Brule Indian \nReservation. With treated drinking water from the Missouri River now \nreaching most of the three reservations, as well as the 7 county area \nof the West River/Lyman-Jones Rural Water System, we are very close to \ncompleting this critically important project.\n  Unfortunately, appropriations have failed to keep pace with projected \ntimelines, and additional costs have cut into construction funding. \nAccordingly, the project requires an increase in the cost ceiling and \nextension of its authorization in order to be completed and serve the \ndesign population. Without an adjustment to the cost ceiling, some \nportions of the Oglala Sioux Rural Water Supply System and Rosebud \nSioux Rural Water System will remain incomplete. The legislation I have \nintroduced today addresses this shortfall and other important aspects \nof the project. The legislation also directs other Federal agencies \nthat support rural water development to assist the Bureau of \nReclamation in improving and repairing existing community water systems \nthat are important components of the project.\n  Our Federal responsibility to address the tremendous need for \nadequate and safe drinking water supplies on the Pine Ridge, Rosebud \nand Lower Brule Indian Reservations remains as important today as it \nwas 25 years ago. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nadvance this modest but important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5737-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5737-S5738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 534--CONGRATULATING THE NAVY DENTAL CORPS ON ITS \n                           100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Armed Services:\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\n                              S.

REPEAL OF OBAMACARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following with respect to \n     the impact of Public Law 111-148 and related provisions of \n     Public Law 111-152 (collectively referred to in this section \n     as ``the law''):\n       (1) President Obama promised the American people that if \n     they liked their current health coverage, they could keep it. \n     But even the Obama Administration admits that tens of \n     millions of Americans are at risk of losing their health care \n     coverage, including as many as 8 in 10 plans offered by small \n     businesses.\n       (2) Despite projected spending of more than two trillion \n     dollars over the next 10 years, cutting Medicare by more than \n     one-half trillion dollars over that period, and increasing \n     taxes by over $800 billion dollars over that period, the law \n     does not lower health care costs. In fact, the law actually \n     makes coverage more expensive for millions of Americans. The \n     average American family already paid a premium increase of \n     approximately $1,200 in the year following passage of the \n     law. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predicts that \n     health insurance premiums for individuals buying private \n     health coverage on their own will increase by $2,100 in 2016 \n     compared to what the premiums would have been in 2016 if the \n     law had not passed.\n       (3) The law cuts more than one-half trillion dollars in \n     Medicare and uses the funds to create a new entitlement \n     program rather than to protect and strengthen the Medicare \n     program. Actuaries at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Services (CMS) warn that the Medicare cuts contained in the \n     law are so drastic that ``providers might end their \n     participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to \n     care for beneficiaries)''. CBO cautioned that the Medicare \n     cuts ``might be difficult to sustain over a long period of \n     time''. According to the CMS actuaries, 7.4 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries who would have been enrolled in a Medicare \n     Advantage plan in 2017 will lose access to their plan because \n     the law cuts $206 billion in payments to Medicare Advantage \n     plans. The Trustees of the Medicare Trust Funds predict that \n     the law will result in a substantial decline in employer-\n     sponsored retiree drug coverage, and 90 percent of seniors \n     will no longer have access to retiree drug coverage by 2016 \n     as a result of the law.\n       (4) The law creates a 15-member, unelected Independent \n     Payment Advisory Board that is empowered to make binding \n     decisions regarding what treatments Medicare will cover and \n     how much Medicare will pay for treatments solely to cut \n     spending, restricting access to health care for seniors.\n       (5) The law and the more than 13,000 pages of related \n     regulations issued before July 11, 2012, are causing great \n     uncertainty, slowing economic growth, and limiting hiring \n     opportunities for the approximately 13 million Americans \n     searching for work. Imposing higher costs on businesses will \n     lead to lower wages, fewer workers, or both.\n       (6) The law imposes 21 new or higher taxes on American \n     families and businesses, including 12 taxes on families \n     making less than $250,000 a year.\n       (7) While President Obama promised that nothing in the law \n     would fund elective abortion, the law expands the role of the \n     Federal Government in funding and facilitating abortion and \n     plans that cover abortion. The law appropriates billions of \n     dollars in new funding without explicitly prohibiting the use \n     of these funds for abortion, and it provides Federal \n     subsidies for health plans covering elective abortions. \n     Moreover, the law effectively forces millions of individuals \n     to personally pay a separate abortion premium in violation of \n     their sincerely held religious, ethical, or moral beliefs.\n       (8) Until enactment of the law, the Federal Government has \n     not sought to impose specific coverage or care requirements \n     that infringe on the rights of conscience of insurers, \n     purchasers of insurance, plan sponsors, beneficiaries, and \n     other stakeholders, such as individual or institutional \n     health care providers. The law creates a new nationwide \n     requirement for health plans to cover ``essential health \n     benefits'' and ``preventive services'', but does not allow \n     stakeholders to opt out of covering items or services to \n     which they have a religious or moral objection, in violation \n     of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (Public Law 103-\n     141). By creating new barriers to health insurance and \n     causing the loss of existing insurance arrangements, these \n     inflexible mandates jeopardize the ability of institutions \n     and individuals to exercise their rights of conscience and \n     their ability to freely participate in the health insurance \n     and health care marketplace.\n       (9) The law expands government control over health care, \n     adds trillions of dollars to existing liabilities, drives \n     costs up even further, and too often put Federal bureaucrats, \n     instead of doctors and patients, in charge of health care \n     decisionmaking.\n       (10) The path to patient-centered care and lower costs for \n     all Americans must begin with a full repeal of the law.\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\n       (b) Repeal.--\n       (1) PPACA.--Effective as of the enactment of Public Law \n     111-148, such Act (other than subsection (d) of section 1899A \n     of the Social Security Act, as added and amended by sections \n     3403 and 10320 of such Public Law) is repealed, and the \n     provisions of law amended or repealed by such Act (other than \n     such subsection (d)) are restored or revived as if such Act \n     had not been enacted.\n       (2) Health care-related provisions in the health care and \n     education reconciliation act of 2010.--Effective as of the \n     enactment of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act \n     of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), title I and subtitle B of title \n     II of such Act are repealed, and the provisions of law \n     amended or repealed by such title or subtitle, respectively, \n     are restored or revived as if such title and subtitle had not \n     been enacted.\n\n     SEC. __.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A report from the Bipartisan Policy Center's Cyber \n     Security Task Force, published in July 2012, found that--\n       (A) 50,000 cyber attacks were reported to the Department of \n     Homeland Security between October 2011 and February 2012; and\n       (B) 86 of the attacks described in subparagraph (A) took \n     place on critical infrastructure networks.\n       (2) The report of the Commission on Cybersecurity for the \n     44th President from the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies (referred to in this subsection as \n     ``CSIS''), published in November 2010, concluded that the \n     United States is facing an imminent crisis in cybersecurity \n     human capital.\n       (3) The November 2010 CSIS report cited another CSIS \n     report, entitled ``A Human Capital Crisis in Cybersecurity'', \n     which estimated that 1,000 specialists who had the \n     specialized cybersecurity skills needed to defend the United \n     States effectively in cyberspace existed in the United \n     States, but the number of cybersecurity specialists needed \n     that year was between 10,000 and 30,000.\n       (4) Another report published by CSIS, entitled \n     ``Cybersecurity Two Years Later'', noted that ``there has \n     been slow progress in changing the situation from where we \n     were two years ago''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     recognizing that the United States is currently facing a \n     human capital crisis in cybersecurity, the President should--\n       (1) develop model standards, in coordination with any \n     existing standards, for nonprofit institutions that provide \n     training programs to develop advanced technical proficiency \n     for individuals seeking careers in computer network defense;\n       (2) emphasize experiential learning and the opportunity to \n     take on significant real-world casework as essential parts of \n     training and development programs for cybersecurity \n     professions;\n       (3) recognize institutions which develop advanced technical \n     proficiency and provide real-world casework for individuals \n     seeking careers in computer network defense as examples of \n     excellence in specialized cybersecurity training;\n       (4) employ resources to support nonprofit institutions to \n     expand the cybersecurity human capital capacity of the United \n     States, particularly by supporting or establishing education \n     and training programs which--\n       (A) demonstrate current and projected caseload of \n     sufficient, important system and network defense activity to \n     provide real-world training opportunities for trainees, with \n     a heavy emphasis on real-life, hands-on, high-level \n     cybersecurity work;\n       (B) demonstrate practical computer network defense skills \n     and up-to-date cybersecurity experience of the senior staff \n     proposing to lead the education and training programs;\n       (C) demonstrate access to hands-on training programs in the \n     most up-to-date computer network defense technologies and \n     techniques; and\n       (D) collaborate with the Federal Government and private \n     sector companies in the United States in such programs; and\n       (5) establish a program recognizing citizens who have \n     demonstrated outstanding leadership and service as mentors in \n     the field of cybersecurity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2687.

SENSE OF SENATE ON APPOINTMENT BY THE ATTORNEY \n                   GENERAL OF AN OUTSIDE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO \n                   INVESTIGATE CERTAIN RECENT LEAKS OF APPARENTLY \n                   CLASSIFIED AND HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON \n                   UNITED STATES MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE PLANS, \n                   PROGRAMS, AND OPERATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over the past few weeks, several publications have been \n     released that cite several highly sensitive United States \n     military and intelligence counterterrorism plans, programs, \n     and operations.\n       (2) These publications appear to be based in substantial \n     part on unauthorized disclosures of classified information.\n       (3) The unauthorized disclosure of classified information \n     is a felony under Federal law.\n       (4) The identity of the sources in these publications \n     include senior administration officials, participants in \n     these reported plans, programs, and operations, and current \n     American officials who spoke anonymously about these reported \n     plans, programs, and operations because they remain \n     classified, parts of them are ongoing, or both.\n       (5) Such unauthorized disclosures may inhibit the ability \n     of the United States to employ the same or similar plans, \n     programs, or operations in the future; put at risk the \n     national security of the United States and the safety of the \n     men and women sworn to protect it; and dismay our allies.\n       (6) Under Federal law, the Attorney General may appoint an \n     outside special counsel when an investigation or prosecution \n     would present a conflict of interest or other extraordinary \n     circumstances and when doing so would serve the public \n     interest.\n       (7) Investigations of unauthorized disclosures of \n     classified information are ordinarily conducted by the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation with assistance from \n     prosecutors in the National Security Division of the \n     Department of Justice.\n       (8) There is precedent for officials in the National \n     Security Division of the Department of Justice to recuse \n     itself from such investigations to avoid even the appearance \n     of impropriety or undue influence, and it appears that there \n     have been such recusals with respect to the investigation of \n     at least one of these unauthorized disclosures.\n       (9) Such recusals are indicative of the serious \n     complications already facing the Department of Justice in \n     investigating these matters.\n       (10) The severity of the national security implications of \n     these disclosures; the imperative for investigations of these \n     disclosures to be conducted independently so as to avoid even \n     the appearance of impropriety or undue influence; and the \n     need to conduct these investigations expeditiously to ensure \n     timely mitigation constitute extraordinary circumstances.\n       (11) For the foregoing reasons, the appointment of an \n     outside special counsel would serve the public interest.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Attorney General should--\n       (A) delegate to an outside special counsel all of the \n     authority of the Attorney General with respect to \n     investigations by the Department of Justice of any and all \n     unauthorized disclosures of classified and highly sensitive \n     information related to various United States military and \n     intelligence plans, programs, and operations reported in \n     recent publications; and\n       (B) direct an outside special counsel to exercise that \n     authority independently of the supervision or control of any \n     officer of the Department of Justice;\n       (2) under such authority, the outside special counsel \n     should investigate any and all unauthorized disclosures of \n     classified and highly sensitive information on which such \n     recent publications were based and, where appropriate, \n     prosecute those responsible; and\n       (3) the President should assess--\n       (A) whether any such unauthorized disclosures of classified \n     and highly sensitive information damaged the national \n     security of the United States; and\n       (B) how such damage can be mitigated.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2698.

or\n       (ii) if the covered entity owns or possesses data in \n     electronic form containing personal information of fewer than \n     10,000 individuals and direct notification is not feasible \n     due to excessive cost to the covered entity required to \n     provide such notification relative to the resources of such \n     covered entity, as determined in accordance with the \n     regulations issued by the Commission under paragraph (3)(A).\n       (B) Method of substitute notification.--Substitute \n     notification under this paragraph shall include--\n       (i) conspicuous and clearly identified notification by e-\n     mail to the extent the covered entity has an e-mail address \n     for an individual who is entitled to notification under \n     subsection (a)(1);\n       (ii) conspicuous and clearly identified notification on the \n     Internet Web site of the covered entity if the covered entity \n     maintains an Internet Web site;

or\n       (ii) by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that \n     notification of the breach of security could be reasonably \n     expected to cause damage to the national security; and\n       (B) the United States Secret Service or the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation, as the case may be, provides written notice \n     of its determination under subparagraph (A) to the covered \n     entity.\n       (2) United states secret service.--If the United States \n     Secret Service invokes an exemption under paragraph (1), the \n     United States Secret Service shall submit written \n     justification for invoking the exemption to the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security before the exemption is invoked.\n       (3) Federal bureau of investigation.--If the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation invokes an exemption under paragraph (1), \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall submit written \n     justification for invoking the exemption to the U.S. Attorney \n     General before the exemption is invoked.\n       (4) Immunity.--No cause of action shall lie in any court \n     against any Federal agency for acts relating to the exemption \n     from notification for national security or law enforcement \n     purposes under this title.\n       (5) Reports.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and upon request by Congress \n     thereafter, the United States Secret Service and Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation shall submit to Congress a report on \n     the number and nature of breaches of security subject to the \n     exemptions for national security and law enforcement purposes \n     under this subsection.\n       (i) Financial Fraud Prevention Exemption.--\n       (1) In general.--A covered entity shall be exempt from the \n     requirements under this section if the covered entity \n     utilizes or participates in a security program that--\n       (A) effectively blocks the use of the personal information \n     to initiate an unauthorized financial transaction before it \n     is charged to the account of the individual;

After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli \n     that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult \n     human, for example, by recoiling.\n       (3) In the unborn child, application of such painful \n     stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress \n     hormones known as the stress response.\n       (4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with \n     long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered \n     pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and \n     learning disabilities later in life.\n       (5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal \n     anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a \n     decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when \n     painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia.\n       (6) The position, asserted by some medical experts, that \n     the unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a \n     point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization \n     predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to \n     experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires \n     nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. \n     However, recent medical research and analysis, especially \n     since 2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion that \n     a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain.\n       (7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born \n     missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with \n     hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.\n       (8) In adult humans and in animals, stimulation or ablation \n     of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while \n     stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.\n       (9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for \n     pain processing in early development differ from those of \n     adults, using different neural elements available at specific \n     times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to \n     fulfill the role of pain processing.\n       (10) The position, asserted by some commentators, that the \n     unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state that \n     precludes the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent \n     with the documented reaction of unborn children to painful \n     stimuli and with the experience of fetal surgeons who have \n     found it necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia \n     to prevent the unborn child from\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\n     engaging in vigorous movement in reaction to invasive \n     surgery.\n       (11) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence \n     that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least \n     by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.\n       (12) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert a \n     compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of \n     unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical \n     evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.\n       (13) The compelling governmental interest in protecting the \n     lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial \n     medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling \n     pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the \n     compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of \n     unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither \n     governmental interest is intended to replace the other.\n       (14) The District Council of the District of Columbia, \n     operating under authority delegated by Congress, repealed all \n     limitations on abortion at any stage of pregnancy, effective \n     April 29, 2004.\n       (15) Article I, section 8 of the Constitution of the United \n     States of America provides that the Congress shall ``exercise \n     exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever'' over the \n     District established as the seat of government of the United \n     States, now known as the District of Columbia. The \n     constitutional responsibility for the protection of pain-\n     capable unborn children within the Federal District resides \n     with the Congress.\n       (c) District of Columbia Pain-capable Unborn Child \n     Protection.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 74 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 1531 the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 1532.

In order to ensure NATO's permanent and \n     unfettered access to cyberspace and integrity of its critical \n     systems, we will take into account the cyber dimension of \n     modern conflicts in NATO's doctrine and improve its \n     capabilities to detect, assess, prevent, defend and recover \n     in case of a cyber-attack against systems of critical \n     importance to the Alliance.''\n       (2) In an April 2012 speech, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton stated, ``There is a steady drumbeat of [cyber] \n     attacks on governments, on businesses, on all kinds of \n     networks every single day. And we have to be in a position to \n     protect ourselves and, under Article 5, protect our NATO \n     partners.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration \nof S. Res. 525 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 525) honoring the life and legacy of \n     Oswaldo Paya Sardinas.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to speak about Oswaldo \nPaya, a Cuban dissident, and his untimely death in Cuba in a supposed \nautomobile accident. The Cuban people, indeed all freedom-loving people \nof the world, have recently lost a great advocate for freedom. He was \nsomeone who was in peaceful opposition to the tyranny that is on the \nisland of Cuba.\n  Oswaldo Paya died in a car crash on Sunday, July 22. He was just 60 \nyears old. Another Cuban dissident, Harold Cepero, was also killed in \nthe accident, and two European politicians, one from Spain and one from \nSweden, were injured. Paya was one of Cuba's best known dissidents. He \npushed for civil and human rights. He pushed for an end to one-party \nrule. He pushed for freedom for political prisoners. And he pushed for \nsupport for private businesses. In 2002, his Varela Project delivered \nmore than 24,000 verifiable signatures in support of these ideals to \nthe Cuban Government. It was the largest petition drive in Cuban \nhistory. Paya bravely led this initiative at great risk to himself, to \nhis loved ones, and to his colleagues. For his work, he received the \nEuropean Parliaments' Sakarov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2002, and \nhe was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n  The reason I am bringing this up, other than pointing out that planet \nEarth has lost a friend for freedom, is to note that the circumstances \nof the car accident are the topic of some debate. Cuban officials \ninsist the driver was speeding and that he lost control and he hit a \ntree. But others are saying that witnesses saw another vehicle hit Mr. \nPaya's vehicle and drive it off the road. Paya's daughter Rosa Maria \nsays she holds the Cuban Government responsible. She has told CNN en \nEspanol that ``we think it's not an accident. They wanted to do harm \nand then ended up killing my father.'' That is a direct quote.\n  Paya's loved ones and the Cuban people and the international \ncommunity deserve to have all the facts surrounding this tragic event \nexamined and put out in the public. That is why I have submitted, along \nwith a number of our colleagues, S. Res. 525, which honors the life, \nlegacy, and exemplary leadership of Oswaldo Paya. This resolution also \ncalls on the Cuban Government to allow an impartial third-party \ninvestigation into the accident. I urge the Senate to unanimously pass \nthis resolution.\n  This request comes on the heels of other disturbing news out of Cuba. \nWe have learned that more than 40 prodemocracy activists were detained \nafter Paya's funeral last Tuesday. The reason? They dared to shout \n``libertad'' at that time--``freedom''--during the ceremony. Reports \nalso indicate that several of the dissidents were severely beaten.\n  These peaceful activists were only honoring one of their own and they \nended up as victims of an authoritarian regime. Now more than ever \nbefore the United States must continue policies that promote the \nfundamental principles of political freedom, democracy, and human \nrights, to all of which Oswaldo Paya devoted his life.\n  Senator Durbin, we are quite concerned the Castro regime continues to \nhold an American hostage, Alan Gross. Once again, another Senator rises \nto urge the Cuban regime in the strongest possible terms to immediately \nand unconditionally release him.\n  We will never forget Paya's passion and dedication to freedom and \nfaith. The least the regime can do is to release Alan Gross.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I further ask that the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, which is at the desk, \nbe agreed to; the resolution, as amended, be agreed to; the preamble be \nagreed to; the motions to reconsider be made and laid upon the table, \nwith no interviewing action or debate, and that any statements relating \nto the measure be printed in the Record at the appropriate place as if \nread.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2740) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To condemn the Government of Cuba for the detention of nearly \n 50 pro-democracy activists following the memorial service for Oswaldo \n                             Paya Sardinas)\n\n       On page 4, line 13, strike ``; and'' and insert a \n     semicolon.\n       On page 4, line 17, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       On page 4, after line 17, insert the following:\n       (7) condemns the Government of Cuba for the detention of \n     nearly 50 pro-democracy activists following the memorial \n     service for Oswaldo Paya Sardinas.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 525), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 525\n\n       Whereas, on Sunday, July 22, 2012, 60-year-old Cuban \n     dissident and activist Oswaldo Paya Sardinas died in a car \n     crash in Bayamo, Cuba;\n       Whereas at a young age, Oswaldo Paya Sardinas criticized \n     the communist government in Cuba, which led to his \n     imprisonment at a work camp on Cuba's Isle of Youth in 1969;\n       Whereas, in 1988, Oswaldo Paya Sardinas founded the \n     Christian Liberation Movement as a nondenominational \n     political organization to further civil and human rights in \n     Cuba;\n       Whereas, in 1992, Oswaldo Paya Sardinas announced his \n     intention to run as a candidate to be a representative on the \n     National Assembly of Popular Power of Cuba and, 2 days before \n     the election, was detained by police at his home and \n     determined by Communist Party officials to be ineligible to \n     run for office because he was not a member of the Communist \n     Party;\n       Whereas, in 1997, Oswaldo Paya Sardinas collected hundreds \n     of signatures to support his candidacy to the National \n     Assembly of Popular Power, which was rejected by the \n     electoral commission of Cuba;\n       Whereas the Constitution of Cuba supposedly guarantees the \n     right to a national referendum on any proposal that achieves \n     10,000 or more signatures from citizens of Cuba who are \n     eligible to vote;\n       Whereas, in 1998, Oswaldo Paya Sardinas and other leaders \n     of the Christian Liberation Movement created the Varela \n     Project, a signature drive to secure a national referendum on \n     ``convert[ing] into law, the right of freedom of speech, the \n     freedom of press and freedom of enterprise'';\n       Whereas, in May 2002, the Varela Project delivered 11,020 \n     signatures from eligible citizens of Cuba to the National \n     Assembly of Popular Power, calling for an end to 4 decades of \n     one-party rule, to which the Government of Cuba responded by \n     beginning its own referendum that made Cuba's socialist \n     system ``irrevocable'', even after an additional 14,000 \n     signatures were added to the Varela Project petition;\n       Whereas the Varela Project is the largest civil society-led \n     petition in the history of Cuba;\n       Whereas Oswaldo Paya Sardinas bravely led the Varela \n     Project at great risk to himself, his loved ones, and his \n     associates;\n       Whereas, in March 2003, the Government of Cuba arrested 75 \n     human rights activists, including 25 members of the Varela \n     Project, in the crackdown known as Cuba's ``Black Spring'';\n       Whereas Oswaldo Paya Sardinas's dedication to freedom and \n     faith earned him the Sakarov Prize for Freedom of Thought \n     from the European Parliament in 2002;\n       Whereas Oswaldo Paya Sardinas received the W. Averell \n     Harriman Democracy Award from the United States National \n     Democratic Institute for International Affairs in 2003;\n       Whereas Oswaldo Paya Sardinas was nominated for the Nobel \n     Peace Prize by Vaclav Havel, the former president of the \n     Czech Republic, in 2005; and\n       Whereas President Barack Obama stated, ``We continue to be \n     inspired by Paya's vision and dedication to a better future \n     for Cuba, and believe that his example and moral leadership \n     will endure.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the life and exemplary leadership \n     of Oswaldo Paya Sardinas;\n       (2) offers heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, \n     and loved ones of Oswaldo Paya Sardinas;\n       (3) praises the bravery of Oswaldo Paya Sardinas and his \n     colleagues for collecting more than 11,000 verified \n     signatures in support of the Varela Project;\n       (4) in memory of Oswaldo Paya Sardinas, calls on the United \n     States to continue policies that promote respect for the \n     fundamental principles of religious freedom, democracy, and \n     human rights in Cuba, in a\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\n     manner consistent with the aspirations of the people of Cuba;\n       (5) in memory of Oswaldo Paya Sardinas, calls on the \n     Government of Cuba to provide its citizens with \n     internationally accepted standards for civil and human rights \n     and the opportunity to vote in free and fair elections;\n       (6) calls on the Government of Cuba to allow an impartial, \n     third-party investigation into the circumstances surrounding \n     the death of Oswaldo Paya Sardinas; and\n       (7) condemns the Government of Cuba for the detention of \n     nearly 50 pro-democracy activists following the memorial \n     service for Oswaldo Paya Sardinas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/31/senate-section/article/S5803-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 1, 2012\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.
