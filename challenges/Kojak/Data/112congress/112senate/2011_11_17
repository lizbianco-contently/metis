This week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, \nknown as the watchdog of the Senate, confirmed what Democrats have been \nsaying for months--that the so-called Republican jobs plan isn't much \nof a plan and it wouldn't create any jobs.\n  The Congressional Budget Office report analyzed different approaches \nto spurring economic growth and jobs proposed by both parties. Among \nthe top job creators were Democratic proposals to extend unemployment \nbenefits and cut middle-class taxes. But when the CBO looked at the GOP \nplan to eliminate safeguards that protect lives, save money, and shield \nthe environment, it concluded that the idea was a flop. The study \nconcluded that the effects of the changes the Republicans propose would \nbe negligible at best and at worst could actually lower economic growth \nand slow hiring.\n  Although their plan would have no positive effect on our economy, the \nRepublicans want to gut the safeguards that saved hundreds of thousands \nof lives just last year alone. Although their plan could potentially \nslow economic growth, they want to gut the safeguards that save \nAmerican companies and consumers $1.3 trillion each year by increasing \nproductivity and reducing medical bills. Nonpartisan experts agree this \nis not the road to recovery. They also agree with Democrats that \nputting money back into the pockets of middle-income families and small \nbusinesses with tax credits and refunds and extending unemployment \nbenefits is the most efficient way to get Americans working again to \nturn our economy around. Families who have more money to spend will \npump it back into the economy. Businesses that have more money to spend \nwill hire new workers. At a time where we need to conserve every dollar \nand get the most bang for the buck, these proposals do more with less.\n  As we continue to discuss ways to combat high unemployment in the \ncoming months, it would behoove my Republican colleagues to remember \nthat not all proposals are created equally. When we consider our next \njobs bill in December, my Republican friends will once again face a \nchoice: We can cling to ideological proposals we know won't work or \nthey can join forces with Democrats to pass proposals we know will \ncreate jobs. I hope the Republicans prove to be more interested in \ngetting results than in getting their way.\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7634-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Over the past few weeks, I have repeatedly come to the \nfloor to highlight the good work Republicans in the House have been \ndoing in identifying jobs legislation on which the two parties can \nactually agree. At last count, House Republicans had passed 22 jobs \nbills which were designed not only to incentivize the private sector to \ncreate jobs but which were also designed to attract strong bipartisan \nsupport. In other words, House Republicans have been designing jobs \nlegislation that could actually pass. They have been legislating with \nan eye toward making a difference instead of just making a point.\n  I have been encouraging the Democratic majority here in the Senate to \nfollow the House's lead, take up these bipartisan jobs bills, pass them \nhere in the Senate, and send them to the President for signature. That \nway we would actually be helping to create jobs, and we would send a \nmessage to the American people that we can actually do something many \nof them think we don't do enough of around here; that is, work \ntogether.\n  This morning, I would like to call on my Democratic colleagues once \nagain to take me up on the offer. Once we get back from Thanksgiving, \nlet's take up these bipartisan bills that have already passed the \nHouse, pass them here in the Senate, and send them down to the \nPresident for signature. We showed we can do it last week when we \nworked together to pass Senator Brown's 3 percent withholding bill and \nSenator Murray's Veterans bill. In fact, yesterday the House passed \nthis legislation 422 to 0, sending it to the White House for the \nPresident's signature. So I would like to call on the President this \nmorning to invite Senator Brown down to the White House for the signing \nceremony, which would show the American people that cooperation is, \nindeed, possible when the Senate focuses on bipartisan job-creation \nsolutions.\n  Let's continue to build off that momentum and do more. Many of the \nbipartisan House-passed bills already have companion or similar \nlegislation here in the Senate. There is no reason we can't start to \ntake them up as soon as we get back. There is a lot we could do.\n  Yesterday, I highlighted a bill by Senator Collins, the EPA \nRegulatory Relief Act. It has strong support from both Republicans and \nDemocrats right here in the Senate, including 12 Democratic cosponsors. \nLet's pass it. The House-passed version of this bill passed \noverwhelmingly. It got more than 40 Democratic votes. It is supported \nby more than 300 business groups, including the American Forest and \nPaper Association, the National Association of Manufacturing, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, \nand the Business Roundtable. According to one estimate, this bill could \nsave more than 200,000 jobs and provide greater certainty for \nbusinesses that are asking us for it. The EPA has asked for more time. \nBoth parties support it. Let's pass it.\n  Once we pass that bill, we should take up the four other bipartisan \nHouse-passed bills I highlighted last week. These four bills would help \nbusinesses raise capital, expand their businesses, and create more \njobs. They all passed with bipartisan support over in the House. We \nhave bipartisan companion or similar legislation right here in the \nSenate. What is the holdup? Let's pass these bills too.\n  There is the Small Company Capital Formation Act, cosponsored by \nSenators Tester and Toomey. Its companion legislation got 183 \nDemocratic votes in the House. Let's pass it.\n  There is the Community Bank Resource Improvement Act, cosponsored by \nSenators Hutchison and Pryor. Its companion legislation in the House \ngot 184 Democrats. Let's take it up and pass it.\n  There is the Private Company Flexibility and Growth Act, cosponsored \nby Senators Toomey and Carper. Let's pass it.\n  There is the Democratizing Access to Capital Act, sponsored by \nSenator Scott Brown. A similar bill in the House passed with 407 votes, \nincluding 169 from Democrats. Let's pass it.\n  There is the Access to Capital for Job Creators Act, cosponsored by \nSenator Thune. It passed the House with 413 votes, including 175 \nDemocrats. Let's pass it.\n  And we shouldn't stop there. As I see it, there is no reason we \nshouldn't take up every one of these bipartisan bills that have already \npassed the House once we get back and pass them, one by one. They all \npassed the House on a bipartisan basis. They all help the private \nsector create jobs. There is no good reason we shouldn't take up all \nthese bills and pass them right here in the Senate because if we can't \npass jobs legislation on which we all agree, then what are we going to \npass? This should be a layup.\n  The Republican House has done its job. It is time for the Senate to \nact. Let's do what the American people expect us to do. Let's take up \nthese jobs bills when we return, pass them, and send them down to the \nPresident for signature. Let's do the work we were sent here to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7634-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, once again we find ourselves in a too \nfamiliar position. Secret meetings over the financial future of our \ncountry are being held as we head toward the final hours--really final \nminutes as has been the pattern around here--of an agreement that will \nbe produced for us and expected to be passed by a committee of 12. It \nis less than a week until the deadline and no language has been made \npublic.\n  The American people should be able to make their voice heard before \nthe committee votes because the truth is, once that vote happens there \nwill be no opportunity to change their product. It will be up or down, \nthe train will have left the station. The bill will, hopefully, be a \ngood bill that can pass but we will not have any opportunity to amend \nit.\n  That is not the way Congress was set up to work. I happened to catch, \nthis morning, a statement by former Secretary of Defense under \nPresident Bush and President Obama, Robert Gates. This is a statement \nhe made in an interview:\n\n       I think, frankly, the creation of this supercommittee was a \n     complete abdication of responsibility on the part of \n     Congress. It basically says, ``This is too hard for us. Give \n     us a BRAC. Give us a package where all I have to do is vote \n     it up or vote it down and I don't have to take any personal \n     responsibility for the tough decisions.'' So now we are left \n     with this Sword of Damocles hanging over the government, \n     hanging over defense, and if these cuts are automatically \n     made, I think the results for our national security will be a \n     catastrophe.\n\n  That is what the former Secretary of Defense said recently.\n  Admiral Mullen, when asked about this in response to a question I \nasked him at the Armed Services Committee--the then-Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs said, if this sequester takes place:\n\n       It has a good chance of breaking us and putting us in a \n     position of not keeping faith with this all volunteer force \n     that has fought two wars. . . . It will impose a heavy \n     penalty on developing equipment for the future, and it will \n     hollow us out.\n\n  One of the reasons I am here this morning is to issue a warning and \ncall attention to some matters that I believe are important. People \nwill make many promises about what this deal will be about if it passes \nand they reach an agreement. Hopefully they will reach an agreement \nthat is one that can be honestly defended and we\n\n[[Page S7635]]\n\nwill all be happy to vote for it. But what we have seen so far \nindicates that secret deals, while they remain secret, are promoted to \nbe far better than they are when you begin to see what is in them. The \ndevil will always be in the details.\n\n  Yesterday on the floor I spoke about the Budget Control Act disaster \nfunding gimmick. Over 10 years, the cumulative cost of this gimmick \nwill be about $140 billion to the Treasury, including interest. Done \nwith just a few words tucked into the bill, people did not understand \nthe effect of disaster provisions. It came out in the eleventh hour \ninto the final agreement and people voted on it without fully \nunderstanding what it meant. So just a few words can dramatically alter \nthe future fiscal situation of our country.\n  The record of broken promises is long, improvident promises about \nwhat a bill would do. Many deals have been proposed that have promised \nserious spending cuts and minimal tax increases only for the reverse to \nbe actually true.\n  Let me run down a brief list: The President's budget, submitted \nearlier this year, was accompanied with the President's claim that it \n``does not add to our debt.'' Clearly, one of the most dramatic, \nerroneous, blatantly false statements ever issued by a President of the \nUnited States. The reality is, that budget would double the debt of the \nUnited States in 11 years. That budget would have as its lowest single \nannual deficit, according to CBO, an annual deficit of $724 billion \nwith deficits in the years 8, 9, 10 up to $1 trillion again. It \nincreased spending, it increased taxes, and it increased the debt more \nthan if we had done nothing.\n  Then the Senate Democrats talked about a budget I called a phantom \nbudget. We have not had one in the Senate for 932 days. So they talked \nabout a budget, and they made some claims, but we never saw it in \ndetail--never saw the detail. But they claimed it had $2 trillion in \nspending cuts and $2 trillion in tax hikes, $1 of tax hikes for every \n$1 of spending cuts.\n  The President, earlier this year, acknowledged that we should have $3 \nof spending cuts for every $1 of tax increases. Of course, that has \nbeen abandoned now. But the reality was that the phantom budget was \ntalked about but never produced--but an outline was produced--actually \nadded, we think, $2 in tax hikes for every $1 in spending cuts.\n  Then, Senator Reid, during the effort to raise the debt limit, his \nrevised proposal claimed $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction. The \nreality was they were counting $1.1 trillion in savings from war costs \nbecause the CBO assumes that war costs would be the same for 10 years. \nIt was never going to be the same for 10 years. We are always going to \nbring the war costs down as soon as possible. It is a phony claim that \nwe should reduce spending by $1 trillion by claiming credit for war \ncosts that we are on a steadfast path and have been to reduce.\n  The President's supercommittee proposal that he submitted to this \ncommittee of 12 claims $2 in cuts for every $1 in taxes. But the \nreality, as we see it, there are no real cuts and 100 percent of the \nreduction will come from more taxes, more spending, more debt so far. \nSo if this committee proposes a solution and asks us to vote for it, \nhere are some things we should look for and not be happy with, if they \nare in the bill. The pattern has been--I would say for the promoters of \nthese agreements--to spin them to sound better than they are.\n  One of the things we should look out for are claims of spending \nreductions that occur by setting a cap on war spending, as I indicated. \nThe money was never going to be spent. Some are claiming $1 trillion in \nsavings from that and it should not be counted. Another thing we would \nlook at are front-loaded promises, front-loaded revenue increases, tax \nincreases that occur now along with back-loaded promises of spending \ncuts in the future--in the outyears then they claim these savings. But \nthe pattern around here is that once a tax increase is passed, it is \nthere, but a promise of a spending cut in the future very often does \nnot become a reality. We know that. That is the pattern that has put us \nin such a desperate financial condition today, just that kind of \nactivity. So whatever happens this time, this cannot be part of the \nprocess.\n  We need to watch for a plan that would rely on directions to standing \ncommittees in the House and Senate to, at some point in the future, \nproduce legislation that might reduce entitlement spending and/or would \nraise revenue.\n  These committees have not followed through on that in the past, and \nthe supercommittee's directions to them, we have to know, are not \nlikely to occur based on history around here. That is the historic \nreality. Just directing a committee to raise taxes or cut spending does \nnot at all mean they are going to do it.\n  Another thing we need to watch out for is if the committee makes \nunrealistic cuts to programs without reforming those programs, such as \nthe current assumed annual cuts that are in law today to health care \nproviders, doctors, and hospitals to cut their reimbursement rates. \nCongress knows we cannot go forward with those cuts, and they have been \navoided every year by borrowing money to pay to avoid very serious cuts \nto our providers that, if not paid, would quit doing Medicare and \nMedicaid work. Doctors don't have to do that. It is just at a point we \ncannot cut providers anymore.\n  Another thing we need to watch out for is a plan that assumes \nunrealistic changes to the Congressional Budget Office baseline. One of \nthe things is to assert overly optimistic economic growth projections \nfor the next 10 years. More and more we are hearing that coming out of \nthis recession is going to be a long, tough, slow slog. If we want to \nspend more money and claim to have a budget that improves our financial \nsituation, one way to do it is to just assume more growth than is \nactually going to occur, that the experts don't believe will actually \noccur. If we do that, that is phony accounting. Our numbers may look \nbetter today but not as the years go by. That is the kind of thinking \nthat has gotten us in the deep debt hole we are in today.\n  Another thing to watch out for is the claim that interest savings \nderived from tax increases are spending cuts. Interest expense--and it \nis substantial for our country--is a byproduct of spending and taxes. \nIf you drive up debt, our interest payment will go up. If we raise \ntaxes and reduce the deficit, then interest rates drop. We can't count \nthe interest reduction as a spending cut. That is not cutting any real \nspending. That is just avoiding a future interest growth that would \nhave occurred if we haven't done it. I don't think we should count--and \nwe must not count--interest reductions either from tax increases or \nspending cuts as a spending cut.\n  I would also like to talk about the Defense cuts, briefly. Majority \nLeader Reid said this just yesterday, I believe:\n\n       If the committee fails to act, sequestration\n\n  That is, automatic cuts--\n\n     is going to go forward. Democrats are not going to take an \n     unfair, unrealistic load directed toward domestic \n     discretionary spending . . . and take it away from the \n     military.\n\n  In other words, take the cuts away from the military. The automatic \ncuts that would fall on the military, which are, as Admiral Mullen, the \nformer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs said, will hollow us out.\n  These automatic cuts are odd. Many programs with rising costs are \nprotected from any cuts. Cuts are prohibited against the Medicaid \nProgram and the surging Food Stamp program, but the Defense Department, \nwhich is already slated to take $450 billion in cuts, is facing another \n$600 billion in cuts, according to the Department of Defense. It would \nbe a nearly 20-percent net reduction in Defense over the next 10 years. \nIt would be the most severe hammering of the Defense Department, while \nprotecting other programs from any cuts. It is not legitimate. Yet the \nmajority leader is pushing back and saying this is perfectly \nlegitimate. He is not going to have cuts in non-defense discretionary \nspending. He wants them to fall on the military.\n  The majority leader's comments suggest that the Defense increases \nhave increased faster than domestic discretionary spending, but nothing \ncould be further from the truth. From fiscal year 2008 to 2011, the \nDefense budget increased--base budget--by just 10 percent. Meanwhile, \neducation spending surged 67 percent over the 2009 through 2011 period, \ncompared to the previous three year period.\n\n[[Page S7636]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I believe \nthis Congress has taken a great risk in turning over to a committee of \n12 this responsibility. It is going to be difficult for them to reach \nan agreement. If they don't, damaging sequestration could occur. If \nthey do reach an agreement, we have to be sure it is an honest \nagreement that actually achieves what they promised, which is--at a \nminimum--$1.2 trillion worth of deficit reductions. We need $4 \ntrillion--as every expert has said--over 10 years in savings to begin \nto put this country on the right path. We are nowhere close to that.\n  I feel like the country is going to have to take some tough medicine. \nI hope the committee can help us get there. I do not approve of the \nprocess, but hopefully it will work and maybe we will not repeat it in \nthe future.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7636-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7636-S7637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS\n\n  Mr. REED. I rise to underscore a crucial challenge facing our Nation. \nThere are 14 million Americans who are looking for work. Six million \nhave been unemployed for more than 6 months, and the average length of \nunemployment is 40 weeks, the longest average in more than 60 years. \nThese are dire circumstances. They must be changed, and we know how to \ndo it. We know how to address our immediate unemployment crisis.\n  We must enact policies that will put Americans back to work and \nstrengthen our economy. Congress can start by passing the American Jobs \nAct. The American Jobs Act is a blueprint for boosting our economy. It \ncontains policies that most Americans, and virtually all economists, \nagree government should do in order to help our economy grow.\n  It would provide relief to the middle class. It would help small \nbusinesses grow and hire. It would invest in our Nation's bridges and \nroads and schools, help stabilize our housing market and provide aid to \nStates so teachers and first responders can stay on the job.\n  Congress must also renew basic policies such as Federal unemployment \ncompensation programs that have been a lifeline to the unemployed, \ntheir families, businesses and to States and economies throughout this \nNation. If we do not extend unemployment benefits by the end of the \nyear, 2 million Americans will lose their benefits by February \n2012. This would be disastrous for them and for the local businesses \nthat depend upon these people being able to still go out and get a cup \nof coffee or go out and buy the essentials of life. It would be \ndisastrous for States that, again, depend on that type of economic \nactivity in our national economy.\n\n  This is why I joined several of my colleagues to introduce the \nEmergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2011. If Federal \nsupport for unemployment benefits is not extended, the economy could \nlose $72 billion in economic activity, endangering up to 560,000 jobs \nnationwide--in my State the estimate is 2,300 jobs would be lost--\nsimply because we will again shrink demand as people who are relying on \njust getting by with an unemployment check no longer even have that--\nthose few dollars--to get by.\n  These proposals should be nonpartisan and in the past they have \nindeed garnered both Democratic and Republican support. Unfortunately, \nin the midst of the deepest and longest unemployment crisis our Nation \nhas faced since the Great Depression, too many of our Republican \ncolleagues have chosen simply to delay and to deny the reality of \nmillions of Americans who are looking for work, underemployed, \nstruggling to get by day to day.\n  In January 2008, before the economic crisis took hold, the \nunemployment rate was 5 percent. It ultimately peaked at 10.1 percent \nnationally in October of 2009. This massive, sudden drop in employment \nwas precipitated by one of the worst financial crises we have ever seen \nin the history of the country. This crisis was caused by excessive risk \ntaking by financial institutions, lax regulations and, in the minds of \nso many Americans, out and out greed.\n  Since that 10.1-percent high of unemployment in October of 2009, the \nunemployment rate has trended downward, but not fast enough. The \nnational unemployment rate has hovered around 9 percent since January \nof this year. The fact remains that the economy is generating more jobs \nthan it was under the policies of President Bush, particularly in the \nlast year of his administration, but it is still not generating enough \njobs. As we saw with the most recent unemployment report, businesses \nare hiring despite some strong headwinds, particularly the economic \ndangers from Europe. In October, the economy added 80,000 jobs and the \nunemployment rate came down from 9.1 percent to 9 percent. That is the \nright direction, but not the right speed, not the right momentum, not \nthe right response to this crisis. The economy still has 6.6 million \nfewer jobs than at the beginning of the 2007 recession, and the rate of \njob growth is, as I said, simply too slow. Adding 80,000 jobs keeps us \na bit afloat, but it doesn't allow us to have the momentum to move the \neconomy forward, which we need.\n  If we continue to see sluggish job growth with an average 125,000 \npayroll jobs added per month--and that is the pace this year--it will \ntake us an additional 52 months--not weeks--52 months to get back to \nthe prerecession levels of payroll employment. If we pick up job \ngrowth--say to 200,000 jobs per month, which is, again, exceeding the \ncurrent pace, but not the kind of spectacular pace we need--it still \nwill take an additional 33 months to get back to pre-Bush recession \nlevels in employment. This persistently high unemployment rate and \nanemic growth have correctly been described as a national crisis.\n  But more important than the findings of economists and those who are \nstudying the policy effects of this is the damage that this crisis is \ninflicting upon the families and communities of America. Combined with \nthe fact that middle-class families have not seen a real increase in \ntheir family income in 10 years, and now they have seen this high \nunemployment, this is a double whammy. At the same time, some \nessentials such as food and fuel have become more expensive. We cannot \noverstate the difficulty that so many families are seeing: 10 years, \neffectively, without any real growth in their income, increased prices \nin essentials, and a job market that is weak, at best, although \nslightly improved.\n  That is why what we have to do here is literally get Americans back \nto work, to give them not only the resources but the confidence that \nthe days ahead will be much better. This crisis requires the full \nattention of Congress, as well as action, not just discussion. We \ncannot afford further inaction. We cannot again indulge in a period of \ntime where we were borrowing to pay for two major conflicts.\n  I note my predecessor from Alabama talking about the military budget. \nSince 2001, we have fought two major conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand we have not raised the revenue to support those efforts. We have \nput them on the backs of future generations of Americans and on the \nbacks of Americans today who are facing this job crisis. We have to \nwork, to put people to work, to end this problem.\n  Unfortunately, I fear that, as I have said before, many of my \nRepublican colleagues are simply engaged in delay, which might be \npolitically expedient, but it is not helping the families of America.\n  Economists who are studying this economy, both national and \ninternational, have been emphatic that we have to put policies in place \nto get people back to work. Many of these policies are encapsulated in \nthe American Jobs Act, which has been repeatedly rejected by my \ncolleagues on the other side. They voted down two parts of the bill we \npulled out, one being the Teachers and First Responders Back to Work \nAct that would have created or protected 400,000 education jobs, kept \nthousands of police and firefighters on the job, and helped local \ncommunities as they are struggling to keep afloat.\n  They also rejected the Rebuild America Jobs Act, which would have \nmade\n\n[[Page S7637]]\n\nan immediate investment of $50 billion in our highways, transit \nsystems, railways, and aviation infrastructure. Frankly, I don't know \nany American in any part of this country who does not get the idea that \nwe have to begin and continue to reinvest in our infrastructure. Every \nAmerican can point to a bridge that is failing. They can point to \ncongestion on the highways. They can point to projects that are so \nnecessary not only for the long-term activity of the country but for \nthe immediate employment of our citizens.\n  The rejection of these efforts is based on one simple fact: that we \nare asking the wealthiest Americans to pay for these initiatives. No \nlonger are we going to put it on the back of future generations as we \nhave with a decade of foreign conflicts and other programs such as the \nMedicare Part D expansion. We are trying to be fiscally responsible not \nonly to propose ways to put people to work but also to pay for those \nmeasures now. That is what my colleagues object to. They seem to be \nmore concerned about that 1 percent that is talked about than the rest \nof Americans who need work--not just directly, but their communities \nneed the work so they can prosper along with the Nation.\n\n  All of this delay has been accompanied by their proposals, but their \nproposals always seem to rely upon austerity: We will have to cut more \nand more and more. But I don't think this single-minded focus on \nausterity is going to lead to the kind of growth we need. In fact, \nthere are many analysts and economists who argue that the austerity \nmeasures being suggested are counterproductive to growing the economy; \nthat, in fact, they lead to higher unemployment and lower wages.\n  For example, a recent IMF study talking about the consequences of \npursuing an agenda focused on austerity found that an austerity program \nthat curbs the deficit by 1 percent of GDP reduces real income by about \n.6 percent and raises unemployment by .5 percent. So the notion that we \ncan simply cut our way to employment growth is not substantiated by \nfair-minded analysis.\n  For example, again, Gus Faucher of Moody Analytics examined the most \nrecent proposal offered by my colleagues Senators McCain and Paul and \nsaid that the Republican proposal wouldn't address the causes of the \ncurrent weakness in the short term and in fact it would be harmful.\n  The Congressional Budget Office looked at a broad range of policies \nfrom both parties and concluded that reducing taxes on business income \nand repatriation of foreign income are the most ineffective and \ninefficient tools for growing jobs. These two measures seem to lead the \nlist of the proposals on the other side of the aisle. Also, the idea of \nproviding more tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy to create \njobs is not supported by the record. Bush-era tax breaks for the \nwealthiest resulted in mediocre growth for our economy and declining \nwages for the middle class over the period of 2001 to 2008, 2009.\n  Instead of bringing forth or supporting issues that will actually put \nAmericans to work, my colleagues on the other side want to reframe the \nissue. They want to talk about burdensome regulations, and this \nargument doesn't stand up, either.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by making a point which I think is \nvery important, because this notion of simply striking away all the \nregulations and we will have this miraculous growth in employment is \nnot substantiated by careful analysis.\n  Since 2007, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has tracked reasons behind \nmass layoffs. Among the reasons an employer can cite for layoffs is \n``government regulation.'' The data shows that government regulation \naccounted for a minuscule .2 percent of layoffs. These are the managers \nand leaders of these companies checking the box as to what is causing \nthem to lay off people. Instead, employers cite a lack of demand as a \nreason for 39 percent of the layoffs in 2008 to 2010. Indeed, if \nregulations are driving unemployment, one would expect to see job \nlosses and high unemployment rates in sectors of the economy where \nregulation has increased, such as the financial services sector. \nHowever, in the financial services sector, the unemployment rate is \nmuch lower than the national average. In fact, it is at 5.8 percent. \nMeanwhile, domestic financial firms have posted extraordinary record \nprofits in the first two quarters of 2011. So this notion that \neliminating regulations is going to miraculously solve our problems is \nnot substantiated by the evidence we are collecting.\n  What we need to do is put people back to work. The programs in the \nAmerican Jobs Act will do that. I hope that will be recognized and \naccepted so we can move quickly to pass it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate Senator \nReed's comments about the state of this economy and what the \nsupercommittee is doing and the direction we need to go on all of these \ntax issues and all of these spending issues. He is so right.\n  We know several things about Social Security. We know it has been \naround for 75 years. We know if we do things right here in Congress, it \nwill be around for another 75 years. We know it makes a huge difference \nin the lives of our citizens and our constituents in Oregon, in Ohio, \nin Rhode Island, and all over this country. We know that more than half \nof seniors in my State who are on Social Security get more than half of \ntheir income from Social Security, and it plays such an important role \nin their lives. We also know that until recently, there was not a cost-\nof-living adjustment for seniors. We know that over the last 2 years, \neven though the President and the majority in the Senate--the Democrats \nin the Senate and in the House--voted for a $250 one-time payment for \nseniors to help them deal with the increase in costs of their health \ncare--except for that, we know that Social Security beneficiaries in \nthis country didn't get a cost-of-living adjustment for 2 years.\n  We also know--and the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Oregon, is \nworking with Senator Mikulski from Maryland and me on legislation to \nfix this. We also know the cost-of-living adjustment is, pure and \nsimple, understated because the cost-of-living adjustment seniors \nusually get--never quite enough to keep up with their expenses--is \nbased on the cost of living for a working person, for someone in his \nfifties or forties or in her thirties or twenties.\n\n  For someone who is working full time, their cost-of-living increase \nis different than a senior's cost-of-living increase because if a \nperson is 70 years old, they are much more likely to have higher health \ncare costs than if they are 30 years old.\n  So, historically in this country, we do a Consumer Price Index-W, \n``wages''--CPI-W. It is based on a 30- or 40- or 50-year-old who is \nworking full time, their cost of living. We are not basing it on the \ncost of living of a senior citizen who consumes, if you will, much \nhigher health care, who has much higher health care costs.\n  That is what the legislation Senator Merkley and Senator Mikulski and \nI are working on: CPI-E, Consumer Price Index for the Elderly, \nreflecting their real costs. Why should a senior's cost-of-living \nadjustment be based on a 30-year-old's cost of living instead of a 70-\nyear-old's cost of living? That is clearly why we need the change.\n  We also know another thing about Social Security. We know some \nconservative politicians in this institution--mostly Republicans, not \nquite entirely--we know some conservative politicians in this \ninstitution want to change the Consumer Price Index the other way, to \nmake it even smaller.\n  For 2 years in a row, there was no increase, no COLA, no Consumer \nPrice Index increase, no extra dollars to keep up with burgeoning \nhealth care costs for seniors. We know that did not happen for 2 years. \nThere are people in this institution--many of whom have never supported \nSocial Security to begin with all that much, frankly, to be honest--who \nwant to see a smaller cost-of-living adjustment. It is something called \nchained CPI. I will not go into the details about how it works, but it\n\n[[Page S7638]]\n\nbasically says to seniors: Whatever you are spending money on--if you \nare buying apples, for instance, then you could buy bananas. My staff \nsays bananas are cheaper. We had an argument about that, whether \nbananas are cheaper per calorie and per weight and all that. But, \nnonetheless, they say to seniors, under this chained CPI thing--some \nconservative think tank, some corporate-funded, insurance company, drug \ncompany-funded think tank, I assume, came up with this bizarre idea of \nCPI chained--they say to seniors: You can pay less for things because \nyou can do substitutions of food--from beef to chicken or from apples \nto bananas or from something to something--and save money.\n  Most seniors have already made those substitutions in their buying \nhabits because they are already squeezed because the cost-of-living \nadjustment has not kept up with their health care costs. That is the \nwhole point. So instead of our moving to reduce the cost-of-living \nadjustment, going to this chained Consumer Price Index, chained CPI, we \nshould move away from CPI-W, based on wages, to CPI-E, meaning what \nelderly people's costs are as their health care goes up.\n  It will mean several hundred dollars in the monthly benefit a senior \nreceives. Let me give those numbers, and then I will wrap up.\n  For the average person who retired in 1985, that person would get \nabout an $887 increase, if it was the way Senator Merkley and Senator \nMikulski and I want to change Social Security. That CPI, that increase, \nwould then go up a little bit over time, so seniors would, in fact, be \nable to keep up with their health care costs. That is the importance of \nthis change. That is the importance of our legislation. We cannot go \nthe other way, chained CPI.\n  The last point I will make is, these conservatives who do not much \nlike Social Security--some of them are Presidential candidates, I might \nadd--they will say: We cannot afford this. The budget deficit is not \nbecause of Social Security. It is because of a bunch of other factors. \nSocial Security is not part of this budget deficit. We know how to do \nminor changes to fix Social Security long term and take care of seniors \nand their health care needs and their increased costs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise this morning to \nsupport the adoption of a consumer price index for Social Security that \nwould accurately reflect the costs our senior citizens actually face.\n  I am delighted to join the Presiding Officer, Senator Brown of Ohio, \nin this effort, along with Senator Mikulski of Maryland. Social \nSecurity is a promise, a bond between our government and our senior \ncitizens.\n  Our senior citizens have worked hard their whole life and paid into \nSocial Security every step of the way. They expect Social Security will \nbe there for them when they retire.\n  Over the past few years, I have heard from many Oregon seniors who \nare making ends meet on a fixed income. They ask me: Why is it we are \nnot getting a cost-of-living adjustment, a COLA? Because our costs are \nrising. They have been deeply disturbed to know, with these fixed \nincomes and these rising costs, they are being squeezed in the middle.\n  I explain to them in these townhalls it is because the COLA is \ncalculated not on what seniors face in their costs but upon what a \nbroad cross-section of working people face. They tell me: Senator, that \nis different than the costs we face. We are at a different point in our \nlives. Health care becomes a huge component. They tell me: I can tell \nyou, Senator, health care costs are not going down.\n  Some in this Chamber are coming forward with a proposal that would \nmake it even harder for our seniors. It would use a new calculation: \nnot this standard ``cross-section of America COLA'' we are currently \nusing but what is referred to as a chained CPI. That chained CPI says: \nIf the price of this goes up, you can buy that. Actually, what it does \nis go in the wrong direction in terms of accurately reflecting the \ncosts our seniors face in retirement.\n  If we take someone who is 65 today and we look down the road, by the \ntime they are 75, this chained CPI would cost them $560 per year--\nroughly a month's rent. By the time the average 85-year-old has their \npayment calculated, the chained CPI would cost them $984 per year; the \naverage 95-year-old: $1,392 per year.\n  At a time when the best off Americans are paying less than ever \nbefore, it is simply wrong to shift costs on to our seniors and the \nmost vulnerable in our society.\n  There is an alternative. It is called the CPI-E. The Consumer Price \nIndex for our seniors or elderly. I prefer to think of it as the CPI-E \nfor ``experienced.'' Our most experienced citizens face different costs \nthan the rest of us. The CPI-E would track inflation specifically based \non the basket of goods those aged 62 and older are purchasing.\n  It is simply a fairer and more accurate way to calculate the benefits \nfor our seniors. If their costs are rising slower than the overall \ncosts for society, it would reflect that. If their costs are rising \nhigher than the overall pace of inflation, then that would be \nreflected. Either way, it is fair.\n  We have to ensure we are keeping our promise to our senior citizens \nin a way that accurately reflects the reality of living in this \ncountry. This bill for the CPI-E or Consumer Price Index for the \nexperienced is the best way to achieve that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf \nof the Senator from Illinois, Mark Kirk, because the time has come for \nour country to sanction the Central Bank of Iran.\n  It has become commonplace for political leaders to state that an \nIranian regime armed with nuclear weapons is unacceptable. President \nObama has stated that an Iranian regime armed with a nuclear weapon is \nunacceptable. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime has not been deterred \nfrom conducting activities relevant to the development of such an \nexplosive device.\n  The report of the IAEA of November 8, 2011, makes clear that Iran has \nworked on the development of an indigenous design of a nuclear weapon, \nincluding the testing of components, and that Iran has yet to answer \nall of the IAEA's questions concerning the military dimensions of \nIran's nuclear program.\n  Last month, the world learned of the Quds Force plot to assassinate \nthe Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to the United States.\n  Iran remains undeterred, and the United States is left with fewer \noptions for dealing with the Iranian nuclear program as time elapses.\n  This amendment by Senator Kirk from Illinois would add to the current \nsanctions against Iran by targeting the central bank of that country. \nThis, in my judgment, is one of the few remaining actions, short of an \nembargo of Iranian shipping and military intervention, to slow or end \nthe Iranian nuclear program. It is worth supporting and pursuing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I am pleased to bring S. 1867, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2012, to the Senate floor. The Armed \nServices Committee approved the bill by a unanimous vote of 26 to 0. \nThis is the 50th consecutive year that our committee has reported a \ndefense authorization act. Every previous bill has been enacted into \nlaw.\n  I would like to thank all of the members and the staff of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee for the commitment they have shown to the best \ninterests of our men and women in uniform as we have developed this \nlegislation. Every year, we take on tough issues, and we work through \nthem on a bipartisan basis consistent with the traditions of our \ncommittee. I particularly thank Senator McCain, our ranking minority \nmember, for his strong support throughout the process. The unanimous \ncommittee vote in favor of this legislation would not have been \npossible without his cooperation and support.\n  We were delayed in getting this year's bill to the Senate floor by \ntwo issues that have arisen since the time the Armed Services Committee \napproved the first version of this bill, S. 1253, in late June.\n  First, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011, which \nmandated deep reductions in discretionary spending, including defense \nspending. The initial bill reported by the Armed Services Committee \nwould have cut the President's budget request for national defense \nprograms by more than $6 billion. The Budget Control Act, which was \nadopted after our initial bill was reported, requires an additional $21 \nbillion in reductions.\n  Second, the administration and others expressed misgivings about the \ndetainee provisions in the initial bill, although the provisions in our \ninitial bill represented a bipartisan compromise that was approved by \nthe committee on a 25-to-1 vote. Many of these concerns were based on \nmisinterpretations of the language in that bill; nonetheless, we have \nworked hard to address these concerns.\n  First, relative to the additional $21 billion in budget cuts, we \nconsulted closely with the Department of Defense before identifying \nthese cuts. We believe the reductions we decided upon can be \naccomplished without an adverse impact on our troops or their vital \nmission, and without significant increase in risks to our national \nsecurity.\n  The committee report which accompanied the initial bill, Senate \nReport 112-26, did not address these cuts but is otherwise applicable \nto this bill as well. So the new cuts are not addressed in that Senate \nreport because these new reductions came after that Senate report was \nmade.\n  For this reason, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the cuts \nbe printed in the Record immediately following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Second, the new bill would modify the detainee provisions \nto address concerns and misconceptions about the provisions in our \ninitial bill. In particular, the new bill first modifies section 1031 \nof the bill, as requested by the administration, to assure that the \nprovision that provides a statutory basis for the detention of \nindividuals captured in the course of hostilities conducted pursuant to \nthe 2001 authorization for use of military force, the AUMF, to make \nsure that those provisions and that statutory basis are consistent with \nthe existing authority that has been upheld in the courts and neither \nlimits nor expands the scope of the activities authorized by the AUMF.\n  It also modifies sections 1033 and 1034 of the bill, as requested by \nthe administration, to impose 1-year restrictions rather than permanent \nlimitations on the transfer of Gitmo detainees to foreign countries and \non the use of Department of Defense funds to build facilities in the \nUnited States to house detainees who are currently at Gitmo.\n  We were unable to agree to the administration's proposal to strike \nsection 1032, the provision that requires military detention of certain \nal-Qaida terrorists subject to a national security waiver. We did, \nhowever, adopt a number of changes to the provision. In particular, we \nmodified the provision so that it clarifies that the President gets to \ndecide who makes the determinations in coverage, how they are made and \nwhen they are made, ensuring that executive branch officials will have \nflexibility to keep any covered detainee in civilian custody or to \ntransfer any covered detainee for civilian trial at any time.\n\n[[Page S7640]]\n\n  Second, we clarify that there is no interruption of ongoing \nsurveillance and intelligence-gathering activities or of ongoing law \nenforcement interrogation sessions. There have been misstatements, \nmisimpressions, and misinterpretations of the provisions of our bill \nrelative to those issues. We clarify them to make sure it is clearly \nunderstood by this body and the American people that--repeating, it is \nthe executive branch, it is determined by the President, the people he \nappoints who will make determinations of coverage, how they are made, \nwhen they are made, so that it ensures the flexibility that the \nexecutive branch wants to keep any covered detainee in civilian custody \nor to transfer any covered detainee for civilian trial at any time.\n  It has been suggested that ongoing surveillance and intelligence-\ngathering activities by law enforcement people would be interrupted, or \nthat their interrogation might be interrupted. It is very explicitly \nclear in this bill that there is no such interruption, there is no such \ninterrogation session interruption or surveillance interruption or \nintelligence-gathering activities interruption. The process to make \nsure that doesn't happen is in the President's hands.\n  The administration officials reviewed the draft language for this \nprovision the day before our markup and recommended additional changes. \nWe were able to accommodate those recommendations, except for the \nadministration request that the provision apply only to detainees who \nare captured overseas. There is a good reason for that. But even here, \nthe difference is relatively modest, because the provision already \nexcludes all U.S. citizens. It also excludes all lawful residents of \nthe United States, except to the extent permitted by the Constitution. \nThe only covered persons left are those who are illegally in this \ncountry or who arrive as tourists or on some other short-term basis, \nand that is a small remaining category, but an important one, because \nit includes the terrorists who clandestinely arrive in the United \nStates with the objective of attacking military or other targets here.\n  Contrary to some statements I have seen in the press, the detainee \nprovisions in our bill do not include new authority for the permanent \ndetention of suspected terrorists. Rather, the bill uses language \nprovided by the administration to codify existing authority that was \nadopted by both the Bush administration and the Obama administration \nand that has been upheld in the Federal courts.\n  Moreover, the bill requires for the first time that any detainee who \nwill be held in long-term military custody anywhere in the world would \nhave access to a process that includes a military judge and a military \nlawyer.\n  I want to repeat that. For the first time, this bill provides that, \nin determining a detainee's status, the detainee will have access to a \nlawyer and to a military judge. That is not the case now. Nor would the \nbill preclude the trial of terrorists in civilian courts, as some have \nerroneously asserted. As a matter of fact, it is the contrary. The bill \nexpressly authorizes the transfer of any military detainee for trial in \nthe civilian courts at any time. An amendment that eliminated that \nauthority was defeated in the Armed Services Committee on a bipartisan \n19-to-7 vote during the markup of the initial bill.\n  The bill would not require the interruption of ongoing surveillance \noperations or ongoing law enforcement interrogations of suspected \nterrorists, as some have incorrectly asserted. The opposite is the \ncase, as I have said, because we have included language in the bill \nthat specifically precludes those possibilities.\n  The bill also provides that the President, not Congress, will decide \nwho makes determinations of whether a detained person is in the narrow \nclass covered, and the President will decide how and when these \ndeterminations are made.\n  The bill would not require that al-Qaida terrorists who are captured \non American soil be transferred to military custody, because it \nincludes an easily effectuated national security waiver. With this \nwaiver authority, executive branch officials may keep any detainee in \ncivilian custody or move any detainee to civilian custody if they \nchoose to do so.\n\n  That provision provides the executive branch flexibility to choose \nthe most appropriate course of action for al-Qaida terrorists whom we \ncapture, including detention in civilian custody. That was the intent \nof the original language, and it has been clarified in the bill before \nus. I recognize that the administration remains unsatisfied with this \nprovision, but we have gone a long way to address their concerns.\n  What about the dollar provisions in this bill? The bill we bring to \nthe floor today would authorize $662 billion for national defense \nprograms--$27 billion less than the President's budget request, and $43 \nbillion less than the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2011. I am \npleased we were able to find these savings without reducing our strong \ncommitment to the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families, \nand without undermining their ability to accomplish their important \nnational security missions. In this time of fiscal problems for our \nNation, every budget must be closely examined to identify savings, and \nthe Department of Defense budget is no exception.\n  This bill contains many important provisions that will improve the \nquality of life of our men and women in uniform, provide needed support \nand assistance to our troops on the battlefield, and make the \ninvestments we need to meet the challenges of the 21st century, and \nprovide for needed reforms in the management of the Department of \nDefense.\n  First and foremost, the bill before us continues the increases in \ncompensation and quality of life our service men and women and their \nfamilies deserve as they face the hardships imposed by continuing \nmilitary operations around the world.\n  For example, the bill would authorize a 1.6-percent across-the-board \npay raise for all uniformed military personnel and extend over 30 types \nof bonuses and special pays aimed at encouraging enlistment, \nreenlistment, and continued service by active-duty and Reserve military \npersonnel.\n  The bill provides that annual increases in TRICARE Prime enrollment \nfees in future years will not exceed the percentage increase in retired \npay. The bill authorizes $30 million in supplemental impact aid and \nrelated education programs for the children of servicemembers. The bill \nauthorizes service Secretaries to carry out programs to provide \nservicemembers with job training and employment skills training to help \nprepare them for the transition to private sector employment. It \nauthorizes the service Secretaries to waive maximum age limitations to \nenable certain highly qualified enlisted members who served in Iraq or \nAfghanistan to enter the military service academies.\n  The bill also includes important funding and authorities needed to \nprovide our troops the equipment and support they will continue to need \nas long as they remain on the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  For example, the bill fully funds the President's request for $3.2 \nbillion for the development, testing, production, and sustainment of \nthe MRAP vehicles and new MRAP all-terrain vehicles, which are needed \nto protect our troops against improvised explosive devices.\n  The bill authorizes $11.2 billion to train and equip the Afghan \nNational Army and the Afghan police, the funding level recommended by \nthe commander of U.S. Central Command after consultation with the \ncommander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan. The purpose here \nis to grow the capability of those Afghan security forces to prepare \nthem to take over increased responsibility for Afghanistan's security \nas we begin reductions in U.S. forces.\n  The bill provides $400 million for the Commanders' Emergency Response \nProgram in Afghanistan and $400 million for the Afghanistan \nInfrastructure Fund to support projects that enhance the \ncounterinsurgency campaign.\n  The bill extends the authority of the Department of Defense to \nconduct a program for the reintegration of former insurgent fighters \ninto Afghan society.\n  The bill establishes a new Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund to \nallow the Department to rapidly field new systems in response to urgent \noperational needs identified on the battlefield, and it provides the \nCentral Command--CENTCOM--commander new\n\n[[Page S7641]]\n\ncontracting authorities needed to stop the flow of money through U.S. \ncontracts to persons who are actively opposing U.S. forces in \nAfghanistan.\n  The bill also contains a number of provisions that will help improve \nthe management of the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies. \nFor example, the bill would address shortcomings in the Department of \nDefense's management of operating and support costs, which are \nestimated to constitute 70 percent of the lifecycle costs of major \nweapons systems.\n  The bill freezes DOD spending on contract services at fiscal year \n2010 levels and requires the Department of Defense to take a number of \ncommonsense steps to achieve savings in this area.\n  The bill adds $32 million for the Department of Defense's corrosion \nprevention and control and requires implementation of the \nrecommendations of a recently congressionally mandated report on \ncorrosion control on the F-22 and F-35 programs.\n  The bill improves the management of defense business systems by \nstrengthening the authority of the Department of Defense's chief \nmanagement officers in the investment review process and ensures that \nthis process covers existing systems as well as new ones.\n  The bill also adds $43 million to enable the Department of Defense IG \nto provide more effective oversight and to help identify waste, fraud, \nand abuse in defense programs, especially in the area of procurement.\n  In light of the budget constraints we face this year, the committee \nworked hard to keep funding increases of any kind to a minimum. We \nadded the following items: $66 million for unfunded requirements \nidentified by military leaders, $90 million for investments in programs \nsuch as the DOD IG and corrosion control that have high payback rates, \n$63 million for critical investments in intelligence and cyber security \nimprovements, $497 million for increased funding needed to ensure the \nefficient execution of ongoing Department of Defense programs, and $270 \nmillion for a handful of broad-based competitive programs needed to \nhelp us keep our leadership in military technology.\n  I continue to believe it would be wrong for us to give up the power \nof the purse given Congress in the Constitution. I don't believe the \nexecutive branch has a monopoly on good ideas. In fact, I think we are \nmore often receptive to creative new ideas that can lead to advances in \nthe national defense than the defense bureaucracy is. Nonetheless, \nthere are no earmarks in this bill.\n  Finally, I would like to discuss four major issues in the bill that \nwere the subject of extended debate in the course of our markup this \nyear.\n  First, this bill includes provisions that would require sound \nplanning and justification before we spend more money for Marine Corps \nrealignment from Okinawa to Guam and on tour normalization in Korea. \nThese provisions follow detailed oversight that Senators Webb, McCain, \nand I have conducted over the past years. In particular, the bill \nprohibits the expenditure of funds for Marine Corps realignment from \nOkinawa to Guam until we receive an updated force laydown and a master \nplan detailing construction costs and schedule of all projects \nnecessary to carry it out.\n  The bill requires the Department of Defense to study moving Marine \nCorps aviation assets currently at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to \nKadena Air Base, and the feasibility of relocating some or all Air \nForce assets currently at Kadena Air Base, rather than building a \nreplacement facility at Camp Schwab that is unrealistic and \nunaffordable.\n  The bill prohibits the obligation of funds for tour normalization on \nthe Korean Peninsula until the Secretary of the Army provides Congress \nwith a master plan, including all costs and schedule projections to \ncomplete the program, and the Director of Cost Assessment and Program \nEvaluation performs an analysis of alternatives justifying the \noperational need.\n  The Department of Defense current plans for Okinawa, Guam, and Korea \nwere developed years ago in a different fiscal environment and are \nprojected to cost billions of dollars more than anticipated. At a time \nof tight budgets, we owe it to the Department of Defense and to the \ntaxpayers to insist on a close examination and strong justification \nbefore we proceed.\n  Second, the committee adopted an amendment to strike all funding for \nthe Medium Extended Air Defense System, MEADS. In February, the \nDepartment of Defense announced that after investing more than $1.5 \nbillion in the MEADS Program, the program remained a high risk and the \nadditional funding needed to field the system was unaffordable. \nHowever, the Department declined to terminate the program because the \nmemorandum of understanding with our allies on which the program is \nbased commits us to continued funding even if we withdraw from the \nprogram. For this reason, the Department requested over $400 million in \nfunding for the continued development of a system that it has no \nintention of fielding. The committee amendment eliminates this funding. \nWe recognize that under the memorandum of understanding, our decision \nnot to fund this program could require the United States to pay for a \nprogram in which it is no longer a participant. However, the committee \nconcluded that the course proposed by the Department is untenable and \nthat the Department should explore all options with our allies before \ncontinuing to fund a program which we no longer need.\n  Third, our committee members share both a deep concern about the \nrising cost of the Joint Strike Fighter Program, on which we are now \nprojected to spend more than $1 trillion--which includes operation and \nsustainment costs--and a strong belief that the Department of Defense \nmust take stronger action to contain these costs.\n  The committee unanimously adopted an amendment requiring that the \nnext JSF contract be entered on a fixed-price basis and that the \ncontractor assume full responsibility for all costs above the target \ncost specified in the contract. This amendment puts the contractor on \nnotice that we have lost patience with continued overruns on the \nprogram and we are determined to protect the taxpayer from further cost \nincreases, without unnecessarily jeopardizing the heavy investment we \nhave already made in the program by prematurely terminating the \nprogram. Senator McCain has taken, really, the active lead in this \neffort, and it is a very critically important effort for our taxpayers.\n\n  Finally, the bill includes a bipartisan compromise regarding detainee \nmatters--as I have made reference to before--that would address a \nseries of important issues that relate to detainees. It is worth \nsummarizing the detainee-related provisions in the bill.\n  First, the bipartisan compromise would codify the military's existing \ndetention authority, as stated by both the administration of President \nBush and the administration of President Obama and approved in the \ncourts.\n  Second, the bill would require military detention for a core group of \ndetainees who are part of al-Qaida--or an associated force that acts in \ncoordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaida--and who \nparticipate in planning or carrying out attacks or attempted attacks \nagainst the United States or its coalition partners. That is a defined \ncore group of detainees.\n  This provision includes a national security waiver and includes \nlanguage expressly authorizing the transfer of detainees for trial in \ncivilian courts. It continues the conditions on the transfer of Gitmo \ndetainees to foreign countries, including certification requirements to \nbe met before a transfer may take place. Contrary to what some have \nsaid, this provision does not prohibit transfers from Gitmo. In fact, \nit is less restrictive of such transfers than legislation passed in the \nlast Congress and signed by the President. In particular, this year's \nprovision includes a national security waiver that is designed to \naddress concerns expressed by the Secretary of Defense about a similar \nrestriction which was included in last year's authorization and \nappropriations act.\n  The bill contains the same limitation on the use of Department of \nDefense funds to build facilities in the United States to house Gitmo \ndetainees that has been included in past authorization and \nappropriations acts. This provision applies only to Department of \nDefense funds. It does not prohibit the use of Department of Justice \nfunds that might be needed in connection with a\n\n[[Page S7642]]\n\ntransfer for the purpose of a criminal trial, and it does not prohibit \nthe closure of Gitmo.\n  The provision requires the Department of Defense to issue procedures \naddressing ambiguities in the review process established for Gitmo \ndetainees. The provision clarifies but does not overturn the Executive \norder issued by the President earlier this year.\n  The provisions require the Department of Defense to establish \nprocedures for determining the status of detainees, including, as I \nindicated before, for the first time, a military judge and a military \nlawyer for a detainee who will be held in long-term military custody.\n  The bill clarifies procedures for guilty pleas in trials by military \ncommission. This provision would require a separate trial on the \npenalty, with a unanimous verdict needed to impose the death penalty. \nSo while a death penalty could be imposed by a commission, the detainee \nwould have no assurance of that result, for those detainees who want \nthat assurance so they can make themselves martyrs.\n  As I have already indicated, these provisions have been substantially \nmodified as a result of extensive discussion with administration \nofficials. We did not make every change requested by the \nadministration, although we adopted many of them--probably most of \nthem--and made additional changes to address specific concerns raised \nby administration officials.\n  Mr. President, as we are here today, we have over 96,000 U.S. \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines on the ground in Afghanistan, \nwith 23,000 more remaining in Iraq. While there are issues on which we \nmay disagree, we all know we must provide our troops with the support \nthey need as long as they remain in harm's way.\n  Senate action on the national defense authorization bill for fiscal \nyear 2012 will improve the quality of life of our men and women in \nuniform. It will give them the tools they need to remain the most \neffective fighting force in the world. Most important of all, it will \nsend an important message that we as a nation stand behind them and \nappreciate their service.\n  We look forward to working with our colleagues to promptly pass this \nimportant legislation. And as I yield the floor, I again want to thank \nSenator McCain and all the members of our committee for their hard work \non this bill, as well as our staffs for their extraordinary capability. \nBut I want to thank personally Senator McCain for everything he has \ndone to make it possible for us to get to the floor at this time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nSummary of $21 Billion in Additional Cuts Resulting From Second Markup \n       of National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012\n\n\n                          Airland Subcommittee\n\n       Army Programs: The bill would cut an additional $2.8 \n     billion in Army Procurement and $800 million in RDTE. This \n     includes over $1 billion in reductions proposed by the Army, \n     and over $2 billion for programs that had unjustified or \n     excessive growth, misaligned schedules, fact of life changes \n     including terminations, or other management challenges. These \n     recommended reductions include $518.7 million for the Joint \n     Tactical Radio System, $224.0 million for Warfighter \n     Information Network-Tactical, $172.5 million for Ground \n     Soldier System-Nett Warrior, and $157.3 for HMMWV \n     recapitalization programs. The bill would also transfer over \n     $600 million from the base request to the overseas \n     contingency operations accounts for capabilities directly or \n     closely related with military operations in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan such as increased ISR, mine protected vehicles, \n     armoring kits, and base defense and force protection systems.\n       Navy Programs: The bill would cut an additional $724.5 \n     million in Navy Procurement and $55.9 million in RDTE. This \n     includes $532.1 million for programs that had unjustified or \n     excessive growth, misaligned schedules, fact of life changes \n     including terminations, or other management challenges. These \n     recommended reductions include $163.5 million for the E-2D \n     Advanced Hawkeye, $159.9 million for spares and repair parts, \n     $69.9 million for AMRAAM, and $99.7 million for the F/A-18E/F \n     Hornet.\n       Air Force Programs: The bill would cut an additional $910.2 \n     million in Air Force Procurement and $596.0 million in RDTE \n     for programs that had unjustified or excessive growth, \n     misaligned schedules, fact of life changes including \n     terminations, or other management challenges. These \n     recommended reductions include $145 million for the A-10, \n     $120 million for AFNET, $103 million for initial spares and \n     repair parts, and $101 million for the AMRAAM. The bill would \n     also transfer $87.2 million from the base request to the \n     overseas contingency operations accounts for activities \n     directly or closely related with military operations in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan such as war consumables.\n\n\n             Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee\n\n       Program Delays and Under-Execution: The bill would reduce \n     funding for science and technology and information technology \n     by $216 million due to excessive program growth and program \n     delays; reduce funding for U.S. Special Operations Command by \n     $135 million due to unjustified growth and items already \n     funded in recent reprogramming actions; reduce funding for \n     counter-drug programs by $128 million based on a DOD \n     assessment that this funding is excess to need; reduce \n     funding for counter-proliferation programs by $43 million due \n     to slow execution; reduce funding for the Joint IED Defeat \n     Organization (JIEDDO) by $85 million based on unjustified \n     program growth; and reduce funding for the Chemical and \n     Biological Defense Program by $40 million due to under-\n     execution and program delays.\n\n\n                         Personnel Subcommittee\n\n       Military Personnel Funding: The bill would reduce funding \n     for military personnel by $100.6 million, by taking an \n     additional $42.6 million in unobligated balances and using \n     updated CBO estimates for savings attributable to a change in \n     the calculation of hostile fire pay.\n       Defense Health Care: The bill includes a $330.0 million cut \n     to private sector care under the Defense Health Program, \n     based on an assessment of historical under execution rates \n     for private sector care.\n       Military Spouse Career Advancement Accounts (MyCAA): The \n     bill reduces funding for the program by $120 million. This \n     reduction was offered by the Department of Defense because \n     although the President's budget request included $190 million \n     for the program, DOD has indicated that as a result of its \n     redesign of the MyCAA program, only $70 million is needed for \n     execution in fiscal year 2012.\n\n\n                         Readiness Subcommittee\n\n       Military Construction: The bill would cut an additional \n     $527 million in military construction funding. This includes \n     three domestic projects valued at $83.1 million, the largest \n     of which the Technology Center's Third Floor Fit Out, valued \n     at $54.6 million does not need funding because NSA has \n     indicated that it has sufficient unobligated balances to \n     complete the project. The balance of the cuts are for: (1) \n     overseas military construction projects in areas that are \n     subject to an ongoing strategic review (including five \n     projects in EUCOM valued at $179.6 million); (2) planning and \n     design funds rendered unnecessary due to previous cuts; and \n     (3) programs that are not fully budgeted for in the FYDP.\n        Operation and Maintenance: The bill would cut an \n     additional $3.1 billion in operation and maintenance funding. \n     This includes $1.5 billion in reductions proposed by the \n     military services; $315 million for ammunition account cuts \n     based on inefficient ammunition management and \n     recommendations from the military services; $294 million for \n     excess growth in service contractors and civilian employees; \n     and $258 million in the OCO accounts for a transfer of Coast \n     Guard support to the Department of Homeland Security.\n       Transfers to Overseas Contingency Operations Funding: The \n     bill would transfer to OCO accounts $4.9 billion of operation \n     and maintenance funding for activities closely associated \n     with military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, including \n     MRAP vehicle sustainment, body armor sustainment, overseas \n     security guards, theater security packages, depot maintenance \n     and readiness funding in support of combat operations, and \n     CENTCOM headquarters public affairs. Most of these activities \n     have previously been funded from OCO accounts.\n\n\n                         Seapower Subcommittee\n\n       Navy Programs: The bill would cut an additional $234.4 \n     million in Navy Procurement and $496.7 million in RDTE for \n     programs that had unjustified or excessive growth, misaligned \n     schedules, fact of life changes including terminations and a \n     Navy-requested realignment of the VXX Presidential Helicopter \n     program, or other management challenges. The recommended \n     reductions include $120 million for JTRS, $70 million for the \n     Future Unmanned Carrier-Based Strike System, $63 million for \n     ship contract design and live fire T, and $58 million for \n     the Standard Missile.\n       Marine Corps Programs: The bill would make additional \n     reductions of $101.0 million in Procurement, Marine Corps due \n     to slow program execution or contract award delays.\n       Air Force Programs: The bill would cut an additional $108.6 \n     million in Air Force Procurement for unnecessary post \n     production funding for the C-17 program and $45.9 million in \n     RDTE for programs that had contract delays or where the \n     programs were being re-phased.\n\n\n                         Strategic Subcommittee\n\n       Space: The bill would reduce funding for space programs by \n     $233 million due to slow execution in the development of the \n     Family of Advanced Line of Sight Terminals (FAB-T) used in \n     conjunction with the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) \n     satellite system; by $300 million by dropping authorization \n     for the long term lease of a commercial satellite by the \n     Defense Information\n\n[[Page S7643]]\n\n     Systems Agency due to a lack of an analysis of alternatives; \n     and by $105 million in connection with delays in contract \n     awards associated with GPS systems under development.\n       Department of Energy: The bill would reduce funding for \n     environmental cleanup at former atomic weapons production \n     sites by $356 million due to slow program execution; reduce \n     the NNSA nonproliferation program by $168 million due to cost \n     overruns for a pit disassembly facility to produce mixed \n     oxide fuel, which is now developing a new program base line; \n     and for NNSA program management by $45 million due to an \n     excessive rate of growth.\n       Missile Defense: The bill would reduce funding by $55 \n     million for the procurement of Standard Missile-3 Block IB \n     missiles due to a test failure which requires an \n     investigation, correction, and retest, delaying production \n     (an additional $260 million of funding would be moved from \n     procurement to the R account to facilitate the fixes); and \n     reduce funding for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense \n     (THAAD) missile defense system by $120 million to reflect the \n     reality of slower production rates due to delays in the \n     program. A few joint or Army programs would be reduced by $47 \n     million for under-execution.\n       Intelligence Funding: The bill includes a number of \n     reductions to the Military Intelligence Program because of \n     late contract awards, slow execution rates, program delays, \n     and changes in programs since mark-up; it also includes \n     reduced funding for the National Intelligence Program \n     reflecting cuts agreed to by the two intelligence committees.\n\n\n                           General Provisions\n\n       Troop Reductions in Afghanistan: The bill would reduce OCO \n     funding by $5.0 billion due to the President's decision to \n     withdraw the 33,000 U.S. surge force from Afghanistan, with \n     10,000 to be withdrawn by December 2011 and the remaining \n     23,000 to be withdrawn by next summer. The Department of \n     Defense has informed us that the $5.0 billion is no longer \n     needed as a result of the planned Afghanistan troop \n     reduction.\n       Afghanistan Security Forces Fund: The bill would reduce \n     funding for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF) to \n     $11.2 billion, a $1.6 billion reduction from the President's \n     request. The Commander, U.S. Central Command, has determined \n     that FY2012 ASFF funding can be reduced by $1.6 billion \n     because of efficiencies and cost avoidances achieved by the \n     NATO Training Mission in Afghanistan in its plans for \n     building and sustaining the Afghan Army and Police.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1092\n\n    (Purpose: To bolster the detection and avoidance of counterfeit \n                           electronic parts)\n\n  Mr. Levin. Mr. President, pursuant to a unanimous consent request \nwhich was previously entered into on this matter, I send to the desk an \namendment on behalf of myself and Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 1092.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect to \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it now pending first in line?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is now pending first in line.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I want to make one \nquick comment about this amendment.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment that addresses the massive issue \ncreated by counterfeit parts getting into the defense supply system. It \nis something our staffs have investigated heavily.\n  Senator McCain and I are introducing this bipartisan amendment. We \nhope it has strong support in this Senate. It will address a critically \nimportant issue we have now seen in the defense supply system with \nmillions of counterfeit parts--mainly from China--getting into our \ndefense system and threatening the security of our troops, the \neffectiveness of their mission, and costing the taxpayers a heck of a \nlot of money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \nbrief colloquy with the chairman, Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, I wish to thank the Chairman for the long \nyears of work we have had together. This is the culmination of this \nyear's work which is coming to the floor after great difficulty and a \nlot of obstacles. I want to thank the Senator again for the spirit of \nbipartisanship, which is a long tradition in the committee which was \npracticed by our predecessors. Obviously, we know on occasion that we \nhave differences of views, and sometimes we--especially I--express \nthose in perhaps a passionate manner. But the fact is, at the end of \nthe day, we continue to come together and work together for the good of \nthis Nation's security.\n  The reason I ask the Senator is because I think our colleagues ought \nto understand the context of this bill. First of all, it is a new bill, \nand it has a reduction of some $20 billion in authorization in order to \nkeep with the Budget Control Act, a total now of a $27 billion \nreduction, which is a significant amount of money. It seems to me our \ncolleagues should understand this $9.8 billion cut in defense \nprocurement, $3.5 billion cut in research, development, test, and \nevaluation, $1.6 billion cut in military construction, $6.7 billion in \noverseas--these are significant reductions already in what we had \noriginally envisioned as necessary for our Nation's defense capability.\n  I would ask the chairman, these are painful decisions we had to make. \nFor those who somehow believe it is business as usual in the Department \nof Defense and on the Defense authorization, it simply is not correct. \nWe have already made significant reductions, I ask my colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree with my friend from Arizona. We literally worked \nmonths to get to the first reduction which was in our original bill. \nThen when the Congress adopted the Deficit Reduction Act, which \nrequired additional reductions, these are very difficult decisions to \nmake because they in many cases will increase risks which we don't want \nto increase but nonetheless have got to accept some additional degree \nof risk on some of our programs in order to do the fiscally responsible \nthing. I agree with my friend.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my colleague, also, two more points. One is \nthat we also have planned for an additional well over $400 billion \nreductions in the next decade, and those will again entail at some \npoint an increase in risk. So in that context, I would appreciate again \nan expression of the chairman's view of a Draconian cut that would take \nplace as a result of sequestration. The Secretary of Defense has \ntestified before our committee of the ``devastating effects,'' as have \nour military leaders.\n  Mr. LEVIN. These cuts that would result from sequestration are \nmassive not just in defense but also in nondefense discretionary areas. \nThe purpose of that threat is to hopefully prevent it from taking \nplace, as with any other kind of a sword of Damocles held over people's \nheads--our heads--that if we don't reach some kind of an agreement with \nour special committee, the group of 12 that is working so hard to come \nup with a reduction that will meet the requirements of the bill, we \nwould then have a sequestration, across-the-board cuts, which are not \nthe rational way to budget, are massive, Draconian--to use the word \nwhich the Senator from Arizona quoted. And that is true in both defense \nand nondefense. But, again, the purpose of having that sequestration \nprocess in place is, hopefully, an incentive so that it doesn't take \nplace.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, I would ask the chairman, we have met the \nrequirements of the Appropriations Committee with this additional $20 \nbillion reduction in this ``new'' legislation. Then it seems it would \nbe only appropriate that the Appropriations Committee meet the \nprovisions of authorization that are in the authorization bill.\n  In other words, I am told there are some differences in the \nAppropriations Committee's bill as far as what the authorizing \ncommittee's responsibilities are. I hope the Appropriations Committee \nwould address those differences in deference to our role as \nauthorizers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is always our hope. It doesn't work out the way we \nwish frequently, but it is always our hope that the way it should \nwork--at least theoretically--around here is that should be what the \nappropriators do.\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\nThat has not worked out that way in I don't know how many recent years. \nThe Senator and I have had some discussions about that. When I first \ngot here, many years ago, that was an issue which had not been \nresolved. But I think what the Senator sets out is the hope that the \nappropriators would look at our authorizations and follow our \nauthorizations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  I finally wish to comment. I am more than hoping. I intend to \nidentify those areas of difference between the authorizing committee \nand the Appropriations Committee, and fully expect the appropriating \ncommittee--unless there is some overriding reason--to conform with the \nauthorization bill.\n\n  Again, I thank Senator Levin and his staff for the work we are doing. \nAnd I thank the leadership. I thank Senator Reid for bringing the bill \nto the floor. I know he has a lot of important priorities, but I \nbelieve it is very important that we continue an over half-century \ntradition of the Senate taking up, passing, and then finally seeing \nenacted into law the Defense authorization bill.\n  I think it is a valid statement to say that there is no greater \npriority the people's representatives have than to take every measure \nwe can possible to ensure the security of our Nation and the men and \nwomen who serve in it. This legislation is the result of literally \nthousands of hours of discussion, debate, hearings, input to make sure \nwe do the very best job we can to protect our Nation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, with the committee's action earlier this week \nwe have ensured that our authorization top line of $526 billion for the \nbase Defense budget complies with the budget allocation levels adopted \nby the Senate Appropriations Committee for fiscal year 2012.\n  We have worked with the administration over the past several weeks to \naddress their concerns with the detainee provisions in our bill. We \nunderstand the administration is still not satisfied with the committee \nwork. We have made many clarifications, modifications at the request of \nthe administration to the detainee provisions as they were reported \nfrom the committee in June. As a result, we were able to report out the \nbill again this week with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 26 to 0.\n  We will be glad to continue our discussions with the administration. \nI am grateful the administration reached out to us and that because of \nthat discussion in negotiations with Mr. Brennan and others from the \nWhite House we were able to make some changes. I regret they haven't \nbeen sufficient to overcome their objections, but we will continue to \nwork with them. This is a very important issue.\n  Obviously, our collective goal is to make sure that members of \nterrorist organizations, specifically al-Qaida, do not return to the \nfight, and that we make sure we are able to treat al-Qaida members who \nare captured in keeping with international law, but at the same time in \nkeeping with the priority interests of America's national security. So \nI understand there will be an amendment on that issue or amendments. We \nlook forward to debating and discussing that aspect.\n  Whatever additional concerns that may remain with the detainee \nprovisions should be dealt with, as they will be, through debate and \namendment. But, importantly, all of the aspects of this bill are of \nsuch vital importance to supporting the men and women of our Armed \nForces and their families. We have already started to work on \namendments that we know our colleagues are preparing to offer on this \nbill, and I encourage all my colleagues to file their germane \namendments as quickly as possible.\n  Obviously, I repeat, the legislation is extremely important to our \nNation's defense and the men and women in uniform. I know all of my \ncolleagues appreciate that fact.\n  I would hope that this year, unlike in recent previous years, we will \nnot add to this bill policy riders that are not relevant to the bill.\n  The committee bill before the Senate is the culmination of 11 months \nof hard work conducted through 71 hearings and meetings this year on \nthe full range of national security priorities and issues. This \ntradition of deliberative review and oversight is typical of what the \nDefense authorization bill has provided our Nation's military for over \n50 years, without fail. The committee's priorities this year and every \nyear start with our bipartisan commitment to improve the quality of \nlife for the men and women of the all-volunteer force--active duty, \nNational Guard, and Reserves--and their families, through fair pay, \nimproved policies, benefits commensurate with the sacrifices of their \nservice, and by addressing the needs of the wounded, ill, and injured \nservicemembers and their families.\n  To do these things, this bill authorizes a 1.6-percent across-the-\nboard pay raise for all members of the uniformed services, authorizes \npay incentives for recruitment and retention of our most highly skilled \nand highly sought-after men and women, and improves the Uniformed Code \nof Military Justice to more effectively respond to accusations of \ncertain types of misconduct. This bill provides essential resources, \ntraining, technology, equipment, and force protection our military \nneeds to succeed in their missions, including authorizing a 6-percent \nincrease in funding for our enormously important professional and \ndedicated special operations forces who play such a large role in our \ncounterterrorism operations worldwide, and over $2.4 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense counter-improvised explosive device activities. I \ncannot overemphasize the importance of the timely funding of these \ncounter-IED funds given the increase in the use of this kind of attack \nagainst our troops, first in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.\n  The bill enhances the capability of our military and that of our \nallies to conduct counterinsurgency operations, including the authority \nto provide support to those aiding U.S. Special Operations in combating \nterrorism in Yemen and East Africa, authorization of $400 million for \nthe Commanders Emergency Response Program--known as CERP--in \nAfghanistan, and authorization of $11.1 billion to train and equip the \nAfghan security forces for the security of the Afghan people.\n  The bill strengthens and accelerates nuclear nonproliferation \nprograms while maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent, reducing the \nnumber of nuclear weapons, and ensuring the safety, security, and \nreliability of the nuclear stockpile, the delivery systems, and the \nnuclear infrastructure. In this regard, the bill authorizes $1.1 \nbillion to continue development of the Ohio-class submarine replacement \nprogram to modernize the sea-based leg of the nuclear triad of delivery \nplatforms. It improves our ability to counter nontraditional threats, \nfocusing on terrorism and cyber warfare; in part by requiring DOD to \nacquire and incorporate capabilities for discovering previously unknown \ncyber attacks and establishing a new Joint Urgent Operational Need Fund \nto allow the Department to rapidly field new systems in response to \nbattlefield requirements. It authorizes DOD to immediately void a \ncontract if a contractor has been determined by the commander, U.S. \nCenter Command, to be actively opposing U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\n  A related provision would provide enhanced audit authority to assist \nin the enforcement of this provision. It authorizes over $13 billion \nfor new construction of critical facility projects that have a direct \nimpact on the readiness and operations of our military while also \nproviding much needed construction jobs in a struggling economy.\n  In contrast to these enhancements and new authorities, the committee \nalso had to make some very difficult decisions. The President's budget \nrequest of $553 billion was cut by nearly $27 billion in recognition of \nthe difficult budget situation our country faces. These difficult \nfunding reductions include: $10 billion cut in the operation and \nmaintenance accounts for the military services used to fund readiness \nand training activities. This was done mainly by scaling back the \ngrowth in service contracts while also reducing certain accounts for \ndaily operating activities and training; a $9.8 billion cut in defense \nprocurement accounts for programs that had more money than could be \nefficiently put under contract this year and programs that were not \nable to meet production milestones; a $3.5 billion cut in the research, \ndevelopment, test and evaluation accounts by examining the performance \nof hundreds of programs and\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\nidentifying those that showed excessive cost growth or a lack of \nperformance; $1.6 billion in cuts in military construction projects, \nmostly at overseas locations, to allow for a review of our U.S. \nmilitary force posture worldwide. In addition, the bill cuts $6.7 \nbillion from the President's budget request of $118 billion for \noverseas contingency operations, known as OCO, due to a forecast of \nreduced operations in Afghanistan during 2012.\n  These cuts are the first step in what will be an extremely critical \ndebate on the right amount of defense spending over the next 10 years. \nWe will need to make some very difficult decisions that will \nundoubtedly increase risk as we decide whether to continue or terminate \ncostly and, in some cases, troubled and overdue programs. We will need \nan informed and honest debate on which defense requirements and \ncapabilities most effectively and efficiently protect the full range of \nour Nation's interests.\n  As such, this committee's review and curtailment of troubled, \nwasteful or unnecessary programs is not only essential to ensure proper \nstewardship of taxpayer funds but also stays true to the intent of \npreserving funds for war fighter priorities. Along these lines, this \nbill proposes to cut: $452 million for the Enhanced Medium Altitude \nReconnaissance and Surveillance System due to program delays; $192 \nmillion from related Brigade Combat Team Modernization projects due to \na program termination by the Army; $200 million for the Joint Tactical \nRadio System due to program delays; $406 million for the Medium \nExtended Air Defense Systems, known as MEADS, which is a high-risk \njoint program for air defense with Germany and Italy which the Army has \ndecided not to deploy operationally; $519 million for the Joint \nTactical Radio System, called JTRS, as a result of program execution \nand cost concerns; $244 million for Warfighter Information Network-\nTactical; $173 million for Ground Soldier System-Net Warrior; $157 \nmillion for HMMWV recapitalization programs; $108 million for \nunnecessary postproduction funding for the C-17 Program; $233 million \ndue to slow execution in the development of the family of Advanced Line \nOf Sight Terminals used in conjunction with the Advanced Extremely High \nFrequency Satellite System; $300 million by curtailing authority for \nlong-term lease of a commercial satellite by the Defense Information \nSystems Agency due to a lack of an analysis of alternatives; $105 \nmillion in connection with delays in contract awards associated with \nGPS systems under development.\n  Even after this long list of cuts to troubled programs, I would have \nliked to have done more.\n  I wish to point out that in the days when we were increasing defense \nspending, it was one thing not to be in sync with the appropriations \ncommittee. In the days of reductions in defense spending, it is \nabsolutely vital that the Appropriations Committee follow the guidance \nand authorization of the authorizing committee. I intend to do \neverything in my power to make sure that happens.\n  An example of what I would have liked to have seen more of is the \nJoint Strike Fighter or the F-35 Programs. I offered an amendment \nduring the committee's markup that would have put the program on a 1-\nyear probation if the costs under the fixed-price contract for the \nfourth lot of early production aircraft grew by more than 10 percent \nover their target cost by the end of the year. My goal was to send a \nstrong, simple, and powerful message to the Pentagon and to Lockheed \nMartin, a message that we will no longer continue down the road of \nexcessive cost growth and schedule slips on this program just because \nother alternatives are hard to come by.\n  We now are faced with a prospect of the first $1 trillion weapons \nsystem in history, which it certainly was not originally designed to \nbe.\n  As it turned out, the amendment did not go forward as a result of a \ntie vote in committee. An alternative provision offered by Chairman \nLevin will instead require that the fifth lot of early production F-35 \naircraft be procured under a fixed-price contract and that Lockheed \nMartin bear the entire responsibility for any cost overrun other than \ncertain limited costs needed to make specific changes that the \ngovernment requests. Because I feel it is essential to use fix-price \ncontracts for large Pentagon weapons programs, I supported the \nchairman's amendment during the markup and I support it now.\n  Today, as we speak, the Pentagon is negotiating with Lockheed Martin \non who will bear the cost of changes to the design and manufacturing of \nthe aircraft that could come down the road as a result of thousands of \nhours of flight testing that lie ahead. In this sense, the excessive \noverlap between development and production that is called concurrency \nis now coming home to roost. The Defense Department quite rightly says \nit will not sign any contract for the next lot until Lockheed Martin \nagrees to pay a reasonable share of these concurrency costs, and \nLockheed Martin doesn't want to bear the risk of new discoveries.\n\n  Let me be clear. I strongly support the Department of Defense \nposition. I think it reflects exactly the congressional view reflected \nin our markup. As we agree to buy more early production jets while most \nof the development testing has yet to be done, Lockheed Martin must be \nheld increasingly accountable for cost overruns that come as a result \nof wringing out necessary changes in the design and manufacturing \nprocess for this incredibly expensive aircraft.\n  How does this legislation affect pending negotiations? It means on \nthe next production lot, Congress expects the Department to negotiate a \nfixed-price contract that requires Lockheed Martin to assume an \nincreased share of any cost overruns. It requires a ceiling price for \nthat lot that is lower than the previous contract for the last lot \npurchased. It ensures a shared responsibility for reasonable \nconcurrency cost increases.\n  In other words, the deal we negotiate on this next production lot \nmust be at least as good, if not better, than the deal we negotiated \nunder the previous one. Otherwise, we are moving in the wrong direction \nand it will only be a matter of time before the American people and the \nU.S. Congress lose faith in the F-35 Program, which is already the most \nexpensive weapons program in the history of this country.\n  I look forward to having the opportunity to address this and other \nsignificant national security policies related to detainee policies, \ncyber operations, Iranian aggression, Pakistan, acquisition reform, and \nthe way we buy space programs and launch services, further limiting the \nuse of fixed-price contracts for procurement, reducing the cost of \nmilitary health care, counterfeit parts, and the future of our military \nin the face of major budget reductions.\n  On the issue of counterfeit parts, I commend the initiative of the \nchairman to address this critical issue. The proliferation of \ncounterfeit parts threatens the safety of our men and women in uniform, \nour national security, and our economy. We cannot risk a ballistic \nmissile interceptor missing its target or a helicopter pilot unable to \nfire his or her weapons or display units failing in aircraft cockpits \nor any other system failure, all because of a counterfeit electronic \npart. Nor can we keep affording the hundreds of thousands, even \nmillions, of dollars to fix the systems they penetrate.\n  Our committee has been conducting an investigation for the past year, \nand we will have an amendment--there is one already pending--as a \nresult of this outstanding work.\n  I also plan to offer amendments that will start us on the course of \nan updated plan for U.S. military forces in the Pacific theater. The \ncurrent plan to move 8,700 marines, 9,000 family members from their \ncurrent bases on Okinawa to Guam is now estimated to require spending \nbetween $18 and $23 billion on Guam to build up its capabilities as a \npermanent base. This is an increase of well over $10 billion from the \noriginal estimate. I believe the pricetag will continue to rise. As a \nresult, I, along with Chairman Levin and Senator Webb and other \ncolleagues, view this program as unworkable, unaffordable, and an \nunnecessary strain on the relations between our government and the \nGovernment of Japan. Recognizing this strain, both the Armed Services \nCommittee and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs' Committee \nof the Appropriations Committee have stopped funding Guam\n\n[[Page S7646]]\n\nmilitary construction projects until the Department of Defense provides \na master plan and considers alternatives that may provide the needed \nMarine forward presence at much less expense.\n  Let's face it, we simply are at a level we cannot afford under the \npresent plan. I also understand our relations with Japan are very \nimportant in this whole move. We cannot send a signal that America is \nleaving the area. In fact, I was very pleased to see the agreement the \nPresident of the United States signed with the Prime Minister of \nAustralia just yesterday that provides for a joint operating base in \nAustralia. But we must understand the delicacy of our relations with \nthe Government and people of Japan, especially in the time of rising \nconcern about some of the behavior that has been exhibited by the \nChinese.\n  I believe we need to take advantage of this pause to convene a \ncongressional commission of experts in Asian affairs, with multilateral \ninput, to review our national security interests in the Pacific region \nover the next 30 years and charter that commission to propose a posture \nfor our military forces that will both strengthen our traditional \nalliances while offering opportunities for cooperative efforts with \nemerging partners and allies to solidify our mutual interests in the \nregion.\n  In the face of the doubt about the scope and timing of the Pacific \nrealignments, we also need to ensure that this pause in potentially \nunnecessary spending is extended in 2012 to the use of defense funds to \nactivities that have no direct impact on military functions or missions \non Guam, such as the purchase of civilian school buses and an artifact \nrepository and a mental health clinic on Guam. While these projects may \nhave legitimate value to the Government of Guam to address current \nneeds for citizens of Guam, they simply are not my idea of top defense \npriorities in the fiscal environment we face.\n  In addition, despite the efforts of Congress to ban earmarks and \nspecial interest projects, this bill contains almost $850 million in \nauthorizations of funding for items and programs not requested by the \nadministration. The full Senate needs to consider the merits of these \nunrequested spending items and to determine whether they are top \ndefense priorities in today's fiscal environment.\n  The bill also cuts $330 million for private sector care under the \nDefense Health Program, based on an assessment of historical \nunderexecution rates. This is the first step in an important progress \nin helping the Department of Defense control spiralling health care \ncosts. It is the other challenges we face in this bill where we could \nhave and should have done more.\n\n  Secretary Panetta, speaking at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said:\n\n       The fiscal reality facing us means we also have to look at \n     the growth in personnel costs, which are a major driver of \n     budget growth and are, simply put, on an unsustainable \n     course.\n\n  The Secretary concludes:\n\n       If we fail to address [these costs], then we won't be able \n     to afford the training and equipment our troops need in order \n     to succeed on the battlefield.\n\n  Providing the Department with the authority to adjust Tricare PRIME \nenrollment fees based on a realistic index of national health \nexpenditures per capita, as the administration requested, would have \nbeen the right thing to do. Instead, this bill limits all future \nenrollment fee increases to the cost-of-living adjustment for military \nretired pay.\n  Military retirees and their families deserve the best possible care \nand nothing less in return for a career of military service. But we \ncannot ignore the fact that health care costs will undermine the combat \ncapability and training and readiness of our military if we don't begin \nto control the cost growth now. Our committee report reflects the \ndesire of the committee to review options for phasing in more realistic \nfuture adjustments beginning in fiscal year 2014, and that is exactly \nwhat we must do.\n  I wish to emphasize a point here. I am solemnly aware of the \ncommitment this Nation has made to the men and women who have served in \nthe military regarding health care and benefits. This Nation has made \npromises for many years and has endeavored to keep those promises. But \nwe are faced with a set of dire circumstances regarding the long-term \nviability of entitlement programs that threatens to undermine a whole \nrange of promises we have made to every American.\n  I am also keenly aware that in this unprecedented fiscal crisis \nfacing this country, providing for our national defense is the most \nimportant responsibility that our or any government has. It is our \nNation's insurance policy. And in a world that is more complex and \nthreatening than I have ever seen, we cannot allow arbitrary budget \narithmetic to drive our defense strategy in spending. We have to look \nat every program to determine what risks we can afford to take without \nrisking the lives and welfare of those brave young Americans who \nvolunteered to serve in the military.\n  As such, some of the defense cuts being discussed--particularly as a \nresult of sequestration--would do grave harm to our military and our \nNation's security. The immediate impact of a sequester, according to \nSecretary Panetta, who previously served as chairman of the House \nBudget Committee and Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, could be \na 23-percent across-the-board cut to our Nation's defense programs. \nShipbuilding and construction contracts would have to be curtailed. \nCivilian personnel and contractors would have to be furloughed. The end \nresults of these cuts after 10 years would be ``the smallest ground \nforce since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the \nsmallest Air Force in its history.'' The United States would face \n``substantial risk of not being able to meet our defense needs.''\n  Defense spending is not what is sinking this country into fiscal \ncrisis, and if the Congress and the President act on that flawed \nassumption, they will create a situation that is truly unaffordable--\nthe decline of U.S. military power and a hollow military. We cannot let \nthis happen. Despite a significant decline in defense spending, the \ngrowing threats we face around the world demand a strong and resolute \nU.S. military that continues as the first line of protection for peace, \nfreedom, justice, and democracy around the world.\n  I have had the privilege of a long career in public service, but in \nall my years I don't think I have ever seen a geopolitical environment \nas complex and as multidimensional as the one we face today. This will \nonly increase in the years to come. The rise of China is one of the \nmost seminal events in world history, but it is not an isolated \noccurrence. Other nations across the Asia-Pacific--most notably India--\nare also growing rapidly and using their newfound wealth to enhance \ntheir comprehensive national power, especially new military \ncapabilities.\n  The challenge for the United States is this: How do we, as a historic \nPacific power, use the next few years--despite the necessary cuts that \nwill have to be made in our defense spending--to make smart, strategic \ninvestments that set us up to shape the future of the coming Pacific \ncentury? That means a more geographically dispersed and operationally \nresilient regional force posture. It means developing new operational \nconcepts, such as the Defense Department's AirSea Battle concept, which \naims to enable us to operate effectively in an anti-access and area-\ndenial environment. It means taking advantage of the many opportunities \nwe face to enhance the capabilities and interoperability of our \nalliances and partnerships. And perhaps most of all, it means making \nsome difficult and at times painful choices about where we can go, what \nwe do, and what we can do without. We all must take responsibility for \nthese choices.\n  When we talk about our increasing focus on the Asia-Pacific region, \nwhat this does not mean and cannot mean is a lack of commitment to the \nbroader Middle East. After all, the United States still has a capacity \nto do at least two things at once, and we cannot afford to allow that \nto change.\n  The Middle East and north Africa are undergoing perhaps the most \nconsequential period of upheaval since the collapse of the Ottoman \nEmpire. Governments with long patterns of authoritarian control--some \nof them our partners--are falling under the popular pressure of \nmillions of citizens who desire dignity, freedom, and opportunity. Our \nold and dear ally Israel faces a more tumultuous and potentially \nthreatening position than it has in decades. At the same time, new \nregional\n\n[[Page S7647]]\n\nleaders, such as Turkey and Qatar and the UAE, are playing a more \nconfident and assertive role in shaping the events of the region \ndespite the failure of leadership that led us to the full withdrawal of \nU.S. troops in Iraq. The success of that country remains a critical \nnational security interest of the United States. We must remain \ncommitted to Iraq's success and stability. And all the while, the \nIranian regime continues to threaten the security of the region and \nthat of the United States.\n  Amid all of these complicated and important global trends, it is \nabsolutely vital that the Members of this body be allowed to engage in \na fulsome and serious debate about the vital national security \ninterests contained in this bill. I hope there will be a generous \nopportunity to offer amendments and debate them. I am confident we can \ndo this while still moving diligently and quickly along.\n  We have given the majority leader the commitment that we will work to \nensure Senate consideration of this bill on an expedited basis. This \nChamber must have the opportunity to complete this bill and then send \nit to the conference with the House. We need to have a conference \nreport before the end of the year.\n  We cannot continue to place critical authorizations in appropriations \nbills or continuing resolutions because we cannot get the Defense \nauthorization bill done in a timely manner. As an example, this bill \nincludes extensions for several important counternarcotics authorities \nthat expired at the end of fiscal year 2011. The expiration of these \nauthorities has had a direct impact on DOD efforts to combat illicit \ntrafficking networks where proceeds often directly fund the activities \nof terrorists and other criminal organizations that pose a significant \nthreat to U.S. security interests. Timely passage of the Defense \nauthorization bill will ensure that these counternarcotics missions can \ncontinue in places such as Afghanistan, Colombia, and along our \nsouthern border.\n  I, for one, am not proud of the 9-percent approval rating in the \nperformance of Congress determined by various polls. They are right--we \nneed to do more for the American people. I hope we can reverse this \ndownward trend in our approval by tackling the critical national \nsecurity challenges facing this country in an efficient and effective \nmanner.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Levin to pass this bill as \nquickly as possible and get it into law for the benefit of our military \nand our country. I would ask our colleagues--as we usually do--to get \ntheir amendments to us so we can have them considered and have as \nprompt action as possible on them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me thank my friend from Arizona for his great work on \nthis bill and the way in which he and our members, our brothers and \nsisters on the committee, including the Presiding Officer, worked so \nwell together on a bipartisan basis and the way our staffs worked \ntogether. We are now in a position where we can consider amendments, as \nthe Senator from Arizona said, pending the receipt of amendments for \nour consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the McCain-Levin \namendment No. 1092.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think that is the Levin-McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to discuss that amendment. This amendment is \na result of the effort made by our committee staff and other members of \nthe committee to identify a very serious problem that can affect our \nNation's security; that is, the counterfeiting of critical components \nthat end up in our defense systems--in some cases, helicopters; in some \ncases, aircraft; in some cases, missiles--literally every high-tech \naspect of our Nation's defense systems.\n  We traced, in hearings under Senator Levin's leadership, the way in \nwhich, through different shell companies, these parts that originate in \nChina that are counterfeit end up, through various establishments and \nthen by our major parts suppliers, in our weapons systems. There \nalready have been occasions where there have been system failures, and \nthere have also been situations which have inhibited or reduced \nreadiness and further capabilities. So far, thank God, it has not \nresulted in any casualties or deaths, but there is very little doubt \nthat this counterfeiting poses a serious threat. According to our \nfindings, some 70 percent of these counterfeit parts come from China.\n  It has to be stopped. We don't know, to tell my colleagues the truth, \nif all the parts of this amendment will stop it because it is a huge \nmoney-making business, but I think this initial amendment will move us \nin the right direction to try to bring at least under some control the \nflow of these counterfeit parts into our Nation's defense.\n  So I hope that with the help of my colleagues we could adopt this \namendment as rapidly as possible and move on to the next one. I know of \nno one who objects to it. I know there are other members of the \ncommittee who were involved in the examination of this situation, and \nperhaps they would like to come and speak on it. But I would recommend \nto the chairman that we move on this amendment as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I very \nbriefly described this amendment before, but I will take a few minutes \nnow to describe it in some greater length because it is very \nsignificant. It is going to totally change the way we buy replacement \nparts for our weapons systems to avoid the absurdity that we have so \nmany counterfeit parts, including used parts, where we need new parts \non these weapons systems.\n  The investigative staff of our committee looked at just a slice of \nthe Defense chain for getting replacement parts. In that one slice of \nthat supply chain, they identified 1,800 examples of where counterfeit \nparts were in our weapons systems. There were 1,800 different examples, \nbut they involve millions of parts.\n  What happens here is that these used computers that originate from \nChina, which are called e-waste, are sent back to China where they are \npulled apart. The electronic parts are then washed, frequently in a \nstream--and there are pictures of these parts being washed in streams--\ndried out in the open, and then they go mainly to one place in China, \nShantou. The surfaces of these parts are then sanded down, new surfaces \nare put on them, and a number is placed on them to make them look like \nnew parts. Then, those parts, through various ways, get into the supply \nchain. That is what we have to stop.\n  This is dangerous for our troops. It jeopardizes their missions. We \nbelieve we are losing approximately 11,000 American jobs that would be \nmaking these parts if they weren't counterfeited overseas. That is just \none estimate by the Semiconductor Industry Association. Our \nsemiconductor manufacturers suffer about $7.5 billion in lost revenue. \nSo there is a safety issue and a mission threat issue here, first and \nforemost, but this is also an unnecessary and unfair blow to the \nAmerican economy and to American jobs.\n  This is what this amendment does. We are requiring the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to establish a program of enhanced inspection of \nelectronic parts imported from any country that is determined by the \nSecretary of Defense to be a significant source of counterfeit parts in \nthe DOD supply chain.\n  This amendment requires the Department of Defense and its suppliers \nto purchase electronic parts from original equipment manufacturers and \ntheir authorized dealers, or from trusted suppliers who meet \nestablished standards for detecting and avoiding counterfeit parts. It \nestablishes requirements for notification, inspection, testing, and \nauthentication of electronic parts that are not available from such \nsuppliers.\n  It requires the Department of Defense and DOD contractors who become \naware of counterfeit parts in the supply chain to provide written \nnotification to the Department of Defense inspector general, the \ncontracting officer, and the Government-Industry Data Exchange \nProgram--GIDEP--or a similar program designated by the Secretary of \nDefense.\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\n  The amendment would authorize Customs to share information with \noriginal component manufacturers from electronic parts inspected at the \nborder to the extent needed to determine whether an item is a \ncounterfeit.\n  It requires large Department of Defense contractors to establish \nsystems for detecting and avoiding counterfeit parts in their supply \nchains, and it authorizes the reduction of contract payments to \ncontractors who fail to develop adequate systems.\n  The amendment requires the Department of Defense to adopt policies \nand procedures for detecting and avoiding counterfeit parts in its own \ndirect purchases, and for assessing and acting upon reports of \ncounterfeit parts from Department of Defense officials and DOD \ncontractors.\n  The amendment authorizes the suspension and debarment of contractors \nwho repeatedly fail to detect and avoid counterfeit parts or otherwise \nfail to exercise due diligence in the detection and avoidance of \ncounterfeit parts.\n  The amendment also includes a bill Senator Whitehouse introduced that \nwas passed out of the Judiciary Committee to toughen criminal sentences \nfor counterfeiting military goods or services.\n  Finally, the amendment requires the Department of Defense to define \nthe term ``counterfeit part'' which is a critical and long overdue step \ntoward getting a handle on the problem.\n  We also make it clear that it is the supplier of the counterfeit part \nwho is going to pay for its replacement, and not the taxpayers of the \nUnited States.\n  This amendment touches the jurisdiction of two or three other \ncommittees, so we have sent this amendment to the other committees to \ntry to clear this amendment. The Judiciary Committee is one, and I \nthink Homeland Security is another, and I believe the Finance Committee \nis the third. We are hoping we can get prompt, positive response, but \nobviously we want to make sure those other committees are consulted and \nthat they concur. If not, we would have to then make changes in the \namendment, probably, in order to accommodate what those concerns are. \nBut there are some jurisdictional issues here which we are currently \nworking out.\n  I had an opportunity this morning, with Senator McCain, to talk to \nSenator Leahy, who was before our committee introducing a nominee, to \nalert him to the fact that we had this amendment which touched on the \njurisdiction of his committee. I hope by now the language of the \namendment has been shared with the staffs of those three committees--\nand I think I have them all--but we intend to do exactly that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Surely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it not also true that as the Senator mentioned, and I \nwish to emphasize, that Senator Whitehouse's Combating Counterfeiting \nMilitary Act is a part of this bill, so that would hopefully satisfy at \nleast the Judiciary Committee? I see the distinguished Senator from \nIowa here. He does not intend to address this issue, but I hope we can \nget the committees of jurisdiction involved in this as quickly as \npossible. I think this is an issue we should not delay too much longer.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, we do need to consult with those committees. That is \nunderway. I am hopeful the committees and their leaders will take a \nprompt look at this and see if there is any problem with the language \nfrom the perspective of their committees.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the chairman will further yield briefly, so we will \nnot voice vote this until we get the signoff of the relevant \ncommittees; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Constitutionality of PPACA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Supreme Court has \nagreed to hear the arguments in three cases challenging the \nconstitutionality of the health care reform law Congress passed 2 years \nago. I appreciate that the Obama administration asked the Supreme Court \nto hear this question. In light of the importance of these cases, I \nhave written to Chief Justice Roberts asking him to provide live audio \nand video coverage of the oral arguments.\n  The constitutionality of the health care law was the subject of a \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee last February. Regrettably, the \nJudiciary Committee would not hold such a hearing until after the bill \nbecame law. Those who voted for that law should have given these \nconstitutional questions more attention before they voted for the bill. \nToday I wish to discuss the issues that are presented in the cases, \nfocusing primarily on the constitutionality of the individual mandate \nand another recent appellate court ruling on that topic.\n  When Congress passed this law last year, we were told it would be \nvery popular and truly and clearly constitutional. Neither is true. \nPolls show that the law remains unpopular. The law's individual mandate \nprovision requires nearly all Americans who do not otherwise have \nhealth insurance to purchase such insurance or to pay a monetary \npenalty. That provision also raises serious constitutional questions \nabout the scope of congressional power to regulate interstate commerce.\n  Normally, the Supreme Court grants only 1 hour for oral argument. \nHere, the constitutional questions associated with the bill are so \ndifficult that the Supreme Court has decided to devote 5\\1/2\\ hours to \noral argument. The answers to the questions are not clear. Besides \nconsidering the commerce clause question, the Court will also hear oral \narguments on three other questions. The first is severability: Will the \nremainder of the law stand if the individual mandate is struck down? \nNormally, the Court does not even consider severability until it has \ndecided that a part of a statute is, in fact, unconstitutional. The \nfact that at least four Justices have voted to hear arguments on this \nquestion should cause uneasiness among those who are confident that the \nlaw is constitutional. The second issue is the constitutionality of the \nlaw's expansion of the Medicaid Program upon the States. The third is \nwhether procedurally the law can be challenged in the courts before it \nactually takes effect.\n  There is always the possibility that after all the briefs, all the \narguments, and all the public expectations, the Supreme Court will \nfinally resolve whether the health care law is, in fact, \nconstitutional. Conversely, the Court could determine that it is too \nsoon for it to rule on the issue because the law hasn't fully gone into \neffect.\n  Before the Supreme Court agreed to hear these cases, the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the DC Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was \nwithin the constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce. That \ncourt concluded that this result followed from existing Supreme Court \ndecisions. It also ruled that Congress could, therefore, require \nprivate individuals to purchase any product that Congress chose. The \nmajority opinion was written by Judge Laurence Silberman.\n  I respect Judge Silberman, but I strongly dispute his ruling and I \nwish to take this opportunity to outline my disagreements with Judge \nSilberman.\n  I think Judge Silberman has selectively read Supreme Court decisions. \nFor instance, he noted that no Supreme Court has ever held the commerce \nclause authority is limited to people who are currently engaging in an \nactivity that involves interstate commerce, but it is equally true that \nno Supreme Court case has ever held that the commerce clause covers \npeople who are not engaging in an activity and may never do so in the \nfuture. It is not clear why Judge Silberman focused only on the first \nformulation and did not consider the second. This omission is even more \npeculiar when compounded by his omission of the Supreme Court's \nrepeated skepticism of congressional claims that it can exercise a \npower that it never before discovered in more than 200 years of our \nconstitutional history. The Court has always been wary when a new power \nis claimed.\n  Judge Silberman recognized that the power claimed here to require \nthat the purchase of a product or service is novel, but he did not \ncontinue with the next step that the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\nwould have taken. Instead, the judge concluded that the argument \nagainst the power was equally novel.\n  I think it is common sense no one would have made such an argument if \nCongress had not claimed this power. For instance, when the Supreme \nCourt in the Plaut case ruled that Congress could not reinstate a \nstatute of limitations once it had expired, it pointed out that \nCongress had never done that. It did not belittle the argument against \nthe practice by characterizing it, as Judge Silberman did, as novel. In \nfact, the argument against the novel claimed power won.\n\n  Judge Silberman stated that Congress cannot regulate noneconomic \nbehavior based on a weak link to interstate commerce. He ruled that \nCongress cannot regulate intrastate economic activity that in the \naggregate does not substantially affect interstate commerce. Agreeing \nwith Judge Silberman, so far so good. But then he found that decisions \nwhether to purchase health insurance do affect interstate commerce. \nHowever, the Supreme Court has never ruled that Congress can regulate \ndecisions--in other words, thoughts--on whether to purchase a good or \nservice. The Court for decades has referred to the power of Congress to \nregulate activities that affect interstate commerce.\n  Since Congress cannot regulate noneconomic activities or intrastate \neconomic activities that have no combined effect on commerce, then it \nfollows naturally that Congress cannot regulate at all inactivity--such \nas refraining from buying a product.\n  Judge Silberman considered the ``activity'' argument and, in my mind, \nhe repeated an earlier error. He concluded that no Supreme Court case \nhad ever said that existing activity was necessary for Congress to \nexercise its power to regulate interstate commerce.\n  But it is just as true that many Supreme Court cases have described \nthe kinds of activities Congress may regulate under the commerce \nclause. Judge Silberman could have as accurately found that no Supreme \nCourt case has ever held that Congress has the power to regulate \ncommerce in the absence of an activity.\n  Another way Judge Silberman selectively read the Supreme Court \nprecedents is that he could have struck down the individual mandate \nconsistent with all Supreme Court precedents.\n  This point was confirmed in the Judiciary Committee hearing we held \nin February. I asked the witnesses whether the Supreme Court could \nstrike down the individual mandate without overruling any of these \nprecedents. The Republicans' witnesses both responded that the Court \ncould do so. The Democrats' witnesses identified no cases that would \nhave to be overturned. So not only is the individual mandate \nunconstitutional, but the Supreme Court could strike it down without \noverturning any of its precedents.\n  Judge Silberman disagreed. He said the mandate here is close to the \nfacts of Wickard v. Filburn, a famous 1942 Supreme Court decision that \nbroadly read the powers of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. \nThe Court then upheld the second Agricultural Adjustment Act. Under \nthat law, a farmer could be penalized for growing wheat on his own farm \neven for the use of his own family and livestock. He could not grow \nthat wheat if he exceeded his wheat quota. The homegrown wheat \nsubstituted for the wheat the farmer otherwise would have had to \npurchase on the open market, so the Court concluded that would depress \nthe price of wheat when combined with the actions of similar farmers \nall across the country. So, obviously, in Filburn, that farmer affected \ninterstate commerce. That may not make sense to us today, but it made \nsense in 1942, and it is still a precedent.\n  Judge Silberman, however, ruled that the regulation at issue in that \ncase is very similar to the individual mandate, which is an inactivity \nif you decide not to purchase it, and that any activity involved in the \nWickard case was incidental to simply owning a farm.\n  I take issue with that. The Wickard case differs conceptually from \nthe individual mandate. Farmer Filburn, in 1942, could avoid the \nregulation by ceasing to farm, by no longer engaging in the regulated \nactivity. In fact, that is true in all of the cases Judge Silberman \ncited. A person can avoid laws penalizing cultivation of marijuana by \nnot cultivating marijuana. A person can avoid laws criminalizing child \npornography by not downloading child pornography. A person can avoid \npublic accommodation regulations by not operating a public \naccommodation. Those are activities Congress can constitutionally \nregulate under the commerce clause.\n  But that is not the case with the individual mandate. You cannot \navoid being subject to that mandate. If you exist, if you are alive, an \nindividual in this country, you are regulated. And, of course, that is \nnot the situation with respect to any other decisions Judge Silberman \ncited. It is why he is, respectfully, wrong to find that the \ninfringements on liberty are the same in those cases as they are in the \nindividual mandate. The liberty of avoiding the regulation was \npreserved in the laws at issue in those cases. Liberty would prevail \nbecause you did not have to abide by the law if you were not in that \nbusiness, but not so with the individual mandate under the health care \nreform bill.\n  Moreover, I disagree with Judge Silberman's assertion that it is for \npolitical reasons and not constitutional ones that it took until 2010 \nfor Congress to conclude that the Constitution allows it to force \npeople to buy goods or services. If this power truly existed, Congress \nwould have exercised it frequently and long ago.\n\n  Why would Congress pass tax incentives to encourage people to buy \nhybrids if Congress could simply order you or anybody else to buy \nhybrids? Why would Congress give strong incentives for farmers not to \ngrow wheat so as to keep the price up when it could force people--the \nconsumer--simply to buy wheat? Why could it not raise the price of beef \nby requiring vegetarians to purchase it, so long as it did not require \nthem to eat that beef? Why would Congress take the political heat for \nraising taxes when it could order some people to pay third parties for \ngoods and services?\n  Even more sinister, Members of Congress could use this supposed power \nunder the commerce clause to entrench ourselves in office. Congress \ncould require that the goods and services Americans must purchase be \nlimited to those providers who contribute to the political party of the \nMembers. Or it could prohibit purchases from those providers who \ncontribute to the other political party. It could require people to buy \nhouses or cars or other products in areas where that political party \nhas its base of support. Sounds a little bit like Mussolini's Italy, \ndoesn't it?\n  Before the Supreme Court's Lopez decision, there were people who \nbelieved Wickard v. Filburn, since 1942, gave Congress the ability to \nregulate anything Congress chose to regulate. Then, in the Lopez case, \nthe Supreme Court ruled that the commerce clause did not permit \nCongress to regulate the possession of handguns near schools. At the \ntime, there was widespread fear among liberals that the power of \nCongress to regulate interstate commerce would be jeopardized. Those \nfears did not materialize. Similarly, today, people such as Judge \nSilberman again believe that Wickard v. Filburn gives Congress the \nability to regulate nearly anything it chooses and, therefore, the \nindividual mandate must be upheld. I do not agree.\n  Where I give Judge Silberman credit--and if you knew the man, you \nwould know this is his character--is in his intellectual honesty. \nUnlike the Obama administration, Judge Silberman recognizes the truth. \nIf Congress can force people to buy health insurance, he admits, it can \nforce people to buy any goods or services. It can regulate inactivity \nbecause it can affect interstate commerce. This is consistent with the \nopinion of the Congressional Budget Office, which wrote in a 1994 \nmemorandum that ``a mandate-issuing government'' could lead ``[i]n the \nextreme'' to ``a command economy, in which the President and the \nCongress dictated how much each individual and family spent on all \ngoods and services. . . . '' That is not the America our Constitution \nwriters envisioned.\n  At the oral arguments in the DC Circuit, the judges asked the Obama \nadministration lawyer if Congress could require Americans to buy \nbroccoli, or to buy cars to keep General Motors in business, or to set \nup mandatory retirement accounts in place of Social\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\nSecurity. The lawyer weaseled an answer, saying that ``It would \ndepend.'' That is not a principled position on the nature of the \nsupposed powers of Congress, which has no limit.\n  Judge Silberman is a former Ambassador to what used to be Yugoslavia. \nHe understands the difference between a command economy and a free \nmarket economy. What his decision implicitly states is that Wickard v. \nFilburn permits Congress to enact a command economy with no individual \neconomic freedom whatsoever. But our Constitution provides protections \nfor private property and for contracts. It establishes some form of a \nfree market system. Judge Silberman's interpretation may imply that \nWickard v. Filburn was wrongly decided and should be overturned, but I \ndo not believe it is necessary to overrule that decision, any more than \nit was necessary to reverse the Filburn case when they decided the \nLopez case.\n  Apart from cases, we need to go back to the basics. We should \nconsider first principles in evaluating the constitutionality of the \nindividual mandate in the health care reform bill. The people are \nsovereign in our country. The government serves the people, not the \nother way around. That is enforced through our Constitution. And that \nConstitution gives Congress just limited powers.\n  In the Federalist Papers, James Madison wrote that the powers of the \nFederal Government are few and are defined, and the powers of the \nStates are many and are undefined. Although there is much more \ninterstate commerce in today's economy than there was in 1787, the \npower is still limited. If Congress can require Americans to purchase \ngoods and services that Congress chooses, without a limiting principle, \nthen there is no limited Federal Government. There would be no issue \nthat Congress could not address at the Federal level. There would be no \nrange of State powers that the Federal Government cannot usurp. And \nthere would be no individual economic autonomy that the Federal \nGovernment must respect. Surely, the Constitution would not have been \nratified if Americans had understood it to permit such a result.\n  The upcoming Supreme Court decisions on the constitutionality of the \nindividual mandate are important, not only for the fate of that \nprovision but for their effect on the powers of the Federal Government \nand for the very survival of individual economic activity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1084\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the pending amendment. I \nrise in support of the Kirk-Manchin-Heller and Blunt amendment \nregarding Iran. What we know with regard to Iran is that they have \npersecuted 330,000 Baha'is in their country, registered their houses, \nkicked their kids out of university, made sure that they can do no \nbusiness with the Iranian Government.\n  We know Iran is the chief sponsor of the terrorist group Hezbollah \nthat has had a grip on southern Lebanon. We know Iran jumped the Shiite \ndivide to also support the terrorist group called Hamas in the Sunni \ncommunity.\n  We know Iran has been a state sponsor of terror as certified by \nPresidents Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and Obama.\n  We know Iran recently sentenced an Iranian actress to 90 lashes for \nappearing in an Australian movie without a headdress.\n  We know Iran recently arrested 70 of its fashion designers, for \ncrimes I cannot even imagine that they would have committed.\n  But, most importantly, we know the International Atomic Energy Agency \nhas certified that now Iran has enriched uranium far beyond what it \nneeds to run a civilian reactor program; that Iranian military \npersonnel have been involved in acquiring information on the design of \nnuclear weapons; that the Iranians are working on the details of a \nwarhead for their Shahab-3 missile that fits all of the profiles of a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Finally, we know, according to the Attorney General of the United \nStates, Eric Holder, that Iran and its Iranian Revolutionary Guards \nQuds force established a bomb plot with the Mexican cartel, the Zetas, \nto blow up a Georgetown restaurant, to kill a number of Americans, even \ntalked about possibly killing Senators, in an effort to assassinate the \nSaudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States here in Washington, DC.\n  I think it is clear with this bipartisan amendment that we all \nrecognize we are at a turning point and that we need new sanctions \nagainst Iran. Without crippling sanctions, I believe we have then \nturned the international community on the path toward war, likely \nbetween Iran and our allies, in Israel.\n  This would cause a needless loss of life. It would lead to higher \nenergy prices for the West, an increase in instability in Europe when \nwe can least afford it. Therefore, we need to level crippling \nsanctions, especially against the Iranian center of gravity, the \nCentral Bank of Iran.\n  The Central Bank of Iran is the principal funder of the Ahmadinejad \nregime itself. It is probably the source of funds so substantially \nprovided to terrorist groups by Iran to Hamas and Hezbollah. It is the \nCentral Bank of Iran that is supporting operations in Afghanistan and \nIraq against our allies there.\n  It is the Central Bank of Iran that is the principal underlying \nfinancial support for the Iranian nuclear program, and the Central Bank \nof Iran that is the paymaster for the Iranian Revolutionary Guards \nforce, especially their Quds force. Likely the money that was planned \nfor the Zetas to carry out the bomb plot in Washington, DC, had its \norigin point with the Central Bank of Iran.\n  That is why 92 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, despite these \npartisan times, have joined to say we should level this crippling \nsanction against the Central Bank of Iran.\n  I thank the 92 Senators who signed the Schumer-Kirk letter. \nIndications are that the Obama administration is going to take further \nactions on the Central Bank of Iran. This amendment lays out the full \nroadmap for what we should do.\n  What does the amendment do? It is patterned after the bipartisan \namendment adopted under the authorship of Democratic California \nCongressman Howard Berman, unanimously adopted in the House Foreign \nAffairs Committee, that says for any business, if you do business with \nthe Central Bank of Iran, you cannot do business with the United States \nof America.\n  We know that world financial arrangements and especially oil markets \nare complicated instruments, so under this bipartisan amendment we have \na 180-day timeclock to make sure that especially key allies and friends \nof the United States can unhook from Iranian oil and the financial ties \nthat bind them to Iran. This is particularly important for Turkey, for \nSri Lanka, for Italy, and for Greece, who would all use that time under \nthis amendment to unhook from Iran.\n  In this, I think we are going to have a very willing partner in the \nGovernment of Saudi Arabia, recently obviously focused on, because the \nIranians tried to kill their Ambassador to the United States. I will be \nmeeting with that Ambassador tomorrow. I think this amendment lays the \ngroundwork not just to work with Israel, not just to work with Saudi \nArabia, but our allies, to collapse the Central Bank.\n\n  Without action, I think we turn the Middle East and especially the \nPersian Gulf toward war. That is why we should take every nonmilitary \naction possible to avoid that conflict, to collapse the Central Bank of \nIran.\n  There are a number of bipartisan heroes in this story--Senator \nLieberman, who has been a key actor on these issues and a partner with \nme on many of these issues; Senator Gillibrand also who has helped out; \nobviously Senator Schumer, who was the coauthor of the 92-Senator \nletter on the Central Bank of Iran; Senator Menendez, who also has an \noutstanding idea on creating an Iranian oil-free zone; and obviously my \nbipartisan partner on this and best friend in the Senate, Senator \nManchin, who joined me on this effort.\n  Together, we can have a clear statement about what has happened with \nthe IAEA and the Iranian nuclear program, with their record on human \nrights, with their record on support for terrorism and, most \nimportantly, according to the Attorney General, with a brazen attempt \nto attack the United States directly with this bomb plot.\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\n  I urge Members of this Chamber to vote for this amendment, which is \nnow pending to the National Defense Authorization Act, because it puts \na clear statement forward, levels the toughest nonmilitary sanction we \nhad, helps reduce the chance for war or market and oil instability and \nhigher prices, and has such a strong bipartisan pedigree behind it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and as the ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, I \nwish to speak for a few moments and comment on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  I will begin by thanking the majority leader for honoring his \ncommitment to bring the National Defense Authorization Act to the floor \nfor debate, amendment, and passage. As Leader Reid pointed out this \nmorning, this would have been the first time in a half century in which \nwe would not have passed a national defense authorization bill. In the \nmidst of two wars, with our brave sons and daughters and husbands and \nwives fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, with our country facing a \nserious threat from radical Islamist terrorists, that would have been \nunacceptable.\n  I very much thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for their \nleadership. In this era that has been characterized by gridlock and \npartisanship in Washington, the Armed Services Committee has \nrepresented a welcome exception. The Senate Armed Services Committee \nhas a long-enjoyed, well-deserved reputation for professionalism and \nbipartisanship as we work across party lines to support our troops and \ntheir families who sacrifice so much for our country to keep us safe.\n  This bipartisan spirit is reflected by the fact that the Armed \nServices Committee unanimously reported the initial Defense \nauthorization bill out of committee this summer, and did so again this \nweek, after reducing the authorization levels consistent with the \nrequirements we need to meet, in light of the fiscal crisis our country \nfaces, and after revising the detainee compromise to take into \nconsideration some of the administration's concerns.\n  This year, once again, the quality of Senator Levin's and Senator \nMcCain's leadership is reflected in the quality of the legislation the \nArmed Services Committee has produced. This bill will ensure that our \nwar fighters have what they need to accomplish their missions, protect \nthemselves, and defend our country.\n  I am especially proud of the work of the Readiness Subcommittee. It \nhas been a pleasure to work with Chairman McCaskill. Our committee made \nsignificant, well-informed reductions that achieve taxpayer savings \nwithout endangering our military readiness.\n  However, going forward, I wish to raise one issue. We have to guard \nagainst excessive cuts to our readiness accounts that will leave our \ntroops and our Nation less prepared for future contingencies. In light \nof the supercommittee meeting in Washington, we have to come to an \nagreement to avoid what Secretary Panetta has described as catastrophic \nand a deep concern for our national security if those sequestration \ncuts occur.\n  I am particularly pleased key provisions of the Brown-Ayotte ``no \ncontracting with the enemy'' legislation are included in the bill. This \nprovision will make it easier for the Defense Department, contracting \nofficials in Central Command area operations, to void contracts with \ncontractors that, unfortunately, in some instances, have funneled \ntaxpayer dollars to our enemies.\n  Let me conclude by saying that, again, I very much appreciate the \nleadership and bipartisan nature of the work done on the Armed Services \nCommittee. This is a very important bill that I am very glad we are \ngoing to take up and fully debate in the Senate. I certainly urge my \ncolleagues to pass this bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1065\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 1065.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Ms. Ayotte], for herself, \n     Mr. McCain, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1065.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: Relating to the force structure for strategic airlift \n                               aircraft)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 136. STRATEGIC AIRLIFT AIRCRAFT FORCE STRUCTURE.\n\n       Section 8062(g)(1) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``October 1, 2009'' and inserting ``October \n     1, 2011''; and\n       (2) by striking ``316 aircraft'' and inserting ``301 \n     aircraft''.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, the amendment I have just offered to the \nDefense authorization bill is an amendment that Senator Reed from Rhode \nIsland is joining me in sponsoring.\n  The amendment itself would allow the Air Force to reduce its \nstrategic airlift aircraft inventory to what they need to meet our \nreadiness needs. It would save $1.2 billion of taxpayer money in the \nnext few years, without compromising the readiness we need to protect \nour Nation.\n  Our Nation's strategic air fleet provides global air mobility to the \nU.S. military. As GEN Raymond Johns, commander of the Air Force Air \nMobility Command, said in his statement in a hearing before the Armed \nServices Committee, where we had this amendment addressed:\n\n       The strategic airlift is a national asset allowing America \n     to deliver hope, to fuel the fight, and to save lives \n     anywhere in the world within hours of getting the call.\n\n  In order to meet this need, the United States uses C-5s and C-17s as \ntheir strategic airlift capability, and current Federal law sets the \nAir Force's minimum number of strategic aircraft at 316. However, the \nAir Force and the administration--when the Department of Defense \nsubmitted their budget request, they made very clear that we don't need \nto keep the minimum requirement at 316 to meet the needs of our \ncountry; that only a minimum requirement of 301 aircraft are needed to \nmeet the strategic airlift capacity requirements of our country. The \nrequirement to maintain the bottom-line limit of 316 is a situation \nwhere Congress is requiring the Air Force to maintain planes it does \nnot need to protect the readiness of our country. So it was the Air \nForce that wanted this amendment to be brought forward to ensure we can \nsave taxpayer dollars--over $1 billion.\n  This is very important at a time when we are asking our military, as \na result of the Budget Control Act, over the next 10 years, to reduce \nspending by close to $450 billion. So they have to look at areas where \nwe are spending money we don't need or where we are maintaining assets \nwe do not need to meet our readiness.\n  That is why I brought this amendment forward. It is a commonsense \namendment that I am so pleased Senator Reed has joined me on. I hope my \ncolleagues will support it in this time of great fiscal challenges. But \nthe need remains ever present to protect our national security against \nthose who would want to harm Americans and our allies for what we \nbelieve in.\n  We have to allow the Air Force and our Armed Forces to make sensible \ndecisions on where they need to put resources to protect our country. \nThat is what this amendment does. I will say we had a full hearing in \nthe subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee on the strategic \nairlift aircraft requirement. The military testified uniformly that \nreducing the number of the strategic airlift from 316 to 301 would put \nus in a very strong position to meet every contingency that we can \nanticipate going forward, including multiple contingencies around the \nworld, as well as homeland events.\n  This area has been studied very carefully. It will allow us to \ncontinue to\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\nprotect our country, but again, will save $1.2 billion in taxpayer \nmoney over the next few years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it correct that the U.S. Air Force not only supports \nthis but considers it one of their very high priorities?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes, this is a very high priority of the Air Force, \nbecause in this difficult time when they are making reductions, this is \nan area where they can meet our national security needs. Yet Congress \nhas actually asked the Air Force to maintain more planes than it needs. \nSo this is a commonsense provision that is very important to our Air \nForce.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In these times of very difficult budgetary decisions that \nare having to be made, is it not true also the President's budget in \n2011 had included a plan to retire 17 C-5As in 2011 and 5 in 2012?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes. Actually, this amendment I am bringing forward is \nconsistent with the administration's budget request they submitted for \nthe Congress's consideration. So this is a situation where, after a \ncareful hearing we had before a subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and after the administration had submitted its request, and \nafter the Air Force asked for this, it makes complete sense that we \nwould allow them to reduce this strategic airlift capacity.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask if any State where these aircraft are presently \nstationed would lose that mission or whether the older C-5s would \nconvert to new C-17s? Is that pretty much the conclusion the Senator \nwould draw from the Air Force plan?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. This is not going to be a diminishment for States. This \nis just going to be a right-sizing of the fleet.\n  What I am concerned about is if we don't pass amendments such as \nthis, where the administration has asked for it, where all of the data \nsupports that we don't need to keep the level at 316, and where we can \nsave $1.2 billion by doing it, how can we then ask our military to make \nsignificant reductions if we don't allow them to take such commonsense \naction such as this?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, and I hope we can \ndispose of this amendment. I don't know if a recorded vote would be \nrequired by any of the Members, but I hope we can voice vote it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for not only her comments about the committee work and myself \nand Senator McCain personally, but I want to tell her, and tell anyone \nwithin the sound of my voice, what a valuable member of our committee \nshe is. She is someone who is there all the time, and I very much value \nthe input she gives to us because of her regular presence at our \nhearings and our meetings. So I thank her for that as well as her \ncomments.\n  I also thank her for this amendment. It is a good amendment. I \nunderstand from my staff, and from what the Senator said as well, there \nwas a hearing held specifically on this subject, and that Senator Reed, \nas chairman, made a commitment to hold that hearing, as I understand \nit. He is a cosponsor of the amendment of Senator Ayotte. As far as I \ncan see, it is a good amendment, a sound amendment, and it does what \nSenator McCain said, as well as what the Senator from New Hampshire has \nsaid. It avoids spending money on something we can't afford to spend \nmoney on.\n  I don't know of any objection on this side, and I support the \namendment.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it true we are trying to clear the amendment on both \nsides at the moment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't know of an objection on this side. As far as I am \nconcerned, if there is no further debate, the Presiding Officer can put \nthe question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Chair to put it to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1065) was agreed to.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator Levin, \nand the ranking member, Senator McCain, for the immensely important \nwork they have done on the bill we are considering, S. 1867, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. It is a massively important bill, a \nbig bill, and I want to focus on one part of it--a seemingly small \nsection but a vitally important provision of the bill--that enables our \nDepartment of Defense to more effectively counter improvised explosive \ndevices, known as IEDs, which have been a major source of attacks \nagainst United States and coalition forces in the wars of Iraq and \nAfghanistan and threaten not only our troops there but all around the \nworld as well as our coalition partners.\n  I thank particularly one of my colleagues, Senator Bob Casey, who has \nbeen a champion of these efforts against the IEDs or roadside bombs for \nsome time. He has been a relentless and tireless leader in this effort \nand has included me and others, and I am proud to join him in seeking \nmore effective measures.\n  This summer saw the highest volume of IED incidents ever recorded in \nOperation Enduring Freedom, approximately 1,800 a month. That is a \nstaggering and alarming number, and they continue. These devices are \ndeadly and devastating, killing and maiming our troops and causing loss \nof limbs, traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress, and other \nhorrific injuries that are the signature wounds of the ongoing wars. In \nfact, roadside bombs cause 60 percent of all casualties in Afghanistan. \nThey are the hidden killers in this war.\n  I speak with the urgency of an elected official whose State citizens \nare at risk and who are returning with these signature wounds of war \nand whose lives and limbs can be preserved if we act effectively. I \nspeak as a citizen who has visited the hospitals and the troops who \nhave come back. We have all visited our constituents and their \nfamilies, their loved ones, their friends and neighbors who have been \nvictims of these terrible weapons of destruction.\n  Most IEDs in Afghanistan, in fact more than 80 percent, are made with \nmaterials originating in Pakistan. There is no magic bullet or panacea \nto solving this problem or addressing the challenge. It will take a \ncomprehensive fight. Both the provisions contained in the Foreign \nOperations appropriations bill with regard to Pakistan and the vital \nforce protection equipment in the Defense authorization bill are \nessential to shutting down the sources of bomb-making materials in \nPakistan. They include steps to interdict bomb-making materials at the \nborder and to provide the armor and force protection against the IED \nthreat.\n  Roadside bombs in Afghanistan are typically made with calcium \nammonium nitrate, a very common fertilizer. It is a seemingly innocent \nproduct but capable of detonation when processed and packaged in these \nroadside bombs and then placed in areas where our troops go. This \nfertilizer from Pakistan accounts for more than 80 percent of the IEDs \nin Afghanistan. Every day bags of this fertilizer are smuggled to \nAfghanistan from Pakistan, sometimes hidden in the convoys of goods \nthat cross the open 1,500-mile border. The fertilizer pellets are \nboiled down and the material is put in a package or container with an \nexplosive detonator that is often linked to a simple trigger system--\nsomething such as a tripwire buried in the sand awaiting the tire of a \npassing vehicle or the foot of an American soldier on patrol. At this \nmoment, thousands of our soldiers and Marines have been injured. \nThousands of these bombs are buried in Afghanistan soil and, sadly, \nmany more will be planted in the coming weeks and months.\n  Again, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, has been a \nleader in the Senate and, indeed, led a bipartisan group of Senators, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nmyself, in writing to the Secretary of State to request a greater \ndiplomatic effort by our government to encourage Pakistan to stem the \nflow of bomb-making materials into Afghanistan. Then, in August, we \nwent on an official trip, a CODEL, to take the message straight to the \nGovernment of Pakistan. We met with the most senior leaders of Pakistan \nand we urged stronger action against the misuse of everyday materials \nby terrorist groups in making the bombs that kill and maim our troops \nin Afghanistan. We took this message to officials of Pakistan at the \nhighest level, and they responded with a plan that is supposedly being \nimplemented.\n  The fact is, stronger measures are needed. We need a crackdown and a \nshutdown on the bomb-making materials, the fertilizer, and the calcium \nammonium nitrate that is transported and smuggled across the border so \nthat it can be made into bombs and maim and kill troops from \nConnecticut and from across the country--troops who are innocent \nvictims--and the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan themselves who have \nbecome victims.\n  We saw firsthand how our troops seek to protect themselves from these \nIEDs. In fact, at a sand-swept compound in Helmand Province in \nAfghanistan our congressional delegation saw the most common types of \nprotective practices and devices, including how our soldiers and \nmarines wear body armor, lie face down in the dirt and drag a 10-foot \npole with a hook on the end on the ground to look for the telltale \nsigns of an IED. Other measures range from the use of dogs that sniff \nout bombs to huge armor vehicles and more advanced technology. But even \nwith the most effective and advanced means of detection and disarming \nbombs, body armor is still essential to protecting our troops.\n  Pakistan's plan to address the IED smuggling supply chain, which is a \nthreat to its own people as well as our soldiers and marines, has yet \nto prove effective. The plan addresses border security, regulation of \nfertilizer materials, and promoting public awareness of the threat \nposed by these IEDs. But we cannot rely on Pakistan's goodwill to \nensure this important work is given the priority it requires.\n  There can be no ambiguity, no doubt, no uncertainty in our \nrelationship with Pakistan, and that is why I support the even stronger \nmeasures Senator Casey has championed in a process he has suggested \nthat would withhold any assistance if verification cannot be \naccomplished. The Pakistanis need to prove with action, not mere plans \nor conferences, that they are stemming and stopping the flow of \nfertilizer. They need to prove more than good will or good intentions \nbut effective action to stem and stop the flow of all of the bomb-\nmaking materials across the border.\n  We also must support efforts by the Department of Defense to procure \nand deploy body armor and equipment, such as this bill does, that \nprotects all our troops in harm's way. We are all familiar with the \nforce protection development such as enhanced ceramic plates and \nredesigning vehicles with V-shaped hulls to deflect blast impact. These \nadvances, make no mistake, came at great expense in terms of blood and \ntreasure to our Nation. We learned how to properly equip our troops in \nsome respects for these measures. But even as the end of Operation \nEnduring Freedom is now in sight, the requirement to develop even \nbetter protection continues and it must be relentless and tireless.\n  We cannot abandon our efforts. We simply cannot abandon this fight to \nprotect our troops in the field. The lessons learned will serve to \nhonor our commitment to ensure that the brave men and women who protect \nour freedom and protect our safety and security have the best \nprotection we can provide them.\n  Enhanced ballistic armor, including underwear protection--or blast \nboxers--are essential to combatting the threat of roadside bombs. When \nan IED detonates against dismounted troops, it blasts sand and \nfragments that shred skin, literally tears apart the skin of our \ntroops. Covering their legs and groin area with flexible armor can \nprevent amputation of a limb or worse.\n  I have asked and been informed about delivery of this equipment. To \ndate, 165,000 of the tier 1 sets of blast protection have been \ndelivered into theater. The Marine Corps received 15,000 sets of tier \n2-level protection, delivered 4 days ahead of schedule. By the middle \nof next month, the Army will also receive its complete requirement of \ntier 2-level sets.\n  This armor was adapted from one of our allies, British forces, and \nthe Army has now established domestic production of the equipment. I am \nhopeful that additional types of protection will also be processed and \nproduced and sent and I hope it will be expeditiously.\n  When I learned of this lifesaving equipment and the challenges \ninvolved in delivery, I wrote to the Department of Defense urging swift \ndelivery of the body armor. I was joined by colleagues Senators Casey, \nBennet, and Whitehouse. I am hopeful this program will be an example of \nour body armor procurement system working effectively. I am hopeful it \nwill set an example and provide a model for this body armor being \nprovided expeditiously, as it is needed. I look forward to our passing \nthe Defense authorization bill, which continues these efforts to supply \nbody armor and equipment needed for troops in Afghanistan.\n  This bill provides also for the equipment needed to interdict IEDs, \nfrom the small backpacks carried by our troops to UAVs to giant Buffalo \nvehicles. Interdiction also requires the right specialized equipment to \ndetect materials to make those IEDs as they are smuggled across the \nporous Afghan-Pakistan border. This effort also requires training and \nawareness of both our military personnel and our allies in this fight. \nAs of September 2011, the Afghan border police had 20,852 personnel. \nThis growth is encouraging.\n  But the border police have problems with endemic corruption, and they \nare effective only to the extent that our special forces augment this \neffort. Our special forces, our special operators, should be encouraged \nand enabled to continue this effort. Interdiction is an integral part \nto larger efforts to understand battles based in this region. Force \nalone can't solve this problem. We need better intelligence and the \nright detection equipment, combined with the efforts of our special \nforces. It must be truly a comprehensive effort, as the Defense \nauthorization bill clearly recognizes. We need to show all who live on \nboth sides of this border that the cost of supplying the ingredients of \nthese bombs that kill and maim our troops is too high for them, just as \nit is too high for us to tolerate.\n  Let me again thank chairman Senator Levin and ranking member Senator \nMcCain for their recognition of this problem. Our Nation has spent more \nthan $\\1/2\\ trillion in support of the war in Afghanistan. We have \nsustained more than 2,800 coalition casualties. An Afghanistan that is \nstable and self-sufficient certainly is our goal, and it depends upon \nthe tactical success of these efforts.\n  IEDs remain the weapon of choice of our enemy. Should we not learn to \nsuccessfully counter the threat of IEDs, we will see this asymmetrical \nthreat repeated on the battlefield, wherever our troops are deployed \naround the world.\n  Given the enormity of this challenge, I urge my colleagues to remain \ncommitted to this goal, remain true to this strategy, and counter these \nIEDs. We must authorize both our foreign operations expenses and this \nbill and I thank my colleagues for their truly bipartisan support of \nthese efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. As to the floor privileges, Mr. President, let me just \ncomment how valuable these Navy fellows are in our offices. I am very \ngrateful for LCDR Knisley's service in my office, and I know Senator \nWicker feels the same.\n  LCDR Shane Knisley will be leaving my office next month, and I wish \nto thank him very much for the service he has provided in the Senate.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to be asking \nunanimous consent that the Senate take up to confirm the nomination of \nKen Kopocis to be Assistant Administrator for the Office of Water for \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Before I make that unanimous consent request, I wish to just take a \nmoment to say a few words about this nominee and the process that has \ntaken place in Senate.\n\n[[Page S7654]]\n\n  I have known Ken Kopocis since I was first elected to Congress in \n1986 and have worked personally with him on a number of water-related \nissues. Ken has extensive background in water policy and legislative \nissues, having worked at the Congress for 25 years. I worked with him \nfirst when I was in the House of Representatives. I know the Presiding \nOfficer also, when he was in the House, remembers the good work Ken did \nfor the House of Representatives. He has now worked, of course, in the \nSenate.\n  He has played a role in crafting and defending numerous pieces of \nenvironmental legislation, including the Clean Water Act. At a time \nwhen there are so many controversial issues concerning water issues in \nthe Congress, I think it is important we have someone at the helm who \nhas the confidence of Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  I have the honor of chairing the Subcommittee on Water and Wildlife \nin the Environment & Public Works Committee. Ken Kopocis enjoys the \nconfidence of all the members of our committee.\n  When his nomination was considered in the Environment & Public Works \nCommittee back in July--that is when we took it up--Ken was praised by \nboth Republicans and Democrats alike. Most of my colleagues have had \nthe opportunity to work with him, and they are enthusiastic about his \ncredentials and his levelheaded bipartisan approach to every issue.\n  It is time the Senate take up this confirmation. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 403, that the nomination be \nconfirmed with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions \nbe in order to the nomination; that any statements related to the \nnomination be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. There are \nstill questions that need to be answered and information that needs to \nbe provided by Mr. Kopocis.\n  I am concerned about the depth of his past involvement to change the \nscope of the Clean Water Act beyond congressional intent. To me, this \nnominee still needs to explain his views on public and stakeholder \ninput on regulations he would be in charge of and explain his \nunderstanding--his understanding--of the role of Congress versus the \nrole of the Environmental Protection Agency in terms of who makes the \nlaws in this country.\n  Until those issues are clarified, I do not believe it is appropriate \nfor this nominee to move forward.\n  Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor in just a \nmoment.\n  Let me say to my friend from Wyoming, I am going to do my best to \nmake sure the Senator gets all the information he needs. I wish to make \nsure every Senator has all the information they need. I think this is a \nvery important position to be filled. Mr. Kopocis has the \nqualifications and confidence. I wish to make sure that is done as \nquickly as possible. I respect my colleague's views, and I will work to \nmake sure he gets all the information he needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Udall, is coming over to propose an amendment and I \nhope that will happen momentarily and I hope Members will be prepared \nwith other amendments that we can dispose of this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the \nfiscal year 2012 national defense authorization bill.\n  As ranking member on the Seapower Subcommittee, I wish to thank both \nChairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for their leadership. It is \nsomewhat of an achievement in actually getting the bill to the floor at \nthis time, and I appreciate their determination.\n  As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday next week, I would like to \ntake a moment to honor the men and women of our Armed Forces. We are \ngrateful for their service, and our thoughts and prayers are with those \nnow deployed at sea and ashore. My own State of Mississippi is home to \nmany brave servicemembers. Their sacrifices are matched, of course, by \nthose of their families who have supported them day in and day out as \nthey selflessly serve this country.\n  As ranking member of the Seapower Subcommittee, I have had the \npleasure of working with my friend Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who is \nchairman of that subcommittee. We both worked to ensure that this bill \nmeets a wide range of procurement, sustainment and research and \ndevelopment needs for the Navy and the Marine Corps.\n  Our deliberations were informed by, among other things, a series of \nhearings we held that addressed force structure and modernization for \nthe Department of the Navy. This process has resulted in a bill that \ncontains provisions which will deliver important capabilities and \nsupport our sailors and marines.\n  The bill before us is supportive of the President's shipbuilding \nbudget request and contributes to the continued vitality of our \nshipbuilding industrial base which is very important. At a time when we \nare concerned about job creation, the last thing we want to do is let \nour industrial base be chipped away.\n  The fiscal year 2012 shipbuilding budget funds new construction for \nvarious types and classes of ships, including an aircraft carrier, \namphibious ships, submarines, and large and small surface combatants, \ntotaling more than $15 billion.\n  From our discussions during the Seapower Subcommittee meetings, it \nhas become abundantly clear that members are concerned about challenges \nin maintaining fleet capacity among many classes of ships and the \ncapability gaps that exist that have a real effect on the sailors who \ncrew these ships. From amphibious ships to aircraft carriers to \ndestroyers and to submarines, our Navy must maintain an adequate \nbalance among all classes of ships to ensure our Navy can execute these \nresponsibilities.\n  Through classified briefings we have received from senior officials \nin the Navy and in the intelligence community, the Seapower \nSubcommittee also is well aware of the imminent and emerging threats \nfacing our sea services. America must maintain its capability to \nproject power and uphold our obligations to our friends and allies \nthroughout the world. This means robust investment in seapower, and I \nam heartened that this bill contains such an investment.\n  With the Deficit Reduction Committee's recommendations due to \nCongress in less than 1 week, I know all my colleagues agree that \ncutting our deficit and reducing our national debt responsibly is a \nmust. Failing to act will put the burden on our children and \ngrandchildren. We must make tough decisions now on spending because our \ncurrent track is unsustainable.\n  I hope the Deficit Reduction Committee is able to come to an \nagreement on spending priorities because the alternative is \nunacceptable cuts in national defense. We must remember that national \ndefense is solely a Federal responsibility. Failure to reach consensus \nwould have grave consequences for our military. Marine Corps Commandant \nGEN James Amos cautioned about such cuts earlier this week.\n  In conclusion, I believe the national defense authorization bill \nreaffirms our commitment to national security and to our men and women \nin uniform.\n  I urge my colleagues to act quickly on this important piece of \nlegislation, and once again I thank and commend my friends, Chairman \nLevin and Ranking Member McCain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7655]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I come to the floor to comment \non the NDAA, the bill in front of us today. I want to start my remarks \nby acknowledging the leadership of Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nMcCain. Under their tutelage and leadership the committee has worked \ntirelessly to craft a Defense Authorization Act that provides our Armed \nForces with the equipment, the services, the training, and the overall \nsupport they need to keep us safe while they themselves are being \nprotected. I thank the chairman and ranking member, my colleagues, and, \nmost important, the wonderful staff that works for us for their \ndiligence and dedication to this important work.\n  I also come to the floor to speak out against a proposed change that \nI think would alter what has been a very effective set of terrorist \ndetention policies and procedures. I believe to make those changes \nwould complicate our capacity to prosecute the war on terror and call \ninto question the principles we as Americans hold dear.\n  I filed an amendment, No. 1107, that would take a look at what is \nproposed in the NDAA. We have a solemn obligation to pass the National \nDefense Authorization Act. But we also have a solemn obligation to make \nsure those who are fighting the war on terror have the best, most \nflexible, most powerful tools possible. I have to say again, and I will \nsay it more than two times in my remarks, I am worried these changes we \nare about to push through would actually hurt our national security.\n  I am a proud member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As I have \nimplied, and I want to be explicit, I understand the importance of this \nbill. I understand what it does for our military, which is why, in sum, \nwhat I am going to propose with my amendment is that we pass the NDAA \nwithout these troubling provisions but with a mechanism by which we can \nconsider what is proposed and perhaps at a later date include any \napplicable changes in the law.\n  We need to hear from the Department of Defense, our intelligence \ncommunity, and the administration more broadly on what our men and \nwomen in the field actually need to effectively prosecute the war on \nterror, especially before we change detainee policies that are already \nworking. As I am saying, I have serious concerns about the detainee \nprovisions that have been included in the bill.\n  In my opinion, and in the opinion of many others--and I will share \nthose opinions and insights with my colleagues--these provisions \ndisrupt the capacity of the executive branch to enforce the law, and \nthey impose unwise and unwarranted restrictions on our ability to \naggressively combat international terrorism. In so doing, they inject \nlegal uncertainty and ambiguity that may only complicate the military's \noperations and detention practices.\n  I am not the only one who has serious concerns. The Secretary of \nDefense has urged us to oppose these new provisions. Both chairmen of \nthe Intelligence and Judiciary Committees strongly oppose them. The \nPresident's team is recommending a veto. These are people whose \nopinions should be carefully considered before we put these new \nproposals into our legal framework.\n  In the Statement of Administration Policy the White House states:\n\n       We have spent 10 years since September 11, 2001, breaking \n     down the walls between intelligence, military and law \n     enforcement professionals; Congress should not now rebuild \n     those walls and unnecessarily make the job of preventing \n     terrorist attacks more difficult.\n\n  Those are striking words that should give us all pause as we face \nwhat seems to me a bit of a rush to submit these untested and legally \ncontroversial restrictions on our ability to prosecute terrorists.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the entire Statement of \nAdministration Policy printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, these are complex issues that \nhave far-reaching consequences for intelligence, civilian law \nenforcement agencies, and our intelligence community as they work to \nkeep Americans safe from harm. Despite this fact, the Department of \nDefense and the national security staff, as far as I know, had little \nopportunity to review or comment on the final language in the \nprovisions. As a result, these provisions restrained the ``Executive \nBranch's options to utilize, in a swift and flexible fashion, all the \ncounterterrorism tools that are now legally available.''\n  That quote comes directly from a letter addressed to the Armed \nServices Committee from Secretary Panetta. I think we all know that \nbefore he held the job he has now, Secretary of Defense, Mr. Panetta, \nwas the Director of the CIA. He very well knows the threats facing our \ncountry, and he knows we cannot afford to make mistakes when it comes \nto keeping our citizens safe.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Secretary Panetta's letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, the provisions I am speaking to \nare well intended. I have much admiration for my colleagues who propose \nthem, but I think we need to take some more time to consider the \nramifications. The United States, our country, can currently choose \nfrom several options when prosecuting terrorists. That flexibility has \nallowed us to try, convict, and imprison hundreds of terrorists, and it \nallows the government to select the venue that will provide the highest \nlikelihood of obtaining a conviction. The current detention provisions \nin the bill we are debating would strip away that flexibility and \npotentially impair our capacity to successfully prosecute and convict \nterrorists. It is not clear to me why, after 10 years of successfully \nprosecuting terrorists and preventing another 9/11-like attack, why we \nwould want to limit our options while our enemies are constantly \nadapting their tactics and expanding their efforts to do us harm.\n\n  In a recent op-ed in the Chicago Times, a bipartisan group of three \nformer Federal judges, including William S. Sessions, who was also the \nappointed Director of the FBI under President Reagan, said it best when \ndescribing these provisions:\n\n       Legislation now making its way through Congress would seek \n     to over-militarize America's counterterrorism efforts, \n     effectively making the U.S. military the judge, jury and \n     jailer of terrorism suspects to the exclusion of the FBI and \n     local and State law enforcement agencies. As former Federal \n     judges, we find this prospect deeply disturbing. Not only \n     would such an effort ignore 200 years of legal precedent, it \n     would fly in the face of common sense.\n\n  And I ask unanimous consent that op-ed be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I also point out these provisions raise \nserious questions as to who we are as a society and what our \nConstitution seeks to protect. One section of these provisions, section \n1031, could be interpreted as allowing the military to capture and \nindefinitely detain American citizens on U.S. soil. Section 1031 \nessentially repeals the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 by authorizing the \nmilitary to perform law enforcement functions on American soil. That \nalone should alarm my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. But there \nare other problems with these provisions that must be resolved.\n  These detainee provisions are unnecessary, counterproductive, and \npotentially harmful to our counterterrorism efforts. I know I have said \nthis a couple of times already, but it feels as though they are being \nrushed through in a manner that does not serve us well. The Department \nof Defense has had little input. There have been no hearings. Earlier \nthis week the changes were presented to us in the Armed Services \nCommittee just hours before we were asked to vote on them. These are \njust too important a set of questions to let them pass without a \nthorough review and far greater understanding of their\n\n[[Page S7656]]\n\neffect on our national security and our fight against terrorism. It \nfeels to this Senator that we are rushing hastily to address a solution \nin search of a problem. We ought to hear from the Department of \nDefense, the intelligence community, our colleagues, and other relevant \ncommittees before we act. Do we believe this Congress--again, let me \nunderline that after 10 years of successfully prosecuting the war on \nterror--should substitute its views for that of our Defense, \nintelligence, and Homeland Security leadership without careful \nanalysis?\n\n  I recently received a letter signed by 18 retired military leaders in \nopposition to these provisions. The letter states that: ``Mandating \nmilitary custody would undermine legitimate law enforcement and \nintelligence operations crucial to our security at home and abroad.'' I \ncould not agree more.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 4.)\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. We are already trying and convicting \nterrorists in both civilian courts and under military commissions. The \nprovisions that are in this bill would require the DOD to shift \nsignificant resources away from their mission, to act on all the fronts \nall over the world, and they would become a police force and jailer. \nThis is not what they are good at. This is not what we want them to do. \nI think it has potentially dangerous consequences because we have \nlimited resources and limited manpower. We would not lose anything by \ntaking a little bit more time to discuss and debate these provisions, \nbut we could do real harm to our national security by allowing this \nlanguage, unscrutinized, to pass, and that is exactly what our highest \nranking national security officers are warning us against doing.\n  This is a debate we need to have. It is a healthy debate, but we \nought to be armed with all of the facts and expertise before we move \nforward. The least we can do is take our time, be diligent, and hear \nfrom those who will be affected by these new limitations on our ability \nto prosecute terrorists.\n  It concerns me that we would tell our national security leadership--a \nbipartisan national security leadership, by the way--that we would not \nlisten to them and that Congress knows better than they do. It doesn't \nstrike me that that is the best way to secure and protect the American \npeople. That is why I have filed amendment No. 1107. I think it is a \ncommonsense alternative that will protect our constitutional principles \nand beliefs while also allowing us to keep our Nation safe. The \namendment has a clear aim, which is to ensure we follow a thorough \nprocess and hear all views before rushing forward with new laws that \ncould be harmful to our national security.\n  What is in the amendment? It is straightforward. Specifically the \namendment would require that our Defense, intelligence, and law \nenforcement agencies report to Congress with recommendations for any \nadditional authorities or flexibility they need in order to detain and \nprosecute terrorists. In other words, let's not put the cart before the \nhorse or fix something that is not broken. Let's first hear from the \nstakeholders as to what laws they believe need to be changed to give \nthem better tools to do their job.\n  My amendment then asks for hearings to be held so we can fully \nunderstand the views of respected national security experts. Moreover, \nit would require input from each of the relevant committees to ensure \nthat we have carefully considered the benefits and consequences of our \nactions. The chairmen of our Judiciary and Intelligence Committees have \ndeep concerns about the detainee provisions in the pending legislation. \nAnd, of course, as we underwent this process, the existing laws that \nguide our actions today would remain in place. They have been \nsuccessful.\n  I see some of my colleagues who I think share my views who have come \nto the floor. They also made the compelling case that it is a system \nthat is working. Why would we change it without thinking it through? It \nis straightforward, it is common sense, and it allows us to make sure \nwe will win the war on terror.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Colorado yield for a question, \nthrough the Chair?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Colorado for his strong \nstatement and totally support his position. This change in the Defense \nauthorization bill goes beyond a military decision. It goes to the \nfundamental questions of principles of our Constitution and our body of \nlaw. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe this \nmatter should have been considered as well by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and I believe Senator Feinstein has expressed the feeling \nthat it should have been considered as well by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I wish to use one example to ask the Senator from Colorado a \nquestion. When we had the so-called Underwear Bomber, the passenger on \na commercial aircraft who tried to detonate a bomb--and thank God was \nunsuccessful--he was subdued, arrested, and interrogated by the Federal \nBureau of Investigation in Detroit. After that investigation was \nunderway--and he surrendered some information--he stopped talking, at \nwhich point the FBI investigators read him his Miranda rights.\n\n  Then later, working with his parents, he resumed talking to the \ninvestigators and literally--according to the FBI--gave a dramatic \namount of information helpful to us in keeping America safe and \nstopping terrorism. He was then prosecuted in the criminal courts of \nAmerica, article 3 courts, and ultimately, weeks ago, pled guilty.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator state his question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am going to. I would say to the Senator from Arizona, I \nthink it is important we take some time on this important issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say it is important that all voices be heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator McCain, of course, as the ranking member, will \nhave ample opportunity to express his point of view.\n  What I am asking the Senator from Colorado is this: Taking into \nconsideration the language that is now being presented in this Defense \nauthorization bill, particularly section 1032, it is my understanding \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation could not have continued their \ninterrogation of this suspected terrorist without first contacting our \nmilitary and bringing them in to determine whether they had \njurisdiction over this matter. In other words, time would have been \nlost, opportunities would have been lost, information might have been \nlost by following the new section in the bill.\n  I am asking the Senator from Colorado if this is a decision which he \nbelieves we should make in the haste of a Defense authorization bill or \nought to step back and work with the President of the United States, \nthe FBI, the military, and our intelligence forces to make sure we do \nnot lose an opportunity to catch an alleged terrorist, to interrogate \nthem, and to keep this country safe.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nquestion. My understanding is the Senator from Illinois is correct, \nthat provision 1032 would change the way in which interrogations would \nunfold. There may be some in the Senate who would see it differently, \nbut that is all the more reason to adopt my amendment, which would \nallow a thorough process of hearing from the very experts who \ninterrogated the Underwear Bomber and other experts who have been on \nthe front lines in fighting terrorism. We ought to go slow. We should \nnot fix something that is working fine right now.\n  I thank the Senator for his question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Arizona will forgive me, I would ask \none more question through the Chair. The question goes back to the \npoint the Senator made: Section 1031, as I understand it, would be a \ndeparture from current law and would say that those who are American \ncitizens can be detained indefinitely if they are suspected of certain \nterrorist conduct. I ask the Senator from Colorado: Is that the point \nthe Senator made in his statement?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. The Senator from Illinois is correct. Mr. \nPresident, 1031 would do just that, and it would come directly at a \npiece of law, posse comitatus, which dates back to the Civil War, that \nis held dear by all of us in America because it distinguishes between \nthe military used to protect us\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\nagainst foreign foes and how we manage our own civil affairs here at \nhome.\n  Also, as the Senator alludes to, it causes questions to be raised \nabout something that is very sacred in our system of law, which is the \nwrit of habeas corpus. You have to prove why you hold someone. You \ncannot detain an American citizen indefinitely in any other \ncircumstance.\n  I thank the Senator for his questions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We explicitly wrote into this bill the following language: \nthat the procedures providing for the determination that somebody is an \nAl-Qaida terrorist or related, affiliated one is not required to be \nimplemented until after the conclusion of the interrogation session, \nwhich is ongoing at the time the determination is made.\n  Is the Senator familiar with that language which explicitly says that \nthe President will adopt the procedures--whatever procedures the \nPresident determines--to make sure there is no interference with an \nongoing interrogation by the civilians as it appears in section 2(c) on \npage 363? Is the Senator familiar with that?\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I am familiar with the language in the general \nway it has been introduced. I would say to the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee that we had a chance to review this language \nstarting about 48 hours ago.\n  One of the reasons I think my amendment is important is it would give \nthose voices, which are being heard more and more as of today, who have \nconcerns with this provision--they are not sure how it applies--that \nthat is all the more reason to slow this down, to keep the existing law \nin place, and go through a more thorough process to understand the \nramifications of the waiver provision and the other provisions the \nchairman and ranking member----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it not true, however, that the language which is in \nthis bill that I just read clearly provides there will not be any \ninterference with an interrogation session, that those procedures are \nto be determined by the President, and that it explicitly says there \nwill not be any interference with the interrogation and the procedures \nwill guarantee there will not be? That is the point of this language.\n  I don't understand how the statement could be made that this language \nin this bill interferes with the interrogation by civilian authorities \nand the FBI when the very language here says they will not interfere \nwith that interrogation. I wonder if the Senator could explain to me \nhis agreement with the Senator from Illinois that something in this \nbill would result in an interference with an interrogation.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. What I would say to my friend is that just \nhaving had an opportunity to review this language in the last 48 hours, \nI have no question about his intent, but I have heard from people with \nmuch greater expertise than I have that there are questions that are \nstill unanswered. Maybe this provision is appropriate and will do what \nthe chairman says it will do. But, again, that is why I think it would \nbe well worth our time to take a further look at what is involved in \nthese provisions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do appreciate the Senator's response. I have one other \nquestion, and that has to do with an American citizen who is captured \nin the United States and the application of the custody pending a \nPresidential waiver to such a person. I wonder whether the Senator is \nfamiliar with the fact that the language which precluded the \napplication of section 1031 to American citizens was in the bill we \noriginally approved in the Armed Services Committee, and the \nadministration asked us to remove the language which says that U.S. \ncitizens and lawful residents would not be subject to this section.\n  Is the Senator familiar with the fact that it was the administration \nwhich asked us to remove the very language which we had in the bill \nwhich passed the committee, and that we removed it at the request of \nthe administration that this determination would not apply to U.S. \ncitizens and lawful residents? Is the Senator familiar with the fact \nthat it was the administration which asked us to remove the very \nlanguage, the absence of which is now objected to by the Senator from \nIllinois?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I am familiar now because the Senator from \nMichigan has shared that fact with me. I am also familiar with the fact \nthat the administration has other questions and concerns which has \ncaused it to issue a set of provisions and issues they wish to further \nconsider.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I would be happy to yield to my friend from \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is the Senator from Colorado aware that the administration \nhas raised real concerns--both DOD and the White House--saying that \nrequiring the President to devise the kind of procedures discussed in \nthis bill creates all kinds of problems, and that this is one of the \nreasons why both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee have asked to have the opportunity to hold hearings \non a section that obviously involves the jurisdiction of both the \nSenate Intelligence and Senate Judiciary Committees?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I am. The Senator from Vermont is correct. \nThat knowledge on my part is, in part, one of the reasons I filed the \namendment we are discussing right now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2011.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n S. 1867--National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2012--(Sen. Levin, \n                                 D-MI)\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 1867, the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2012. \n     The Administration appreciates the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee's continued support of our national defense, \n     including its support for both the base budget and for \n     overseas contingency operations and for most of the \n     Administration's initiatives to control spiraling health \n     costs of the Department of Defense (DoD).\n       The Administration appreciates the support of the Committee \n     for authorities that assist the ability of the warfighter to \n     operate in unconventional and irregular warfare, authorities \n     that are important to field commanders, such as the \n     Commanders' Emergency Response Program, Global Train and \n     Equip Authority, and other programs that provide commanders \n     with the resources and flexibility to counter unconventional \n     threats or support contingency or stability operations. The \n     Administration looks forward to reviewing a classified annex \n     and working with the Congress to address any concerns on \n     classified programs as the legislative process moves forward.\n       While there are many areas of agreement with the Committee, \n     the Administration would have serious concerns with \n     provisions that would: (1) constrain the ability of the Armed \n     Forces to carry out their missions; (2) impede the Secretary \n     of Defense's ability to make and implement decisions that \n     eliminate unnecessary overhead or programs to ensure scarce \n     resources are directed to the highest priorities for the \n     warfighter; or (3) depart from the decisions reflected in the \n     President's FY 2012 Budget Request. The Administration looks \n     forward to working with the Congress to address these and \n     other concerns, a number of which are outlined in more detail \n     below.\n       Detainee Matters: The Administration objects to and has \n     serious legal and policy concerns about many of the detainee \n     provisions in the bill. In their current form, some of these \n     provisions disrupt the Executive branch's ability to enforce \n     the law and impose unwise and unwarranted restrictions on the \n     U.S. Government's ability to aggressively combat \n     international terrorism; other provisions inject legal \n     uncertainty and ambiguity that may only complicate the \n     military's operations and detention practices.\n       Section 1,031 attempts to expressly codify the detention \n     authority that exists under the Authorization for Use of \n     Military Force (Public Law 107-40) (the ``AUMF''). The \n     authorities granted by the AUMF, including the detention \n     authority, are essential to our ability to protect the \n     American people from the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its \n     associated forces, and have enabled us to confront the full \n     range of threats this country faces from those organizations \n     and individuals. Because the authorities codified in this \n     section already exist, the Administration does not believe \n     codification is necessary and poses some risk. After a decade \n     of settled jurisprudence on detention authority, Congress \n     must be careful not to open a whole new series of legal \n     questions that will distract from our efforts to protect \n     the country. While the current language minimizes many of \n     those risks, future legislative action must ensure that \n     the codification in statute of express\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\n     military detention authority does not carry unintended \n     consequences that could compromise our ability to protect \n     the American people.\n       The Administration strongly objects to the military custody \n     provision of section 1032, which would appear to mandate \n     military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects. \n     This unnecessary, untested, and legally controversial \n     restriction of the President's authority to defend the Nation \n     from terrorist threats would tie the hands of our \n     intelligence and law enforcement professionals. Moreover, \n     applying this military custody requirement to individuals \n     inside the United States, as some Members of Congress have \n     suggested is their intention, would raise serious and \n     unsettled legal questions and would be inconsistent with the \n     fundamental American principle that our military does not \n     patrol our streets. We have spent ten years since September \n     11, 2001, breaking down the walls between intelligence, \n     military, and law enforcement professionals; Congress should \n     not now rebuild those walls and unnecessarily make the job of \n     preventing terrorist attacks more difficult. Specifically, \n     the provision would limit the flexibility of our national \n     security professionals to choose, based on the evidence and \n     the facts and circumstances of each case, which tool for \n     incapacitating dangerous terrorists best serves our national \n     security interests. The waiver provision fails to address \n     these concerns, particularly in time-sensitive operations in \n     which law enforcement personnel have traditionally played the \n     leading role. These problems are all the more acute because \n     the section defines the category of individuals who would be \n     subject to mandatory military custody by substituting new and \n     untested legislative criteria for the criteria the Executive \n     and Judicial branches are currently using for detention under \n     the AUMF in both habeas litigation and military operations. \n     Such confusion threatens our ability to act swiftly and \n     decisively to capture, detain, and interrogate terrorism \n     suspects, and could disrupt the collection of vital \n     intelligence about threats to the American people.\n       Rather than fix the fundamental defects of section 1032 or \n     remove it entirely, as the Administration and the chairs of \n     several congressional committees with jurisdiction over these \n     matters have advocated, the revised text merely directs the \n     President to develop procedures to ensure the myriad problems \n     that would result from such a requirement do not come to \n     fruition. Requiring the President to devise such procedures \n     concedes the substantial risks created by mandating military \n     custody, without providing an adequate solution. As a result, \n     it is likely that implementing such procedures would inject \n     significant confusion into counterterrorism operations.\n       The certification and waiver, required by section 1033 \n     before a detainee may be transferred from Guantanamo Bay to a \n     foreign country, continue to hinder the Executive branch's \n     ability to exercise its military, national security, and \n     foreign relations activities. While these provisions may be \n     intended to be somewhat less restrictive than the analogous \n     provisions in current law, they continue to pose unnecessary \n     obstacles, effectively blocking transfers that would advance \n     our national security interests, and would, in certain \n     circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers \n     principles. The Executive branch must have the flexibility to \n     act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries \n     regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers. Section \n     1034's ban on the use of funds to construct or modify a \n     detention facility in the United States is an unwise \n     intrusion on the military's ability to transfer its detainees \n     as operational needs dictate. Section 1035 conflicts with the \n     consensus-based interagency approach to detainee reviews \n     required under Executive Order No. 13567, which establishes \n     procedures to ensure that periodic review decisions are \n     informed by the most comprehensive information and the \n     considered views of all relevant agencies. Section 1036, in \n     addition to imposing onerous requirements, conflicts with \n     procedures for detainee reviews in the field that have been \n     developed based on many years of experience by military \n     officers and the Department of Defense. In short, the matters \n     addressed in these provisions are already well regulated by \n     existing procedures and have traditionally been left to the \n     discretion of the Executive branch.\n       Broadly speaking, the detention provisions in this bill \n     micromanage the work of our experienced counterterrorism \n     professionals, including our military commanders, \n     intelligence professionals, seasoned counterterrorism \n     prosecutors, or other operatives in the field. These \n     professionals have successfully led a Government-wide effort \n     to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qa'ida and its \n     affiliates and adherents over two consecutive \n     Administrations. The Administration believes strongly that it \n     would be a mistake for Congress to overrule or limit the \n     tactical flexibility of our Nation's counterterrorism \n     professionals.\n       Any bill that challenges or constrains the President's \n     critical authorities to collect intelligence, incapacitate \n     dangerous terrorists, and protect the Nation would prompt the \n     President's senior advisers to recommend a veto.\n       Joint Strike Fighter Aircraft (JSF): The Administration \n     also appreciates the Committee's inclusion in the bill of a \n     prohibition on using funds authorized by S. 1867 to be used \n     for the development of the F136 JSF alternate engine. As the \n     Administration has stated, continued development of the F136 \n     engine is an unnecessary diversion of scarce resources.\n       Medium Extended Air Defense Systems (MEADS): The \n     Administration appreciates the Committee's support for the \n     Department's air and missile defense programs; however, it \n     strongly objects to the lack of authorization of \n     appropriations for continued development of the MEADS \n     program. This lack of authorization could trigger unilateral \n     withdrawal by the United States from the MEADS Memorandum of \n     Understanding (MOU) with Germany and Italy, which could \n     further lead to a DoD obligation to pay all contract costs--a \n     scenario that would likely exceed the cost of satisfying \n     DoD's commitment under the MOU. Further, this lack of \n     authorization could also call into question DoD's ability to \n     honor its financial commitments in other binding cooperative \n     MOUs and have adverse consequences for other international \n     cooperative programs.\n       Overseas Construction Funding for Guam and Bahrain: The \n     Administration has serious concerns with the limitation on \n     execution of the United States and Government of Japan funds \n     to implement the realignment of United States Marine Forces \n     from Okinawa to Guam. The bill would unnecessarily restrict \n     the ability and flexibility of the President to execute our \n     foreign and defense policies with our ally, Japan. The \n     Administration also has concerns over the lack of \n     authorization of appropriations for military construction \n     projects in Guam and Bahrain. Deferring or eliminating these \n     projects could send the unintended message that the United \n     States does not stand by its allies or its agreements.\n       Provisions Authorizing Activities with Partner Nations: The \n     Administration appreciates the support of the Committee to \n     improve capabilities of other nations to support \n     counterterrorism efforts and other U.S. interests, and urges \n     the inclusion of DoD's requested proposals, which balance \n     U.S. national security and broader foreign policy interests. \n     The Administration would prefer only an annual extension of \n     the support to foreign nation counter-drug activities \n     authority in line with its request. While the inclusion of \n     section 1207 (Global Security Contingency Fund) is welcome, \n     several provisions may affect Executive branch agility in \n     the implementation of this authority. Section 1204 \n     (relating to Yemen) would require a 60-day notify and wait \n     period not only for Yemen, but for all other countries as \n     well, which would impose an excessive delay and seriously \n     impede the Executive branch's ability to respond to \n     emerging requirements.\n       Unrequested Authorization Increases: Although not the only \n     examples in S. 1867, the Administration notes and objects to \n     the addition of $240 million and $200 million, respectively, \n     in unrequested authorization for unneeded upgrades to M-1 \n     Abrams tanks and Rapid Innovation Program research and \n     development in this fiscally constrained environment. The \n     Administration believes the amounts appropriated in FY 2011 \n     and requested in FY 2012 fully fund DoD's requirements in \n     these areas.\n       Advance Appropriations for Acquisition: The Administration \n     objects to section 131, which would provide only incremental \n     funding--undermining stability and cost discipline--rather \n     than the advance appropriations that the Administration \n     requested for the procurement of Advanced Extremely High \n     Frequency satellites and certain classified programs.\n       Authority to Extend Deadline for Completion of a Limited \n     Number of Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) \n     Recommendations: The Administration requests inclusion of its \n     proposed authority for the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of \n     Defense to extend the 2005 BRAC implementation deadline for \n     up to ten (10) recommendations for a period of no more than \n     one year in order to ensure no disruption to the full and \n     complete implementation of each of these recommendations, as \n     well as continuity of operations. Section 2904 of the Defense \n     Base Closure and Realignment Act imposes on DoD a legal \n     obligation to close and realign all installations so \n     recommended by the BRAC Commission to the President and to \n     complete all such closures and realignments no later than \n     September 15, 2011. DoD has a handful of recommendations with \n     schedules that complete implementation close to the statutory \n     deadline.\n       TRICARE Providers: The Administration is currently \n     undertaking a review with relevant agencies, including the \n     Departments of Defense, Labor, and Justice, to clarify the \n     responsibility of health care providers under civil and \n     workers' rights laws. The Administration therefore objects to \n     section 702, which categorically excludes TRICARE network \n     providers from being considered subcontractors for purposes \n     of the Federal Acquisition Regulation or any other law.\n       Troops to Teachers Program: The Administration urges the \n     Senate's support for the transfer of the Troops to Teachers \n     Program to DoD in FY 2012, as reflected in the President's \n     Budget and DoD's legislative proposal to amend the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and Title 10 of the U.S. \n     Code in lieu of section 1048. The move to Defense will help \n     ensure that this important program supporting members of the \n     military as teachers is retained and provide better oversight \n     of 6 program outcomes by simplifying and streamlining program \n     management. The Administration looks forward to\n\n[[Page S7659]]\n\n     keeping the Congress abreast of this transfer, to ensure it \n     runs smoothly and has no adverse impact on program enrollees.\n       Constitutional concerns: A number of the bill's provisions \n     raise additional constitutional concerns, such as sections \n     233 and 1241, which could intrude on the President's \n     constitutional authority to maintain the confidentiality of \n     sensitive diplomatic communications. The Administration looks \n     forward to working with the Congress to address these and \n     other concerns.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2011.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to express the Department of \n     Defense's principal concerns with the latest version of \n     detainee-related language you are considering including in \n     the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year \n     2012. We understand the Senate Armed Services Committee is \n     planning to consider this language later today.\n       We greatly appreciate your willingness to listen to the \n     concerns expressed by our national security professionals on \n     the version of the NDAA bill reported by the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee in June. I am convinced we all want the \n     same result--flexibility for our national security \n     professionals in the field to detain, interrogate, and \n     prosecute suspected terrorists. The Department has \n     substantial concerns, however, about the revised text, which \n     my staff has just received within the last few hours.\n       Section 1032. We recognize your efforts to address some of \n     our objections to section 1032. However, it continues to be \n     the case that any advantages to the Department of Defense in \n     particular and our national security in general in section \n     1032 of requiring that certain individuals be held by the \n     military are, at best, unclear. This provision restrains the \n     Executive Branch's options to utilize, in a swift and \n     flexible fashion, all the counterterrorism tools that are now \n     legally available.\n       Moreover, the failure of the revised text to clarify that \n     section 1032 applies to individuals captured abroad, as we \n     have urged, may needlessly complicate efforts by frontline \n     law enforcement professionals to collect critical \n     intelligence concerning operations and activities within the \n     United States.\n       Next, the revised language adds a new qualifier to \n     ``associated force''--``that acts in coordination with or \n     pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda.'' In our view, this \n     new language unnecessarily complicates our ability to \n     interpret and implement this section.\n       Further, the new version of section 1032 makes it more \n     apparent that there is an intent to extend the certification \n     requirements of section 1033 to those covered by section 1032 \n     that we may want to transfer to a third country. In other \n     words, the certification requirement that currently applies \n     only to Guantanamo detainees would permanently extend to a \n     whole new category of future captures. This imposes a whole \n     new restraint on the flexibility we need to continue to \n     pursue our counterterrorism efforts.\n       Section 1033. We are troubled that section 1033 remains \n     essentially unchanged from the prior draft, and that none of \n     the Administration's concerns or suggestions for this \n     provision have been adopted. We appreciate that revised \n     section 1033 removes language that would have made these \n     restrictions permanent, and instead extended them through \n     Fiscal Year 2012 only. As a practical matter, however, \n     limiting the duration of the restrictions to the next fiscal \n     year only will have little impact if Congress simply \n     continues to insert these restrictions into legislation on an \n     annual basis without ever revisiting the substance of the \n     legislation. As national security officials in this \n     Department and elsewhere have explained, transfer \n     restrictions such as those outlined in section 1033 are \n     largely unworkable and pose unnecessary obstacles to \n     transfers that would advance our national security interests.\n       Section 1035. Finally, section 1035 shifts to the \n     Department of Defense responsibility for what has previously \n     been a consensus-driven interagency process that was informed \n     by the advice and views of counterterrorism professionals \n     from across the Government. We see no compelling reason--and \n     certainly none has been expressed in our discussions to \n     date--to upset a collaborative, interagency approach that has \n     served our national security so well over the past few years.\n       I hope we can reach agreement on these important national \n     security issues, and, as always, my staff is available to \n     work with the Committee on these and other matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Oct. 7, 2011]\n\n                           Beyond Guantanamo\n\n       (By Abner Mikva, William S. Sessions and John J. Gibbons)\n\n       A new shift in philosophy has begun to emerge among \n     lawmakers in Washington. Legislation now making its way \n     through Congress would seek to overmilitarize America's \n     counterterrorism efforts, effectively making the U.S. \n     military the judge, jury and jailer of terrorism suspects, to \n     the exclusion of the FBI and local and state law enforcement \n     agencies. As former federal judges, we find this prospect \n     deeply disturbing. Not only would such an effort ignore 200 \n     years of legal precedent, it would fly in the face of common \n     sense.\n       The bill in question, the 2012 National Defense \n     Authorization Act, would codify methods such as indefinite \n     detention without charge and mandatory military detention, \n     and make them applicable to virtually anyone picked up in \n     anti-terrorism efforts--including U.S. citizens--anywhere in \n     the world, including on U.S. soil. Such an effort to restrict \n     counterterrorism efforts by traditional law enforcement \n     agencies would sadly demonstrate that many members of \n     Congress have very little faith in America's criminal justice \n     system.\n       It is a fact that our criminal justice system is uniquely \n     qualified to handle complex terrorism cases. Indeed, civilian \n     courts have successfully overseen more than 400 terrorism-\n     related trials, whereas military commissions have handled \n     only six. While the use of military commissions may \n     occasionally be appropriate under the Constitution, the \n     Guantanamo military commissions remain subject to serious \n     constitutional challenges that could result in overturned \n     guilty verdicts. The simple truth is that existing federal \n     courts operate under rules and procedures that provide all \n     the tools necessary to prosecute terrorism cases and they are \n     not subject to the same legal challenges as military \n     commissions.\n       We need access to proven instruments and methods in our \n     fight against terrorism. Stripping local law enforcement and \n     the FBI of the ability to arrest and gather intelligence from \n     terrorism suspects and limiting our trial options is \n     counterintuitive and could pose a genuine threat to our \n     national security. Furthermore, an expanded mandatory \n     military detention system would lead to yet more protracted \n     litigation, infringe on law enforcement's ability to fight \n     terrorism on a local and state level, and invite the military \n     to act as law enforcement within the borders of our states.\n       In the face of these disturbing developments, we are \n     encouraged by the fact that the administration has expressed \n     its own concerns. The Obama White House has raised strong \n     objections to congressional efforts to undermine the use of \n     our traditional criminal justice system, efforts that would \n     effectively eliminate the administration's ability to \n     leverage ``the strength and flexibility'' of the system to \n     ``incapacitate dangerous terrorists and gather critical \n     intelligence.'' In previous statements, President Barack \n     Obama said he intends to oppose any attempt to extend or \n     expand such restrictions in the future. We submit to the \n     president that the future is now.\n       We firmly believe the United States can preserve its \n     national security without resorting to sweeping departures \n     from our constitutional tradition. We call on Obama and \n     Congress to support a policy for detention and trial of \n     suspected terrorists that is consistent with our Constitution \n     and maintains the use of our traditional criminal justice \n     system to combat terrorism. Further restricting the tools at \n     our disposal is not in the best interest of our national \n     security.\n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n                                                 November 7, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: We write today to thank you for signing on to \n     the October 21, 2011 letter to Senator Reid regarding \n     detainee provisions 1031-1033 in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act. We are members of a nonpartisan group of \n     forty retired generals and admirals concerned about the \n     implications of U.S. policy regarding enemy prisoner \n     treatment and detention. We have been following the public \n     debate concerning the provisions closely and are troubled by \n     the overreaching nature of the legislation that would allow \n     for indefinite detention without trial, mandatory military \n     custody of counterterrorism suspects and permanent transfer \n     restrictions imposed on inmates already at GTMO, some of whom \n     have been cleared for release.\n       We understand there has been significant disagreement about \n     the provisions and exactly what their impact on national \n     security would be; however, the fact that such disagreement \n     exists underscores that further public debate is needed and \n     the provisions should not go forward as a part of the NDAA.\n       Regardless of how one interprets the intent of the \n     provisions, it does not cure the underlying defect: over-\n     militarization of our counter terrorism response. Our \n     military does not want nor seek to try all foreign terror \n     suspects. Congress has wisely enacted dozens of criminal laws \n     to incapacitate potential terrorists, and federal courts have \n     convicted more than 400 of terrorism related crimes since 9/\n     11. Using military commissions as a one-size-fits-all \n     response threatens our security because commissions do not \n     have the same broad array of criminal laws that our federal \n     courts have.\n       Military custody may be an incident of battlefield \n     operations, but mandating military custody would undermine \n     legitimate law enforcement and intelligence operations \n     crucial to our security at home and abroad. Providing an \n     individualized waiver would only serve to politicize each \n     decision and possibly paralyze effective national security \n     response.\n       We thank you again for signing on to the October 21, 2011 \n     letter to Senator Reid and your attention to these important \n     issues. As former members of our armed forces, please\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\n     call on us as a resource as debate moves forward on detainee \n     provisions as part of the NDAA\n           Sincerely,\n         General Joseph P.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the sake and the accommodation of the \nschedules of my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks and whoever the speaker is on the other side designated by the \nchairman, Senator Ayotte be recognized, and then after a speaker from \nthe other side, if necessary, Senator Chambliss, followed by a speaker \non the other side, followed by Senator Graham. I do that because of the \ntime constraints of my colleagues. So I ask unanimous consent and \nagreement from the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, before we go into the \nseries of speakers, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to just \ncall up and then set aside amendment No. 1072, which is sponsored by \nmyself and Senator Graham, and there is a list of 67 cosponsors.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1072\n\n (Purpose: To enhance the national defense through empowerment of the \n  National Guard, enhancement of the functions of the National Guard \n   Bureau, and improvement of Federal-State military coordination in \n                      domestic emergency response)\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 1072.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mr. \n     Graham, and others, proposes an amendment numbered 1072.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is on behalf of myself, Senators \nGraham, Rockefeller, Ayotte, Baucus, Begich, Bennet, Bingaman, \nBlumenthal, Blunt, Boozman, Boxer, Scott Brown, Sherrod Brown, Burr, \nCantwell, Cardin, Carper, Casey, Coats, Conrad, Coons, Corker, Crapo, \nDurbin, Enzi, Feinstein, Franken, Gillibrand, Grassley, Hagan, Harkin, \nHeller, Hoeven, Inhofe, Inouye, Johanns, Ron Johnson, Tim Johnson, \nKlobuchar, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Lee, Lugar, Manchin, McCaskill, \nMenendez, Merkley, Mikulski, Moran, Murray, Ben Nelson, Pryor, Risch, \nSanders, Schumer, Shaheen, Snowe, Stabenow, Tester, Mark Udall, Vitter, \nWarner, Whitehouse, and Wyden. It has been called up, and I ask \nunanimous consent to have it set aside to deal with the pending matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the foregoing request from the Senator from \nArizona is----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I don't object because \nthat is the way we should proceed, going back and forth, and usually we \ndo that informally. I don't know whether there may be implications \nbecause I don't know who will be speaking.\n  Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Michigan. I do that for the \nconvenience of my colleagues because I know there will also be others \ncoming to speak on this important issue.\n  I wish to point out that the Senator from South Carolina--a member of \nthe National Guard, one of the major authors of the Detainee Treatment \nAct, and a person who has tried hundreds of cases in military courts--\nbrings a degree of knowledge and expertise on this issue.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire served as attorney general of her \nState for a number of years. She understands the Miranda rights. She \nhas been a student and leader on this issue of detainee treatment.\n  Also, of course, Senator Chambliss, in his role as the Republican \nleader on the Intelligence Committee, has a deep and longstanding \ninvolvement on detainee issues and the requirements for making our \nNation safe.\n  I will be fairly brief except to say that by any judgment, the \nPresident's policy, the President's strategy, the President's movements \nconcerning detainees have been a total and abysmal failure. If the \nPresident of the United States would have had a coherent policy that \nmade any sense whatsoever to anyone, we would not have had to act in \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  Let me point out a couple of facts. The President of the United \nStates campaigned saying that he would close Guantanamo Bay. Guantanamo \nBay remains open. The President of the United States also said we would \nhave detainees tried in civilian as well as military courts, and that \nwas a position he has held.\n  So they had a great idea: Let's take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to New \nYork City. That was a great idea. Let's have $300 million in security \ncosts while they have a trial of one of the most notorious \ninternational criminals. Obviously, that one got the support it \ndeserved.\n  Thanks to the release policy of Guantanamo, 27 percent of the \ndetainees of Guantanamo who have been released are back in the fight, \ntrying to kill Americans--only this time they have a red badge of \ncourage and a degree of legitimacy because they spent time in \nGuantanamo Bay. Leaders of al-Qaida have been released from Guantanamo \nBay under this administration. They were released under the Bush \nadministration as well, to be fair, but we didn't know at that time how \nmany of them would return to the fight. Some of the leaders in Yemen \nwhom we are speaking about who are now doing everything they can to \nkill Americans were released from Guantanamo Bay. That can't be viewed \nas a successful policy. Thirty individuals in Guantanamo today are \ncitizens of Yemen. We can't release them, obviously, back to Yemen.\n\n  So now what do we do in order not to have people go to Guantanamo \nBay? We are now using U.S. naval ships to detain suspected terrorists. \nFor 60 days, they kept a suspected al-Qaida member on board a ship. \nNow, when I support the construction of more Navy ships, I have a lot \nof missions in mind. Serving as a detainment facility for suspected \nterrorists is not one of them.\n  The Underwear Bomber was Mirandized 50 minutes into custody, and the \nSenator from Illinois forgot to mention that several weeks went by \nbefore the Underwear Bomber's family came and convinced him to \ncooperate. Suppose there had been an impending attack on the United \nStates of America during the 50 minutes in captivity before he was \nMirandized. Most Americans don't believe al-Qaida members should be \nMirandized, as the Senator from New Hampshire, who has had a lot of \nexperience with individuals who have exercised their Miranda rights, \nwill point out.\n  So the administration policy has been a complete failure. What we are \ntrying to do in this legislation--and we have tried and tried again to \nsatisfy many of the concerns the administration has, including, I would \npoint out, doing certain things such as making this legislation only \nfor 1 year--not permanent but only for 1 year--and we have put into \nthis legislation a national security waiver which is a mile wide. If \nthe President of the United States decides that an individual should be \ngiven a trial in civilian court, he has a waiver that all he has to do \nis exercise. So I am not exactly sure why the administration feels so \nstrongly about a 1-year restriction, with a national security waiver \nthat is a mile wide. We made a couple of other changes at the request \nof the administration. So I can only assume that\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\nsomehow this has some sort of political implications--and I don't say \nthat lightly--as most of the actions concerning this whole detainee \nissue seem to be driven by.\n  So there were hearings held in the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nThere was input from different sources. The Senator from Michigan has \nbeen fair and objective on this issue, and I am very appreciative of \nthat. The vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee was, I believe, \n26 to 0.\n  We feel very strongly that these provisions in this bill are \nnecessary to keep Americans secure. We want to stop more than one out \nof every four of these detainees going back into the fight. We want to \nmake sure the military court system applies here to people who are \nnoncitizens and known members of al-Qaida. All of it seems to me to \nmake perfect sense.\n  So obviously the administration ratcheted up the stakes today with a \nthreat of a veto. I hope they are not serious about it. There is too \nmuch in this bill that is important to this Nation's defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if we can amend the unanimous consent agreement. \nThere is nobody that I know of on this side at the moment who wants to \nspeak in support of the amendment, so I am wondering if it would be \nagreeable to the ranking member to have two Members on his side go and \nthen two Members on our side, should that occur.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is not agreeable to me. I would say that they have \nthe ability to walk over here if they are interested.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In that case, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would agree to that, but it is not fair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't want you to agree if you think it is not fair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. You know it is not fair. If you have a speaker, bring \nthem up.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am in opposition to the amendment. I want to be fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Arizona agree with the \nrevised unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion of \nthe Senator from Colorado. As the vice chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, let me just say in response to the statement \nfrom the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee that there \nhas not been a lack of discussion of this issue, both within the Armed \nServices Committee and within the Intelligence Committee. While I am \nnot permitted to talk about what has gone on within the Intelligence \nCommittee, I assure my colleagues that this has been a major issue from \na discussion standpoint for a number of months. In fact, it has been a \npoint of discussion for almost 3 years now. I will get into some of \nthat in my comments.\n  Secondly, just in quick response to the comment of the Senator from \nIllinois, the assistant majority leader, when he talked about how we \nwould treat U.S. citizens under this, I know how smart he is, and he is \nmy friend, but he obviously hasn't read the bill. There is a specific \nexclusion for citizens of the United States being required to be \ndetained by the military in this bill.\n  Over the past several years, there has been an ongoing debate \nconcerning our Nation's ability to fully and lawfully interrogate \nsuspected terrorists. One thing remains clear: After all of these years \nafter 9/11, we still lack an unambiguous and effective detention \npolicy. The consequences of that failure are very real. If we had \ncaptured bin Laden, what would we have done with him? If we had \ncaptured Anwar al-Awlaki, what would we have done with him? If today we \ncapture Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, what would we do with him? \nMany of us have posed these same questions to various administration \nofficials, and the wide variety of responses only confirms that there \nis no policy. That is unacceptable, and that is why the detainee \nprovisions in this bill are so absolutely critical.\n  I think it is fair to say that if we had captured bin Laden or \nAwlaki, we could have gained very actionable intelligence from either \none of them, and that is our primary goal. But how would we have done \nthat? We have no detainee policy; there is no place we could have taken \nthem for long-term interrogation. The closest thing to a policy we have \nheard from the administration is that Guantanamo is off the table. But \nthat is not helpful when they provide no other alternatives.\n\n  We have heard some administration officials say holding detainees on \nships for brief periods of time solves this detention problem. Now, \nSenator McCain just addressed that issue, and we have a great U.S. \nNavy. It is not the intention of the U.S. Navy to function in a way of \nsailing ships around the world and having terrorists brought to ships \nfor detention. A state-of-the-art facility like Guantanamo Bay is off \nthe table, but holding someone on a ship, never intended to be a \nfloating prison and prohibited from long-term detention by the Geneva \nConventions is somehow a humane replacement for Guantanamo? That simply \ndoes not make sense.\n  The intent behind the detainee provisions in this bill is very \nsimple: We must be able to hold detainees for as long as it takes to \nget significant foreign intelligence information without them lawyering \nup, as the Christmas Day bomber did so famously after only 50 minutes \nof interrogation.\n  Again, to my friend from Illinois, who talked about the fact that \nonce this young man's parents got involved, that after his Miranda \nrights had been given to him, he gave us an awful lot of intelligence--\nand that is true in his case--I doubt very seriously that Zawahiri's \nparents, who probably are not even alive, are going to step up and tell \ntheir son: You ought to go in and talk to these folks and give them all \nthe details about the way you helped plan the September 11 attacks on \nthe United States of America. We just know with high-value targets that \nis not going to happen on a wholesale basis, and we simply need to be \nin a position to gain actionable intelligence from every one of those \nindividuals.\n  While I fully support the detainee provisions in this bill, I believe \nthere are other improvements that can and should be made. For example, \nI am cosponsoring Senator Ayotte's amendment which will allow our \nintelligence interrogators to use lawful interrogation methods beyond \nthose set forth in the Army Field Manual.\n  We need to be clear on exactly what this means. This amendment does \nnot authorize or condone torture, and every technique used in every \ninterrogation must comply with our laws and treaty obligations. I \nbelieve there needs to be flexibility in how we interrogate terrorists. \nBut even more so I believe it is foolish to publicize--as the Army \nField Manual does--the specific techniques that can be used in \ninterrogating a suspected terrorist.\n  Over the years, we have heard repeatedly from the intelligence \ncommunity that the element of surprise is sometimes our greatest asset \nin gathering timely intelligence from detainees. Senator Ayotte's \namendment gives the intelligence community the ability to use \ntechniques that have not been broadcast over the Internet. In my \nopinion, that makes a lot of sense. I hope my colleagues will agree \nbecause the folks we are dealing with in the terrorist world today--\nthese guys who are the meanest, nastiest killers in the world; who wake \nup every morning trying to figure out ways to kill and harm Americans--\nare not stupid. They carry laptops. They know how to use the Internet. \nWe gain valuable information oftentimes through the airwaves. We know \nhow smart they are, and we know they have the capability of going on \nthe Internet today and reviewing the Army Field Manual. They know \nexactly the way they are going to be interrogated and the type of \ntechniques that are going to be used to gain intelligence from them.\n  The Armed Services Committee has worked very hard on a bipartisan \nbasis to come up with legislation that will improve congressional \noversight of detainee matters, as well as provide greater assurance \nthat detainees who pose a threat to our national security are not \nreleased so they can return to the fight.\n  As the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I have a specific \ninterest in making sure our intelligence community has the ability to \ngather timely and actionable intelligence from detainees. I believe \nthis bill will help our intelligence interrogators do exactly that, and \nI urge my colleagues\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\nto support these provisions fully as was done on a unanimous basis \nwithin the Armed Services Committee when this issue was discussed, \ndebated, and talked about thoroughly during the markup.\n  I yield to my friend from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. Yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am sorry. I thought you gave us two, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. LEVIN. You had two, I believe. You were the second, I think.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think what the chairman meant was, there would be two \nif----\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we did not have somebody here, we were going to do it \ntwo at a time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. I think it is the other side's turn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of the \nSenator from New Hampshire. I will not speak long. I know she is here \nwaiting to speak, as we go back and forth across the aisle in sequence.\n  I want to begin by thanking Chairman Levin and his ranking member, \nSenator McCain, for the work they have done on this detention issue. I \nthink they have made a lot of progress, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work on the Senate floor to try to conclude what I hope \nwill be a successful agreement for everyone.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1092\n\n  But I am here to speak about amendment No. 1092 to the National \nDefense Authorization Act, which is the piece that has been put in that \nresponds to the serious and ever-growing problem of counterfeit parts \nthat appear in our military supply chain.\n  Our Nation asks a lot of our troops. We send them far away. We send \nthem into danger. We ask them to suffer prolonged separation from their \nfamilies. We ask them to put their life and limb in peril. In return, \nwe have a high obligation to give them the best possible equipment to \nfulfill their vital missions and come home safely.\n  In order to assure the proper performance of our weapons systems, of \nour body armor, of our aircraft parts, and of countless other mission \ncritical parts, we have to make sure they are legitimate and not \ncounterfeit parts.\n  That was why I introduced the Combating Military Counterfeits Act, \nwhich was reported without objection by the Judiciary Committee on July \n21 of this year. It is cosponsored by my colleague, Senator Graham, \nwhom I see on the floor; by the ranking member, Senator McCain--again, \nmy appreciation to him--Senator Coons; the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy; Senator Kyl; Senator Schumer; Senator Hatch; \nSenator Blumenthal; and Senator Klobuchar. I thank all of those \ncosponsors for their support and leadership on this important issue.\n  I particularly want to thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain \nfor including this legislation in their amendment No. 1092, which was \noffered earlier today.\n  Senator Levin and Senator McCain led an in-depth investigation in the \nArmed Services Committee into this problem of military counterfeits, \nand they have drawn on that investigation in making these important \nreforms that will protect military procurement from counterfeit parts. \nI am very glad they believe, as I do, the enhanced criminal penalties \nin my bill would provide a useful complement to those important \nchanges.\n  Prosecutors have an important role to play in the fight against \nmilitary counterfeiters. The criminals who sell counterfeit military \nproducts should not get off with light sentences. They knowingly sell \nthe military, for instance, counterfeit body armor that could fail in \ncombat, a counterfeit missile control system that could short-circuit \nat launch, or a counterfeit GPS that could fail under battlefield \nconditions.\n  The Combatting Military Counterfeits Act of 2011 makes sure \nappropriate criminal sanctions attach to such reprehensible criminal \nactivity, first, by doubling the maximum statutory penalty for an \nindividual who trafficks in counterfeits and knows the counterfeit \nproduct either is intended for military use or is identified as meeting \nmilitary standards; and, second, by directing the Sentencing Commission \nto update the sentencing guidelines as appropriate to reflect our \ncongressional intent that trafficking in counterfeit military items be \npunished seriously, sufficiently to deter this kind of reckless \nendangering of our servicemembers.\n  The administration has called for these increased sentences for \ntrafficking in counterfeit military products. In the private sector, \nthis legislation is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the Semiconductor Industry \nAssociation, DuPont, the International Trademark Association, and the \nInternational AntiCounterfeiting Coalition. I thank all of them for \ntheir work and leadership on this issue.\n  One semiconductor manufacturer, ON Semiconductor, which has a \ndevelopment center in East Greenwich, in my home State of Rhode Island, \nhas written a letter of support explaining that military counterfeits \nare a particular problem since ``[m]ilitary grade products are \nattractive to counterfeiters because their higher prices reflect the \nadded costs to test the products to military specifications, \nspecifications that include the full military temperature range.'' So \nit is a target area for counterfeiters.\n  I will say, without going on at any great length, the examples are \nshocking. The Defense Department, for instance, has found out in \ntesting that what it thought was Kevlar body armor was, in fact, \nnothing of the sort and could not protect our troops the way proper \nKevlar can. In another example, a supplier sold the Defense Department \na part that it falsely claimed was a $7,000 circuit that met the \nspecifications of a missile guidance system.\n  A January 2010 study by the Commerce Department quoted a Defense \nDepartment official as estimating that counterfeit aircraft parts were \n``leading to a 5 to 15 percent annual decrease in weapons systems \nreliability.'' The investigation, led by Chairman Levin and Ranking \nMember McCain, revealed countless other grave and sobering examples.\n  I am glad we are responding to the serious and ever-growing threat \nposed by counterfeit military parts. Again, I thank Chairman Levin and \nRanking Member McCain for their great work to eliminate counterfeit \nparts from the military supply chain, and I hope all my colleagues will \nsupport their amendment No. 1092.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, let me thank Senator Whitehouse \nfor the extraordinary effort he has made to go after counterfeit parts. \nWe have incorporated his legislation in our legislation. It is a \ncritically important part of our legislation. But his leadership has \nbeen early, often, and strong on this issue, and we commend and thank \nhim for it. Hopefully, when this amendment gets passed, there will be a \nrecognition of the critical role the Senator from Rhode Island played. \nIt is an ongoing saga to stop counterfeiting coming in, mainly from \nChina. This is a major effort to stem that flow.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the chairman and the ranking member.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, could I just add my words of \nappreciation, along with those of the chairman, for Senator \nWhitehouse's hard work on this very important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Colorado to strike the detainee provisions \nfrom the defense authorization markup--provisions that were agreed upon \non an overwhelming bipartisan basis in the Armed Services Committee.\n  I would like to start first by revisiting the history of this and \nwhere we are because the reason the Armed Services Committee, in the \nfirst place, thought it was very important we discuss this issue in \ncommittee and address it is that having participated in hearings over \nthe course of months and months in the Armed Services Committee, there \nhas been witness after witness from our Defense Department who has come \nin and our military leaders with whom we have been talking about the \ndetention policy and asking\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\nthem very important questions about where we are and how we are going \nto ensure that our military and intelligence community has the tools \nthey need to protect America, and also asking them about this issue of \ndetainees and how we are treating them.\n  Because one of the important facts my esteemed colleague from \nGeorgia, as well as the ranking member, Senator McCain, mentioned, is \nthat we have a recidivism rate of 27 percent from Guantanamo--those who \nhave reengaged our soldiers again and are back in theater. I was very \nconcerned about this in the Armed Services Committee. That caused, over \na series of months, us to ask about the administration's detainee \npolicy.\n  I just want to share some of the comments that were made over that \nperiod of time in February. Secretary Michael Vickers said the \nadministration is in the final stages of revising or establishing its \ndetention policy.\n  Now, that was 8 months ago, and we are now 10 years into this war. In \nApril I questioned GEN Carter Ham, the Commander of Africa Command, \nabout what we would do if we captured a member of al-Qaida in Africa. \nDo you know what he told me. He said, ``We would need some lawyerly \nhelp on answering that one.''\n  So this is an area that cried out for clarification on a bipartisan \nbasis because it is so important to ensure that while we remain at war \nwith terrorists that we have the right policies in place to protect \nAmericans. That is why the Armed Services Committee worked very hard.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee, Chairman Levin, for his \ndiligent work, along with other members of the committee for coming \nforward with this provision--that the Senator from Colorado is seeking \nto strike--as well as the ranking member, Senator McCain.\n  What ended up happening is, we brought forward a compromise that \npassed overwhelmingly out of committee originally in June. In fact, it \npassed out 25 to 1, and then the administration raised some concerns \nabout it. In reaction to those concerns, I know the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, as well as the ranking member and some others \nof us, including myself, sat down with members of the administration to \nhear out their concerns and to try to accommodate their concerns while \nstill making sure we had a policy that would give proper guidance, \nwould protect Americans, and would fundamentally deal with this issue \nof making sure, in the first instance, that we reaffirmed our authority \nthat we are at war with al-Qaida post 9/11; second, reaffirming that \nwhen we are at war the presumption is military custody because the \npriority has to be gathering intelligence to protect our country; and \nthen, third, those who are released from Guantanamo, making sure there \nis a standard in place so they cannot reengage back into the battle to \nharm our troops, our partners, and our allies.\n  In that process, that is how this provision was derived that Senator \nUdall from Colorado seeks to strike with his amendment. If we were to \neliminate these provisions, we would be putting our country in a \nposition where these important issues are not being addressed, and they \nneed to be addressed just based on what we have heard from our military \nleadership over many months in the Armed Services Committee.\n  So I would also echo what Senator Chambliss, who is the vice chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee, said. This is an issue that has been \nthoroughly discussed in this body and cries out for passage in the \nDefense Authorization Act. I want to point out a couple of very \nimportant parts to this. Now, I am someone who, on the recent \nappropriations bill, the CJS appropriations bill, brought an amendment \nthat would have provided for military commissions trials for members of \nal-Qaida and associated forces who have committed an attack against us \nor our coalition partners because I am deeply concerned that this \nadministration has been treating these types of cases as common \ncriminal cases.\n  When I brought that amendment forward, it did not pass this body. I \nfeel very strongly that the policy should be that we treat these cases \nfor what they are, military cases, because we remain at war and our \npriorities should be to gather intelligence. But I point out the fact \nthat after my amendment lost, I sat down with the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, the ranking member, and the administration to hear \nout their concerns.\n  So while this amendment--I would have gone further in my amendment--\naddresses many of the objections that were raised--in fact, I think all \nof the objections which were raised to the amendment I brought to the \nfloor from the other side; that is, we have given the administration \nflexibility to make the decision on whether they believe it is \nappropriate, based on national security concerns, which has to be the \nprimary concern and consideration of how to treat those who have \ncommitted an attack on our country who are members of al-Qaida or \nassociated forces, and also who are not members of this country, so who \nare foreign citizens and are seeking to attack our country or have \nattacked our country in a way that the administration can decide it is \nbest to handle them in a civilian court or a military system.\n  So all of the objections that were raised to my amendment--I stand by \nmy amendment--but they are addressed in this compromise. And to hear \nthe objection to it, that there is not flexibility, it is very clear \nthat is just not true when you look at the language in this amendment \nbecause we adjusted the amendment to address the administration's \nconcerns to say no interrogation will be interrupted based upon this \namendment; that interrogations have to be the priority, and we are \ngiving the administration maximum flexibility under this amendment.\n  So I do not understand why there are such objections continuing when \nthis is as a result of a very good, strong good-faith effort to address \nany operational concerns that were raised based on the amendment I \nbrought and even based on the prior language which, in my view, I think \nwas very sufficient.\n  I want to point out something that is very important. In the course \nof the discussions we had with the administration on section 1031, \nwhich we have heard cited as a section that could be used to detain \nAmericans indefinitely, this section was changed based on feedback from \nthe administration. In fact, the administration asked us to actually \nstrike a provision in it that would have said American citizens--it did \nnot apply to American citizens, and, in fact, had to comply with the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  So I am a little bit apoplectic to understand why the administration \nis raising an objection about something they actually asked to be \nremoved on a section they told us they were satisfied with and based on \nrevisions that we made that they wanted. We said we would be happy to \nmake these accommodations because we wanted to make sure we got this \nright.\n  So on that section, I do not understand why we are in a position \nwhere the Senator from Colorado is trying to remove it--the \nadministration is objecting to it--when we took the language they gave \nus and incorporated it directly into the National Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  One point I think is being lost: So why is it that this amendment \ncreates an initial presumption for military custody? This is the most \nimportant point. The priority has to be in protecting American citizens \nby gaining available intelligence to protect our country. The esteemed \nSenator from Illinois cited the case of the so-called Christmas Day or \nUnderwear Bomber as an example of how cases have worked well.\n  Well, I think it is important to appreciate the facts of that case. \nThis is a situation where the underwear bomber is caught with the \nexplosives strapped to him, where there are hundreds of witnesses on \nthe plane, and they were able to make their case in the absence of any \ninterrogation or confession. What ended up happening is he was \nquestioned at the scene for about 50 minutes? Then he was read his \nMiranda rights, one of those being: You have the right to remain \nsilent.\n  Let's think about that for a second. We would want to tell \nterrorists: You have you have the right to remain silent. Common sense \nwill tell you telling a terrorist they have the right to remain silent \nis counter to what we need to do to protect Americans. We do not want \nthem to remain silent, we\n\n[[Page S7664]]\n\nwant them to tell us everything they know. But continuing on with that \ncase, the only reason he reengaged in providing information for our \ncountry is because his parents intervened. Weeks later, his parents \nconvinced him he should cooperate with us; that he should provide \ninformation and tell us what he knew.\n  If our interrogation policy for people who commit attacks on our \ncountry is going to be, well, we hope a parent comes and intervenes to \nhelp us get information that will protect Americans, I think we are in \ntrouble if that is our intelligence-gathering procedure.\n  So I wanted to point out, since that case is cited as an example by \nthe Senator from Colorado and the Senator from Illinois as to why this \nsection should be struck, if anything, I think that case points out why \nwe need guidance in this area and why it is very important the priority \nbe on gathering intelligence.\n  That is what this amendment does. It gives the administration \nsufficient flexibility, based on concerns they raised, operational \nconcerns. If the FBI is conducting an interrogation, they do not have \nto stop it because of anything in this provision. That is very clear.\n  If the administration wants to treat someone in a civilian court, \neven though I do not think they should versus a military commission who \nis a member of al-Qaida who has attacked our country, that waiver is in \nhere. That flexibility is in here.\n  This was a reasonable compromise where people like me who would have \ngone a lot further did not get what we wanted. But what we did do is \nget a very strong bipartisan compromise that came out of this committee \noverwhelmingly. When we had a vote at the beginning of the week, and \nthe Senator from Colorado raised the very same amendment to strike this \nprovision, it was rejected overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis.\n  So I hope this Chamber will also overwhelmingly reject striking this \nvery important provision from the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Again, we cannot be in a position where we spend the next year in the \nArmed Services Committee again hearing from our military leaders: The \nadministration is still in the final stages of revising or establishing \nits detention policy. I certainly do not want to hear again from one of \nour generals, when I ask him about our detention policy and what we are \ngoing to do with terrorists: I would need some lawyerly help in \nanswering that one.\n  This amendment gives us the guidance we need. I would ask my \ncolleagues to reject striking it from the authorization.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I view the detention provisions of \nthis bill as real pernicious, as an attack on the Executive power of \nthe President, and contrary to the best interests of this Nation. So I \nrise to express my strong opposition to three specific detention \nprovisions in the Defense authorization bill.\n  There was some discussion on the Senate floor that the Intelligence \nCommittee had reviewed these. This is not true. I would like to read a \nletter that I sent to the majority leader that was signed by every \nDemocratic member of the Intelligence Committee on October 21.\n\n       We write as members of the Senate Judiciary Committee--\n\n  Because there were some Judiciary Committee members on this.\n\n     and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to express \n     our grave concern with subtitle D, titled Defense Matters of \n     title 10 of S. 1253, the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2012. We support the majority of provisions \n     in the bill which further national security and are of great \n     importance. But we cannot support these controversial \n     detention positions.\n\n  Then we go on to say--and I will not read the whole letter. I will \nput the whole letter in the Record.\n\n       The executive branch must have the flexibility to consider \n     various options for handling terrorism cases, including the \n     ability to prosecute terrorists for violations of U.S. law in \n     Federal criminal court.\n       Yet, taken together, sections 1031 and 1032 of subtitle (d) \n     are unprecedented and require more rigorous scrutiny by \n     Congress. Section 1031 needs to be reviewed to consider \n     whether it is consistent with the September 18, 2001, \n     authorization for use of military force, especially because \n     it would authorize the indefinite detention of American \n     citizens without charge or trial . . .\n\n  I will stop reading here, but again, I want to emphasize this point. \nWe are talking about the indefinite detention of American citizens \nwithout charge or trial. We have not done this at least since World War \nII when we incarcerated Japanese Americans. This is a very serious \nthing we are doing. People should understand its impact.\n  I want to outline the provisions in the Armed Services bill that \nwould further militarize our counterterrorism efforts and ignore the \ntestimony and recommendations of virtually all national security and \ncounterterrorism officials and experts. We have heard from the \nSecretary of Defense, the Attorney General, the general counsel of the \nDefense Department, and John Brennan, the Assistant to the President \nfor Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. Every one of them opposes \nthese provisions. They have to carry them out. They are the \nprofessionals responsible for so doing. Yet, we are going to \ncountermand them?\n  The first problematic provision, section 1032, requires mandatory \nmilitary custody with no consideration of the details of individual \ncases. The bill mandates military detention of any non-U.S. citizen who \nis a member of al-Qaida, or an associated force, whatever that may be, \nand who planned or carried out an attack, or attempted attack, on this \ncountry or abroad. Here is the problem: The Armed Services Committee \nignores the administration's request to have this provision apply only \nto detainees captured overseas. Therefore, any noncitizen al-Qaida \noperative captured in the United States would be automatically turned \nover to military custody.\n  Military custody for captured terrorists may make sense in some \ncases, but certainly not all. Requiring it in every case could harm our \nNation's ability to investigate and respond to terrorist threats and \ncreate major operational hurdles. For example, the FBI has 56 local \nfield offices around the country. It is staffed with agents who can \narrest, interrogate, and detain. The military does not. As has been the \npolicy of Republican and Democratic Presidents before and after 9/11, \nthe decision about where to hold a prospective terrorist should be \nbased on the facts of each case, and should be made by national \nsecurity professionals in the executive branch.\n  In a letter, Secretary Panetta said this week that this provision \n``restrains the executive branch's options to utilize, in a swift and \nflexible fashion, all the counterterrorism tools that are now legally \navailable.''\n  He added that the bill as written ``. . . may needlessly complicate \nefforts by frontline law enforcement professionals to collect critical \nintelligence concerning operations and activities within the United \nStates.''\n  This is the man who ran the CIA and is now running the Department of \nDefense, and we are going to ignore him? Are we saying it doesn't make \nany difference what he says? I am not part of that school of thought. I \nthink what he says does make a difference.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have Secretary Panetta's November 15 \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2011.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to express the Department of \n     Defense's principal concerns with the latest version of \n     detainee-related language you are considering including in \n     the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year \n     2012. We understand the Senate Armed Services Committee is \n     planning to consider this language later today.\n       We greatly appreciate your willingness to listen to the \n     concerns expressed by our national security professionals on \n     the version of the NDAA bill reported by the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee in June. I am convinced we all want the \n     same result--flexibility for our national security \n     professionals in the field to detain, interrogate, and \n     prosecute suspected terrorists. The Department has \n     substantial concerns, however, about the revised text, which \n     my staff has just received within the last few hours.\n       Section 1032. We recognize your efforts to address some of \n     our objections to section 1032. However, it continues to be \n     the case that any advantages to the Department of\n\n[[Page S7665]]\n\n     Defense in particular and our national security in general in \n     section 1032 of requiring that certain individuals be held by \n     the military are, at best, unclear. This provision restrains \n     the Executive Branch's options to utilize, in a swift and \n     flexible fashion, all the counterterrorism tools that are now \n     legally available.\n       Moreover, the failure of the revised text to clarify that \n     section 1032 applies to individuals captured abroad, as we \n     have urged, may needlessly complicate efforts by frontline \n     law enforcement professionals to collect critical \n     intelligence concerning operations and activities within the \n     United States.\n       Next, the revised language adds a new qualifier to \n     ``associated force''--that acts in coordination with or \n     pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda.'' In our view, this \n     new language unnecessarily complicates our ability to \n     interpret and implement this section.\n       Further, the new version of section 1032 makes it more \n     apparent that there is an intent to extend the certification \n     requirements of section 1033 to those covered by section 1032 \n     that we may want to transfer to a third country. In other \n     words, the certification requirement that currently applies \n     only to Guantanamo detainees would permanently extend to a \n     whole new category of future captures. This imposes a whole \n     new restraint on the flexibility we need to continue to \n     pursue our counterterrorism efforts.\n       Section 1033. We are troubled that section 1033 remains \n     essentially unchanged from the prior draft, and that none of \n     the Administration's concerns or suggestions for this \n     provision have been adopted. We appreciate that revised \n     section 1033 removes language that would have made these \n     restrictions permanent, and instead extended them through \n     Fiscal Year 2012 only. As a practical matter, however, \n     limiting the duration of the restrictions to the next fiscal \n     year only will have little impact if Congress simply \n     continues to insert these restrictions into legislation on an \n     annual basis without ever revisiting the substance of the \n     legislation. As national security officials in this \n     Department and elsewhere have explained, transfer \n     restrictions such as those outlined in section 1033 are \n     largely unworkable and pose unnecessary obstacles to \n     transfers that would advance our national security interests.\n       Section 1035. Finally, section 1035 shifts to the \n     Department of Defense responsibility for what has previously \n     been a consensus-driven interagency process that was informed \n     by the advice and views of counterterrorism professionals \n     from across the Government. We see no compelling reason--and \n     certainly none has been expressed in our discussions to \n     date--to upset a collaborative, interagency approach that has \n     served our national security so well over the past few years.\n       I hope we can reach agreement on these important national \n     security issues, and, as always, my staff is available to \n     work with the Committee on these and other matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leon E. Panetta.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me explain why this proposal is bad policy.\n  Consider the case of Najibullah Zazi. He was arrested in September of \n2009 as part of an al-Qaida conspiracy to carry out suicide bombings of \nthe New York City subway system. The FBI arrested Zazi after they had \nfollowed him on a 24/7 basis. He began providing useful intelligence to \nthe FBI once captured.\n  If the mandatory military custody in the Armed Services bill were \nlaw, all of the surveillance activities, all of what the FBI did would \nbe in jeopardy. Instead of interrogating him about his coconspirators, \nor where he had hidden other bombs, the FBI would have squandered \nvaluable time determining whether Zazi was a member or part of al-Qaida \nor an ``associated force.'' Requiring law enforcement and national \nsecurity professionals to determine whether an individual meets a \nspecific legal definition adds a delay--most people would have to admit \nthis. Also a waiver process takes time as it proceeds through the \nPresident and Secretary of Defense, both of whom believe it unduly \ncomplicates the ability to immediately interrogate an individual or \nprevent another attack.\n  Suppose a terrorist such as Zazi were forced into mandatory military \ncustody. Then the government could also have been forced to split up \ncodefendants, even in cases where they otherwise could be prosecuted as \npart of the same conspiracy in the same legal system.\n  Zazi was a permanent legal resident. His coconspirators were both \nU.S. citizens. They would be prosecuted on terrorist charges in Federal \ncriminal court, but Zazi himself would be transferred to military \ncustody. Two different detention and prosecution systems would play out \nand could well complicate a unified prosecution.\n  Incidentally, in the Zazi case, prosecutors have obtained convictions \nagainst six individuals, including guilty pleas from Zazi, who faces \nlife in Federal prison without parole.\n  What could be better than that? If it is not broke, don't fix it. \nWhat is happening now isn't broke. That is the point.\n  Guess what. I try to do my homework, I read the intelligence, and I \ntry to know what is happening. It is working. The government has its \nact together. Now arbitrarily this is going to change because there is \na predilection of some people in this body that the military must do it \nall--if they cannot do it all, a part of it. But what this does is \nessentially militarize certain criminal terrorist acts in the United \nStates. I have a real problem with that. I don't understand why \nCongress would want to jeopardize successful terrorism prosecutions.\n  The former speaker was talking about Farouq Abdulmutallab, better \nknown as the Underwear Bomber, from Christmas Day in 2009. \nAbdulmutallab was brought into custody in Detroit after failing to \ndetonate a bomb on Northwest Flight 253. He was interrogated almost \nimmediately by FBI special agents. And he talked.\n  Some critics contend that Abdulmutallab stopped talking later that \nday because he was Mirandized. That happens to be correct, at least \ntemporarily. But what these critics don't mention is that he likely \nwould have been even less forthcoming to military interrogators.\n  It was FBI agents who traveled to Abdulmutallab's home in Nigeria and \npersuaded family members to come to Detroit to assist them in getting \nhim to talk. The situation would have been very different under Section \n1032. Under the pending legislation, it would have been military \npersonnel who were attempting to enlist prominent Nigerians to assist \nin their interrogation, and Abdulmutallab would have been classified as \nan enemy combatant and held in a military facility and, therefore, his \nfamily would not be inclined to cooperate. This is we have been told on \nthe Intelligence Committee.\n  For the record, Umar Farouq Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty to all \ncharges last month in a Federal criminal court in Michigan and will \nlikely spend his life behind bars. What can be better than that? Where \ncan the military commission come close to that effort? In fact, they \ncan't. They had 6 cases, minor sentences, or released, plus 300 to 400 \nconvictions in Federal Court.\n  To conclude on this mandatory military custody provision, the Defense \nDepartment has made clear it does not want the responsibility to take \nthese terrorists into mandatory military custody. But do we know \nbetter? I don't think so.\n  The Department of Justice has said that approximately one-third of \nterrorists charged in Federal Court in 2010 would be subject to \nmandatory military detention, absent a waiver from the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  The administration contends that the mandatory military custody is \nunwise because our allies will not extradite terrorist suspects to the \nUnited States for interrogation and prosecution--or even provide \nevidence about suspected terrorists--if they will be sent to a military \nbrig or Guantanamo.\n  Finally, the military isn't trained or equipped for this mission--\nthey have plenty to do as it is--but the Department of Justice is.\n  As John Brennan, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security \nand Counterterrorism, said in March:\n\n       Terrorists arrested inside the United States will, as \n     always, be processed exclusively through our criminal justice \n     system. As they should be.\n\n  I agree.\n\n       The alternative would be inconsistent with our values and \n     our adherence to the rule of law. Our military does not \n     patrol our streets or enforce our laws in this country. Nor \n     should it.\n\n  I could add that our military doesn't spend its resources and \nexpertise surveilling terrorists in the U.S. like Najibullah Zazi, as \nthe FBI did, to know his every move, to know where he bought the \nchemicals, to know the amount of chemicals, to know what backpacks they \nhad, and to follow him to New York. It makes no sense to me to have to \ntransfer that jurisdiction.\n  The second problematic provision imposes burdensome restrictions to \ntransfer detainees out of Guantanamo, section 1033. This provision \nessentially establishes a de facto ban on transfers of detainees out of \nGitmo, even for the purpose of prosecution in U.S. courts or another \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\n  The provision requires the Secretary of Defense to make a series of \ncertifications that are unreasonable--and, candidly, unknowable--before \nany detainee is transferred out of Gitmo.\n  Again, here is an example: The administration proposed eliminating \nthe requirement that the Secretary of Defense certify that the foreign \ncountry where the detainee will be sent is not ``facing a threat that \nis likely to substantially affect its ability to exercise control over \nthe individual.''\n  How can the Secretary of Defense certify that--facing a threat that \nis likely to not just affect, but substantially affect, its ability to \nexercise control over the individual? What does it mean for a nation to \n``exercise control'' over a former Gitmo detainee? Does he have to be \nin custody? Can he have an ankle bracelet? Is he remanded to his home? \nIs he in some county facility somewhere? What does it mean?\n  The Secretary of Defense must also certify, in writing, that there is \nvirtually no chance that the person being transferred out of American \ncustody would turn against the United States once resettled.\n  I agree with the sentiment, but as it is written, this is another \nimpossible condition to satisfy.\n  The administration tried to work with the Armed Services Committee to \nmake this section more workable, but the input by professionals in the \ndefense, law enforcement, and intelligence communities, quite frankly, \nwas rejected.\n  The committee didn't address the concerns of the administration \nexcept to limit these restrictions to 1 year.\n  In his November 15 letter, Secretary Panetta wrote he was troubled \nthis section remains essentially unchanged and that none of the \nadministration's concerns or suggestions for the provision were \nadopted. This in itself is a concern. The views of the professionals \nwho do this day in and day out should be considered. Congress is not on \nthe streets, we are not shadowing terrorists, we are not putting \ntogether intelligence. So I find this just terribly imperious.\n  The third problematic detention provision reverses the interagency \nprocess of detention reviews for those detained at Guantanamo.\n  Let me begin by saying I support detention of terrorists under the \nlaw of war. There must be a way to hold people who would, if free, take \nup arms against us. But detention without charge, perhaps forever, is a \npower that must be subject to serious review to ensure it is applied \ncorrectly and that we are only holding people--in some cases for \ndecades--with cause and careful consideration and review.\n  Incidentally, this would apply to U.S. citizens. Do we want to go \nhome and tell the people of America we are going to hold them, if such \na situation comes up, without any thorough and considered review? It is \njust not the American way.\n  In March, the President issued an executive order that laid out the \nprocess for reviewing each detainee's case to make sure indefinite \ndetention continues to be an appropriate and preferred course. Section \n1035 essentially reverses the interagency process created by the \nPresident's order.\n  Let me just say a few things about this process. The Secretary of \nDefense is in charge of the decision. He is allowed to reject the \nfindings of an interagency review board that includes a senior official \nfrom the State Department, the Department of Defense, the Justice \nDepartment, DHS, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, \nand the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They, \ntogether, review a case of a person who could be held forever without \ntrial, without charge. They can deliberate on the kind of threat this \nindividual continues.\n  There are people who are in Guantanamo--or I should say who were in \nGuantanamo--who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. That \nis possible for an American as well. Everything we are all about is to \nsee that the system is a just system. This is not just and particularly \nnot for a U.S. citizen. I don't care who they are, they have certain \nrights under the Constitution as a U.S. citizen.\n  Why should we place the Department of Defense above the unified \njudgment of five other departments on what is, at its heart, a question \nabout the legality of continued detention, the assessment of the threat \na detainee poses, and the options available to handle that individual?\n  Secretary Panetta is not requesting new authority in this section. \nAgain, reading from the Secretary's November 15 letter, he says:\n\n       Section 1035 shifts to the Department of Defense \n     responsibility for what has been a consensus-driven \n     interagency process that was informed by the advice and views \n     of counterterrorism professionals from across the Government. \n     We see no compelling reason--and certainly none has been \n     expressed in our discussions to date--to upset a \n     collaborative, interagency approach that has served our \n     national security so well over the past few years.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying I support the vast majority of provisions \nin this authorization. The bill improves our national security and it \nis essential to meet our commitment to the men and women of our Armed \nForces. I understand all that, and I have voted for virtually every \nDefense authorization bill. But I intend to continue to oppose these \nthree detention policy provisions.\n  I have not made up my mind, candidly, how I will vote on this bill. I \nguess maybe I see things a little differently than many in this body, \nbecause one of the things I have learned in my time here is the \nimportance of the U.S. Constitution--and I have had 18 years on the \nJudiciary Committee--and what it means to have due process of law, and \nthat means for everybody. That is for the poorest person on the street, \nthe wealthiest person or whoever it is. Criminals are entitled to due \nprocess of law.\n  How can we do this? It may not stand the test of constitutionality. \nBut be that as it may, despite having raised these concerns months ago \nand offered suggestions to address them, this bill does very little to \nresolve my three principal concerns and those of the administration \nabout mandatory military custody and the possibility this bill will \ncreate operational confusion and problems in the field.\n  I look forward to the debate. Candidly, I hope sides haven't \nhardened. The three amendments I will offer will--one will strike the \nlanguage, one will insert the word ``abroad,'' in section 1032, and one \nwill carry with it the administration's proposal. I hope there will be \nthe opportunity to offer these amendments.\n  I can't think of anything more serious that we are doing, and I must \ntell you a lot of effort has gone into putting the FBI in a position by \ncreating a huge intelligence operation within the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation to be able to deal with terrorist threats in this \ncountry. We also have a Department of Homeland Security to do that as \nwell. To now say the military is going to take over in certain \nsituations is going to end up unworkable, if, in fact, this becomes the \nlaw and I hope it will not.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator from California \nmight offer those amendments right now and call them up so we can get a \nvote on them. We are trying to vote on amendments, and I am wondering \nif she could call up one of those amendments, we could debate it, and \nthen vote on it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I only found out this bill was coming up this \nmorning, so the administration is reviewing the largest amendment at \nthe present time.\n  The other two amendments, we may already have filed those.\n  We have filed those, but I would prefer to wait until we have the \nlarger amendment, which is being reviewed by the administration, and \nthen I will be making a decision as to which I want to go with.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Which amendment is the larger one?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is the amendment currently being reviewed by the \nadministration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is that one of the three?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Which was the larger of the three; can the Senator \ndescribe it for us?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. There are several amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Which is the one currently being reviewed, if the Senator \nis able to share that with us.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This essentially would strike the detention \nprovisions\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\nand replace them with proposals from the executive branch. It reflects \nwhat the White House offered to Senators Levin and McCain as compromise \nlanguage on the detention provisions to address the opposition raised \nby the administration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have more to say, but I am not sure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That helps. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, one, I would like to begin by thanking \nSenators Levin and McCain. I don't know how long Senator Levin and I \nhave been working on this together--it seems like forever--trying to \nget a detainee policy in a post-9/11 world that the courts will accept \nand that lives within our values. I have just been thinking throughout \nthe years about the journey we have taken--beginning with the Bush \nadministration--where the idea of indefinite detention of unlawful \nenemy combatants originated by executive order.\n  I do believe, since 9/11, we have been in a state of undeclared war \nwith organizations such as al-Qaida. The Congress created legislation \nearly on--right after the attacks of 9/11--allowing the President to \nuse military force against al-Qaida. Part of being able to engage \nsomeone militarily is to detain those we capture. But that has been \nyears ago. This is the first time Congress has spoken since the early \ndays of the war.\n  We tried during the Bush administration to work with the Bush people \nto create a law of war detention system by statute. We had a problem \nthere. They felt the executive order was the way to go. I have always \nbelieved when the Congress and the White House work together, the \ncourts appreciate it as being a more collaborative process. So we went \nfrom sort of one extreme--to where we had military commissions that \nwere almost legislating a conviction--to a better product, and the end \nproduct was the 2009 bill we worked on with Senator Levin that got \nalmost 80 votes. So we have come a long way.\n  About the detention issue. Here is what I have been trying to \naccomplish for years. I wish to make sure we understand the difference \nbetween fighting a war and fighting a crime. When it comes to al-Qaida \noperatives, whether they are captured in the United States or overseas, \nthe first thing we should be doing as a nation is trying to find out \nwhat that person knows about the attack in question or future attacks. \nWhen we capture an enemy prisoner, the first thing our military does is \nturn the person over to the military intelligence community for \nquestioning.\n  I am of the belief that we have the ability to question people under \nthe law of war without congressional authorization. But when the \nCongress acts, it is better for us all. So in this bill, working with \nSenators Levin and McCain, we have, as a body, said the President--this \nPresident and all future Presidents--will have the ability to detain a \nmember of al-Qaida and other allied organizations, regardless of where \nthey are captured in the world, and hold them as an enemy combatant.\n  Under the law of war, when we capture an enemy prisoner, there is no \nmagic date we have to let them go. The problem with this war, unlike \nother wars, is there will not be a definable end. We had 400,000 German \nprisoners in military prisons inside the United States during World War \nII. We weren't going to let those folks go if they had been in jail 1 \nyear. Not one of them got to go see a Federal judge saying: Let me out \nof here.\n  Under the law of war of our military, the executive branch of \ngovernment has the authority to protect the Nation, and courts have not \ninterfered with that 200-year right.\n  What is different about this war? There are no capitals to conquer, \nthere is no air force to shoot down or navy to sink. So we have people \nwho don't wear uniforms who are roaming the globe, and they don't have \na home country, they have a home idea, and we are fighting an ideology. \nSometimes they make it to our soil and sometimes they don't.\n  So here is what we are trying to do. We are trying to create a hybrid \nsystem, for lack of a better word. If you captured an al-Qaida member \noverseas in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Yemen, it is clear that they have no \nconstitutional right to petition a judge in the United States: Let me \ngo.\n  When we put people in Guantanamo Bay, the Bush administration argued \nthat prison wasn't subject to legal review by our courts. And in the \nHamdi case involving a U.S. citizen captured in Afghanistan, the \nSupreme Court held that we could hold an American citizen as an enemy \ncombatant. They suggested to the Bush administration a procedure to \nratify that decision. They pointed to an Army regulation, 190--I can't \nremember the number--and we tried to come up with a procedure that \nwould allow us some due process as a nation for an enemy combatant, \nincluding an American citizen.\n  In the Boumediene case, the Court said: Wait a minute. We are going \nto allow a habeas petition by those held as enemy combatants--American \ncitizens or non-American citizens--if they are at Guantanamo Bay \nbecause we have control over that facility. That is part of the United \nStates in terms of our legal infrastructure.\n  So the law of the land is that if you are captured overseas, even if \nyou are an American citizen, you can be held as an enemy combatant and \nquestioned by our military with no right to proceed to a criminal \nvenue. It is not a choice to try them or let them go. You can hold an \nunlawful enemy combatant for an indefinite period of time just like you \ncould hold any other enemy prisoner in any other war. But what we have \ndone differently in this war is we have said: Our courts will review \nthe military's decision to declare you as an enemy combatant in a \nhabeas procedure--not a criminal trial but a habeas procedure--as to \nwhether there is sufficient evidence to label you as an unlawful enemy \ncombatant.\n  So, to my colleagues on the other side, the law of the land by the \nSupreme Court is that an American citizen can be held as an enemy \ncombatant. Like every other enemy combatant, they have habeas rights, \nbut they don't have the right to say: Try me in a civilian court or \nmilitary commission court, because when we capture someone, the goal is \nto gather intelligence.\n  The Christmas Day Bomber, the Times Square case--the reason many of \nus want military custody from the outset is that under domestic \ncriminal law, other than a very narrow public safety exception, we \ndon't have the right under criminal law to hold someone for an \nindefinite period of time without providing them a lawyer and telling \nthem what their legal rights are or charging them in a court of law. \nAnd let me say, as a military lawyer, I would never want that to be the \ncase. I don't want to change our domestic criminal system to allow us \nto grab someone and hold them indefinitely, pending criminal charges, \nwithout the right to a lawyer, the right to remain silent being \npresented to the defendant, and presentment to court, because that is \nwhat criminal law is all about. Under military law, whether it is here \nat home or abroad, you can hold someone suspected of being an enemy \nagent, enemy prisoner, and you can interrogate them humanely and \nlawfully--and we have good laws now governing interrogation \nprocedures--without having to present them to a court. That is the \ndifference between intelligence gathering and fighting a crime.\n  The Padilla case was an American citizen captured inside the United \nStates. He was held for about 4 years in Charleston Naval Brig, and the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that, yes, an American citizen \ncaptured within the United States can be held as an unlawful enemy \ncombatant, but they have the right to counsel when it comes to \npresenting their habeas case. They don't have the ability to tell the \ninterrogator and the military: I don't want to talk to you now. I want \nmy lawyer.\n  When you are talking to a military interrogator or the FBI or the CIA \ntrying to gather intelligence, you don't have a right to remain silent, \nyou don't have a right to a lawyer because we are trying to defend \nourselves against an enemy bent on our destruction. The day we decide \nto treat you as a common criminal, even a terrorist suspect, all those \ncivilian rights attach.\n  So this bill is trying to create a process that if you are captured \nin the United States, this legislation says\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\nthat you will be presumptively put in military custody because that is \nthe only way we can hold you and interrogate you because under domestic \ncriminal law, that is not available, nor should it be.\n\n  There is a waiver provision here. If the administration believes that \nmilitary custody is not the right way to go, they can waive that. But \nthe day you turn someone over to civilian authorities for the purpose \nof prosecution, you have a very limited window to gather intelligence \nbecause all the criminal rules apply. And what we are trying to do is \nto make sure we can defend ourselves and not overly criminalize the \nwar. That is why this is so important.\n  As to the White House concerns--they wanted to have that flexibility \nwithout any statutory involvement--I believe this will serve the Nation \nwell long after President Obama leaves office. I don't know who the \nnext President will be, but I do believe this: We will be under threat \nand siege by an enemy bent on our destruction.\n  So if you believe, as I do, that we are at war but it is a different \nkind of war, please give your Nation--our Nation--the ability to defend \nus. And the best way to be safe in the war on terror is to gather good \nintelligence and hit them and stop them before they hit you because \nthey could care less about dying. So intelligence gathering is the way \nto keep us safe.\n  Most enemy prisoners captured in traditional wars never go to court. \nThe last thing I am worried about is how you prosecute these guys. The \nfirst thing I worry about is, what do they know, and what is coming our \nway?\n  So the provisions of 1032 apply to captures within the United States. \nAnd we are saying that when an al-Qaida operative suspected of being \ninvolved in a terrorist act--a very limited class of cases, by the \nway--is captured on our soil, we would like them to be in military \ncustody from the get-go. But we have provisions that say: You don't \nhave to make that decision or interrupt an interrogation. There is a \nwindow of time in which you can deal with the case without having to \nmake the waiver. We are not impeding interrogations, and we are not \nsaying you have to stay in military custody forever because we give \nthis administration and future administrations the flexibility to waive \nthat provision if it makes sense.\n  To the Christmas Day Bomber--he was read his Miranda rights within an \nhour, his family was involved, and it turned out that he pled guilty. I \nam not a professional interrogator, but I do know this: You don't read \nan enemy prisoner their rights when you capture them on the battlefield \nin a war. The question is, Is the United States part of the \nbattlefield? That is really what this is about. Are we going to allow \nthe enemy to get here, and all of a sudden all the rules change because \nthey made it to our homeland? I would argue that the closer they are to \nus, the more we want to know. So it would be an absurd outcome that if \nsomehow the enemy could find a way to get to our homeland, all the \nrules change because if you capture one of these guys in Yemen, nobody \nis suggesting you have to give them a lawyer.\n  Well, when you get to the United States, what we are suggesting is \nthat we have a legal system that understands the difference between \nfighting a war and fighting a crime, and if you are suspected of being \nan al-Qaida member, citizen or not, we are going to find out what you \nknow through lawful interrogation techniques. That has to be done under \nthe military system because civilian domestic criminal law doesn't \nallow that to be done.\n  That is what we created here--a bifurcated system with waivers. If we \ndon't have this in place, we are going to lose intelligence and our \nNation is going to be at risk. People are going to get killed if we \nlose good intelligence.\n  So, to me, the idea of reading someone their Miranda rights doesn't \nmake a lot of sense, but you have the flexibility to do that, if you \nchoose, out in the field. You just have to get a waiver. So when you \ncapture somebody on the homeland, I don't want our people to think that \nyou have to give them a lawyer and read them their rights and that you \ncan't question them about what they know about attacks against our \nhomeland. That is dumb. That doesn't make us a better people, that \nmakes us less safe. Let's put them in military custody, with the right \nto waive that. Let's give our interrogators plenty of time to find out \nwhat is going on. Then we will make a decision about where to \nprosecute.\n  I believe Federal courts have a role in the war on terror. There have \nbeen plenty of cases involving terrorism that went to Federal court \nwhere you had a good outcome. There have been cases going to Federal \ncourt where you had less than a stellar outcome. The key is, if you are \nholding an enemy combatant for 4 or 5 years under the law of war, I \ndon't think it makes sense to put them in civilian court. You should \nput them in military commissions. And we are talking about people we \nhave been holding for a period of time because we looked at them as a \nmilitary threat, not as a common criminal.\n  So the provisions in 1032 are good law that will stand the test of \ntime. It will allow us on our homeland to do what we can do overseas. \nWouldn't it be odd not to be able to protect yourself because the enemy \ngot to the United States less than you could if you captured them \noverseas?\n  Now let's talk a little bit about American citizens. There are a few \npeople--and I give them credit for having passionate, honest-held \nbeliefs that the President of the United States doesn't have the \nauthority to designate an American citizen who has now joined al-\nQaida--to issue an order to kill him--this al-Awlaki guy who was in \nYemen. The bottom line is, the President, through a legal process we \ncreated years ago, made a determination that an American citizen has \njoined the enemy forces, and he issued an order through a legal process \nthat says: If you find this guy, you can capture or kill him.\n  Now, wouldn't it be odd if you had a law that says you can kill \nsomebody, but when you capture them, you can't hold them for a very \nlong time, you can't indefinitely detain them? Well, death is pretty \nindefinite. So if you can kill a guy, why in the world can't you hold \nthem and interrogate them to find out what they know about this attack \nor future attacks?\n  So let's be consistent. It makes sense to me that if an American \ncitizen wants to join al-Qaida, they are no longer our friend, they are \nour enemy. And if the evidence is solid and it has gone through a legal \nprocess and this President or any other President determined that an \nAmerican citizen is now operating abroad trying to harm us, joining al-\nQaida, I believe they have the absolute legal and moral authority to \nidentify that person as a threat to the United States; kill or capture. \nAnd if you don't agree with me, fine. I think about 80 percent of my \nfellow citizens do. It would be absurd not to be able to have that \nability. Citizenship is something to be respected. It is something to \nbe cherished. It is not a ``get out of jail free'' card when you turn \non your fellow citizens.\n\n  So at the end of the day, we have a system in place now that I am \nvery proud of.\n  To Senator Levin, we have negotiated and we have compromised because \nthe administration had some legitimate concerns. They had some \nlegitimate concerns about Congress overly mandating how you detain, \ninterrogate, and try prisoners. What we have come up with is the \nbalance I have been seeking for 5 years. If you capture someone in the \nUnited States, you start with the presumption that you are going to \ngather intelligence in a lawful manner and prosecution is a secondary \nconcern. We give the executive branch the ability to waive that \nrequirement, and we have conditions on that requirement that will not \ninterrupt an interrogation.\n  But we need to let this President know, and every other President, \nthat if you capture someone in the homeland, on our soil--American \ncitizen or not--who is a member of al-Qaida, you do not have to give \nthem a lawyer or read them the rights automatically. You can treat them \nas a military threat under military custody, just like if you captured \nthem overseas.\n  So this provision that Senators Levin, McCain Ayotte, and all of us \nhave worked on makes perfect sense to me. It is a balance between \nprotecting our homeland, living within our values, and giving the \nexecutive branch the flexibility they need to protect us, but just \nusing good old-fashioned common\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nsense. Under domestic criminal law, you cannot hold someone \nindefinitely without giving them a lawyer or reading them their rights, \nnor should you. But under military law, if you have evidence that the \nperson is a military threat, you don't have to give them a lawyer. That \nmakes no sense whether you capture them here or overseas.\n  Everyone held as an unlawful enemy combatant has the right to access \nour Federal courts. Under this bill, it is not just one time you get to \ngo to court. We create an annual review process so that if you are held \nas an enemy combatant in military prison or civilian prison, you will \nget an annual review. We don't want you to go into a black legal hole. \nWe don't want an enemy combatant determination to be a de facto life \nsentence.\n\n  I am proud of this work product. We go further than what the courts \nrequire. The courts require a habeas review of any person held as an \nenemy combatant. But at the end of the day, we say you have an annual \nreview.\n  That requirement is for people captured in the United States, held at \nGitmo. It doesn't apply to people held in Afghanistan. Thank God it \ndoesn't. But in circumstances where someone is captured in the United \nStates, held at Guantanamo Bay, every person will have their day in \ncourt to challenge the status of enemy combatant, and if they are going \nto be held indefinitely, they are going to get an annual review process \nas to whether it makes sense to hold them for 1 year.\n  Again, I wish to emphasize in war we do not have to let people go who \nare a danger. Most of these cases are intel cases. We are not fighting \na crime, we are fighting a war. If the intelligence is good enough to \nconvince a Federal judge that this person is a military threat, why in \nGod's name would you want to let him go because of the passage of time? \nOur message to al-Qaida recruits is don't join al-Qaida because you \ncould get killed or wind up dying in jail. Isn't that the message we \nwant to send? Why in the world would we require our Nation to release \nsomebody when the evidence presented to a Federal judge is convincing \nenough for him to sign off on what the military determined at an \narbitrary point in time? That doesn't make us better people. It would \nmake us less safe.\n  This bill is a very sound, balanced work product, and I will stand by \nit, I will fight for it, and I respect those who may disagree. But why \ndid we take out the language Senator Levin wanted me to put in about an \nAmerican citizen could not be held indefinitely if caught in the \nhomeland? The administration asked us to do that. Why did they ask us \nto do that? It makes perfect sense. If American citizens have joined \nthe enemy and we captured them at home, we want to make sure we know \nwhat they are up to, and we do not want to be required, under our law, \nto turn them over to a criminal court, where you have to provide them a \nlawyer at an arbitrary point in time. So the administration was \nprobably right to take this out.\n  Simply stated, if you are an American citizen and you want to join \nal-Qaida: Bad decision; you could get killed or you could spend the \nrest of your life in military prison as a military threat or you could \nwind up in an article 3 court and maybe get the death penalty. I want \npeople to know there is a downside to joining the enemy. I want to give \nour country the tools we need as a nation to fight an enemy and do it \nwithin our values. I don't want to waterboard people, but I don't want \nthe only interrogation tool to be the Army Field Manual, online where \nanybody can read it. I wish to make sure everybody has a chance to say: \nI am not an enemy combatant. But I don't want to criminalize the war by \ncapturing somebody on our soil and saying: You have a right to remain \nsilent, when we would never read that right and present that to them if \nwe captured them overseas.\n  We want to make sure we can gather intelligence, whether we capture \nthem at home or abroad, whether they are an American citizen or not, if \nthere is evidence they have joined al-Qaida.\n  To my colleagues, if you join al-Qaida, no matter where you join, no \nmatter where you take up arms against the United States, we have every \nright in the world to treat you as a military threat. People who have \njoined al-Qaida are not members of a mob. They are not trying to enrich \nthemselves. They are trying to put the world into darkness. Our laws \nneed to distinguish the difference between a guy who robbed a liquor \nstore and somebody who wants to blow up an airplane over Detroit or \nblow up innocent people in Times Square. If you do not understand that \ndifference and if you do not have a legal system that can recognize \nthat difference, then we have failed the American people.\n  This is a good work product. It has strong bipartisan support. We \nworked with the administration. But we are in a long war where a lot is \nat stake. I have tried to be as reasonable as I know how to be, and \nthis work product is the best effort of a lot of well-meaning people, \nRepublicans and Democrats. I will defend it. If you want to keep \narguing about it, some people suggested we will talk a long time about \nthis--yes, we will talk a long time about this. We will have a good \ndiscussion among ourselves as to whether an al-Qaida operative caught \nin the United States gets more rights than if we caught him overseas. \nWe will have an argument among ourselves as to whether our military \nshould be able to gather intelligence to protect us, regardless of \nwhere the person is captured, and the question for the nation is: Is \nAmerica part of the battlefield? You better believe it is part of the \nbattlefield. This is where they want to come. This is where they want \nto hurt us the most. If they make it here, they should not get more \nrights than they would get if they attacked us overseas.\n  They should not be tortured because it is about us, not about them. \nThe reason I don't want to torture anybody is because I like being an \nAmerican. I think it makes us stronger than our enemies. There are ways \nto get good intelligence from the enemy without having to mimic their \nbehavior. I do believe the military's work product should be judged and \nreviewed in Federal court in a reasoned way. That is part of this \nlegislation. I do not want anybody to be sitting in jail forever \nwithout some review process so that one day maybe they could get out.\n  But here is what I will not tolerate. I will not criminalize what is \na war. I will not put this Nation in the box of having captured a \nterrorist, when the evidence is solid that we know they are part of the \nenemy trying to kill us and say we have to give them a lawyer or let \nthem go because of the passage of time. That makes no sense.\n  Senator Levin, Senator McCain, this is a product we should be proud \nof. We should fight for it, and we are going to fight. If you want to \nmake it a long fight, it will be a long fight. We are not giving up.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am a little puzzled. Maybe the Senator from South \nCarolina has a response to this. Perhaps Chairman Levin does. We did \ngive a national security waiver, which is very generous, in that the \nPresident just has to certify that it is in the national interest.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Why does he think that would not be acceptable if there \nwere a case where an individual would be held by civilian authorities \nrather than military authorities?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The only answer I can give to Senator McCain is that \nthere is a legitimate concern about encroaching on executive power. I \nhave that concern. The executive branch is the lead agency in this war. \nThey are the lead agency when it comes to prosecuting crime. But what I \nam trying to do, along with his help and that of Senator Levin, is to \ncreate statutory authority for this President and future Presidents \nthat will serve the Nation well.\n  Congress has been too quiet and too silent. During the Bush years, we \ndid not assert ourselves enough. We let things go. We were reluctant to \nget involved. Now we are involved in a constructive way.\n  What we have said as a Congress, if this bill passes, is that the \nexecutive branch has flexibility, but the Congress of the United \nStates--which has powers when it comes to war--believes that an al-\nQaida operative, those associated with al-Qaida, should be initially \nheld in military custody because we are trying to gather intelligence. \nAs I tried to\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\nexplain, if you turn them over to civilian authorities for law \nenforcement purposes, then the whole process of intelligence gathering \nstops. You have to read Miranda rights. There is a very limited public \nsafety exception. We allow a waiver if that is in the best interests of \nour national security. We have requirements in the bill not to impede \ninterrogation. That is why we are doing this, because we want a process \nthat will allow us to deal with people caught in the United States in a \nconsistent way from administration to administration and understand the \ndistinction between gathering intelligence to defend yourself in a war \nand prosecuting a crime.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Everyone we capture may not be as stupid as the couple \nwho waived their Miranda rights. One of them is going to be pretty \nsmart and certainly not waive their Miranda rights. Wouldn't that make \nsense over time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator is absolutely right. The flexibility of \nwhether to Mirandize somebody exists. I don't know what is the best \nway. I do believe the best start is to take the Christmas Day Bomber \noff the plane and interrogate him in terms of what he knows about \nfuture attacks, how he planned this attack, and worry about prosecution \nin a secondary fashion. The only way you can do that is through a \nmilitary custody intelligence-gathering process.\n  At the end of the day, I do believe it makes a lot of sense for the \nCongress to weigh in. We have not done it before. We have balanced this \nout. The administration's concerns have been met as much as I know how \nto meet them, and I am very proud of the work product.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Christmas Day Bomber, I believe he was taken off that \nplane in Detroit, he was interrogated by the FBI; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I believe so.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There was nothing wrong with that. That was the choice of \nthe executive branch. It worked here.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Nothing wrong with that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We make it flexible. This is something which I heard today \nfrom the supporters of this amendment. They want flexibility.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is exactly what we provide in this amendment. That is \nthe question Senator McCain just asked: If this administration or any \nadministration decides that they want to provide the civilians with \nopportunity to interrogate, for whatever length of time they want, they \nare going to set the procedures under this language in our bill; is \nthat not correct? The President will determine the procedures. If he \nwants those procedures to be civilian control until some point, that is \ngoing to be up to the President. We may disagree with that or not.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Exactly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are Members of our body who very strongly disagree \nwith that.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But that is not who is going to decide. We are not going \nto make the decision that the person is going to be given or not given \ncivilian interrogation. That decision is going to be made by a \nPresident who sets the procedures for interrogation and will decide \nwhether to provide a waiver; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is contract. If I might continue the conversation \nfor a minute, if you don't mind. Would the Senator agree with me that \nif we all of a sudden required our soldiers to read Miranda warnings to \nan al-Qaida operative caught in Afghanistan, people would think we \nwere crazy?\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would think it would be a very bad policy.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. OK. What if we have the very same person who made it out \nof Afghanistan and makes it to America. I think most people would want \nus to gather intelligence to find out what is coming next. Would the \nSenator agree with me, if you put someone in civilian control for the \npurpose of prosecution, intelligence gathering becomes very difficult?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Not necessarily. I think there are occasions where the \ncivilian interrogation may be actually more workable.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. OK. Fair enough. But does the Senator agree with me that \nyou cannot indefinitely hold someone under domestic criminal law \nwithout presenting them to court or reading them Miranda rights?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct--indefinitely. But how long that lasts is \na procedure the President is going to determine.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right. But here is the point we are going to make. Some \nof us believe that presentment to a court and a Miranda warning may not \nbe the best way to go, in terms of gathering intelligence. Under \nmilitary custody for intelligence gathering there is no right to remain \nsilent; does the Senator agree with that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under military custody, yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So we are starting the game with military custody but for \nthe reasons the Senator just said--and they may be good reasons, to say \nthat is not the right way to go--they can go down another path. That is \nall we are trying to do. Because there is a sort of a gap when it comes \nto someone caught in the United States. We are trying to provide \nclarity, what to do with an al-Qaida member caught in the United \nStates, to create flexibility but start the process with intelligence \ngathering because, in the United States, if you hold someone, under the \nlaw enforcement model, caught in the United States, you have to read \nthem their rights. You have to present them to court.\n  If they are in military custody, you don't have to do that. But what \nsystem fits the situation best should be left to the executive branch. \nWe are just creating an avenue for military custody that can be waived.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct, providing flexibility which we should \nprovide in order for the executive branch to have what they want, which \nis the flexibility. There, I think, many of our colleagues believe \nthere is too much flexibility. But whether that is right or----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Oh, yes, they are over here. There are plenty of them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But whether they are right or wrong, the facts are in this \nbill there is flexibility. It is carefully laid out. The President will \nlay out the procedures and notify the Congress of those procedures. But \nthe point is, we do provide the very flexibility that the President of \nthe United States has sought. We give them that flexibility, and it \nseems to me for the characterization of this bill to be that there is \nno flexibility, that somebody must go into military detention, is \ninaccurate. We ought to debate policy, but we should not debate what \nthe words of a bill are.\n  One other thing. Is it not correct that when it is said, as the \nSenator from California did, that this provision has unprecedented and \nnew authority for indefinite detention of American citizens without \ntrial, that as a matter of fact we had in section 1031, in the bill \nfiled months ago, language which would have exempted American citizens? \nIt was the administration that wrote 1031 the way it is now and has \napproved of that language; is that not correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is absolutely correct. Let's talk about indefinite \ndetention and what it means. When someone is captured as a member of \nal-Qaida--the Bush administration has had people at Guantanamo Bay for \nyears. They are being held under the law of war. Does the Senator agree \nwith that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am sorry?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Bush administration has had prisoners held at \nGuantanamo Bay for years now who have not been prosecuted. They are \nheld under the law of war.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Obama administration has continued to hold at least \n48 under that same theory.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And believes they have that authority.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I believe they are right. All the Congress is saying to \nthe President--this one and future Presidents--is we agree with you, \nthat if the person is a member of al-Qaida or an affiliated group, you \ncan hold them as an enemy combatant without the requirement to let them \ngo at an arbitrary point in time, but under the law, if they are at \nGuantanamo Bay or captured in the United States, they have a\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\nhabeas right to appeal that determination to a judge.\n  Under our bill, does the Senator agree with me, we have done more \nthan that? We have created an annual review process so the person being \nindefinitely held will have some due process every year?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. The Senator has led the way to \nhave this kind of additional protection for those prisoners. There is \ngreater protection in this bill because of that review process than \nthere is without this bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right. And we should do that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could, one other question, because the Senator is an \nexpert on this subject. Is it also not true for the first time in terms \nof determining whether a person is, in fact, somebody who needs to be \ndetained under the law of war--for the first time when that \ndetermination is made, that person is entitled to a lawyer and entitled \nto a military judge?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me tell the Senator how he is dead right. I offered \nan amendment to the first bill we put on the table here on the floor \nabout this, and I had a requirement of a military lawyer being given to \nthe respondent at a combat status review tribunal. Every person being \nheld as an enemy combatant by our military gets a combat status review \ntribunal. We are saying that tribunal has to be chaired by a military \njudge, and we are saying they can access a lawyer. That, to me, is a \nwelcomed change.\n  The Obama administration and the Bush administration decided to put \nthe military judge requirement in place. But this now is a statutory \nrequirement, so the next President is going to be bound to do that. We \nare trying to create a process to allow a status tribunal hearing to be \ndone in a more due-process friendly fashion. We require a judge and we \nprovide access to counsel. To me that is a giant step forward.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And it is the law for the first time; is that not correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. For the first time it is now not the whim of the \nadministration. It will be the law of the land.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If this bill is enacted.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If this bill is enacted.\n  Mr. McCAIN. To kind of summarize this issue for our colleagues, we \nbelieve an al-Qaida operative is an enemy combatant and, therefore, the \nassumption should be that that enemy combatant should be under military \ncustody whether it be in the United States or any place else?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would argue especially in the United States since that \nposes the greatest threat. However, with our assumption that that \nperson should be held under military custody, we still give a very wide \nwaiver in case there are extenuating circumstances.\n  In other words, we are saying that we assume an al-Qaida operative, \nor a suspected al-Qaida operative, is an enemy combatant wherever they \nare on Earth and, therefore, they should be under military custody \nunless there is some reason that the President determines otherwise.\n  The counterargument we are hearing, in summary, is that because that \nal-Qaida operative is apprehended in the United States, therefore, they \nshould fall under civil authority, thereby negating the assumption that \nhe is an enemy combatant; he is a common criminal. This is a very \nimportant principle in this discussion we are having.\n  How do you treat a suspected al-Qaida terrorist who wants to, in the \ncase of the Underwear Bomber, blow up a plane with 100 some-odd \npassengers on it? Shouldn't that person be treated as an enemy \ncombatant and, therefore, subject to all of the rules of military \npeople who are under the supervision of the military? Isn't that what \nwe are debating here? The ACLU and the left, with all due respect, feel \nthat person should be--first of all, that al-Qaida operatives should be \ntreated under our criminal system rather than treated as an enemy \ncombatant who wants to do great harm to the United States of America. \nIs that an accurate description of what we are talking about here?\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, with one caveat. There is a line of thinking that we \nshould be using Federal courts exclusively, that military commissions \nare not appropriate in any circumstance, and that we should be using \nthe law enforcement model once we deal with an al-Qaida operative, \nparticularly here in the United States.\n  What we are saying in this legislation is that the battlefield \nincludes our own homeland. So that argument being made by the ACLU, I \nthink, will bear that because most Americans feel we are not dealing \nwith somebody who robbed a liquor store. These people present a \nmilitary threat, and we should be able to gather intelligence in a \nlawful way.\n  The administration's concern was, are we overstepping Executive \npower. I have, quite frankly, said I am concerned about that. Peter was \nconcerned about that; Dave was concerned about that; I have been \nconcerned about that because I don't believe you can have 535 attorneys \ngeneral or commanders in chief.\n  What we did to accommodate that concern is what the Senator from \nArizona said, we started out with a military custody requirement that \ncan be waived and the procedures to be waived are in the hands of the \nexecutive branch. As Senator Levin has indicated, this, to me, is very \nflexible and is so flexible that I feel very good about it.\n  If it were a mandate to put everybody in military custody and try \nthem in military commissions, even though I think that is the best \nthing to do, I would object, because the flexibility to make those \ndecisions needs to be had in the executive branch. There may be a time \nwhen an article 3 court is better than a military commission court for \nan al-Qaida operative. I don't want the Congress to say article 3 \ncourts could never be used. I don't want the Congress to say military \ncommissions are bad. We now have a good military commission system. We \nhave a process where the homeland is part of the battlefield. The \nindividual being captured on our homeland can be held to gather \nintelligence under military law. And if somebody is smarter than us and \nbelieves that is not the right model, they can change the model.\n  That is the best we can do, and that is the best I am going to do \nbecause I am very worried that in the future we are going to lock \nourselves down into policies that would have an absurd outcome that if \nyou made it to America, we cannot gather intelligence, which would be \ncrazy. There is no good reason for that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In addition to providing in this bill that the \ndetermination as to whether somebody is al-Qaida is to be made through \nprocedures which the President will adopt, No. 1, which is flexibility.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. 2, that determination shall not interfere with any \ninterrogation which is undertaken by civilian or any other authorities; \nis that not correct? And, finally, on top of that, there is a waiver \nthat is provided. We have all of that protection. So the statements \nthat are made on this floor and in some of the press that somehow or \nother we are pushing everybody who is determined to be al-Qaida into \nthe military detention system is not accurate because we have those \nthree protections, the procedures for that decision as to whether \nsomeone is al-Qaida, our procedures, which the President is going to \nadopt; secondly, we only apply this to al-Qaida, not to everybody who \nmight be captured; and, third, we have a waiver for triple protection \nto protect what the Senator rightly is sensitive to, and that is there \nbe flexibility in the executive branch.\n  All of us may say we want it done one way or another. We may presume \nit be done one way or another, we may wish that it be done one way, \ncivilian or military. Some of us may have different opinions. That is \nnot the point. That is not the issue. The issue is what does this bill \nprovide. This bill provides a reasonable amount of flexibility and does \nnot tell the President you must turn somebody who is suspected of being \nal-Qaida over to the civilians at any point or to the military at any \npoint.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may add another layer of process here. Some people \non our side say that is way too much. You should throw these people in \nmilitary--Senator Lieberman, my dear friend, if you left it up to him, \neverybody caught as an al-Qaida operative would be thrown in military \ncustody and would\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\nbe held as long as we need to hold them and would be tried by military \ncommissions.\n  At the end of the day that is sort of where I come out, but I am not \ngoing to create a 535-commander-in-chief body here because there are \ntimes when that may not work. What we have done is what the Senator \nsaid. If you capture someone at home, it is as the Senator described. \nThe reason, to my colleagues on this side, I wanted to build in the \nthings the Senator described is because I am very worried about \ncrossing over out of our lane into the executive lane. I think we have \ncreated a great process.\n\n  But here is what happens to that al-Qaida operative. Not only does \nthe executive branch have the flexibility to go one way versus the \nother, starting with the idea of military custody, but all the things \nthe Senator said are true.\n  What do they have beyond that? If someone is being held as an enemy \ncombatant, there are regulations requiring that they be presented to a \ncombat status review tribunal, now with a military judge, access to \ncounsel--I think it is within 60--I cannot remember the time period. \nThat is done. Then they have the right to take that decision and appeal \nit to a habeas Federal district court judge.\n  No one in America is going to be held as an enemy combatant who \ndoesn't get their day in Federal court. But their day in Federal court \nis a habeas proceeding, not a criminal trial. If the judge agrees with \nthe United States that you are, in fact, an enemy combatant, then you \ncan be held indefinitely, but we require an annual review. If the judge \nlets you go, they have to let you go. This is the best we can do. This \nis a hybrid system. In no other war do you have access to a Federal \ncourt.\n  As I said before, this is war without end, and if we don't watch it, \nan enemy combatant determination can be a de facto life sentence \nbecause there will never be an end to these hostilities probably in my \nlifetime. I recognize that. And in working with the Senator from \nMichigan and Peter and others, we have come up with a process now that \nallows the Federal court to review the military decision. We will have \nan annual review process if the judge agrees with the military. That, \nto me, is due process that makes sense in a war without an end; \nsomething you would not do in World War II, but something we need to do \nhere.\n  So to the critics, please read the damn bill. I apologize for saying \nit that way, but you are talking about things that don't exist. There \nis plenty of flexibility and waiver requirements in this bill. No one \nis being held indefinitely without due process. Not only is this due \nprocess you wouldn't get in any other war, this is due process beyond \nwhat exists today only if we can pass this bill.\n  I don't mind being considered by some of my colleagues as maybe too \nfriendly to due process. The reason I am so passionate about this is \nwhat we do sets a precedent for the world and the future. If one of our \nguys is captured, I can look the other people in the eye--al-Qaida \ncould care less, but other people might--and say we are a rule of law \nnation. I believe in the rule of law, but there is a difference between \nthe rule of law of fighting a crime and fighting a war.\n  I am proud of the military legal system. I do believe the military \njustice system has a role to play in this war. In military commissions, \nthe judges are the same judges who administer justice to our own \ntroops, the same prosecutors, the same defense attorneys, the same \njurors. I am proud of the military legal system. I am proud of the \nFederal court system. I want to use both.\n  Senator Levin, we have been working on this for years. This is the \nbest work product I have seen. I hope my colleagues will understand we \nhave thought long and hard about this, and if we don't get a process in \nplace that has some definition, some certainty, some guidance, we are \nletting our Nation down.\n\n  This is a good bill, and I hope people will vote for it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If this bill contained the provisions as described by our \nfriend from California, I would vote against our bill.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So would I, at my own detriment.\n  I don't want to mandate the executive branch to do everything as \nLindsey Graham would like. I want to start with a theory that makes \nsense and provides flexibility to change it if that makes sense. I \ndon't want anybody to be in jail because somebody in the military said \nthey are an enemy combatant. I want a Federal judge involved in a \nsensible way. I want due process to make sure we can tell the world: \nYou are not sitting in a jail because somebody said you were guilty of \nsomething. You had a chance to challenge that. But to the critics: I \nwill not stand for the idea that we can't defend ourselves under the \nlaw of war, because I believe we are at war. In war, we have the right \nto hold enemy prisoners. We don't have to let them go to kill again. In \nwar, you can hold people and gather intelligence in a human way.\n  That is what we are able to do under this bill--fight a war within \nour values.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Illinois on the \nSenate floor, whom I know is very heavily involved in this issue. I \nthink we have been debating this amendment now for about 3 hours, at \nleast, and we have had a number of speakers from both sides.\n  I hope that perhaps we can go ahead and vote on this amendment. I was \ninformed and the chairman was informed by Senator Reid that there is a \nlimited amount of time that can be spent on this bill. I realize how \nimportant it is to him, but we have no further speakers right now. I \nknow the Senator from Illinois wishes to speak on it. But would it be \nagreeable that after we have exhausted the number of speakers that we \ncould go ahead and vote on the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. It is not pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is too bad. Let me just say to the Senator from \nIllinois, this is an important issue, and I understand how important it \nis to him. But this legislation has a lot to do with defending this \ncountry. For the Senator to hold up the entire bill because he doesn't \nthink it has been discussed enough is a disservice to the men and women \nin the military whose concerns and needs this bill addresses, as well \nas the needs of the Nation's security.\n  So we took up this amendment in the belief that we were going to go \nahead and debate it and vote on it. So the Senator from Illinois, if we \nare forced to not be able to complete work on this legislation, I think \nbears a pretty heavy burden because we have a lot of other provisions \nin this bill that are also vitally important to the security of this \nNation.\n  We have had spirited debate. I have been involved in this legislation \nof the national defense authorization bill for a quarter of a century. \nWe have moved forward and we have had debate and we have had votes. I \nhope we can do that now so we can move forward to other issues.\n  The Senator from Kentucky is on the Senate floor with an amendment he \nwould like to have debated and voted on, and we have about 100 more. So \nI say to the Senator from Illinois that after we have had sufficient \ndebate, I hope we can go ahead and vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know--I now have the floor, so I \nwill proceed.\n  First, let me thank the Senator from Arizona. We have served together \nin the House and in the Senate. I respect him very much. I certainly \nhave the highest respect, as well, for the Senator from Michigan. But I \nwill tell my colleagues this: If the argument is, if we don't vote on \nthis amendment tonight the security of the United States is in peril, \nthat is a little hard to make because we are not going to finish this \nbill tonight, No. 1. No. 2, it is pretty clear the administration \nopposes this particular amendment, at least I have been told they do. \nNo. 3, if we are talking about something as fundamental as changing \nsome laws in this country relative to the U.S. Constitution, I have to \nagree with Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and \nSenator Feinstein, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, that \nthis great body should take the time, debate the issue, and vote on it \nin a timely fashion.\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\n  I am not here to filibuster this matter, but I am here to discuss it.\n  To those who have come to the floor and said it is imperative to move \nnow to change the way we deal with terrorist detainees in the United \nStates, I would like to make a record for them.\n\n  For the record, over the last 10 years we have dealt with alleged \nterrorists in the United States. During that 10-year period of time 300 \nalleged terrorists have been successfully prosecuted in the criminal \ncourts of America and incarcerated safely in American prisons--300. \nDuring that same 10-year period of time, six--count them, six--have \nbeen subjected to prosecution through military tribunals. So the score \nis 300 to 6 for those who want to change the system, with 300 saying we \nhave a pretty darn good Federal Bureau of Investigation, we have \nexcellent lawyers at the Department of Justice, and the American court \nsystem has responded well to keep us safe. So the notion that this has \nto be changed tonight to keep America safe, I don't know there is any \nevidence to support that.\n  I listened to some of the arguments on the Senate floor, and I wish \nto call to the attention of my colleagues that this is not an \ninsignificant change in the law. If section 1031 is enacted into law, \nfor the first time we will be saying in the law that we can detain \nindefinitely an alleged terrorist who is an American citizen within the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield after I complete my point. I believe most of \nus feel if someone is charged with terrorism--an American citizen--that \nnormally they would be subjected to constitutional protections and \nrights as American citizens. For those who believe in military \ntribunals--and I know the Senator from South Carolina does because he \nhas been engaged in them personally and feels they are an honorable and \neffective way of prosecuting individuals--he knows, as I do, we have \ngone through in the last 10 years a series of Supreme Court cases that \nhave questioned whether we are handling military tribunals in the right \nfashion.\n  The law is not settled when it comes to military tribunals, but the \nlaw is clearly settled when it comes to article 3 criminal courts, to \nthe point that 300 alleged terrorists have been successfully prosecuted \nand convicted.\n  So I think this is worthy of debate. It is a valid issue. The \nsecurity of America will always be a valid issue on the floor of the \nSenate. But let's do it in a thoughtful way. This matter was not \nreferred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was not referred to the \nSenate Intelligence Committee. It was decided by the Armed Services \nCommittee. As good as they are, as great as the people are who serve on \nthat committee, there are others who should have a voice in the \nprocess.\n  I yield to the Senator from South Carolina if he has a question he \nwould like to direct through the Chair.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I wish to respond. No. \n1, it is good to debate. It is good to have discussions about important \nmatters. The Senator from Illinois is right. There is nothing more \nimportant than defending the homeland.\n  Now, let me just state the law as I understand it. The Hamdi case was \nan American citizen captured in--\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend from South Carolina allow a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n\n\n Unanimous Consent Agreement--Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 2112\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2112, an act \nmaking consolidated appropriations for the Departments of Agriculture, \nCommerce, Justice, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development \nand related programs; that there be up to 90 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; that upon the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on the adoption of \nthe conference report; further, that the vote on adoption be subject to \na 60 affirmative-vote threshold.\n  Before there is a response to my request, I would tell everyone we \nare going to be in session tomorrow. I have spoken to the two managers \nof the bill. We will likely not have votes tomorrow. In fact, I don't \nthink we will have votes tomorrow. But I would say to all Senators if \nthey have amendments to offer, they should offer them because the time \nfor the Defense authorization bill is winding down. People can't sit \naround and say we will do something next week because next week may be \na lot shorter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would like to change that from 90 minutes to 120 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield for a question? I think I may be \nable to satisfy Senator Paul, I hope.\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the leader make that unanimous consent effective \nafter there is 5 more minutes of discussion between ourselves?\n  Mr. REID. We can make it effective after a half hour of discussion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And after Senator Paul calls up an amendment and after \nSenator Merkley calls up an amendment and then lay them aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would that be acceptable?\n  Mr. REID. I accept the modification with pleasure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, we will get some people offering some amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I could just comment very quickly to my friend from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. REID. Can we get the consent?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the Chair ordered it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield if it will make this proceed faster.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I just wanted to ask the Senator a question.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, my friend from South Carolina \nyielded to me for a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may respond to my friend from Illinois, Hamdi was an \nAmerican citizen captured in Afghanistan. He had joined al-Qaida--the \nTaliban, I guess in that case. We captured him when we went into \nAfghanistan. We brought him back and we held him as an enemy combatant \nfor intelligence-gathering purposes. His case went to the Supreme \nCourt. The Supreme Court said we could hold an American citizen as an \nunlawful enemy combatant, we just have to create procedures, a due \nprocess requirement. Eventually, the court said every unlawful enemy \ncombatant has a habeas right.\n  The law of the land is clear that an American citizen helping the \nenemy overseas can be held indefinitely. But they have the right to \npetition a judge as to whether the initial determination was correct. \nIf the habeas judge believes there is not enough evidence to hold this \nenemy combatant, then they have to release them. But if the judge \nagrees with the government that there is enough evidence to hold them \nas an enemy combatant, they can be held indefinitely. This President is \nholding 48 people at Guantanamo Bay who have never seen a criminal \ncourtroom because of the theory of law of war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from South Carolina, I yielded for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Can the Senator bring it to a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The question is--I forget what I said.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me just say to my colleague, whom I respect and count \nas a friend, the critical difference between the Senator from Michigan \nand the Senator from South Carolina is this: The Hamdi case involved an \nAmerican citizen, part of the Taliban, arrested in Afghanistan, OK? The \nSenator from South Carolina made that point when he said the word \n``overseas.'' Unfortunately, section 1031 does not create\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\nthat distinction. An American citizen arrested in the United States, \ncharged with terrorism, without any connection to overseas conduct--\nhaving been arrested overseas, I should say--is still going to be \nsubject to indefinite detention.\n  The only thing I would add is this: I think this is a good exchange, \nand I think we need more. The notion that we have to hurry up and get \nthis done in the next 5 minutes is not, I don't think, an appropriate \nway to deal with this. I know Senator Paul and Senator Merkley are \nwaiting, and I am prepared to yield the floor at this point.\n  If this matter comes up again this evening, I hope we can engage in \nfurther discussion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I just have a question, if the Senator would yield, of the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Senator aware of the fact that section 1031 in the \nbill we adopted months ago in the committee had exactly the language \nthat the Senator from Illinois thinks should be in this section 31, \nwhich would make an exception for U.S. citizens in lawful residence? \nThat was in our bill. I am wondering if the Senator is aware that the \nadministration asked us to strike that language from section 1031 so \nthat the bill in front of us now does not have the very exception the \nSenator from Illinois would like to see in there.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have the greatest respect for the Senator and the \nadministration, but I think I am also entitled to my own conclusion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, I understand. But I am just asking the Senator, is the \nSenator aware it was the administration that asked us to strike that \nlanguage, the exception for U.S. citizens?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Not being a member of the committee, I did not follow it \nas closely as the Senator did. I respect him very much and take his \nword.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1064\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1064.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul], for himself and Mrs. \n     Gillibrand, proposes an amendment numbered 1064.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against \n                        Iraq Resolution of 2002)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1230. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE \n                   AGAINST IRAQ.\n\n       The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq \n     Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243; 116 Stat. 1498; 50 \n     U.S.C. 1541 note) is repealed effective on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act or January 1, 2012, whichever occurs \n     later.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment will call for a formal end to \nthe war in Iraq. Our Founding Fathers intended the power to commit the \nNation to war be lodged in Congress, and that is what the Constitution \nsays. The power to declare war is one of the most important powers \ngiven to Congress, and it should remain in Congress.\n  James Madison wrote at the beginning in the Federalist Papers that \n``[t]he Constitution supposes what history demonstrates, that the \nExecutive is the branch most prone to war . . . therefore the \nConstitution has with studied care vested that power [to declare war] \nin the Legislature.''\n  We are calling for a formal end to the war in Iraq as the troops come \nhome, as the President has planned by January 1. This will reclaim the \npower to declare war that is vested in Congress. It allows for checks \nand balances and is an important milestone and an important retaining \nof power for Congress. So I will ask very careful deliberation of a \nformal end to the war in Iraq by supporting this amendment.\n  At this time, I would like to yield the floor to Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just briefly, I would ask the indulgence \nof the Senator from Oregon. I just would ask the Senator from South \nCarolina if he would finish the response, and I am sure it would only \ntake him 2 or 3 minutes to finish.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I promise, I will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So I ask unanimous consent that Senator Merkley be \nrecognized after the Senator from South Carolina speaks for a couple \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the exchange with Senator Durbin was very \ngood. The law of the land is pretty clear--unequivocal, in my view--\nthat an American citizen captured overseas can be held as an enemy \ncombatant, and every enemy combatant held at Guantanamo Bay or captured \nin the United States has habeas rights. The Padilla case involves an \nindividual who was captured in the United States, suspected of being an \nal-Qaida operative, and was held for 4 years. He appealed his case to \nthe Fourth Circuit, and the Fourth Circuit said: You have a right to a \nlawyer to prepare your habeas case, but you do not have a right to a \nlawyer to interrupt the interrogation. You can be held as an enemy \ncombatant, and they can gather intelligence for an indefinite period.\n  That is the law of the land, and that is why the administration came \nover and said the provision that Carl and I were talking about really \nwould change the law. They are preserving the ability, if they want \nto--they do not have to do this--basically, to hold an American.\n  Here is the thought process for the body and the Nation: If you \ncapture somebody--not just involved in terrorism; that is not just what \nwe are talking about--al-Qaida operatives involved in an attack on the \nUnited States, if they are an American citizen--who cares?--if they are \ndoing that, we want to know what they know, interrogate them and hold \nthem for prosecution, or just hold them so they will not go back to the \nfight. That is the law.\n  All we are doing is creating a procedure for that system to be \nfollowed. We are not doing anything different than already exists. This \nnotion, somehow, that the homeland is not part of the battlefield is \nabsurd. Why in the world would we give somebody rights who came to \nAmerica to attack us different than we would if we caught them \noverseas, when the point is, they are involved with the enemy--American \ncitizen or not. We are just creating a procedure that will allow that \nsituation to be handled. So that is why the administration objected to \nour language, and I think they are right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1174\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 1174.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley], for himself, Mr. \n     Lee, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Paul, and Mr. Brown of \n     Ohio, proposes an amendment numbered 1174.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the expedited \n transition of responsibility for military and security operations in \n             Afghanistan to the Government of Afghanistan)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1230. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TRANSITION OF MILITARY AND \n                   SECURITY OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) After al Qaeda attacked the United States on September \n     11, 2001, the United States Government rightly sought to \n     bring to justice those who attacked us, to eliminate al \n     Qaeda's safe havens and training camps in Afghanistan, and to \n     remove the terrorist-allied Taliban government.\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\n       (2) Members of the Armed Forces, intelligence personnel, \n     and diplomatic corps have skillfully achieved these \n     objectives, culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden.\n       (3) Operation Enduring Freedom is now the longest military \n     operation in United States history.\n       (4) United States national security experts, including \n     Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta, have noted that al \n     Qaeda's presence in Afghanistan has been greatly diminished.\n       (5) Over the past ten years, the mission of the United \n     States has evolved to include a prolonged nation-building \n     effort in Afghanistan, including the creation of a strong \n     central government, a national police force and army, and \n     effective civic institutions.\n       (6) Such nation-building efforts in Afghanistan are \n     undermined by corruption, high illiteracy, and a historic \n     aversion to a strong central government in that country.\n       (7) Members of the Armed Forces have served in Afghanistan \n     valiantly and with honor, and many have sacrificed their \n     lives and health in service to their country.\n       (8) The United States is now spending nearly \n     $10,000,000,000 per month in Afghanistan at a time when, in \n     the United States, there is high unemployment, a flood of \n     foreclosures, a record deficit, and a debt that is over \n     $15,000,000,000,000 and growing.\n       (9) The continued concentration of United States and NATO \n     military forces in one region, when terrorist forces are \n     located in many parts of the world, is not an efficient use \n     of resources.\n       (10) The battle against terrorism is best served by using \n     United States troops and resources in a counterterrorism \n     strategy against terrorist forces wherever they may locate \n     and train.\n       (11) The United States Government will continue to support \n     the development of Afghanistan with a strong diplomatic and \n     counterterrorism presence in the region.\n       (12) President Barack Obama is to be commended for \n     announcing in July 2011 that the United States would commence \n     the redeployment of members of the United States Armed Forces \n     from Afghanistan in 2011 and transition security control to \n     the Government of Afghanistan.\n       (13) President Obama has established a goal of removing all \n     United States combat troops from Afghanistan by December \n     2014.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should expedite the transition of the \n     responsibility for military and security operations in \n     Afghanistan to the Government of Afghanistan;\n       (2) the President should devise a plan based on inputs from \n     military commanders, the diplomatic missions in the region, \n     and appropriate members of the Cabinet, along with the \n     consultation of Congress, for expediting the drawdown of \n     United States combat troops in Afghanistan and accelerating \n     the transfer of security authority to Afghan authorities \n     prior to December 2014; and\n       (3) not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the President should submit to Congress a plan \n     with a timetable and completion date for the accelerated \n     transition of all military and security operations in \n     Afghanistan to the Government of Afghanistan.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I offer this amendment with several \noriginal cosponsors: Senator Mike Lee, Senator Rand Paul, Senator Tom \nUdall, and Senator Sherrod Brown. I would like to thank them for \njoining in this effort to address our military presence in Afghanistan \nand the fact that our military forces have done such an excellent job \nof completing the original missions of destroying al-Qaida training \ncamps and bringing justice to those responsible for 9/11.\n  But over this past decade, our mission has changed to one of nation \nbuilding--a mission that is obstructed by vast corruption, by \nextraordinary traditional cultural resistance to a strong central \ngovernment, and by a very high illiteracy rate. These factors should \nhave us rethinking how to have the most effective use of our military \nforces, our intelligence assets, in taking on the war on terror, and \nthat we should be engaging in counterterrorist efforts using our \nresources wherever the terrorist threat emerges across the world rather \nthan concentrating these vast resources in Afghanistan.\n  Our sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers \ncould not have done a better job in their military mission. But it is \nright that now we do less nation building abroad and we do more nation \nbuilding at home. It is right that now we refocus our effort to have \nthe most effective strategy to take on terrorism around the world. It \nis in that philosophy that we come together in a bipartisan fashion to \npropose this amendment. We ask that colleagues take a chance to \nconsider it and join us in redirecting our efforts to be more \neffective.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenators Akaka, Chambliss, Blumenthal, Inhofe, Gillibrand, Ben Nelson, \nStabenow, and Mark Udall as cosponsors of amendment No. 1092, which is \nthe pending Levin-McCain amendment on counterfeit parts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Secondly, Mr. President, we are going to move now, I \nbelieve, to the conference report. But I do want to remind folks of \nwhat Senator McCain said; which is, we will be here tomorrow morning. \nWe are here to try to clear amendments. We want to be able to give our \ncolleagues as much opportunity as possible to debate and to clear \namendments. But we have to move this bill. We are not going to be given \na whole week after we come back to get this bill passed, hopefully.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 1867 is still pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is not the Paul amendment the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Merkley amendment is pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Merkley amendment is pending.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Paul amendment be \nthe--\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. Regular order.\n  Mr. McCAIN. OK, that the regular order be--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Levin amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Levin-McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Levin-McCain amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1064\n\n  I would just like to say a couple words about the Paul amendment. I \nwould just like to point out, we will still have 16,500 Americans in \nIraq for an extended period of time. Now, whether they should be there \nis the subject of another debate on another day. But to then not be \nable to do whatever is necessary to protect the lives and safety of \nthose men and women who will continue to serve the country, sometimes \nin variously difficult circumstances--I think this amendment is \nunwarranted.\n  Finally, I would like to ask my colleagues who have further views on \nthe detainee issue if they would come over and add their voices to the \ndebate and discussion because we would like to dispose of this \namendment. I respect the desire of the Senator from Illinois that \neverybody be allowed to speak. We have been now speaking on this single \namendment for, I believe, well over 3 hours.\n  So if there is further discussion on the Udall amendment, I would \nvery much like to have a vote on it so we can bring other important \nissues before the body.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. We are talking about this amendment. Let's debate this \namendment. Let's vote on this amendment. But the heart of the issue is \nwhether the United States is part of the battlefield in the war on \nterror. The statement of authority I authored in 1031, with cooperation \nfrom the administration, clearly says someone captured in the United \nStates is considered part of the enemy force regardless of the fact \nthey made it on our home soil. The law of war applies inside the United \nStates not just overseas. The authorization to use military force right \nafter the war began allowed us to go into Afghanistan and use detention \nand capture and military force to deal with the enemy in Afghanistan \nand other places overseas.\n  To my colleague from New Hampshire, does she believe al-Qaida \nconsiders American soil part of the battlefield?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. In response to the Senator from South Carolina, I would \nsay, unfortunately, our country is the goal for al-Qaida, and we saw \nthat with September 11 and the horrible attacks on\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\nour country that day that killed Americans.\n  They want to come here and harm us and hit us where it hurts us the \nmost. So, unfortunately, America is part of the battlefield. To put \nourselves in a position where we would not allow our military \nintelligence, law enforcement, to have the tools they need to gather \nthe most intelligence to protect Americans on our soil would lead to an \nabsurd result.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Does the Senator agree that with Senator Levin and a very \nbipartisan work product we have now created a legal system that says \nthe following: If a U.S. citizen, a non-U.S. citizen is involved in an \nal-Qaida attack on our Nation, and is captured within the United \nStates, we are allowing our military the ability to hold them as part \nof the enemy force, to question and interrogate them for intelligence \ngathering, and that right we have overseas to hold somebody now exists \nin the United States because the threat is the same?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say to my colleague from South Carolina, when he \nspoke on the floor he captured the most important part of this; that \nis, without the amendment we have been debating, we do not even give \nour military, law enforcement, intelligence officials the ability to \ndecide which system is best in each incident. Rightly so, when you are \nin our country, when you are an American citizen, you are given your \nMiranda rights. You are told: You have the right to remain silent. You \nhave the right to have a lawyer. We need to make sure we do not create \na distinction where if you are captured abroad, you are treated one \nway--and we are giving our officials maximum flexibility to gather as \nmuch information as possible to protect our country--but if you make it \nhere, the rules are different, and we do not give the officials who are \nset to protect us every day, both from a military and law enforcement \nend, the flexibility they need to gather maximum intelligence.\n  It would just be an absurd result to treat it differently. It would \nalmost encourage: Come to America--unfortunately--to attack us because \nyou will actually be given greater rights if the attack occurs here.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator agree that what we have been able to do \non the committee is basically say, in law for the first time, that the \nhomeland is part of the battlefield; that military custody is available \nto hold a suspected al-Qaida operative caught in the United States--\nAmerican citizen or not--but we are going to allow the administration--\nthis administration and all future administrations--to change that \nmodel if they believe it is best?\n  To me, we have created a right by our intelligence community, law \nenforcement community, to do at home what they can do overseas. If we \ndo not do that, that would just not only be absurd, I think it would \nmake us all less safe for no higher purpose. So to my colleagues who \nbelieve we are changing something, all we are trying to do is make sure \nthat when the enemy makes it to America, we can hold them and gather \nintelligence to protect ourselves, no more and no less.\n  We start with the presumption of military custody. But if the experts \nin the field, this administration or future administrations, believe \nthat model is not best, they can seek a waiver. That, to me, is what we \nshould have been doing for years. Because the battlefield, to those who \nare listening, is an idea, not a country. We are battling an idea; that \nis, a terrible idea.\n  Their idea is, if you are a moderate Muslim seeking to worship God a \ndifferent way, you are not worthy of living. If you are a Jew or a \nGentile, you name it, if you do not bow to their view of religion, then \nyou are going to live in hell. So that is what we are fighting. At the \nend of the day, this legislation creates a process to deal with the \nthreats in our own backyard and, unfortunately, does the Senator from \nNew Hampshire agree, that there is going to be further radicalization, \nthat homegrown terror is where this war is going to?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would agree with the Senator from South Carolina that \nunfortunately there are threats we face within our own country from \nhomegrown radicalism. But also let's not forget, this amendment, in \nterms of the military custody, applies to members of al-Qaida or \nassociated forces who have planned an attack against our country or our \ncoalition partners and are not U.S. citizens. So in this provision we \nare talking about foreigners coming to our country who are members of \nal-Qaida and who want to harm Americans, if we think about what \nhappened on September 11.\n  I would also add, I think it is very important what is in this \nimportant provision of the Defense Authorization Act, in response to \nthe Senator from California, who raised the case of Zazi as an example \nwhere she thought that case would be impacted by this amendment, that \nis simply, with all respect to the Senator from California, not the \ncase.\n  Because if one looks at the language in our amendment, we have given \nflexibility to the executive branch to conduct the interrogations, to \nhave surveillance. So in the Zazi case, there was surveillance \nundertaken. We put express language in here allowing the executive \nbranch to allow law enforcement to conduct surveillance, to conduct \ninterrogation.\n  I would point out that provision in terms of the amount of \nflexibility we have actually given the executive branch. But most \nimportantly, we have dealt with the issue the Senator talked about, \nwhich is, in the absence of this provision, when terrorists come to our \ncountry and attack us, we are in a position where, under our law \nenforcement system, they have to give Miranda rights. They have the \nright to presentment. We are simply saying they have the option to make \nsure they can put intelligence gathering as the top priority.\n  So this, as the Senator has identified and talked about, is a very \nreasonable compromise. As the Senator knows, my colleague from South \nCarolina, I would have actually liked to have seen this go further. But \nit is very important that we bring this forward.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would add that Senator Lieberman would have gone \nfurther than the Senator. There is nobody whom I respect more than \nSenator Lieberman, but we are trying to find a balanced way.\n  So in summary, 1032, the military custody provision, which has \nwaivers and a lot of flexibility, does not apply to American citizens, \nand 1031, the statement of authority to detain, does apply to American \ncitizens. It designates the world as the battlefield, including the \nhomeland.\n  Are you familiar with the Padilla case? That is a Federal court case \ninvolving an American citizen captured in the United States who was \nheld for several years as an enemy combatant. His case went to the \nFourth Circuit. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals said: An American \ncitizen can be held by our military as an enemy combatant, even if they \nare caught in the United States, because once they join the enemy \nforces, then they present a military threat and their citizenship is \nnot a sort of a get-out-of-jail-free card; that the law of the land is \nthat an American citizen can be held as an enemy combatant. That went \nto the Fourth Circuit. That, as I speak, is the law of the land.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. That is right. That is the law of the land. That is what \nis reflected in this provision in the Defense Authorization Act. It is \nreflective of case law issued by our U.S. Supreme Court, which in not \nonly that case but in subsequent cases basically said, in those \ninstances, you do have to provide habeas-type relief.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In the Padilla case, that went to the Fourth Circuit. The \nHamdan case went to the Supreme Court. That was capture overseas. But \nthe Fourth Circuit ruling stands that an American citizen captured in \nthe United States can be held as an enemy combatant.\n  But 1032, requiring military custody, is only for noncitizens \ncaptured in the United States. So the bottom line is, I think we have \nconstructed a very sound, solid system that deals with homeland \ncaptures and homeland threats. We have created due process that \nunderstands this is a war without end, that no one is going to be held \nin jail indefinitely without going to a Federal court to make their \ncase that they are unfairly held, that if the Federal court rules with \nthe government, there is an annual review process that would allow the \nopportunity to get out\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\nin the future based on an evaluation of the case.\n  From a due process point of view, I am very proud of the work \nproduct. I think it makes sense. I think it is a balance between our \nright to be safe and our rights to provide individuals with due \nprocess. But the big breakthrough is that we are now, for the first \ntime as a Congress, creating a system that not only will allow this \nPresident flexibility and guidance, but future Presidents, and it will \nhelp us in further court challenges.\n  Quite frankly, the Congress is saying, through this bill, if someone \nis caught in the United States, citizen or not, joining al-Qaida, \ntrying to do harm to our Nation, we are going to create a system where \nyou can be held, you can be prosecuted, you can be interrogated within \nour values, and we are not going to create an absurd result that if you \nmake it here, none of that applies. That is all we are trying to do. \nDoes the Senator agree with that?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would agree with that. The Senator has already pointed \nout how important it is to have these provisions in place to give the \nofficials who do this work every day whom we have so much respect for \nthe ability to gather intelligence.\n  We need this provision to protect our country from attacks on our \nhomeland. It is so important. I would ask one question of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. He is familiar with the military commissions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, I think we need to move to the appropriations \nconference report. We will do it very quickly.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I will ask the Senator quickly. The Senator from Illinois \nsaid we have only had six civilian trials with terrorists.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Military commissions.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Six military commission trials and hundreds of civilian \ntrials of terrorists. I would ask the Senator, did the administration \nsuspend military commission trials for a period of time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The reason we have not had more is because the Obama \nadministration withdrew charges. Thank goodness they have reinstated \ncharges. There are military commission hearings going on as we speak. I \nam in the camp of ``all the above.''\n  Sometimes article 3 courts are the best venue, sometimes military \ncommissions. The Ghailani case was someone we held as an enemy \ncombatant for years, took to Federal court and 200-and-something \ncharges and got convicted on 1. Our Federal courts are not set up to \ndeal with people who have been held as enemy combatants under the law \nof war, then tried in civilian systems.\n  The Christmas Day Bomber, it made perfect sense to me to put him in \nan article 3 court. We found out he was a low-level guy, not one of the \nhigher-ups. But if we catch someone here at home or overseas who is \ninvolved deeply in terrorism in terms of what they know, then we would \nhold them for a period of time to question them.\n  Then, if you wanted to decide to prosecute, military commissions make \nthe most sense. So the only reason we have not had more military \ncommission trials is because they have been stopped. I am not saying \nFederal courts are not an appropriate venue sometimes. I am saying that \nwhen you hold someone under the law of war for years to gather \nintelligence, which you have a right to do, we need to keep them in the \nsame system, and you see what happens when you mix systems.\n  I am very proud of the bill, great debate to have, long overdue. If \nwe can get this enacted into law, I will say this: Americans can look \nanyone in the world in the eye and say: We have robust due process. We \ncan also tell the people in this country whom we are sworn to protect \nthat we have a system that recognizes the difference between an al-\nQaida operative trying to kill us and destroy our way of life and a \ncommon criminal. We need to do both.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding the Agriculture-\nCJS-THUD Appropriations Conference Report that the Senate will be \nvoting on today. I was the only conferee not to sign this conference \nreport and I regret to say that I have serious concerns with provisions \nin this bill.\n  The conference report contains language that will raise the loan \nlimits for FHA to over $729,000. I strongly oppose this language for \nthree reasons. First, this change means that FHA, along with the GSEs \nwill continue to crowd out the private sector. The government currently \naccounts for 96 percent of mortgage-backed security issuance in this \ncountry. We desperately need private sector investment to return so \nthat we can finally achieve sustained growth in the housing market. \nSecond, raising the loan limits for only FHA puts further pressure on \nthe FHA and the taxpayer. Just this week, we learned that there is \nnearly a 50 percent chance the taxpayers will need to bail out the FHA. \nIncreasing the loan limit only increases the risk that the taxpayer \nwill have to bail out FHA. Finally, this will cause the American \ntaxpayer to subsidize homes for wealthy buyers. Helping affluent people \nbuy homes worth over three quarters of a million dollars is directly at \nodds with FHA's mission to develop affordable housing.\n  It is a shame that this bill contains these ill-advised provisions, \nas there is so much worthwhile contained elsewhere within the text. I \nparticularly want to commend Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran, \nand CJS Subcommittee Chair Mikulski and Ranking Member Hutchison, for \nthe great work they did in supporting the Space Launch System, SLS, \nNASA's heavy lift rocket. The bill we will vote on this evening \nprovides $1.86 billion to support SLS, $60 million above the \nPresident's request. The bill puts us on a path towards regaining our \nrightful place as the world's lead spacefaring nation. SLS will take us \nbeyond low Earth orbit, where we have been stuck for decades, and once \nagain make the American space program the envy of the world.\n  It is only as a result of continual pressure from both houses of \nCongress that the U.S. has not completely forfeited space supremacy to \nthe Russians and the Chinese. The Obama administration's 2009 plan \nwould have abandoned NASA's focus on manned exploration and instead \nsubsidized so-called ``commercial'' space companies to perform endless \ntaxi missions to low Earth orbit. Apollo astronaut Eugene Cernan, \nrightfully called the Obama plan a ``pledge to mediocrity.''\n  Fortunately, Congress has pushed back hard. Many of my Senate \ncolleagues and I joined to pass authorization and appropriations \nlegislation requiring NASA to develop a 130 metric ton heavy lift \nvehicle that will take America's next generation of astronauts to the \nmoon and beyond. In countless hearings and private meetings with NASA \nand the administration we have come to an agreement that the primary \npurpose of NASA is to expand human frontiers, not serve as a grant \nadministrator for speculative private ventures. Thankfully, after more \nthan 2 years of continual pressure from Congress and the American \npeople, we appear to have achieved a breakthrough. NASA is moving ahead \nwith SLS and this CJS Appropriations bill will ensure that they have \nthe resources to implement the plans the Administrator has laid out.\n  It is important to note that the recently announced SLS acquisition \nstrategy goes to great lengths to control cost and technical risk. The \nstrategy makes maximum use of existing contracts and flight-tested \nhardware from the Constellation and Shuttle programs while leaving room \nfor competition where appropriate. Neil Armstrong recently told a House \npanel: ``Predicting the future is inherently risky, but the proposed \nSpace Launch System includes many proven and reliable components which \nsuggest that its development could be relatively trouble free.''\n  Mr. President, SLS is a bold and workable plan with strong support in \nboth chambers and both parties. Although I have serious reservations \nabout the overall legislation, I thank my colleagues on the CJS \nSubcommittee for embracing American leadership and the promise of \nAmerican ingenuity through their support for SLS.\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7678-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7678-S7684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n  RELATED AGENCIES PROGRAMS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, \n            2012, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that committee report be \nconsidered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report is considered read. Under the \nprevious order, there will be 2 hours of debate, equally divided, \nbetween the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nconference committee. I rise as the chair of the Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, and Science, one of the three subcommittees in the \nconference report. The other is agriculture. Senator Kohl will be \ncoming to the floor to speak on behalf of his bill that is part of the \nconference, and others will speak.\n  I wish to speak on the Commerce-Justice bill. I am pleased the Senate \nis considering the conference agreement on fiscal year 2012. As I said, \nI am CJS. Senator Kohl will speak on agriculture. Senator Patty Murray \nmanaged the bill on transportation and housing. She is the chair, and I \nam sure either she or her designee will speak about a subcommittee we \naffectionally call THUD.\n  But let me talk about the CJS conference agreement. This is a great \nagreement. It is the product of bipartisan and bicameral compromise and \ncooperation. I wish to thank my ranking member, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison and her excellent staff. We worked hand in hand on this bill.\n  I wish to talk about our colleagues in the House. Much is made about \nthe prickly situation sometimes between the House and the Senate. But I \nwish to thank Chairman Frank Wolf and ranking member Chaka Fattah for \ntheir bipartisan support. There was give and take; sometimes stormy \nexchanges. But at the end of the day, we worked cooperatively and \ncollegially.\n  So as we look at the process, what I wish to say is that the \nconference agreement itself is a good one. Our bill, the CJS bill, \ntotals $52.7 billion in discretionary spending. We were frugal. It is \n$600 million below the 2011 level, and it is $5 billion below the \nPresident's request.\n  The purpose of this bill is to help create American jobs, make our \nstreets and our neighborhoods safe from violent crime and terrorism, \nand to support innovation and technology so America can continue to be \nan exceptional Nation.\n  It also promotes trade. We do this through our Federal agencies: the \nCommerce Department, through its Economic Development Administration, \nPatent Office, International Trade Administration, and the Census \nBureau. It also has important agencies related to innovation: the \nNational Institutes of Standards and the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration.\n  Our bill also has in it the Department of Justice, NASA, and the \nNational Science Foundation.\n  It has a lot of important things in it. It is also a bill that \npromotes justice, including the Commission on Civil Rights, the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation.\n  Within shrinking funding levels, the CJS conference agreement \nprioritizes activities that focused on creating jobs, saving lives, \nprotecting communities, and looking out for the future of our country.\n  The subcommittee faced two very pressing problems that are critical \nto life and safety. One, our weather satellites. We had to come up with \na substantial chunk of money to make sure we had those important new \nweather satellites that tell us about hurricanes, tornadoes, and other \nthings that are coming. Also, we had a real challenge in providing \nadequate funding for America's prison population.\n  These activities are not considered mandatory for budget purposes, \nbut they are not truly discretionary. We had an obligation to fund \nthem. We also had an obligation to provide security funding to the two \nconventions, to help them underwrite their security concerns.\n  Together, the bare minimum needed for the new JPSS satellite and \nprison expenses is nearly $800 million--$350 million for prisons--and \nwe were able to meet that obligation.\n  We also looked out for our law enforcement, for our State and local \npolice departments. This bill provides $2.2 billion to support our Blue \nLine to keep our police safe, to protect them with the equipment they \nneed, such as bulletproof vests, so they can protect us with modern \ntools relating to crime scene analysis, forensic science, and enough \ncops on the beat.\n  We funded Byrne grants at $370 million, a main Federal tool for State \nand local police operations.\n  In terms of Federal law enforcement, we met obligations to the FBI \nand funded them at $8 billion; our Drug Enforcement Agency at $2 \nbillion; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the Marshals \nService, each at $1.2 billion. Our marshals no longer necessarily ride \nthe planes, but what they are out there doing is serving the warrants \nthat go after sexual predators and also make sure they fulfill their \nresponsibility to protect our Federal judiciary at the courthouses. \nThose Federal law enforcement actions are at our borders, in our \nstreets, in our communities, and in important task forces protecting \nour communities.\n  In terms of science and innovation, I am proud of what we did with \nNASA--from the space shuttle legacy to our new vehicles for space \nexploration. We also funded the James Webb Space Telescope, which will \nbe the successor to the Hubble. It is 100 times more powerful and will \nassure America's place as a leader in astronomy for the next 30 years.\n  Our conference agreement was $17.8 billion. It is a balanced space \nprogram. It ensures the continuity or continuation of human space \nflight, does important work in space science, and also bold research in \naeronautics, so we can be at the cutting edge.\n  We also funded the National Science Foundation, which continues to do \nthat groundbreaking innovative work that the private sector works off \nof. This year, three Americans shared the Nobel Prize for physics. One \nwas Dr. Adam Riess at Johns-Hopkins. He used the Hubble space telescope \nto look out for dark energy, to look at decaying supernovas, and found \nout that the expansion of the universe was speeding up.\n  The 2011 Nobel Prize in chemistry winner, Dr. Dan Shechtman, was \nworking at the National Institute of Standards and Technology--which \nthis bill also funds--when he discovered new subatomic particles. Both \ndiscoveries were considered unexpected and even game changers. These \nNobel Prize winners were those wonderful Americans who make use of \nwhether it was the Hubble telescope or the kind of work that goes on in \nour chemistry labs. So we are out there winning the Nobel Prizes, but \nour bill lays the groundwork for winning the markets.\n  On the floor is the chairman of the full committee, Senator Inouye, \nand also Senator Kohl, who managed the bill and will speak for \nAgriculture. There are many things I could say about what we did in the \nbill, but I think I have summarized the basic themes.\n  I will be available to answer any questions from colleagues. I also \nwant the chairman of the full committee to have an opportunity to speak \nand certainly Senator Kohl and Senator Blunt. I want to say to Senator \nBlunt, when Senator Kohl had to be temporarily off the floor, I thank \nhim for working with me. We moved this bill and showed we knew how to \ngovern and move legislation. If we work this way, we will get America \nmoving again.\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, first I thank Chairman Barbara Mikulski \nfor her valiant work in the conference.\n  As we are all aware, the congressional budget process has faced \nunprecedented obstacles over the past year. We have struggled to find \ncommon ground on one of the most basic responsibilities of Congress--\nfunding the operations of the Federal Government.\n  Earlier this year, we saw politically charged threats of government \nshutdowns, culminating with an irresponsible debt ceiling standoff that \nbrought our economy to the brink of disaster. The American people are \ndeeply frustrated that many in Congress put partisanship ahead of the \nnational interest.\n  Yet, despite these challenges, we now consider legislation that \nreflects the good-faith efforts and input of Members of both sides of \nthe aisle in both the House and Senate. Given current fiscal and \npolitical realities, this is no small accomplishment.\n  The conference report before us today includes three fiscal year 2012 \nappropriations measures: Agriculture; Commerce, Justice, Science; and \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development. This legislation also \nincludes a continuing resolution that funds government operations \nthrough December 16, giving Congress time to finish its work on the \nremaining funding bills.\n  These bills are focused on a number of basic priorities: job \ncreation, public safety, science, nutrition, housing, and \ntransportation. Due to the stringent funding limits included in the \nBudget Control Act, which established a discretionary spending level \nthat is $7 billion below last year's level, many items in these bills \nare not funded to the levels I would prefer.\n  As we all await the outcome of the supercommittee, I again remind my \ncolleagues that we cannot balance the Nation's books on the back of \nnondefense discretionary spending.\n  Despite our reduced spending levels, I am pleased that we have been \nable to maintain investments in several critical areas.\n  Public safety is a top priority of this bill. The conference report \nbefore us provides the resources necessary for the Food and Drug \nAdministration to begin implementation of the Food Safety Modernization \nAct, which will better protect the American people from foodborne \nillnesses.\n  The funding levels provided in the conference agreement for the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation; the Drug Enforcement Agency; Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the U.S. Marshals \nService will prevent layoffs and furloughs of Federal agents, enabling \nthe agencies to continue their critical missions with regard to public \nsafety.\n  The funds provided will also allow for increased law enforcement on \nthe Southwest border. I note that the bill maintains funding for COPS \nhiring grants, which were eliminated in the original House bill.\n  The conference report before us funds an additional 11,000 new \nhousing vouchers for homeless veterans. It includes $500 million for \ncompetitive TIGER surface transportation grants, as well as nearly $2 \nbillion for new transit rail projects, and it maintains Federal support \nfor Amtrak.\n  This bill includes more than $12 billion for basic research at the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Science \nFoundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and \nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n  This research will plant the seeds for new discoveries that not only \nwin Nobel Prizes, but also earn profits and create American jobs in our \nhighly competitive global economy.\n  The conference report before us represents thousands of compromises \non issues large and small. It represents, in no small measure, the way \nthe Congress of the United States is meant to function.\n  The credit for this accomplishment rests with the members of the \nsubcommittees and their staffs. I thank the leadership of the three \nsubcommittees, Senators Kohl, Mikulski, Murray, Blunt, Hutchison, and \nCollins for their exceptional efforts in completing these three bills.\n  We all recognize that we would not have been able to accomplish this \ntask without the countless hours put in by the staff of the \nsubcommittee. I want to take a moment--I think it is important--to \nrecognize them for their efforts.\n  I want to publicly thank Galen Fountain, Jessica Arden Frederick, \nDianne Nellor, Bob Ross, Molly Barackman-Eder, Gabrielle Batkin, \nJessica Berry, Jeremy Weirich, Jean Toal-Eisen, Molly O'Rourke, Alex \nKeenan, Meaghan McCarthy, Rachel Milberg, Dabney Hegg, Stacy McBride, \nRachel Jones, James Christoferson, Allen Cutler, Goodloe Sutton, \nCourtney Stevens, Heideh Shahmoradi, Brooke Hayes Stringer, Carl \nBarrick, and Mike Clarke. They are the ones who should be receiving the \nmedal this evening.\n  This conference report is the culmination of a process that includes \ncountless hours of hearings, markups, debate, negotiations, and posting \nonline--and I underline this--all of the hearing testimony and \nlegislative text for any citizen to review. Finally, it represents the \none essential ingredient to a functioning democracy that has been in \nshort supply in recent months: compromise.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this measure and send it to \nthe President for his signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this conference report contains \nagreements between the House and Senate on three appropriations bills.\n  These bills support a wide range of important Federal Government \nactivities. It also includes an extension of the continuing resolution \nthat expires on Friday.\n  The conference report is the product of negotiations that have taken \nplace with the other body's conferees over the past several weeks.\n  I commend the chairmen and ranking members of each of the \nsubcommittees for the thoughtful manner in which they have undertaken \ntheir responsibilities. I also thank the staff members for their \ndiligence and the many long hours they have spent in the performance of \ntheir duties and bringing us to this point.\n  The practice of combining multiple appropriations bills into a single \npackage is not ideal, nor should it be encouraged. I would prefer, and \nI know other Senators would as well, that we have the opportunity to \nconsider, offer amendments, and vote on the bills individually.\n  This summer, the months during which we normally debate \nappropriations bills, Congress and the President were wrangling over \nlegislation to increase the debt ceiling and other matters. While the \ncommittee moved quickly to report bills in September, we are now more \nthan a month into the new fiscal year and are only now approaching \nenactment of the first three appropriations bills. I don't know how or \nwhen we will be able to actually complete action on all these measures, \nbut I want the Senate to know that the members of this committee, under \nthe very able and distinguished leadership of Senator Inouye from \nHawaii, have done everything within our power to try to get the Senate \nto move quickly but carefully to approve these bills.\n  So, Mr. President, without prolonging the debate and knowing other \nSenators are here to speak, let me just say that we have the restraints \nof the Budget Control Act, which were respected by the Appropriations \nCommittee. Caps were included that locked in recent cuts in \ndiscretionary spending, and that is holding future discretionary growth \nbelow the rate of inflation. The act we are passing will bring \ndiscretionary spending as a percentage of GDP to the lowest levels \nsince the Eisenhower administration.\n  I am confident the House and Senate will work together in the coming \nweeks to complete our negotiations on these and other appropriations \nbills that will fully comply with the guidance set out in the Budget \nControl Act. Today, we are making a good start with these three \nappropriations bills, and I urge support for the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I support the conference report, which \nincludes appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, and the \nFood and Drug\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\nAdministration. I am pleased that we followed the regular process to \nget to this point. It has not always been an easy process, but it has \nproduced a good and well-balanced bill.\n  Overall spending levels in this bill are closer to the Senate bill \nthan the House-passed bill. The conference bill is consistent with our \nallocation and includes a nondisaster spending level of $19.565 \nbillion, compared to $19.78 billion in the Senate and $17.253 billion \nin the House. This funding level allowed us to protect important \nongoing programs, while continuing to reduce spending from last year.\n  Some of the highlights of the conference report funding levels are as \nfollows:\n  For the WIC Program, we were able to provide an additional $36 \nmillion above the Senate, bringing total funding to $570 million above \nthe House level.\n  The Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides assistance to \nfood pantries, is funded at the fully authorized level of $140 million.\n  The Food and Drug Administration is funded at the Senate level of \n$2.497 billion, including increased funding to begin implementation of \nthe Food Safety and Modernization Act.\n  The Food Safety and Inspection Service is funded at $1.004 billion, \nan increase of more than $32 million above the House level.\n  The Public Law 480 Program, which provides international food \nassistance, is funded at $1.466 billion, an increase of $426 million \nabove the House level.\n  Agricultural research funded through the Agricultural Research \nService and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture is funded at \n$2.297 billion, an increase of $282 million above the House level.\n  Disaster relief funds for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, \nEmergency Conservation Program, and the Emergency Forest Restoration \nProgram were provided based on the latest USDA estimates.\n  Beyond these important funding items, we also rejected many of the \ncontroversial policy riders that were included in the House bill. Among \nthem were a provision prohibiting any food aid for North Korea, which \nwould tie the hands of U.S. negotiators; a provision blocking \nenforcement of the Energy Independence and Security Act; and a \nprovision blocking participation in a global climate change task force, \nas well as others.\n  Again, I think this is a well-balanced bill. We worked hard with our \nHouse counterparts to identify and maintain priorities that benefit the \nAmerican people. I would like to again thank Senator Blunt for his help \nduring this entire process. His insights were extremely valuable.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kohl in \nsupporting the conference report, and I particularly want to talk about \nthe agricultural programs in the report.\n  This is my first year as the ranking member of the agriculture \nsubcommittee, and I have certainly enjoyed working with the chairman. \nHe has been generous and kind to me, including me in many of these \ndiscussions.\n  In these days, it is no small feat for an appropriations bill to get \nthrough the Senate in what is pretty close to regular order, and so I \nam glad we were able to work closely together to get that done. I hope \nwe can do the same thing next year and have hearings and floor time to \npass the Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA bill again next year and \nmaybe in a way that is even closer to the timing and the order we would \nlike to see.\n  The conference report we are considering today reminds us that we can \nand should return to the regular way of doing business on \nappropriations bills. Even though the conference report includes three \nseparate bills, they were all vigorously debated on the floor, and more \nthan two dozen amendments were accepted. The process has certainly \nyielded a better outcome than a large omnibus appropriations bill would \nhave.\n  The chairman has reviewed the details of the Agriculture bill, so I \nwill touch on only a few of the highlights.\n  Discretionary spending for agriculture programs is $350 million below \nthe fiscal year 2011 level and significantly below the fiscal year 2010 \nlevel. We are slowly but surely reining in discretionary spending.\n  To reduce overall spending, we have made difficult decisions. Most \nprograms in the bill that related to agriculture were reduced by 5 \npercent. We have, however, prioritized those programs that protect the \npublic health and help maintain the strength of our Nation's \nagricultural economy.\n  I am particularly pleased we have been able to maintain funding for \nformula research and competitive agricultural research programs in this \nbill. Smart investments in American agriculture have been made by the \nFederal Government for well over a century now, and this bill continues \nthat process of promoting competitiveness and is critical to helping \nour farmers increase production and produce a food supply that is safe, \nabundant, and affordable.\n  With unemployment still hovering around 9 percent, now is not the \ntime to place unnecessary restrictions on the competitive marketplace. \nTherefore, this plan prohibits the Department of Agriculture from \nmoving forward with a costly and burdensome rule--GIPSA--that \nAgriculture released earlier this year. This rule would have negatively \nimpacted poultry and livestock markets and damaged the overall strength \nof the farm economy.\n  I am also glad the Agriculture bill includes funding to help farmers \nand communities recover from natural disasters. Missouri has seen \nunprecedented devastation from both tornadoes and flooding this year. \nFunding included in this bill for the Emergency Watershed Protection \nProgram and the Emergency Conservation Program is necessary to help \nthose areas recover. It is important that we support our farmers as \nthey clear debris and as they regrade and rehabilitate their land for \nthe next growing season.\n  As the ranking member of the agriculture subcommittee, I have limited \nmy comments to agricultural funding, but I would be remiss if I didn't \npoint out the significant contributions of the Commerce, Justice, \nScience Subcommittee and the Transportation, and Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Subcommittee in developing this conference report.\n  This bill, although it may have been referred to as the agriculture \nminibus, doesn't do justice to the great efforts of my colleagues, \nSenators Mikulski, Murray, Hutchison, and Collins, and their staffs. \nThey have all contributed a lot of time and effort to get this report \nthis far. It is not exactly what any of us would have done, but none of \nus are exactly in charge of doing it all by ourselves.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me and join Senator Kohl in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri for managing the bill for our side because there are \nthree appropriations bills included in this package. I am also pleased \nthat we are actually passing appropriations bills that have been \namended and debated in the Senate the way it ought to be done.\n  I am also very pleased to talk about the Commerce, Justice, Science, \nand Related Agencies bill, which is the subcommittee on which I am the \nranking member. The chairman, Senator Mikulski, has already spoken \nearlier this evening on the bill and what is in it and how we put it \nall together.\n  I can't thank Senator Mikulski enough for being the kind of chairman \nwho could really bring people together, bring the House Members \ntogether, where we had some significant differences. I believe she and \nI were on the same page, that we have national priorities in this bill, \nand we ensured that those priorities were met because they are so \nimportant for our country. It wasn't easy. As has been said by everyone \nwho has spoken, difficult choices had to be made. We had an allocation \nthat was $583 million below the fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution \nlevel. It was $4.7 billion below the President's request.\n  This bill is also in accordance with the Budget Control Act that \npassed on August 2, 2011. I just want to mention\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\non that point that all of the appropriations bills that have gone \nthrough the Appropriations Committee this year have met the Budget \nControl Act requirements. That is something I think we should have done \nand certainly something we were expected to do.\n  There are some Members, however, who will be speaking against these \nbills. They wanted a different standard from the standard we set, which \nwas below the fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution and below the \nPresident's request. But that is the standard we should have met, and \nwe did.\n  We struck a balance between the competing interests of law \nenforcement, terrorism, research, and competitiveness through investing \nin science. I think the chairman, Senator Mikulski, spoke about the \nspecifics of that, but I want to highlight some of the programs of \nnational interest that I was particularly insistent that we focus on.\n  We have worked hard to ensure that law enforcement receives the \npriority funding needed to protect our Nation, our communities, our \nchildren, and the victims of crime. That was a particular point that \nSenator Mikulski made and with which I agree.\n  We have also made sure the FBI has the resources it needs to continue \nits major role in the global mission of counterterrorism and \ncounterintelligence. Director Robert Mueller has seen the largest \ntransition of the agency certainly in modern times, but maybe ever--a \ntransformation from a traditional crime-fighting organization into an \nintelligence-driven, threat-focused law enforcement organization and a \nfull member of the U.S. intelligence community since 9/11.\n  A lot of people are going to say: Well, gosh, why would you increase \nthe FBI? Well, because they are a part of our national security today. \nThey are no longer just a domestic crime-fighting agency--though very \nimportant but nevertheless a smaller function. They are part of our \nU.S. intelligence agencies that are helping us fight terrorism all over \nthe world. So we funded them, and I am glad we did.\n  We have also included language to encourage the Department of Justice \nto maintain its current fiscal year 2011 level of funding that focuses \non the southwest border. This is so important, as we read about the \natrocities happening in Mexico and on our border, some of which have \nbegun to spread across the border, and drug cartels are becoming \nincreasingly emboldened.\n  I was talking to someone in the law enforcement community today who \nhas had very high positions in our government, and he said those drug \ncartels are terrorists. I agree with him. Those drug cartels are \nterrorists. What they are doing to innocent people is atrocious. So we \nare encouraging and we have given the money to the Justice Department \nfor the southwest border.\n  The El Paso Intelligence Center is another important program that is \none of our first safeguards along the border. It is a national tactical \nintelligence center that supports law enforcement in the United States, \nMexico, and the whole Western Hemisphere. It is the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration's most important intelligence-sharing entity focusing on \nall things related to our borders.\n  Another important program in this bill is the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program which we funded to provide Federal assistance to the \nStates and localities that are incurring the costs of incarcerating \nundocumented criminal aliens who have been accused or convicted of \nState and local offenses. We know there are counties throughout our \ncountry that do not have big budgets. Yet we have illegal alien \ncriminals who are being put in county jails and city jails and it is \nimportant for the Federal Government and it is the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to pay for housing those illegal alien criminals. We \nhave done so in this bill.\n  I was also pleased to work with Senator Mikulski and Jon Kyl, the \nSenator from Arizona, to include more money for the U.S. Marshals \nService for its mission along the southwest border, including detention \nconstruction and security upgrades in southwest border Federal \ncourthouses.\n  The last thing I wish to mention is that we had a very moving \nceremony yesterday honoring the significant astronauts--they are all \nsignificant, but some of those who took the first chance to go where no \nhuman being had ever been, and we honored them with the Congressional \nGold Medal, which is the highest honor Congress can bestow on a \ncivilian: John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth, Neil \nArmstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first and second men to walk on the \nMoon, the Americans who did that, and they were ferried there by \nMichael Collins, who landed Apollo 11.\n  We talked, and the speeches were very uplifting, about the importance \nof space exploration and what it has done for our country. It has \nclearly been an economic boon to this country. It has created jobs, it \nhas created better quality of life, and it has also inspired \ngenerations of scientists. With the significant support of Senator \nMikulski, we were able to give NASA the funding it needs to assure that \nwe have not only the vision that was established by Congress in the \n2010 authorization bill but the funding to achieve the vision going \nforward.\n  Since our space shuttle program has been shut down, we are now on a \nmission to provide a commercial crew vehicle to take our astronauts to \nthe space station, where we are doing scientific research, and we have \nfully funded the launch vehicle that is going to take our astronauts \nbeyond Earth orbit and into the asteroid and, hopefully, Mars. That \nfunding has started with this appropriations bill that is going through \nthis year.\n  So we will have our launch system and our Orion capsule that will be \nthe next generation of space exploration for our country, and Senator \nMikulski and I agreed on that priority, along with the Webb telescope, \nwhich is a very significant scientific priority, that we would assure \nthat those priorities were met. We support the emerging commercial \nspace companies to bring cargo and astronauts to the space station, and \nour investment for discovery on the space station as well as the \nscience that is gotten from these wonderful, incredible telescopes that \nfly out there in space and gather information.\n  NASA has now released its design for the heavy launch vehicle that \nwill be able to carry our astronauts in the Orion crew vehicle to the \nMoon, the asteroid, and beyond. Now that that decision has been made, \nwe can focus on the future and on moving human exploration forward. \nNASA has announced its commitment to the path that Congress authorized, \nand now we are providing the funds to accomplish the development of \nthat rocket.\n  Chairman Mikulski and I have strived to produce a bill that reflects \nnot only the Senate's priorities but the needs of our Nation. Not only \ndo I commend her and all the Senators who have a part in passing these \nbills and the House Members who also have a significant part, but our \nstaffs did a lot of the work in making sure these priorities were met. \nHer staff, Gabrielle Batkin, Jessica Berry, Jean Toal Eisen, Jeremy \nWeirich, and Molly O'Rourke did wonderful work and were so close in \nconcept and in close relationships and working relationships with my \nstaff, James Christoferson, Goodloe Sutton, and Allen Cutler.\n  I recommend our bill. I think we stayed within the budget resolution, \nthe Budget Control Act we passed, but we set the priorities, and I am \nvery pleased to offer it to the Senate tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask to be notified after 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the work of the sponsors on this difficult \npiece of legislation.\n  There is so much we would like to do. But every American knows that \nwhen they are in debt, they have to cut back on spending. But \nWashington remains in denial. This bill is a statement that Washington \ndoes not take seriously the extraordinary dangers imposed by our debt. \nIt is bizarre that we passed on to a committee of 12 the job of \nachieving deficit reduction while at the same time working to increase \nthe deficit with bills such as this one.\n  After the first 2 years of the Obama administration in which \nnondefense discretionary spending surged 24 percent--not counting the \nstimulus--it\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\nshould not be difficult for us to find reductions that can be achieved \nin these three bills that have been cobbled together as a mini omnibus. \nBut instead of doing the hard work and finding things we can reduce the \nspending for and bringing this bill in with a reduction--a real \nreduction--in spending, we now have a piece of legislation that is \nmoving forward with increases. In fact, what this amounts to and what \nwe are seeing in the committee of 12, the supercommittee, in their \nsecret work is apparently a demand by our Democratic colleagues that \ntaxes be substantially increased to fund the spending level we have \nbeen on.\n  I recently also addressed some of the gimmicks I believe this bill \nuses to conceal more spending than is apparent. One of these gimmicks, \ncreating the false appearance of cash savings in mandatory spending, \nwas actually increased, in this current version of the bill, in \nconference. That is why I introduced the Honest Budget Act: to confront \nthese continuing problems.\n  Senator Olympia Snowe and I believe these kind of gimmicks, such as \non mandatory spending and claims of reductions that are not real, need \nto be eliminated from our process as they help cause the great deficit \nwe are in.\n  I think it is particularly offensive that the bill is being \nrepresented as a spending cut, even though that was the most minute \nspending cut of $1 billion, when, in truth, it clearly increases \nspending. We need real cuts, not minuscule cuts and certainly not \nincreases.\n  With the President at the helm of the ship of State, Washington is \ncontinuing to steer toward financial disaster. We must get off this \npath. The American people know it. I believe they spoke clearly last \nNovember. We still have not gotten the message. We still remain in \ndenial.\n  Some say: Oh, the tea party. You shouldn't pay attention to them. \nThey were angry people. I think they were deeply frustrated people and, \nyes, somewhat angry. Why should they not be when the people they have \nelected to Congress, they now discover, are spending billions and \nbillions of dollars day after day, week after week, borrowing 40 cents \nof every dollar that is spent? How can we defend that? How can we \ndefend to any American citizen our behavior that has allowed such a \ndebt situation to occur? We have had three consecutive trillion-dollar \ndeficits, and this fiscal year we are expecting to have another \ntrillion-dollar deficit. It is an unacceptable course.\n  I will oppose the legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I rise in support of this conference report, and I \nencourage our colleagues to join me in voting for this measure.\n  Let me first thank Chairman Patty Murray and her staff who worked \ncollaboratively with me and with my talented staff throughout this \nentire process. I also wish to thank Chairman Kohl, Ranking Member \nBlunt, Chairman Mikulski, Ranking Member Hutchison, and of course the \nleaders of the full Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye and \nSenator Cochran. All of us have worked closely together to usher this \nfirst group of appropriations bills to final passage.\n  I am particularly pleased that we brought these appropriations bills \nto the floor through the regular order enabling members to examine, \ndebate, and vote in a fair and transparent process. That is a big \nchange from the approach that has, unfortunately, marred the process in \nprevious years when all the appropriations bills--or nearly all of \nthem--were bundled into one enormous omnibus bill that was considered \nat the last moment in a rushed manner and without the opportunity for \nfull and fair debate and amendment. We didn't do it that way this time, \nand I think that represents progress.\n  I am also pleased this conference report contains provisions that are \nimportant to the State of Maine.\n  The Transportation-HUD bill recognizes the fiscal reality of what is \nnow an unsustainable $15 trillion debt, while making critical \ninfrastructure and economic development investments that will help to \ncreate jobs. In this bill, we are also meeting our responsibility to \nvery vulnerable populations in our country. The bill strikes the right \nbalance between thoughtful investment and fiscal restraint, thereby \nsetting the stage for future economic growth. The proposed nonemergency \nfunding levels for fiscal year 2012 in this bill are nearly $13 billion \nbelow fiscal year 2010, a reduction of nearly one-fifth in 2 years' \ntime. These significant savings represent an unmistakable commitment \nand movement in the direction of fiscal responsibility.\n  For those reasons, and for many more, I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of this conference report.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to spend a minute because I do not \nthink the American public knows how badly they have been hoodwinked by \nCongress. The Budget Control Act told the American people that we cut \n$1 trillion. That is what the claims were. The fact is, under the \nBudget Control Act spending, discretionary spending will still rise by \n$850 billion over the next 10 years. That is the truth.\n  We hear in the bills that are coming up the word ``emergency.'' One \nof the things the American people cannot quite understand is--when they \nhave an emergency what they do is they end up having to make choices. \nThey do not have a bank that will loan them money regardless of whether \nthey are worthy of paying it back, and that is where we are. We are not \nworthy of paying the money back that we are borrowing now. That is \ngoing to become acutely obvious over the next 18 months in our country \nas we see our interest rates rise.\n  We have a bill on the floor that meets the numbers and meets what the \nBudget Control Act said but totally denies what the American people are \nexpecting. Let me talk about what I mean by that. There are five major \nproblems with this bill.\n  No. 1, it claims to cut spending when in fact it does not. When you \ntake all spending, it does not cut spending. We are going to hear and \nwe have heard already how it cuts spending but usually with the caveat \n``not counting emergency spending.'' So the first thing it does is not \nto address any of the problems our country has in terms of having to \ndeal with real cuts in spending, not decreases in the rate of growth of \nspending. We have to have real cuts if we are going to create a future \nfor our kids. If we are going to be able to borrow money in the future \nat an affordable interest rate, we are going to have to have real cuts. \nWe have to quit playing the game to the American people and start \ntalking to them as adults, not playing the game and actually being \ndishonest with them about what we are doing.\n  This bill also continues to demonstrate that we are shirking our \nduties in terms of doing oversight. We have provided funding for things \nthat obviously need to be corrected but we will not correct them. We do \nnot eliminate the wasteful programs. There is nothing in here, not one \nduplicative program in any of these three segments of appropriations \nbills, that is eliminated. Yet we know there is over $200 billion a \nyear in duplication costs to the Federal Government on programs that do \nexactly the same thing. Yet we did not do any of it. It is no wonder \nyou can't cut spending if you don't get rid of programs that do the \nsame thing, none of which or 80 percent of which never accomplish their \ngoals or never have been measured as to whether they accomplish their \ngoals. That is the third thing.\n  The fourth thing this bill does is absolutely ignore FHA's condition. \nIt was announced they are about to run out of money. What do we do? We \nraise the amount of money that people can borrow from the FHA at the \ntime when FHA is running out of money. The only problem with that is \nFHA has a very friendly banker which the Congress has no control over \nbecause when FHA runs out of money, do you know what they do? They go \nand get it from the Treasury and we cannot stop it.\n  What we have done is we have raised the loan limit for FHA homes to \n$729,000 in this bill. FHA is going to be out of money this year. They \nwill have no capital to protect the $1.1 trillion worth of loans they \nare guaranteeing, and they will go get the money. Where is that money \ngoing to come from? That money is going to come from--we are going to \nborrow it from the Chinese. So we are going to compound the\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\nvery problem we have today. It is absolutely ignoring what the real \nsituation is on the ground, ignoring the real complications of not \nacting, and consequently we actually make it worse for our kids and our \ncountry.\n  Finally, it includes very few of the amendments that were passed by \nwide margins in the Senate. One of mine is there. I am very thankful \nfor it. I think it is an appropriate amendment. But several others are \nnot, that were good, commonsense amendments. Yet somebody in the \nAppropriations Committee decided even though they may have voted for \nit, they pulled it out. It was not the majority on the other side who \ninsisted it come out because I checked.\n  What we have done is we are up here and we are going to pass this \nbill. I have no doubt about it. But we are continuing down the road of, \nNo. 1, being dishonest with the American people about what we are \ndoing, how we are doing it; No. 2, we are shirking our responsibility \nto eliminate the wasteful portions of the Federal Government which at \nleast are $350 billion a year, when you combine waste, fraud, and \nduplication. None of that was attacked in this bill, none of it. Then \nwe are lying to them about whether we are actually increasing spending \nor not increasing spending.\n  Our time is shortening. If you look at what happened in Europe in the \nlast 2 weeks, to the bond yields for Italy, to the bond yields for \nSpain, we know what is coming. How bad does it have to get or how close \ndoes it have to get to us before we will act in the best interests of \nthe country instead of the best interests of partisanship or the best \ninterests of our careers?\n  This is not a bad bill. It just doesn't do what the American people \nneed us to do right now, which is start cutting out the waste, fraud, \nand duplication in the Federal Government so that their children will \nhave an opportunity to live in a country of opportunity.\n  This bill fails on that count. It should be defeated and a bill \ncoming back here with $10 or $12 or $15 billion less is what ought to \ncome back here. That is what ought to happen, if we were going to be \ntruly honest. Either I am being dishonest about the situation facing \nour country or you are being dishonest in what you are bringing as the \nanswer on the floor. One of us is not telling the truth and I guarantee \nthe markets are going to prove me right. When we can no longer borrow, \nas the Chairman of the Federal Reserve said, we are going to eventually \nfix all this, regardless of the politicians. Do you know why we are \ngoing to fix it? Because they are going to quit loaning us money. And \nwe have done nothing with this bill to solve the very real and \nimmediate problems in front of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, we are going to move this bill this \nevening. I think we have other people who wish to speak and there is no \nreason they should not come and speak. I encourage them to come over \nhere and say what needs to be said so we can get our work done. We have \na few people who still have opportunities to make a plane. We are not \ngoing to be voting tomorrow. We plan to be voting here in the next 30 \nminutes or so. I hope people come to the floor and speak on the bill. \nThis bill has gone through a process with lots of amendments, lots of \ndebate. It went through a conference committee. It is not perfect by \nanyone's standard of perfect, but legislation seldom is.\n  It is under the level that was established in the debt ceiling \nagreement that also established how we deal with emergency spending. Of \ncourse, many of our colleagues did not vote for that. They did not \nagree with that at the time. It has only been a few weeks ago, but it \nis the standard that the House and Senate worked on. These numbers \nshould be below that number. They are a little lower than the Senate \nnumber which was at that number but higher than the House number. I \nwish we could have been closer to the House number, but the House has a \ndifferent majority than the Senate does.\n  The real point is, if people want to come speak on this bill, the \nvote is scheduled here in about a half hour or so and I hope people \nwill come on over and have their say on this bill, let the people know \nin addition to their vote where they stand. We are waiting for a couple \nof people to come. This would be a good time for them to do that.\n  I yield, and we will be waiting.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I rise to speak about the transportation-housing title \nof the bill before the Senate. It has broad bipartisan support because \nit addresses the very real housing and transportation needs of American \nfamilies across the Nation.\n  This is not a perfect bill, but there is a lot to be proud of in the \nconference report, and I am pleased with what we have been able to \naccomplish with my colleague Senator Collins, because she has worked so \nhard in a bipartisan way to get us to this point, and Chairman Latham \nand Congressman Olver on the House side and all of their staff.\n  This bill makes needed investments in our transportation \ninfrastructure and creates critical jobs, while also supporting housing \nand services for our Nation's most vulnerable.\n  This bill touches the lives of all Americans in ways they can \nappreciate every day, whether it is a parent who commutes every day and \nneeds safe roads or new public transportation options so they can spend \nmore time with their family, a business that depends on a solid \ninfrastructure to move goods and attract customers, young families \nsearching for safe and affordable communities to raise their children \nor a repeatedly laid-off worker who needs help to keep his or her \nfamily in their home. This bill has a real impact on Americans who are \nstruggling in these troubling economic times.\n  Our bill takes a balanced approach that addresses the most critical \nneeds we face in both transportation and housing, while remaining \nfinancially responsible and staying within the constraints of the \nbudget.\n  The bill contains improvement investments for our Nation, including \n$500 million for the competitive, multimodal TIGER Program to help \nimprove our Nation's infrastructure, including rail transportation \nprojects; $1.4 billion for Amtrak, including funding for State-\nsupported services; sufficient funding to preserve housing for our \nNation's low-income families, elderly, disabled, and veterans who rely \non HUD's housing and rental assistance programs; $39.8 billion to \ncontinue the Federal-Aid Highway Program at current levels; $45 million \nfor housing counseling; and $75 million for 11,000 new vouchers for \nhomeless veterans.\n  The bill also addresses the needs of communities that have been hit \nby disasters this year, providing $1.7 billion in emergency relief \nhighway funding and up to $400 million in CDBG funding for areas that \nhave been most impacted by recent disasters.\n  It is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill. It represents a \nfair, bipartisan compromise that makes investments in our \ninfrastructure and protects the most vulnerable, while living within \nour funding restraints. Our bill helps commuters, homeowners, and the \nmost vulnerable in our society. Most importantly, it creates jobs and \nsupports the continued recovery of the national economy.\n  I look forward to having it reach the President's desk soon for his \nsignature, and before I close I again thank my colleague Senator \nCollins and all of her staff for all of their very hard work on this \nbill. I also thank all of my staff members who worked beyond reasonable \nhours to get this bill to this point tonight to be able to send it to \nthe President. They are Alex Keenan, Megan McCarthy, Dabney Hegg, \nRachel Milberg, Molly O'Rourke, Travis Lumpkin, Evan Schatz, and Lauren \nOverman. I thank all of them for their hard work and all of Senator \nCollins' staff as well as our chairman, Senator Inouye, and look \nforward to the passage of this bill this evening.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wanted to add to my earlier remarks in \nsupport of the FY 2012 conference report which includes language I co-\nauthored\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\nalong with Senator Leahy allowing the heaviest trucks to travel on the \ninterstate highways in Maine and Vermont rather than forcing them onto \nsecondary roads and downtown streets.\n  Currently, the heaviest trucks in Maine are diverted onto secondary \nroadways that cut through our downtowns on narrow streets. This creates \na major safety concern. It simply makes no sense to force heavier \ntrucks off the highway and onto our smaller roads, jeopardizing the \nsafety of both drivers and pedestrians.\n  In 2009, I authored a pilot project that allowed trucks weighing up \nto 100,000 pounds to travel on Maine's Federal interstates for 1 year. \nAccording to the Maine Department of Transportation, the number of \naccidents involving trucks decreased. During the 1-year period covered \nby the pilot, the number of crashes involving trucks on Maine's local \nroads was reduced by 72 compared to a 5-year average. This information \nand other data gathered during the pilot provide proof that this \nlanguage will increase safety.\n  In a case study of a freight trip following this route from Hampden \nto Houlton, when these trucks were allowed to use I-95 rather than \nRoute 2, the driver avoided 300 intersections, 4 hospitals, 30 traffic \nlights, 9 school crossings, 4 railroad crossings, and 86 crosswalks.\n  Virtually every safety group in Maine supports this language. These \ngroups include the Maine Association of Police, the Maine State Police, \nthe State Troopers Association, the Maine Department of Public Safety, \nand the Maine Chiefs of Police. This language is also supported by \neducation and child advocacy groups such as Maine Parent Teachers \nAssociation and the Maine School Superintendents Association.\n  Let me make clear: my amendment does not increase the size or weight \nof Maine trucks. The only question is on which roads they are allowed \nto travel.\n  This has been a long and hard-fought battle. But I am delighted that \nI was able to convince my colleagues in both the House and Senate to \nsupport my provision to allow the heaviest trucks to drive on Federal \nhighways in Maine.\n  I also want to voice my support for the Agriculture Appropriations \ntitle of this legislation. I am particularly appreciative of the \nefforts of the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture \nSubcommittee, Senators Kohl and Blunt, and their staffs for their \ndiligent work to move this legislation forward.\n  I also want to thank my colleague, Senator Mark Udall, for joining me \nin co-authoring an amendment to ensure that schools continue to have \nthe flexibility they need to serve children nutritious meals at an \naffordable cost. We worked with Members from both sides of the aisle \nand from across the country in crafting a bipartisan amendment that \nachieves this goal.\n  Our efforts will go a long way in ensuring that schools can serve \nhealthy meals that meet the nutritional needs of students in a way that \nfits their budgets. The language overturns arbitrary restrictions \nproposed by the USDA that would have so restricted the use of potatoes \nin the school lunch program that a school could not have served a baked \npotato and an ear of fresh corn in the same week--an absurd result.\n  We heard from many school advocacy organizations and school and \nschool food service professionals that the rule as proposed was too \nprescriptive, too limiting, and too expensive. USDA estimates that the \nopposed rule would have cost as much as $6.8 billion over 5 years. The \nlion's share of these costs would have been incurred by the state and \nlocal agencies.\n  We were pleased to have the support of the American Association of \nSchool Administrators, National School Boards Association, Council of \nthe Great City Schools, National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals, Maine Parent Teacher Association, Maine School Management \nAssociation, Maine Principals Association, Maine Department of \nEducation, and so many more.\n  Mr. President, for these and many other reasons I am proud to support \nthe FY 2012 conference report.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we would yield back whatever time is left on \nthe Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time \nis yielded back on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to continue to work tomorrow on \nthe DOD authorization bill. Everyone has been told by the two managers \nof this bill that if they have amendments, they should offer them.\n  We are working on the Energy and Water bill. While we are making \nprogress on that with Senators Feinstein and Lamar Alexander, we have \nsome nominations we are working on.\n  The next vote will be at 5:30 on November 28.\n  We will be in session tomorrow.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I yield back the Republican time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2112.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 70, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 208 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--70\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Enzi\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Lee\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Paul\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could, there are a number of Senators \nhere who want to offer their amendments and make them pending tonight. \nThat is fine with us. Then if they have speeches, I would suggest that \nthey withhold speeches until everybody who has amendments here can \noffer them and set them aside so that we can allow people to leave and \nthen have the speeches come, if there are speeches tonight, after \nanybody who wants to make their amendment pending has that opportunity.\n  That is the process I would suggest, and Senator McCain is supportive \nof that process. So that is my suggestion: that the Chair recognize \npeople as the Chair wishes, call up your amendment, set it aside, let \nthe next person call up their amendment, set it aside, and if there are \nany speeches, that they come after everybody who is recognized to call \nup their amendment has that opportunity.\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\n  Now, one other thing. This relates to what will happen, hopefully, \ntonight and tomorrow; that is, we are going to try to clear amendments, \nif we can, tonight and tomorrow. We will be here at 9 o'clock, and we \nare going to try to clear as many amendments as we can because we have \nto make progress on this bill.\n  I just want to thank Senator McCain for all he is doing to help that \nprocess and help our leaders.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand we have a couple of \namendments already from Senator Cardin, No. 1073 and 1188.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Are his two amendments cleared on your side?

USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FUNDS FOR ABORTIONS IN \n                   CASES OF RAPE AND INCEST.\n\n       Section 1093(a) of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting before the period at the end the following: ``or \n     in a case in which the pregnancy is the result of an act of \n     rape or incest''.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Levin and \nSenator McCain with regard to amendment No. 1188, which was my Hotels \nfor Heroes amendment. I am going to be very brief.\n  Hotels for Heroes follows on Hero Miles, a successful program which \nallows our wounded warriors and their families to use frequent flyer \nmiles that are donated for trips to military care facilities. I \ncompliment my colleague in the House, Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger, \nfor his work on establishing that program.\n  The amendment which was just accepted, which Senators Wicker, \nFeinstein, Mikulski, Rockefeller, Casey, and Burr cosponsored, expands \nthat program to include hotel points so that family members can use the \ndonated hotel points for housing so they can be near and visit their \nwounded warriors who are on rest and recuperative leave, emergency \nleave, convalescent leave, or another form of authorized leave \nnecessary because of an injury or illness incurred or aggravated in the \nline of duty in support of a contingency operation.\n  I also want to comment very briefly on the other amendment I filed, \nwhich is No. 1073, that Senator Mikulski cosponsored. This amendment \nwould prohibit the District of Columbia's National Guard from operating \nor expanding its Youth Challenge Program in Anne Arundel County because \nthere is also a better alternative already in place.\n  The DC National Guard currently partners with the Maryland National \nGuard to provide valuable service to at-risk children through the Youth \nChallenge Program at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Harford County, MD. I \nhave visited the two programs at that site, and that is where I think \nit is logical to see an expansion.\n  Here's the problem with the so-called Oak Hill facility in Anne \nArundel County, which is what this amendment deals with: that parcel of \nland borders the National Security Agency (NSA), which will need more \nspace. This is Federal property located in the State of Maryland that \nis important for our national security.\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\n  In the 1920s, the District of Columbia got permission from Congress \nto place on that property--and please understand I am quoting from the \noriginal authorizing language--a facility for children that are \n``feeble-minded.'' That was the exact language contained in the fiscal \nyear 1924 District of Columbia appropriations bill.\n  Since that time, the District, without our knowledge, constructed a \njuvenile detention facility and now wants to add the Youth Challenge \nProgram, which is doing just fine at Aberdeen. The purpose of this \namendment is to say: Look, we already have a place where the Youth \nChallenge Program should be and can expand as necessary. We should not \nbe using this other Federal land in the State of Maryland adjacent to \nNSA for this type of expansion without working with the appropriate \nState and local officials, as well as federal officials.\n  I hope this amendment can get cleared. But I wanted to explain the \nreason I filed it and called it up. I thank the Chair for your \nattention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, the amendment I offered--\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would just say that we have the Senator \nfrom Maine here. I thought we were going to go through the process of \npending amendments before we spoke. I think the Senator's amendment is \nalready pending.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. It is. Because the Senator from Maryland spoke to his \namendment, I thought that process was over. I apologize.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not at all. It is no big deal at all. Maybe the Senator \nfrom Maine could make her amendments pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator from Maine yield?\n  I wanted to thank the Senator from Minnesota for his courtesy because \nhe had no way of knowing that the Senator from Maine was here to offer \nher amendments. I just want to thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I would like to thank the Senator from Michigan for \nthanking me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n               Amendment Nos. 1105, 1155, 1158, and 1180\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

INCLUSION OF DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN CONTRACT \n                   AUTHORITY USING COMPETITIVE PROCEDURES BUT \n                   EXCLUDING PARTICULAR SOURCES FOR ESTABLISHING \n                   CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES.\n\n       Section 2304(b) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (3) and (4) as paragraphs \n     (4) and (5), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following new \n     paragraph (3):\n       ``(3) The Secretary of Commerce shall be treated as the \n     head of an agency for purposes of procurements under \n     paragraph (1) that are covered by a determination under \n     subparagraph (C) of that paragraph.''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1095\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the importance of \n          addressing deficiencies in mental health counseling)\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1088. MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING TRAINING FOR MILITARY \n                   CHAPLAINS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) A decade of deployments for the United States Armed \n     Forces has led to significant increases in traumatic stress \n     for members of the Armed Forces and their families.\n       (2) Increases in the severity and frequency of stress for \n     members of the Armed Forces and their families has driven up \n     demand for mental health counseling services by specially \n     trained counselors and military chaplains.\n       (3) The emotional needs, mental strain, and interpersonal \n     issues that arise among soldiers and their families before, \n     during, and after deployment are highly unique. It is \n     critical that military counselors and chaplains have a \n     specialized understanding of the total deployment experience.\n       (4) The military chaplain's corps for all military services \n     has experienced significant shortfalls in personnel. The Army \n     and Army National Guard have been especially affected by the \n     inability to field needed personnel.\n       (5) A muted ability to field qualified military health \n     counselors and chaplains has an adverse affect on the mental \n     and emotional health of members of the Armed Forces and their \n     families.\n       (6) The United States Army Chaplain Center and School, \n     United States Navy Chaplaincy School and Center, and other \n     military chaplaincy schools rely on accredited universities, \n     seminaries, and religious schools to produce qualified \n     counselors and chaplain candidates.\n       (7) It is important that accredited universities, \n     seminaries, and religious schools producing chaplain \n     candidates or providing post-graduate education and \n     supplemental training adequately prepare students with the \n     training required to address the needs of members of the \n     Armed Forces and their families.\n       (8) There is both opportunity and need for the Chaplain \n     Corps of the United States Armed Forces to work with \n     accredited universities, seminaries, and religious schools to \n     produce qualified counselors and chaplain candidates and \n     provide post-graduate education and supplemental training, \n     and to do so in a way that is cost effective.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the Chief \n     of Chaplains for each military service, should produce a plan \n     to ensure sustainable throughput of qualified chaplains in \n     the military chaplain centers and schools; and\n       (2) the plan should include integration of accredited \n     universities, seminaries, and religious schools to include \n     programmatic augmentation when efficient and fiscally \n     advantageous.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1096\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on treatment options for \nmembers of the Armed Forces and veterans for Traumatic Brain Injury and \n                    Post Traumatic Stress Disorder)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 723. SENSE OF SENATE ON TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF \n                   THE ARMED FORCES AND VETERANS FOR TRAUMATIC \n                   BRAIN INJURY AND POST TRAUMATIC STRESS \n                   DISORDER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 1,400,000 Americans experience Traumatic \n     Brain Injury (TBI) each year, and an estimated 3,200,000 \n     Americans are living with long-term, severe disabilities as a \n     result of brain injury. Another approximate 360,000 men and \n     women are estimated to have been experienced a Traumatic \n     Brain Injury in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan to \n     date.\n       (2) Congressional funding for Traumatic Brain Injury \n     activities began with Public Law 104-166 (commonly referred \n     to as the ``Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 1996'') and has \n     subsequently been addressed in title XIII of Public Law 106-\n     310 (commonly referred to as the ``Traumatic Brain Injury Act \n     Amendments of 2000''), which mandated reports and \n     requirements for mild Traumatic Brain Injury, and in Acts \n     authorizing and appropriating funds for the Department of \n     Defense to date.\n       (3) In 1992 during the Persian Gulf War, Congress created \n     the Defense and Veterans Head Injury Program (DVHIP) to \n     integrate specialized Traumatic Brain Injury care, research, \n     and education across the military and veteran medical care \n     systems.\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\n       (4) With Congressional oversight and appropriations, the \n     Department of Defense subsequently transitioned the Defense \n     and Veterans Head Injury Program to the Defense and Veterans \n     Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) in order improve the military and \n     veterans medical communities ability to develop and provide \n     advanced Traumatic Brain Injury-specific evaluation, \n     treatment, and follow-up care for military personnel, their \n     beneficiaries, and veterans with mild to severe Traumatic \n     Brain Injury.\n       (5) Though Congress, the Department of Defense, and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs have increased the capacity to \n     provide health services, particularly in the areas of mental \n     health and Traumatic Brain Injury, gaps in access and quality \n     remain, to include a selected method for diagnosing a \n     Traumatic Brain Injury, a consistent process for treatment \n     for a Traumatic Brain Injury, availability of providers, \n     shortages of personnel, organizational deficiencies, cultural \n     understanding and acceptance, and available technology in \n     diagnosis and treatment.\n       (6) Gaps in quality of care and limited access to proper \n     care remain for both members of the Armed Forces and \n     veterans, especially veterans who are demobilized members of \n     the National Guard and Reserve.

The number of veterans receiving such compensation \n     for auditory impairment has risen each year since 2005, \n     increasing the number and cost of compensation claims paid by \n     the Secretary and prompting a series of reports on the \n     subject, include a January 2011 report by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States entitled ``Hearing Loss \n     Prevention: Improvements to DOD Hearing Conservation Programs \n     Could Lead to Better Outcomes''.\n       (3) Costs to the Department of Veterans Affairs relating to \n     compensation for hearing-related disabilities are expected to \n     double between 2009 and 2014, exceeding $2,000,000,000 by \n     2014.\n       (4) There is a growing body of peer reviewed literature \n     indicating a direct connection between traumatic brain \n     injury, post traumatic stress disorder, and auditory \n     disorders.\n       (5) 70 percent of members of the Armed Forces who are \n     exposed to a blast report auditory disorders within 72 hours \n     of the exposure.\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\n       (6) Section 721 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417; \n     122 Stat. 4506) requires the Secretary of Defense to \n     establish a center of excellence in the prevention, \n     diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and rehabilitation of \n     hearing loss and auditory system injury.\n       (7) There is no cure for tinnitus, which consists of an \n     often debilitating ringing in the ear. The projected effect \n     of tinnitus on veterans, rise in new cases of tinnitus-\n     related service-connected disabilities among veterans, and \n     the correlating rise in disability claims and cost to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs make finding effective \n     treatment, abatement options, and a cure for tinnitus a \n     priority.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Defense should, in cooperation with the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Director of the Hearing \n     Center of Excellence of the Department of Defense, implement \n     the recommendations of the Comptroller General of the United \n     States in the January 2011 report of the Comptroller General \n     entitled ``Hearing Loss Prevention: Improvements to DOD \n     Hearing Conservation Programs Could Lead to Better Outcomes'' \n     that address prevention, abatement, data collection, and the \n     need for a new interagency data sharing system so that \n     sufficient information is available to address and track \n     hearing injuries and loss.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1100\n\n   (Purpose: To extend to products and services from Latvia existing \n   temporary authority to procure certain products and services from \n        countries along a major route of supply to Afghanistan)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 808.

It provides a secure location to secure and try \n     detainees charged by the United States Government, full \n     access to sensitive and classified information, full access \n     to defense lawyers and prosecution, and full media access by \n     the press.\n       (10) The Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility is the single \n     greatest repository of human intelligence in the war on \n     terror.\n       (11) The intelligence derived from the Guantanamo Bay \n     Detention Facility has prevented terrorist attacks and saved \n     lives in the past and continues to do so today.\n       (12) The intelligence obtained from questioning detainees \n     at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility includes information \n     on the following:\n       (A) The organizational structure of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, \n     and other terrorist groups.\n       (B) The extent of the presence of terrorists in Europe, the \n     United States, and the Middle East, and elsewhere around the \n     globe.\n       (C) The pursuit of weapons of mass destruction by al-Qaeda.\n       (D) The methods of recruitment by al-Qaeda and the \n     locations of its recruitment centers.\n       (E) The skills of terrorists, including general and \n     specialized operative training.\n       (F) The means by which legitimate financial activities are \n     used to hide terrorist operations.\n       (13) Key intelligence used to find Osama bin Laden was \n     obtained at least in part through the use of enhanced \n     interrogation of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Detention \n     Facility, with Leon Panetta, Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, acknowledging that ``[c]learly some of \n     it came from detainees and the interrogation of detainees. . \n     .'' and confirming that ``they used these enhanced \n     interrogation techniques against some of those detainees''.\n       (b) Requirement.--Each high-value enemy combatant who is \n     captured or otherwise taken into long-term custody or \n     detention by the United States shall, while under such \n     detention of the United States, be detained at the Guantanamo \n     Bay Detention Facility (GTMO) at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n       (c) High-value Enemy Combatant Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``high-value enemy combatant'' means an enemy \n     combatant who--\n       (1) is a senior member of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any \n     associated terrorist group;\n       (2) has knowledge of an imminent terrorist threat against \n     the United States or its territories, the Armed Forces of the \n     United States, the people or organizations of the United \n     States, or an ally of the United States;\n       (3) has, or has had, direct involvement in planning or \n     preparing a terrorist action against the United States or an \n     ally of the United States or in assisting the leadership of \n     al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or any associated terrorist group in \n     planning or preparing such a terrorist action; or\n       (4) if released from detention, would constitute a clear \n     and continuing threat to the United States or any ally of the \n     United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, the amendment I offered, No. 1197, will \nhelp small businesses. Small businesses often serve as subcontractors, \nor suppliers, to large corporations that have a primary government \ncontract. My amendment would help guarantee that small businesses get \npaid by these large corporations in a timely way. More specifically, my \namendment would require the Office of Management and Budget to issue \nregulations in the next year to do this.\n  This amendment sounds simple. There is a reason for that. It is. It \nis something we can do here today that will offer real and significant \nhelp to small businesses. It is going to offer predictability and \ncertainty to them.\n  Anyone who owns a small business will tell you that they can't hire \nmore people or plan for the future if they don't know when their next \npaycheck is coming. Getting their money more predictably and quickly \nwill enable them to make the investments they need to grow, thrive, and \nhire more people.\n  The administration has recognized that small businesses are the \nengine that drives our economy. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, \nsmall businesses create an overwhelming majority of all new jobs. Small \nbusinesses are also responsible for producing half of the private \nsector GDP.\n  Given this, it makes sense to me that we need to figure out how to \nmake sure small businesses are getting paid on\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\ntime. OMB recognized this and issued a new policy statement that will \nrequire all Federal agencies to make payments to their small business \ncontractors within 15 days of receiving an invoice. But the fact is, a \nlot of small businesses serve as subcontractors to direct prime \ncontractors. It only makes sense that we should require our large prime \ncontractors to play by the same rules we play by and to pay their \nsuppliers in a timely manner.\n  When Congress passed the Prompt Payments Act back in 1983, it \nrecognized that the Federal Government needed to lead by example, and \nthat we should be paying all of our contractors in no more than 30 days \nafter the contractor sent an invoice our way. Congress went back in \n1988 to create an obligation on construction contractors that they pay \ntheir suppliers within 7 days of the government paying them. But no \nother contractors were under the same commonsense obligation. I think \nthat is a mistake we should correct, especially as we are pouring \nbillions and billions of government dollars into contingency operations \noverseas--and all sorts of other projects that have nothing to do with \nconstruction. All suppliers working with these contractors deserve to \nbe paid on time. I am hoping one day we can tackle this problem for all \nsubcontractors, not just small businesses that are contractors.\n  For now, my amendment takes a modest approach and focuses on the \nbiggest problem--creating certainty and predictability for small \nbusiness subcontractors.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business recently conducted a \nsurvey, and they found nearly 40 percent of firms reported that \nreceivables are coming in at a slower pace. I have heard stories from \ncompanies that have not been paid in 90 days or 120 days after they \nhave invoiced. This is unacceptable.\n  These sorts of delays affect cashflow for these small businesses and \nmake it tough for these businesses to meet payroll obligations and pay \ntheir other basic bills, such as their rent.\n  I want to tell a personal story that relates to small businesses and \nhow important it is to them to be paid on time or how important \ncashflow is. My uncle, Lionel Kunst, was a small businessman. He died \nin 1994. I went to his funeral. At the funeral were a number of his \nbusiness associates--people who supplied him. He made fabric, quilting. \nThese were people who supplied him and people whom he supplied. One \nafter another got up and testified how quickly he paid, or how, if they \ncould not pay on time, he would cut them some slack. That is how \nimportant this is. That is how important it was to them. My uncle was a \nmensch. It was a big deal. These guys got up and all talked about this.\n  This is what we should do. We should do it for these small business \nsubcontractors--make sure they get paid on time. That is all.\n  This is a sensible, simple solution to a real problem that small \nbusinesses are confronting. I urge my colleagues to support me in this \neffort.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would first of all like to thank Chairman \nLevin and Ranking Member McCain for their work on this national defense \nauthorization bill, and tonight I will speak to an amendment I filed. I \nwill not call it up for now. I just want to speak to it. This is a \ncritically important debate for the country, and I know the chairman \nand ranking member have worked very hard on it.\n  I have had the honor and the pleasure to work with Senator Levin on a \nnumber of measures over the years, and one of the real concerns we all \nhave is what is happening to our troops as it relates to IEDs--\nimprovised explosive devices. It has been central to the work many of \nus have done, certainly my work as a member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and, of course, Chairman Levin and so many others working on \nthis bill for a long time.\n  It does have a daily impact, obviously, on our troops and on their \nfamilies. Often the best words about our soldiers and the war itself \ncome from Lincoln when he talked about those who lose their life in \nbattle, those who gave, as he said, ``the last full measure of devotion \nto their country.'' But he also talked about those who served and are \nwounded and who come back. His words to describe those soldiers, when \nhe spoke of them, was ``him who has borne the battle.''\n  I think about those words when I consider those who have borne the \nbattle and come back with not just injuries but with grievous \ninjuries--sometimes almost irreparable harm done to them because of the \nexplosion they lived through from an IED.\n  I was in Bethesda Naval Hospital a couple weeks ago. It is one of the \nreal privileges of serving in the Senate that we are given the \nopportunity to meet so many brave young men and women who serve--those \nwho serve and are never hurt, those who serve and are wounded, and, of \ncourse, unfortunately, we meet the families of those who lose their \nlife in battle. But as I said, a couple weeks ago, at Bethesda Naval \nHospital, I walked into the room of a soldier who had been injured and \nwas recovering. His parents and his brother were in the room with him. \nOne is always worried about staying too long because you feel like you \nare almost intruding. But for some reason, that night, I didn't feel I \nwas intruding because this wounded soldier wanted to talk. He wanted to \ntalk about his service, he wanted to talk about his love for his \ncountry, how he was injured, and he also talked about the future--what \nhe wanted to do when he left that hospital bed.\n  It was a stunning moment for me to hear--from a soldier who is \nlooking up from his hospital bed--of the optimism he displayed about \nhis future. The calm with which he could speak about his service was, \nto me, stunning. He talked as if he were just recovering from a minor \ninjury. Halfway through my visit, I almost had to remind myself of the \ninjuries he was suffering from. He had both legs blown off below the \nknee from an IED blast. But despite that, despite the horror of it, \ndespite the damage done to his body--a 20-year-old soldier--he was \ntalking about the future, what he was going to do when he left that \nhospital, and he was talking about his service.\n  So when we see soldiers such as him, I think it inspires us all the \nmore and compels us to do more when it comes to protecting our troops \nagainst the scourge of IEDs. We know, and so many people here know, \nthat they are the top killer of our troops in Afghanistan. The primary \ningredient in IEDs found in Regional Command South, in Afghanistan--\nwhere the Presiding Officer and I were in August--is a fertilizer \ncalled calcium ammonium nitrate, known by the acronym CAN. It is banned \nin Afghanistan but unfortunately is produced in a few factories in \nPakistan. Just a small percentage of what is produced in Pakistan finds \nits way into Afghanistan and becomes the main ingredient in the IEDs. \nMost of the calcium ammonium nitrate used in IEDs, unfortunately, comes \nfrom Pakistan.\n  Over the past 2 years, I have led an effort to urge Pakistan to do \nmore to address this threat. I have sent letters, we passed a \nresolution in the Senate, and I traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan \nlast August to make the case directly to the leaders in Islamabad, the \ncapital of Pakistan. As I mentioned, the Presiding Officer, Senator \nBennet, along with Senators Blumenthal of Connecticut and Whitehouse of \nRhode Island traveled with me. We spent a good deal of time in \nPakistan--3 days. I think we were pretty consistent in the delivery of \nthat message; that we were not only providing a sense of urgency but \nalmost a directive, as best we could, urging and pushing their \ngovernment as hard as we could to help us and to help themselves, by \nthe way, because a lot of Pakistanis lose their lives this way as well.\n\n  So during these meetings, Senators Bennet, Blumenthal, Whitehouse, \nand I heard good things; that the Pakistani Government had developed a \nplan, a strategy to deal with this--a plan to tighten their borders, a \nplan to regulate the sale of calcium ammonium nitrate and other IED \nprecursor materials, and a plan which included\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\nconducting a public relations campaign to sensitize the Pakistani \npeople to the dangers posed by these materials. This political \ncommitment was encouraging, but given the ongoing and increasing threat \nto our troops, we need to maintain a sense of urgency about it. I think \nwe owe our troops nothing less than that sense of urgency.\n  During our meetings in Islamabad, we also discussed the serious \nthreat IEDs pose to the Pakistani people, as I mentioned a moment ago. \nMore than 500 Pakistanis have been killed by IEDs since the beginning \nof this calendar year. This is a common threat that requires a common \nsolution. This is something we can and should work on together.\n  It is no secret the relationship between the United States and \nPakistan is not a good relationship right now. It is a vast \nunderstatement to say it has soured dramatically. There is an awful lot \nof tension and mistrust and a real breakdown in this relationship. One \nof the ways--not the only way but one of the ways--we can build some \nconfidence so we can begin to work together on a common threat is for \nthe Pakistani Government to take concerted action on the question of \nIEDs.\n  I do want to commend and thank those three Senators I mentioned who \nwere on the trip with me--Senator Bennet of Colorado, the Presiding \nOfficer, who was there for every meeting and worked very hard with us; \nSenator Whitehouse as well, from Rhode Island; and Senator Blumenthal \nwas also with us, who spoke today about this today. I didn't hear him \ngive his remarks on the floor, but my staff told me about them, and I \nthank him for those words and for the dedication to this issue he and \nSenators Bennett and Whitehouse have given during our trip in August \nand since that trip. I am proud to join them on this effort today and \nevery day that we have been working on it. I also thank Senator \nBarrasso from Wyoming for his leadership and willingness to work with \nus on this amendment.\n  This is a critical issue for our troops and for their families. I \nthink it was so important that we delivered during our trip, and \ncontinue to deliver thereafter, a strong bipartisan message to the \nPakistani Government and to any official in their government who has \nanything to do with this issue. I think we can deliver another message \nby way of this amendment on this bill. This amendment will hold \nPakistan to its commitments--the commitments it already made to its \nstrategic plan to counter IEDs.\n  As we know well, these IEDs are killing and injuring our troops at a \nterribly alarming rate. While we can never completely eradicate the \ncomponent parts of IEDs, we can make life difficult for the bombmaker \nif we pass this amendment. We should recommit ourselves to this \nimportant mission and redouble our efforts to limit the availability of \nthese component parts on the battlefield. Again, we owe nothing less \nthan that to our troops.\n  Often, I have said that when we talk about the commitment and the \nsacrifice of our troops, we should also talk about praying for them, \nand we all do that. Thank goodness, the American people pray on a \nregular basis for our troops. But I think we should also, once in a \nwhile, pray for ourselves; that we may be worthy of the valor of our \ntroops. There aren't a lot of ways to prove yourself worthy of the \nvalor of our troops, but one way Members of the Senate and House can \nprove ourselves worthy of that valor is to pass amendments, such as \nthis amendment, to force, as best we can, officials in Pakistan to do \nwhat is right for our troops and their families, for our country but \nalso to do what is right for their own people--the people in Pakistan \nwho are threatened every day by IEDs.\n  I will conclude by saying we have an opportunity to prove ourselves \nworthy of the valor of our troops, and passing this amendment is one \nsuch way to do it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to alert my colleagues that \nI intend to object to any unanimous consent agreement for the \nconsideration of S. 1793 or its companion, H.R. 2076, the Investigative \nAssistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2011. Unless changes are made to \naddress my concerns with the legislation, I will continue to object.\n  I oppose S. 1793/H.R. 2076 in its current form because it would \nexpand the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by \ngiving it authority to conduct investigations of State crimes, and I \nbelieve that that is a bad precedent to set. The FBI should not be \nturned into a roving national police force.\n  I do believe in allowing Federal law enforcement agencies to assist \nState and local agencies, when requested. Agents providing assistance \nshould be afforded civil liability protection.\n  Unfortunately, the bill excludes all other Federal law enforcement \nagencies that routinely provide law assistance to local law enforcement \nwhen requested. For example, local police believed the Secret Service \npossessed the expertise they needed to assist in their investigation of \nthe Boston ``Craigslist Killer.'' As a result of this expert \nassistance, the killer was captured. There is no reason to limit States \nand localities to the assistance of the FBI alone, when other agencies \nmay have the particular expertise that is needed.\n  Too many people think that only the FBI helps local law enforcement. \nThat's simply not true. State and local officers develop positive \nrelationships with their Federal law enforcement counterparts. When a \nviolent crisis occurs, they often request assistance from the Federal \nagents they already work with.\n  I support the idea behind the legislation: to allow State and local \nagencies to request the assistance of Federal law enforcement to \naddress serious State and local crimes. But that should apply to all \nagencies, and should be done without expanding the authority of any \nFederal law enforcement agency to conduct investigations of State and \nlocal crimes on its own, at the expense of other State, local, and \nFederal law enforcement agencies.\n  The bill as reported also contains an ill-advised requirement that \nthe Bureau cannot provide assistance to State or local law enforcement \nagencies unless three persons have died. Given that the bill purports \nto permit assistance in the case of attempted mass murder, a \nrequirement that three people have died before assistance can be \nprovided, is flawed. Moreover, there have been serious crimes involving \nmass shootings in which, fortunately, no one has died. No assistance \ncould be provided to investigate such crimes under the bill in its \ncurrent form.\n  Until these concerns are addressed and further changes are included \nin the bill, I support holding this legislation on the Senate floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7694-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7694-S7695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DANA SINGISER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nhonor a dear friend and native Vermonter, Dana Singiser. Dana has \naccepted the position of Vice President for Public Policy and \nGovernment Affairs for Planned Parenthood, and while I am sorry to see \nher leave President Obama's administration, I am proud to recognize \nDana's hard work and wish her continued success in her career.\n  Dana was raised in the small rural town of Mendon, VT, where her \nmother--the Mendon town clerk--instilled in her the values of democracy \nand the importance of staying engaged in her community. Dana carried \nthis spirit with her in her career on Capitol Hill and on several \npresidential campaigns. Dana came to my office as an intern in the \nsummer of 1991 while attending Brown University. I was immediately \nimpressed with her intelligence, work ethic, and gregarious \npersonality. I knew she would go on to accomplish great things, and \nindeed she has. After graduating from Brown, she attended law school at \nGeorgetown University and spent 7 years at a law firm before her return \nto public service, where she has remained.\n  Dana served as the Director of Women's Outreach for Hillary Clinton's \npresidential bid--an opportunity that allowed her to grow her career in \npolitics. She later also quickly proved herself a valuable asset to \nPresident Obama's campaign, and following his election she was \nappointed Special Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs, \nwhere she has served for the last 3 years.\n  While she has enjoyed her time at the White House, Dana has also \ngained immeasurable experience that will certainly add to her already \nsuccessful career. In Dana's new role with Planned Parenthood, she can \ncontinue her long fight to protect women's rights, and I am glad to see \nher continue to follow her passion. Vermonters are proud to recognize \nDana Singiser's hard work, and we wish her continued success in her \ncareer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article about her achievements, from \nThe\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\nNational Journal, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Fire\n\n               [From the National Journal, Nov. 7, 2011]\n\n                           (By Naureen Khan)\n\n       Dana Singiser remembers the glamour of her first job out of \n     college: running a tiny field office in Vermont for Bill \n     Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign for $300 a month. \n     Luckily, Singiser was a local and her mother was on hand to \n     bring her laboring daughter dinner every night.\n       Public service was always a natural inclination for \n     Singiser, she said. She was, after all, raised by parents who \n     were actively involved in the small rural community of \n     Mendon, Vt., population 1,056. Mom was the town clerk and a \n     small-business owner while Dad kept busy with church \n     activities.\n       An internship with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., while she was \n     still an undergraduate at Brown University gave Singiser her \n     first taste of D.C. and there was no turning back. After \n     working on Clinton's 1992 race, she landed a job in the White \n     House with presidential personnel and packed her bags for \n     Washington--``The last meritocracy,'' according to Singiser, \n     ``where you can work hard and get recognized.''\n       Twenty years later, after jobs on several presidential \n     campaigns, on Capitol Hill, and most recently with the Obama \n     administration as special assistant to the president for \n     legislative affairs, Singiser is headed to Planned Parenthood \n     as vice president of public policy and government affairs.\n       ``It's been great, and you can never leave a White House \n     job without feeling incredibly bittersweet about it,'' \n     Singiser said. ``I feel like a mere mortal, and I can't keep \n     up these hours and this intensity forever.''\n       Not that Singiser is expecting an easy road ahead at \n     Planned Parenthood. She becomes the organization's chief \n     advocate and liaison to both state and national policymakers \n     as the group continues to come under attack as one of the \n     largest legal providers of abortion. The issue has become a \n     lightning rod over the past several months as Republican \n     lawmakers, GOP presidential candidates, and conservative \n     activists have called for federal defunding of Planned \n     Parenthood. Singiser said she hopes to help reframe the \n     conversation in her new role.\n       ``Those attacks are just misplaced,'' she said, pointing to \n     the range of primary-care services that Planned Parenthood \n     provides for men, women, and children. ``The result of those \n     sorts of efforts would be to erode women's health.''\n       Singiser has been well-prepared for the role, working in \n     both policy and politics for the past decade. After her stint \n     with the Clinton administration, Singiser got her law degree \n     from Georgetown University in December 1998 and practiced at \n     the Washington firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld for five \n     years, doing regulatory and lobbying work.\n       When the political bug bit her again, she went to work on \n     Howard Dean's short-lived presidential campaign before a \n     Senate job vacancy caught her eye. For three years, she was \n     staff director for the Senate Democratic Steering and \n     Outreach Committee under then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-\n     N.Y.\n       From there, Singiser went to work for Clinton's 2008 \n     presidential campaign, focusing on women's outreach. When \n     Clinton bowed out of the race and endorsed Barack Obama, her \n     former rival, Singiser got on a plane almost immediately for \n     Chicago to lend a hand to Obama's general-election effort.\n       She has been with the Obama administration since Day One, \n     becoming an expert on everything from financial reform to \n     health care as the president tackled an ambitious legislative \n     agenda in his first two years in office.\n       ``I'm really proud and honored to have served President \n     Obama for three years, but I'm really excited to go on to \n     this next chapter,'' she added.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7695-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7695-S7696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FOSSIL ENERGY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nfossil energy funding in the Energy and Water Appropriations bill.\n  Fossil energy is a critical resource that we should not and can not \njust throw away. Providing the majority of our energy, we need to use \nthese resources in a safe and responsible way. Harnessing domestic \nfossil energy could create jobs, lift up struggling communities, and \nprovide jobs for our strong and dedicated workforce.\n  I know there are people who remain very much opposed to funding \nfossil energy research who want to move away from fossil fuels as \nquickly as possible. But the fact of the matter is that, at this time, \nour Nation is not capable of quickly moving away from fossil fuels, \nwhich provides that majority of the energy we use. We need fossil \nenergy to help us move forward, and we should not pretend otherwise.\n  While I believe that our country will continue using fossil fuels for \nmany decades, it is my hope that we will also continually seek better \nways for using these resources.\n  We need to find more efficient ways of burning coal that emit fewer \npollutants and protect public health. We need to find more \nenvironmentally friendly ways to extract natural gas and oil. And we \nneed to find ways to design and build carbon capture and sequestration \nfacilities that will allow us to reduce the impacts of using fossil \nfuels on the climate.\n  This is the type of work that fossil energy research and development \ngoes towards, and work that I believe we must continue to support. \nWithout it, we are only putting our country at a disadvantage.\n  In Morgantown, WV, the National Energy Technology Laboratory or NETL \nis doing this work and pioneering fossil energy research and \ndevelopment activities that are lighting a pathway for a new era of \nenergy use that is critical to West Virginia and our nation.\n  Unfortunately, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill slashes \nfossil energy funding by 25 percent in just 1 year. In Fiscal Year 2011 \nthe overall fossil energy Budget was $586 million. The President only \nrequested $452.9 million for Fiscal Year 2012 and this bill only \ncontains $445.5 million.\n  In comparison, the overall Energy and Water bill cuts spending by \nless than 1 percent. The nuclear section of this bill cuts funding by \n20 percent and the renewable section of this bill remains flat--not \nfacing any cut this year.\n  I recognize that in this budgetary climate cuts may be inevitable to \nmany programs. But I firmly believe that in the Department of Energy \nbudget no one account can be asked to shoulder that burden alone. But \nif cuts must be made they should be done in fair and reasonable way, \nwhen compared to funding for other energy programs.\n  Unfortunately, the fossil energy cuts in this bill are neither fair \nnor reasonable. The cuts to fossil energy in this bill are \ndisproportionate compared to funding levels for other areas of \nresearch.\n  To correct this situation, I have introduced an amendment that would \nrestore $30 million to the fossil energy account, $10 million for \nnatural gas, $10 million for unconventional fossil fuels and $10 \nmillion for advanced energy systems in coal areas.\n  Again, I understand the budgetary times that we are facing in \nWashington. I understand that cuts have to be made. But what I strongly \ndisagree with is the idea that fossil energy must shoulder more than \nits fair share of cuts.\n  Therefore, I ask my colleagues to join with me to restore a portion \nof funding for the fossil energy program.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, last week, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee held a hearing on whether to elevate the Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This was an \nimportant hearing for the men and women of our armed services, and I am \ngrateful that the committee allowed me to submit a statement for the \nhearing record. In light of the upcoming National Defense Authorization \nAct, in which I expect these provisions to pass, I ask unanimous \nconsent that my statement be printed in the Record before the full \nSenate, so that the rest of my colleagues may have a chance to read it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Senate Committee on Armed Services\n\n       Chairman Levin, Senator McCain, Members of the Committee--\n     thank you for holding this hearing on whether the Chief of \n     the National Guard Bureau should be a member of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff. And thanks to all of the Chiefs of our armed \n     forces--both active duty and reserve--for being here today. \n     There is no question--as a matter of both principle and of \n     national security--that the Chief of the National Guard \n     Bureau should be elevated to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The \n     Guardians of Freedom Act, which passed overwhelmingly in the \n     House of Representatives on May 25, would accomplish this \n     goal. I hope that today's hearing will lead to swift action \n     on this important legislation, and I look forward to the \n     testimony of each of the witnesses.\n       It is important to acknowledge that the role of the \n     National Guard has evolved over the last ten years. Since 9/\n     11, National Guardsmen have mobilized more than 700,000 times \n     to support overseas and domestic missions. They have played \n     an essential role in the conflicts in both Afghanistan and \n     Iraq\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\n     and are a critical operational reserve for our armed forces. \n     Today's National Guard accounts for more than 460,000 service \n     members from every state in the Union--roughly 25 percent of \n     all of our 1.9 million-member force.\n       The Guard has also become an essential part of our nation's \n     response to both man-made and natural disasters. This August, \n     when Hurricane Irene slammed the East Coast, the National \n     Guard responded by calling up over 11,000 soldiers and airmen \n     from 24 states to coordinate the relief efforts. Our Guard is \n     being trained to respond to chemical, biological, nuclear and \n     radiological attacks. It is being trained to deal with \n     pandemics. It is asked to be the first on the scene after \n     major earthquakes, snowstorms, and hurricanes. These homeland \n     defense responsibilities will continue to increase, as well.\n       The National Guard also brings capabilities and \n     efficiencies to the table that we need in these tough \n     economic times. For example, the Air National Guard provides \n     35 percent of the total Air Force capability for seven \n     percent of the cost. And, the Army National Guard provides 40 \n     percent of the Army's capability for just 11 percent of the \n     Army budget. Together, 464,900 members of the National Guard \n     provide a capable, operational and affordable military \n     force--at just six percent of the Pentagon's annual budget.\n       The absence of the National Guard from the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff has very real consequences. Full membership of the \n     National Guard in the Joint Chiefs could have better prepared \n     the Marines' response to the 1992 riots in Los Angeles, our \n     nation's initial response to the 9/11 attacks, or our \n     response to Hurricane Katrina.\n       In October of 2005, the Government Accountability Office \n     called into question the Army National Guard's ability to \n     carry out its domestic mission. Then, just like now, there is \n     no permanent system in place to replenish necessary equipment \n     once it is removed from Guard units in individual states. \n     And, the Pentagon has required National Guard units to leave \n     behind critical equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan. A drastic \n     shortfall in equipment levels has led to a drop in mission \n     readiness. As a result, the Guard's ability to respond to \n     domestic emergencies has been severely inhibited. I find it \n     hard to believe this would be the case if the Guard had a \n     seat at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       With no seat at the table, the National Guard Chief must \n     rely solely on active duty military leaders to make funding \n     decisions. Under the circumstances, General McKinley can do \n     nothing to stop the Joint Chiefs if they put recommend \n     cutting a key program or ignore an opportunity to maintain \n     critical operational capability.\n       In many ways, the Guard has earned the right to be in the \n     room. Today, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau wears \n     four stars. He attends regular Joint Chiefs meetings. While I \n     understand that General McKinley enjoys a good relationship \n     with Chairman Dempsey, personalities can't be everything. \n     Now, it's time to give the National Guard a seat at the \n     table. We need to make sure the National Guard has the voice \n     it needs--not just to protect its capability, but because of \n     its increasingly active role in overseas operations, because \n     of its role in homeland security initiatives, and because of \n     the cost efficiencies it can offer in these turbulent \n     economic times.\n       Ultimately, I understand that change is hard. Some may \n     argue that these changes are not necessary. Some may argue \n     that the National Guard does not deserve a seat at the table, \n     that the National Guard is well-represented on the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, or that the National Guard has the resources \n     it needs.\n       Critics may say that elevating the National Guard would \n     provide a ``second voice'' to the Army and Air Force. That is \n     wrong. The National Guard's participation would be no \n     different than that of the Marine Corps, which is both part \n     of the Navy and has its own seat on the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff. Today, as we all know, the Commandant is a valued \n     member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and no one would argue \n     that his advice over the last 30 years has not been valuable.\n       Some may counter that elevating the National Guard could \n     muddy the Guard's dual commitments to member states and the \n     federal government. In reality, it would not alter lines of \n     authority, but better enable the Guard to provide unfiltered \n     advice on its capabilities and resources. The Guard wouldn't \n     just have its domestic responsibilities--it would have the \n     capabilities, clout, and access to do them better.\n       Critics may also say that the Chief of the National Guard \n     Bureau has no budgetary authority, but that argument is \n     misleading. The role of the Joint Chiefs is to provide sound, \n     useful advice to the President. In fact, the perspective of \n     the Chief of the National Guard Bureau could save our country \n     billions of dollars. Earlier this year, for example, the Air \n     National Guard Bureau offered a proposal that would have \n     saved up to $42 billion. Unfortunately, the Air Force \n     dismissed it almost immediately--likely, I've been told, for \n     turf reasons. That would not have happened had the Chief of \n     the National Guard Bureau been able to make his case, offer \n     his perspective, and share his expertise with our planners at \n     the Pentagon. The National Guard can help the Pentagon cut \n     costs without cutting capabilities--but only if it is an \n     equal partner in the decision-making process.\n       Some may argue that a seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     would give the National Guard too much influence at the \n     active-duty components' expense. But we know better than \n     that. Look at the size of the services' Congressional liaison \n     staff, the military fellows in our offices and the attaches \n     in the halls--or even the number of Senators, including many \n     on this Committee, who are former active-duty service \n     members. An enhanced role for the National Guard would not \n     diminish the active-duty services' clout among lawmakers.\n       Now is the time to give the National Guard the voice it \n     needs on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and to give the President \n     a broader perspective of the capabilities and resources at \n     his disposal. Now is the time to use all of the tools in our \n     arsenal to create a more secure homeland.\n       Mr. Chairman, Senator McCain, Members of the Committee--\n     thank you for holding this hearing. I look forward to swift \n     passage of the Guardians of Freedom Act. And thank you to my \n     good friend, Senator Leahy, for his leadership on this \n     important issue.\n       We have given the National Guard the right to be in the \n     room. Now, let's give them a seat at the table.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7696-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING CONTRIBUTIONS OF COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National \nCommunity Foundations Week. This week, we recognize the millions of \nAmericans who have joined together to make their communities a better \nplace through donations of their time and resources. The generosity and \nwillingness of individuals to work together for the common good has \nbeen a hallmark of the American character since our Nation's founding.\n  Every day volunteer organizations across the country make substantial \ncontributions to our Nation's well-being in countless areas--from \neducation and the arts to economic development and environmental \nprotection. Many of these associations are community foundations--local \ncharitable organizations formed to provide financial support to \nvaluable programs across their communities. Last year alone, community \nfoundations gave approximately $4 billion to various local nonprofit \nactivities.\n  Led by private citizens, community foundations provide effective \nsupport to communities across the United States, often supplementing \nboth public and private programs to provide their friends and neighbors \nwith the maximum level of support necessary to build strong and vibrant \ncommunities. With 700 community foundations across the Nation, they are \none of the fastest growing forms of philanthropy in the United States.\n  One such community foundation which exemplifies the virtues of \ncharity and giving back is the New York Community Trust. Established in \n1924, the New York Community Trust is one of the oldest and largest \ncommunity foundations in the Nation--providing $141 million in grants \nto community organizations in 2010 alone. The trust currently invests \nin various programs to build a better New York, such as helping to \nreemploy New Yorkers through the New York Alliance for Careers in \nHealth Care, NYACH, a project that assesses gaps in the labor market \nand provides workforce training to both assist individuals in getting \nin-demand jobs and simultaneously alleviate the skills gap in the \nhealth care industry. Through its commitment to the Juvenile Justice \nAdvocacy and Action Project, the New York Community Trust is also \ndedicated to finding alternatives to prison for nonviolent, delinquent \nyouth. The trust's grants are also cleaning up the Harlem River, \nremoving tens of thousands of pounds of debris from Swindler Cove and \ntransforming it into a 5-acre park with a children's garden and a \nboathouse.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing this \nweek of November 12 through November 18, 2011, as National Community \nFoundation Week so we may continue to honor the important work that \ncharity and private citizens play in making our Nation a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7696-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7696-S7697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      END UNNECESSARY MAILERS ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I firmly believe that members of the public \nmust have access to the information contained in annual consumer \nconfidence reports, which are required by the Safe Drinking Water Act's \nright-to-know provisions. For the past 11 years, the Environmental \nProtection Agency has required community water systems\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\nto provide customers with an annual report on the quality of their \ndrinking. Currently, large water systems, those serving 10,000 people \nor more, are required to mail copies of the entire report to every \ncustomer.\n  Today, believing wholeheartedly that public access to consumer \nconfidence reports is critical and must be maintained, I am \ncosponsoring Senator Toomey's bill, S. 1578. Under this bill, community \nwater systems would be required to send reports in the mail if a \nviolation of the maximum contaminant level occurs during the year. \nHowever, if there is no violation, water systems could post the reports \nonline and only mail hard copies upon request. I believe that S. 1578 \ndraws attention to an area in which our Federal policy might benefit \nfrom discussion, debate, and potential modernization. Since Internet \naccess has increased dramatically since 1999, the option of reviewing \nreports online is likely far more appealing to consumers than it once \nwas. Also, amendments to the current requirements have the potential to \nreduce paper waste and to reduce unnecessary administrative burden and \nexpense by providing customers with the ability to choose whether or \nnot to receive the report in the mail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7697-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE MONTFORD POINT MARINES\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the dedication \nand selfless service of the Montford Point Marines. The Montford Point \nMarines were the first African-American men to serve in the U.S. Marine \nCorps after President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. \n8802 on June 25, 1941. This brave group of men were trained at Camp \nMontford Point, near the New River in Jacksonville, NC. In total, \n19,168 African-American marines received training at Montford Point \nbetween 1942 and 1949. Many of these ``Montford Marines'' went on to \nserve in the Pacific Theatre Campaign of World War II--at Iwo Jima, \nSaipan, Okinawa--as well as in Korea and in Vietnam.\n  Although these men served our country with both honor and \ndistinction, they often faced adversity and racism during their time in \nuniform. Despite their training, they were prohibited from serving in \ncombat units--working instead in the service and supply units. They \nwere not afforded opportunities other marines enjoyed, such as entering \nnearby Camp Lejeune, without a White counterpart to escort them. The \ncourage and dedication with which these brave men served our country \ndespite these challenges is nothing less than heroic.\n  As the first African Americans in our Marine Corps, they join the \nTuskegee Airmen of the Air Force and the Buffalo Soldiers of the Army \nas heroes who not only forged a new path within our armed services but \nwho brought our country closer to our ideals that ``all men are created \nequal.'' Many Americans credit the historic firsts--such as Howard P. \nPerry of Charlotte, NC--who was the first African-American marine \nprivate to set foot on Montford Point, and Frederick C. Branch, the \nfirst African-American marine second lieutenant at the Marine Base in \nQuantico, VA--for creating the opportunity they have to serve today.\n  The time has come for us to give these American heroes their long \noverdue recognition by awarding them the Congressional Gold Medal, the \nhighest civilian award in the United States. I congratulate my \ncolleagues for unanimously passing this legislation on November 9, \n2011. It is my personal honor and privilege to recognize the Montford \nPoint Marines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7697-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING PAT TAKASUGI\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a great loss suffered \nby the people of Idaho and the Takasugi family in particular. Last \nweek, Idaho State Representative Pat Takasugi passed away after a 3-\nyear battle with cancer. During that fight he was fortunate to have the \nloving support of his wife Suzanne, his three children, and his \nparents.\n  When I was Governor, I had the great fortune to appoint Pat to my \ncabinet to serve as my director of the department of agriculture. Pat \nwas an unwearying advocate for agriculture. He understood what farmers \nfaced, since he was one of them. He started farming in 1977 and \nsuccessfully grew his business from 32 acres to a 1,500-acre operation.\n  Pat served as the director of the department of agriculture for 10 \nyears, and during that time he worked tirelessly in promoting the \nproducts grown in Idaho. In 2003, before the local food movement became \npopular, he instituted the Idaho Preferred brand to help consumers \nidentify locally grown products.\n  He had numerous accomplishments as director that moved Idaho's \nagricultural industry forward. He created the Idaho Food Quality \nAssurance Lab, established the Seed Indemnity Fund, pushed cooperative \nweed management, and streamlined regulations, among others.\n  Pat encouraged the next generation of farmers to be involved in \nvarious agricultural boards and commissions and to become leaders in \ntheir community. Pat walked his talk, as he was a member of numerous \nlocal and national organizations, including a term as president of the \nNational Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\n  His service continued when he decided to step down as the agriculture \ndirector and run for the Idaho House of Representatives. He was handily \nelected in 2008 and again in 2010, and he was a strong advocate for \nlower taxes and less government regulations.\n  For those of us who knew Pat, it was not hard to see why he was so \npopular. He had an infectious sense of humor, great optimism about \nlife, and truly cared about the well-being of others. It can be said \nthat his smalltown roots had something to do with that.\n  Pat grew up in the Wilder, ID, area and attended schools there before \ngraduating from Vallivue High School. He attended the local college, \nthe College of Idaho in Caldwell, which is an outstanding educational \ninstitution.\n  He volunteered for the U.S. Army after graduating and served a total \nof 10 years in Active and Reserve Duty. Pat was promoted to the rank of \ncaptain and qualified for Airborne wings, the Ranger tab, and Special \nForces Green Beret. Pat loved his country and was grateful for the \nopportunities he had to succeed through his own efforts and hard work.\n  Mr. President, while it is difficult to sum up all that Pat Takasugi \ndid for agriculture in Idaho and the many lives he touched through his \nservice, let me conclude by saying that he was a great American. Vicki \nand I extend our condolences on behalf of all Idahoans to Suzanne and \nall of the family for their loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7697-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7697-S7698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING GILBERT CALVIN STEINDORFF, JR.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

He was appointed as probate judge of \nButler County in 1975 and served in that role until his retirement in \n1995. Calvin had a fierce dedication to public service and was a member \nof many civic organizations.\n  A truly selfless individual, Calvin also served as secretary at The \nFirst Christian Church, where he was an elder, providing guidance for \nthose in his church community. For his career in public service and the \ninvaluable role that he played in the community, Calvin was named \nGreenville's ``Man of the Year.''\n  Calvin is loved and will be missed by his wife, Maxine Darby \nSteindorff, and his son, Gilbert C.

Mr. President, I rise to join my fellow \nColoradans, my colleagues in the United States Congress and others \nacross the country in celebration of Native American Heritage Month.\n  Throughout this month we acknowledge the many accomplishments and \ncontributions of the American Indian community in the United States. In \nColorado, from the windswept plains in the east to mountains and \nplateaus in the west, Native American history has formed a strong part \nof our shared history. Today Colorado's native communities play an \nequally strong role in preserving our shared cultural heritage.\n  Just this month, as the chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I held a hearing at Mesa \nVerde National Park that highlighted the importance of how this \ncultural landmark and others in the region can be better protected \nthrough cooperative efforts of our National Parks System and the \nregion's tribes. Improved collaboration and consultation can be a \npositive step in achieving the goal of protecting these invaluable \nresources. Tribes have also worked independently to conserve and \nprotect cultural resources that are important to our shared past. A \nstrong example of these efforts has taken shape over many years in \nSouthwestern Colorado where the Ute Mountain Ute tribe has worked to \nprotect acres of sacred and historically important sites that are \nconnected to the cultural resources that exist within Mesa Verde \nNational Park.\n  The Ute Mountain Ute Tribal Park, situated on the Ute Mountain \nreservation, serves not only as a means to protect important resources, \nbut also as a means to educate and develop an economic base for the \ntribe and the region as a whole. Also in Southwestern Colorado, the \nSouthern Ute Indian Tribe has worked to protect important cultural \nresources. Just this year, the tribe opened a state-of-the-art cultural \ncenter that is dedicated to telling the story of the Ute people, \nproviding another cultural draw to Southwestern Colorado.\n  These are examples of how shared goals of cultural preservation can \nwork symbiotically, and I believe that through close collaboration, the \nfederal government and tribes throughout the country can better protect \ncultural resources while developing other opportunities in economic \ndevelopment and education.\n  This relationship will be crucial in creating new jobs both on and \noff tribal lands while building opportunities for the next generation. \nFor example, the Ute Mountain Ute and the Southern Ute are among the \nregion's largest employers, each employing more than 1,000 workers and \ngenerating millions of dollars in economic activity that benefit the \nentire Southwest region of Colorado. Their success is a reminder that \nIndian Country is a strong economic driver that can play a critical \nrole in our economic recovery.\n  Of course respect for government-to-government relations between \ntribes and the federal government extends to other issues. As we \ncelebrate Native American Heritage month, we must remind ourselves of \nthis relationship and the trust responsibility that exists between our \nFederal government and tribal nations. This is especially important \nwhen addressing issues that have hit the Indian country especially \nhard, such as unemployment, access to health care, education and \nhousing, reliable law enforcement and access to justice. The federal \ngovernment's trust responsibility is a call to work together to address \nthese issues. Upholding this responsibility is vital to respecting \ntribal sovereignty and protecting tribes' ability to determine what is \nin the best interest of their communities. Cooperation and \ncollaboration are paramount in maintaining a strong government-to-\ngovernment relationship, and it is in our shared interest to advance \nthe goal of empowering America's Native communities.\n  Mr. President, to close, I want to highlight a prominent figure in \nColorado who we lost earlier this year named Ernest House, Sr. He was a \nstalwart defender of American Indian sovereignty and a champion of \ncultural preservation. Mr. House was a former Chairman of the Ute \nMountain Ute Tribe and he represented the tribe before national, state-\nwide, and private organizations for more than 50 years. Chairman \nHouse's passing was a great loss for the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Indian \nCountry and for Colorado. I would like to recognize his contributions \nas part of Native American Heritage Month. I have no doubt that his \nlegacy will be a strong part of our lives in Colorado and my thoughts \ncontinue to be with his family.\n  I am proud to join my fellow Coloradans in celebration of Native \nAmerican Heritage Month.

CARPENTER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to \npay tribute to Major General Raymond W. Carpenter and his faithful \nservice to our country. After 44 years of service to our Nation and the \nState of South Dakota, General Carpenter will soon retire from the \nUnited States Army.\n  Gen. Carpenter began his military service in 1967 when he enlisted in \nthe South Dakota Army National Guard. General Carpenter later joined \nthe United States Navy and put his photographic memory to work learning \nthe Vietnamese language in preparation for his assignment at the Naval \nSupport Activity in Danang, South Vietnam. Upon completion of his Naval \nservice, he returned to the South Dakota Army National Guard where he \nwas commissioned in 1974. He has commanded at all levels, from \nLieutenant to Colonel.\n  General Carpenter is an engineer by formal training, tirelessly \ndevising, planning and building. He was a founding member of the \nDirector of the Army National Guard's Engineer Advisory Team and went \non to be the chairman until May 2006. Engineering and organizational \nskills aside, General Carpenter is most passionate about soldiers: the \nNation's sons and daughters who are in his care. I have seen this \nfirsthand and have also witnessed his dedication to our Nation's \nveterans as he assisted me in awarding Korean War medals to veterans in \nSouth Dakota.\n  For the past 2\\1/2\\ years, Gen. Carpenter has ably served as the \nActing Director, Army National Guard. In this capacity, he has led more \nthan 350,000 National Guard soldiers from the 54 states, territories \nand the District of Columbia. As Chairman of the Military Construction \nand VA Appropriations Subcommittee, I have worked with Gen. Carpenter \nto fund important National Guard construction projects, and I was proud \nto have him testify before my subcommittee. He has represented our home \nState well and has been a tireless advocate for the members of the Army \nNational Guard. He is truly a soldier's soldier. On occasion, when Big \nArmy concocted some sort of short-sighted plan, there was Gen. \nCarpenter ``standing like a stone wall'' to look out for the interest \nof his soldiers and his country.\n  For his efforts, General Carpenter has received numerous awards and\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\ndecorations at every phase of his stellar career, including Legions of \nMerits, Meritorious Service Medals, the Vietnam Service Medal, Army \nCommendation Medals, Army Achievement Medals, Army Reserve Components \nAchievement Medals, and the National Defense Service Medals, among many \nothers.\n  Today I join my fellow Americans and stand with proud South Dakotans \nin congratulating Gen. Carpenter on an impressive military career. In \n2011 our Nation is most assuredly safer, stronger, and more secure \nbecause of this dedicated soldier, gifted engineer, and superb leader. \nI am grateful for Gen. Carpenter's service to our country, and to his \nwife, Mary, for her tireless support of her husband and his mission. \nAfter years of dedicated service, I wish Major General Carpenter a \nrelaxing retirement, filled with many joyful hours on his \nHarley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7699-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7699-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7699-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO EXTENDING THE PERIOD OF PRODUCTION OF THE NAVAL \n PETROLEUM RESERVES FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS FROM APRIL 5, 2012--PM \n                                   34\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 7422(c)(2) of title 10, United States Code, I \nam informing you of my decision to extend the period of production of \nthe Naval Petroleum Reserves for a period of 3 years from April 5, \n2012, the expiration date of the currently authorized period of \nproduction.\n  Attached is a copy of the report investigating continued production \nof the Reserves, consistent with section 7422(c)(2)(B) of title 10.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``School Access to Emergency \n     Epinephrine Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to research funded by the Food Allergy \n     Initiative and conducted by Northwestern University and \n     Children's Memorial Hospital, nearly 6,000,000 children in \n     the United States have food allergies.\n       (2) Anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, is a systemic \n     allergic reaction that can kill within minutes.\n       (3) More than 15 percent of school-aged children with food \n     allergies have had an allergic reaction in school.\n       (4) Teenagers and young adults with food allergies are at \n     the highest risk of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis.\n       (5) Individuals with food allergies who also have asthma \n     may be at increased risk for severe or fatal food allergy \n     reactions.\n       (6) Studies have shown that 25 percent of epinephrine \n     administrations in schools involve individuals with a \n     previously unknown allergy.\n       (7) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \n     Diseases (``NIAID'') has reported that delays in the \n     administration of epinephrine to patients in anaphylaxis can \n     result in rapid decline and death. NIAID recommends that \n     epinephrine be given promptly to treat anaphylaxis.\n       (8) Physicians can provide standing orders to furnish a \n     school with epinephrine for injection, and several States \n     have passed laws to authorize this practice.\n       (9) The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology \n     recommends that epinephrine injectors should be included in \n     all emergency medical treatment kits in schools.\n       (10) The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that an \n     anaphylaxis kit should be kept with medications in each \n     school and made available to trained staff for administration \n     in an emergency.\n       (11) According to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, \n     there are no contraindications to the use of epinephrine for \n     a life-threatening reaction.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to prevent trafficking in counterfeit drugs; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, few things are more important to consumer \nwell being than ensuring the safety of our pharmaceutical supply chain. \nYet today, the penalties for counterfeit drug offenses are outdated and \ninsufficient to deter this epidemic problem. As a result, counterfeit \nmedicines reportedly lead to 100,000 deaths globally each year, with \nupwards of 90 percent of drug sales estimated to be counterfeit.\n  Similarly, few things are more important to the American economy and \nlong-term job creation than protecting our companies' intellectual \nproperty. Yet businesses manufacturing and selling counterfeit drugs \nreportedly generate more than $75 billion in annual revenue. This means \nlost profits for American businesses and lost jobs for American \nworkers. Such staggering numbers would be unacceptable in any economic \nclimate, and they are devastating today.\n  Combating the sale of counterfeit drugs is increasingly difficult. \nWhether it is the prevalence of Internet pharmacies, or the new and \nsophisticated methods of manufacturing, packaging and distributing \ncounterfeit drugs, the obstacles to safeguarding the pharmaceutical \nsupply chain in today's economy are many. As a result, large \ncounterfeit drug enterprises are being funded on the backs of \nconsumers, both in Vermont and around the country, whose health and \nsafety are at stake.\n  Under current law, it is illegal to introduce counterfeit drugs into \ninterstate commerce, but the penalties are no different than those \nassessed for trafficking other counterfeit products, such as handbags \nor sneakers. While the manufacture and sale of any counterfeit product \nis a serious crime, counterfeit medication poses a grave danger to \npublic health that warrants a harsher punishment. Legislation is needed \nto raise counterfeit drug penalties to a level commensurate with the \nseverity of the offense in order to deter an epidemic problem.\n  Today, I am introducing the bipartisan Counterfeit Drug Penalty \nEnhancement Act, which will raise the maximum penalties for counterfeit \ndrug offenses, and direct the United States Sentencing Commission to \nconsider amending its guidelines and policy statements to reflect the \nserious nature of these crimes.\n  This legislation will protect the safety of American consumers, and \nthe investment that American pharmaceutical companies make in \ndeveloping the quality medicines that lead to reputable brands. \nEnsuring patient safety and combating intellectual property theft are \nnot uniquely Democratic or Republican priorities, these are bipartisan \npriorities, and I hope that we can quickly take up and consider this \nmuch needed legislation.\n  We should not expect that enactment of this or any legislation will \ncompletely deter this serious problem. But this bill is an important \nstep towards countering a problem that harms American consumers, \nAmerican businesses, and American jobs.\n  I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Bennet for working with me on \nthis legislation, and I look forward to working with all Senators to \npass this important, bipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1886\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the housing rights of victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, nobody should have to choose between \nsafety and shelter. Yet 48 percent of homeless women in Minnesota \npreviously had stayed in abusive situations because they did not have \nsafe housing options available to them. Twenty-nine percent of homeless \nadult women in my State are fleeing domestic violence, and more than \nhalf of those women are living with children. That simply is not \nacceptable.\n  This problem is not unique to Minnesota. Far from it. National \nstudies establish an undeniable link between homelessness and domestic \nand sexual violence. By one account, two in five women who experience \ndomestic violence will become homeless at some point in their lives.\n  Not surprisingly, once a woman becomes homeless, she becomes \nvulnerable to further violence and exploitation. In fact, nine in ten \nhomeless women have experienced severe physical or sexual abuse. During \na hearing last week, the Executive Director of the Minnesota Indian \nWomen's Resource Center explained that perpetrators of sexual violence \noften prey on homeless women.\n  Of course, we all know that this problem is not about statistics. It \nis about the real people with real stories who are behind the numbers. \nIt is about the woman in California who was evicted for ``causing a \nnuisance'' after the police responded to an incident of domestic \nviolence in her Low Income Housing Tax Credit unit--where she was the \nvictim.\n  It is about the mother of five in Florida who received a termination \nnotice after her ex-husband broke down her door and assaulted her. It \nis about the 83-year-old woman in Minnesota who was threatened with \neviction from her Section 202 housing unit because of disturbances \ncaused by her abuser.\n  Though the link between homelessness and domestic and sexual violence \nis undeniable, it is not unbreakable. Advocates across the country work \ntirelessly to ensure that victims of domestic and sexual violence have \nthe shelter and support they need. Local law enforcement officials and \nprosecutors are dedicated to ending the cycle of abuse and \nhomelessness. Property owners, too, often work with victims, advocates, \nand local authorities to find solutions to the problem.\n  Here in Congress, we have made efforts to break the link between \ndomestic and sexual violence and homelessness as well. The 2005 \nViolence Against Women Act included important protections that made it \nunlawful to deny someone housing assistance under certain federal \nprorams just because the individual is a victim of domestic violence, \ndating violence, or stalking. From conversations with experts in \nMinnesota, I know that those protections have been invaluable.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is now up for reauthorization. That \noccasion provides us an opportunity to build on the successes of the \n2005 bill and to address its shortcomings. That is why today I have \nintroduced the Housing Rights for Victims of Domestic and Sexual \nViolence Act. This bill is for every woman who has hesitated to call \nthe police to enforce a protective order because she was afraid that \nshe would be evicted if she did so. The bill rests on the simple \npremise that a woman should not lose her home just because she is a \nvictim of domestic or sexual violence.\n  The Violence Against Women Act currently protects tenants of only two \nfederal housing programs--those provided under Sections 6 and 8 of the \nU.S. Housing Act of 1937. These protections were an important first \nstep. But we can do better. A woman's rights should not depend on the \ntype of housing assistance she receives.\n  So my bill extends VAWA's housing protections to the Low Income \nHousing Tax Credit program, the Rural Housing Services program, the \nHousing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program, the Section 811 \nSupportive Housing Program for persons with disabilities, and five \nadditional Federal housing programs. The Congressional Research Service \nestimates that the bill will cover more than 4 million housing units \nthat are not included in existing law.\n  In addition, current law fails to secure housing rights for victims \nof sexual assault. My bill fixes that problem. It makes it unlawful to \ndeny a woman federally assisted housing just because she is a victim of \nsexual assault. As the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence \nexplains, too many victims become homeless as a result of sexual \nassault, and, once homeless, they are further to sexual victimization. \nMy bill recognizes that victims of sexual assault require safe housing \njust as do victims of domestic violence, dating violence, and \nstalking--groups that already are covered by existing law.\n  My bill also takes an important new step toward ensuring that victims \nof domestic and sexual violence do not end up on the streets. It \nrequires managers of federally supported housing units to adopt \nemergency transfer policies for women who would be in imminent danger \nwere they to stay in their current homes. Under these policies, a \nvictim of domestic or sexual violence could move to safe, federally \nsubsidized housing unit instead of staying in harm's way.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation with Senator Collins and \nSenator Mikulski, both of whom are true champions of women's rights. \nBoth are advocates for victims of domestic and sexual vio1ence. In \n2005, both cosponsored the Violenc Against Women Act reauthorization \nbill. They were leaders in this area then, and they have stepped \nforward to lead again today. I thank them for their help.\n  The Housing Rights for Victims of Domestic and Sexual Violence Act is \npreventive, proven, and precedented.\n  It is preventive because it will keep women and children in their \nhomes at a time when they are vulnerable--when they need a roof over \ntheir heads the most. It is no secret that shelters and transitional \nhousing programs are overextended. This legislation addresses a \nvictim's housing needs before she becomes homeless and requires those \nservices.\n  The protections contained in the bill are proven. Advocacy groups \nfrom Minnesota and throughout the country--the people most familiar \nwith the problem--have weighed in on this bill. It already has been \nendorsed by 23 organizations, including the National Network to End \nDomestic Violence, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the \nNational Women's Law Center, the National Housing Law Project, and the \nNational Low Income Housing Coalition.\n  The bill is unprecedented, too. We are not reinventing the wheel \nhere. The bill builds upon housing protections that were incduded in \nthe 2005 VAWA reauthorization bill, which passed the Senate with \nunanimous consent and was signed into law by President George W. Bush. \nThough many say the political climate here in Washington has changed \nfor the worse in the years since then, I am hopeful that the goals \nunderlying VAWA once again will transcend partisanship.\n  We have worked together to address the unique housing needs facing \ndomestic and sexual violence victims in the past. We need to do so \nagain today.\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1892\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles 5, 10, and 32, United States Code, to \neliminate inequities in the treatment of National Guard technicians, to \nreduce the eligibility age for retirement for non-Regular service, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the National Guard \nTechnician Equity Act to correct inconsistencies in the dual-status \ntechnician program.\n  Over 48,000 National Guard dual-status technicians serve our Nation. \nThey are a distinct group of workers, as civilians, they work for the \nreserve components, performing administrative duties, providing \ntraining, and maintaining and repairing equipment. However, as a \ncondition of their civilian position, they are also required to \nmaintain military status, attending weekend drills and annual training, \ndeploying to Iraq and Afghanistan, and responding to domestic disasters \nand emergencies, thereby creating their ``dual-status.''\n  Because of their unique position, dual-status technicians are caught \nbetween the provisions that govern the federal civilian workforce and \nthe military in numerous ways. First, under existing law, a dual-status \ntechnician who is no longer fit for military duty must be fired from \ntheir technician position, even if they are still fully capable of \nperforming their civilian duties. This bill would give technicians the \noption of remaining in their civilian position if they have 20 years of \nservice as\n\n[[Page S7709]]\n\na dual-status technician. This way we will retain the experience and \nskills of these dedicated employees.\n  Second, dual-status technicians do not have the same appeal rights as \nmost other federal employees, including those civilians in other \nDepartment of Defense positions. Federal employees who are covered by a \ncollective bargaining agreement have the right to file a grievance and \nproceed to arbitration, or file a case with the Merit Systems \nProtection Board, MSPB, a neutral Federal agency. Dual-status \ntechnicians may appeal to the Adjutant General in their state, but not \nto any neutral third party. This bill would allow them to also appeal \nto the MSPB for grievances unrelated to their military service.\n  Third, most reserve component members are able to obtain health care \ncoverage through the TRICARE Reserve Select program. However, dual-\nstatus technicians are ineligible, despite their mandatory military \nstatus and reserve service, because they can participate in the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Program, FEHBP. FEHBP plans can be more \nexpensive than TRICARE Reserve Select, thereby adding costs and \nlimiting health care options for these Guard technicians. My \nlegislation simply calls for the Department of Defense to study the \nfeasibility of converting the coverage for National Guard dual-status \ntechnicians from FEHBP to TRICARE Reserve Select.\n  The National Guard Technician Equity Act also corrects other \ninconsistencies by providing greater civilian and military retirement \nparity, providing eligibility to retain certain military bonuses and \nbenefits, and increasing leave time for required military training.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and cosponsor the National Guard \nTechnician Equity Act. I will also be working to include provisions of \nthis bill in the National Defense Authorization Act, which the Senate \nhas begun to consider, and I hope my colleagues can work together on \nthis effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1893\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to deter terrorism, provide justice for victims, and \nfor other purposes, to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Justice \nAgainst Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. JASTA is a bipartisan \neffort to make modest changes to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, \nor FSIA, and the Anti-Terrorism Act, or ATA, in order to ensure that \nthe victims of terrorism in the United States can hold the foreign \nsponsors of that terrorism to account in American courts.\n  I am especially proud to be introducing this measure with such a \nbipartisan and diverse group of Judiciary Committee colleagues: Myself \nand Senator Whitehouse on the Democratic side, and Senators Graham, \nHatch, Kyl, and Cornyn on the Republican side.\n  This legislation has become necessary due to flawed court decisions \nthat have deprived the victims of terrorism on American soil, including \nthose injured by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, of their \nday in court. Unfortunately, and contrary to the clear intent of \nCongress, some courts have concluded that Americans who were injured \ndue to terrorist attacks in the United States have no recourse against \nthe foreign states that sponsor those attacks. This conclusion is \ncontrary to the plain language of the FSIA and ATA, and it is bad \npolicy.\n  Let me explain the legal background. Originally passed in 1976, the \nFSIA abrogates the sovereign immunity of foreign countries and permits \nsuit against them in Federal court when, among other things, a foreign \ncountry or its instrumentalities commit a tort that results in injury \non our soil, this is known as the ``tort exception'' to the FSIA. In \naddition, the ATA authorizes suit in Federal court by any U.S. national \ninjured ``by reason of an act of international terrorism'' and permits \nthe recovery of damages in U.S. courts.\n  Thus, taken together, the FSIA and ATA were designed to enable \nterrorism victims to bring suit against foreign states and terror \nsponsors when they support terrorism against the United States. I am \nintroducing this bill because I want the survivors of the 9/11 tragedy \nto have their day in court--and they were deprived of this by a court \nruling that contorted the language and purpose of the FSIA and the ATA. \nAs we all know, nearly 3,000 innocent victims died that day, and the \nNation suffered $10 billion in property and other commercial damage \nalone--all at the hands of al-Qaeda and its funders.\n  In 2002, these plaintiffs sued, among other defendants, the Kingdom \nof Saudi Arabia, several Saudi officials, and a purported charity under \nthe control of the Kingdom known as the Saudi High Commission for \nRelief of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Substantial evidence establishes that \nthese defendants had provided funding and sponsorship to al-Qaeda \nwithout which it could not have carried out the attacks.\n  But the Second Circuit threw out this case, based on two flawed \nconclusions. First, the court ruled that the tort exception to the FSIA \ndid not apply, and barred their case because the Saudi entities and \nindividuals were not on the State Department's list. Second, the court \nruled that there was no personal jurisdiction over the Saudis because \nwhile they certainly could ``foresee'' that their support would lead to \nterrorist acts, they did not ``direct'' the terrorist acts. There is \nanother reason that I am introducing this bill. I am introducing this \nbill because we need to cut off the flow of money to terrorists by \nshutting down the reservoir--not just turning off the faucet. We need \nto use every tool at our disposal to hit terrorism at its very root, \nincluding the United States Federal courts.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. This focus on terrorist \nfinancing channels has been a major national security priority since \nthe September 11 attacks. As the Treasury Department's former Under \nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence has observed, ``the \nterrorist operative who is willing to strap on a suicide belt is not \nsusceptible to deterrence, but the individual donor who wants to \nsupport violent jihad may well be,'' Testimony of Stuart Levey, Under \nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, before the Senate \nCommittee on Finance, April 1, 2008.\n  It should be clear that the public interest is served when American \ncitizens have the right to seek compensation for their injuries and \nthat this right serves a dual purpose of deterring bad conduct. Yet we \nare here today introducing this bill, JASTA, because the courts have \nmisconstrued our statutes.\n  Before closing, let me address one concern I have heard that deserves \na response. There are those who worry that restoring Americans' right \nto bring these suits will interfere with our foreign affairs. I simply \ndo not think that is the case. First of all, if Americans have been \ninjured in the United States by foreign terrorism, they have the right \nto seek redress. But it is also important to remember that this law \ndoes not prevent the Executive Branch from espousing claims brought by \nAmericans against foreign states and settling them through an executive \nagreement. This is an executive authority that has been recognized and \nutilized going back to the administration of George Washington, and \nnothing in JASTA interferes with it. Nothing in this act would \ninterfere with the execution of our foreign policy.\n  To conclude, JASTA will restore the rights of the victims of \nterrorism and deter international terrorist financing, and it will have \nthe related benefit of enabling the victims of the September 11 Attacks \nto proceed with their case, as Congress had intended. It does so \nwithout in any way threatening sensitive National security or \ndiplomatic priorities of the nation. In fact, it makes the Nation \nstronger.\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support these modest, but critical, \namendments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY:\n  S. 1897. A bill to amend Public Law 101-377 to revise the boundaries \nof the Gettysburg National Military Park to include the Gettysburg \nTrain Station, and for other purposes, to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, this Saturday, November 19, marks the 148 \nAnniversary of the Gettysburg Address. In this address, President \nAbraham Lincoln famously said, ``The world will little note nor long \nremember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. \nIt is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished \nwork which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is \nrather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before \nus--that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that \ncause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we \nhere highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that \nthis nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that \ngovernment of the people, by the people, for the people shall not \nperish from the earth.''\n  In advance of this important historic occasion, I am introducing the \nGettysburg National Military Park Expansion Act. If enacted, this \nlegislation would expand the boundaries of Gettysburg National Military \nPark to include the historic Gettysburg Railroad Station and an \nadditional 45 acres of land at the southern end of the battlefield. \nThrough these acquisitions, the between 1.5 to 3 million people that \nvisit Gettysburg each year will enjoy a more complete experience. \nPassage of this legislation is very important, especially right now as \nthe Park prepares for the 150 Anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg.\n  The Gettysburg Railroad Station, which is also known as the Lincoln \nTrain Station, is located in downtown Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It was \nbuilt in 1858 and is listed in the National Register of Historic \nPlaces. During the Battle of Gettysburg, the building served as a train \nstation to transport thousands of troops and also as a hospital. \nPerhaps more important historically, this station was the site to which \nPresident Lincoln arrived on the day before he delivered the Gettysburg \nAddress in 1863. This station is currently operated by the National \nTrust for Historic Gettysburg and is open to the public year round. It \nalso serves as the home to the Pennsylvania Abraham Lincoln \nBicentennial Commission, which organized and held events in 2009 to \ncommemorate the 200th anniversary of Lincoln's birth. The station was \nrenovated in 2006 using state grant money to serve as an information \nand orientation center, but currently does not serve as such because of \na lack of funds to manage its day-to-day operations. The Gettysburg \nBorough Council voted in 2008 to transfer the station to the National \nPark Service so that it could be used as a visitor center for tourists \ncoming to the Gettysburg area.\n  The Gettysburg National Military Park Expansion Act would also expand \nthe boundary of the Gettysburg National Military Park to include 45 \nacres of land at the southern end of the battlefield. This area is both \nhistorically and environmentally significant. It was where cavalry \nskirmishes during the Battle for Gettysburg occurred and is also home \nto wetlands and wildlife habitat related to the Plum Run stream that \nruns through the National Park. The forty five acres were donated in \nApril of 2009 and as a result no federal funding or land acquisition \nwould be required to obtain the property and incorporate it into the \nNational Park.\n  The Gettysburg National Military Park Expansion Act would help \npreserve different sites that are historically significant while \nprotecting the environment. The Civil War was a monumental moment in \nour Nation's history and because of this we must take steps to preserve \nthe area's historical sites.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KIRK (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1902. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study of the archeological site and surrounding land \nof the New Philadelphia town site in the State of Illinois, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nDurbin to introduce a bill in support of New Philadelphia, the first \ntown founded by a freed African-American. This bipartisan legislation \nwould initiate a feasibility study in order to determine whether or not \nthis area should be designated as a unit of the National Park System.\n  The town of New Philadelphia, Illinois, established in 1836, became \nthe first known town platted and officially registered by an African-\nAmerican prior to the Civil War. New Philadelphia became a place where \nEuropean Americans, free-born African-Americans, and formerly enslaved \nindividuals could live together in community during a time of intense \nracial strife that transpired before, during, and after the Civil War.\n  Frank McWorter, the founder of New Philadelphia and a former slave \nhimself, saved money from neighboring labor jobs to purchase his own \nfreedom and the freedom of fifteen other family members. Subsequently, \nMr. McWorter purchased a sparse plot of land between the Illinois and \nMississippi Rivers in Pike County, Illinois to establish the town of \nNew Philadelphia, which also became a station along the Underground \nRailroad.\n  In 2005, the town of New Philadelphia is designated a National \nHistoric Place and more recently, it was designated a National Historic \nLandmark in 2009. Being designated a unit of the National Park System \nwill preserve the historical significance of New Philadelphia and allow \nits legacy to continue to inspire current and future generations to \nunderstand the struggle for freedom and opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 333\n\n       Whereas the United States and Japan have enjoyed a \n     productive and successful peace for over six decades, which \n     has nurtured a strong and critical alliance and deep economic \n     ties that are vitally important to both countries, the Asia-\n     Pacific region, and the world;\n       Whereas the United States-Japan alliance is based on shared \n     interests, responsibilities, and values and the common \n     support for political and economic freedoms, human rights, \n     and international law;\n       Whereas the United States-Japan alliance has been \n     maintained by the contributions and sacrifices of members of \n     the United States Armed Forces dedicated to Japan's defense \n     and democracy;\n       Whereas, from December 7, 1941, to August 15, 1945, the \n     Pacific War caused profound damage and suffering to \n     combatants and noncombatants alike;\n       Whereas, among those who suffered and sacrificed greatly \n     were the men and women of the United States Armed Forces who \n     were captured by Imperial Japanese forces during the Pacific \n     War;\n       Whereas many United States prisoners of war were subject to \n     brutal and inhumane conditions and forced labor;\n       Whereas, according to the Congressional Research Service, \n     an estimated 27,000 United States prisoners of war were held \n     by Imperial Japanese forces and nearly 40 percent perished;\n       Whereas the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor and \n     its subsequent Descendants Group have worked tirelessly to \n     represent the thousands of United States veterans who were \n     held by Imperial Japanese forces as prisoners of war during \n     the Pacific War;\n       Whereas, on May 30, 2009, an official apology from the \n     Government of Japan was delivered by Japan's Ambassador to \n     the United States Ichiro Fujisaki to the last convention of \n     the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor stating, \n     ``Today, I would like to convey to you the position of the \n     government of Japan on this issue. As former Prime Ministers \n     of Japan have repeatedly stated, the Japanese people should \n     bear in mind that we must look into the past and to learn \n     from the lessons of history. We extend a heartfelt apology \n     for our country having caused tremendous damage and suffering \n     to many people, including prisoners of wars, those who have \n     undergone tragic experiences in the Bataan Peninsula, \n     Corregidor Island, in the Philippines, and other places.'';\n       Whereas, in 2010, the Government of Japan through its \n     Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established a new program of \n     remembrance and understanding that, for the first time, \n     includes United States former prisoners of war and their \n     family members or other caregivers by inviting them to Japan \n     for exchange and friendship;\n       Whereas six United States former prisoners of war, each of \n     whom was accompanied by a family member, and two descendants \n     of prisoners of war participated in Japan's first Japanese/\n     American POW Friendship Program from September 12, 2010, to \n     September 19, 2010;\n       Whereas Japan's Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada on September \n     13, 2010, apologized to all United States former prisoners of \n     war on behalf of the Government of Japan stating, ``You have \n     all been through hardships during World War II, being taken \n     prisoner by the Japanese military, and suffered extremely \n     inhumane treatment. On behalf of the Japanese government and \n     as the foreign minister, I would like to offer you my \n     heartfelt apology.'';\n       Whereas Foreign Minister Okada stated that he expects the \n     former prisoners of war exchanges with the people of Japan \n     will ``become a turning point in burying their bitter \n     feelings about the past and establishing a better \n     relationship between Japan and the United States'';\n       Whereas Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tetsuro \n     Fukuyama on September 13, 2010, apologized to United States \n     former prisoners of war for the ``immeasurable damage and \n     suffering'' they experienced;\n       Whereas the participants of the first Japanese/American POW \n     Friendship Program appreciated the generosity and hospitality \n     they received from the Government and people of Japan during \n     the Program and welcomed the apology offered by Foreign \n     Minister Okada and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Fukuyama;\n       Whereas the participants encourage the Government of Japan \n     to continue this program of visitation and friendship and \n     expand it to support projects for remembrance, documentation, \n     and education; and\n       Whereas the United States former prisoners of war of Japan \n     still await apologies and remembrance from the successor \n     firms of those private entities in Japan that, in violation \n     of the Third Geneva Convention and in unmerciful conditions, \n     used their labor for economic gain to sustain war production: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes and commends the Government of Japan for \n     extending an official apology to all United States former \n     prisoners of war from the Pacific War and establishing in \n     2010 a visitation program to Japan for surviving veterans, \n     their families, and descendants;\n       (2) appreciates the recent efforts by the Government of \n     Japan toward historic apologies for the maltreatment of \n     United States former prisoners of war;\n       (3) requests that the Government of Japan continue its new \n     Japanese/American POW Friendship Program of reconciliation \n     and remembrance and expand it to educate the public and its \n     school children about the history of prisoners of war in \n     Imperial Japan;\n       (4) requests that the Government of Japan respect the \n     wishes and sensibilities of the United States former \n     prisoners of war by supporting and encouraging programs for \n     lasting remembrance and reconciliation that recognize their \n     sacrifices, history, and forced labor;\n       (5) acknowledges the work of the Department of State in \n     advocating for the United States prisoners of war from the \n     Pacific War; and\n       (6) applauds the persistence, dedication, and patriotism of \n     the members and descendants of the American Defenders of \n     Bataan and Corregidor for their pursuit of justice and \n     lasting peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7712-3", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7712-S7716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1062.

MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING TRAINING FOR MILITARY \n                   CHAPLAINS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) A decade of deployments for the United States Armed \n     Forces has led to significant increases in traumatic stress \n     for members of the Armed Forces and their families.\n       (2) Increases in the severity and frequency of stress for \n     members of the Armed Forces and their families has driven up \n     demand for mental health counseling services by specially \n     trained counselors and military chaplains.\n       (3) The emotional needs, mental strain, and interpersonal \n     issues that arise among soldiers and their families before, \n     during, and after deployment are highly unique. It is \n     critical that military counselors and chaplains have a \n     specialized understanding of the total deployment experience.\n       (4) The military chaplain's corps for all military services \n     has experienced significant shortfalls in personnel. The Army \n     and Army National Guard have been especially affected by the \n     inability to field needed personnel.\n       (5) A muted ability to field qualified military health \n     counselors and chaplains has an adverse affect on the mental \n     and emotional health of members of the Armed Forces and their \n     families.\n       (6) The United States Army Chaplain Center and School, \n     United States Navy Chaplaincy School and Center, and other \n     military chaplaincy schools rely on accredited universities, \n     seminaries, and religious schools to produce qualified \n     counselors and chaplain candidates.\n       (7) It is important that accredited universities, \n     seminaries, and religious schools producing chaplain \n     candidates or providing post-graduate education and \n     supplemental training adequately prepare students with the \n     training required to address the needs of members of the \n     Armed Forces and their families.\n       (8) There is both opportunity and need for the Chaplain \n     Corps of the United States Armed Forces to work with \n     accredited universities, seminaries, and religious schools to \n     produce qualified counselors and chaplain candidates and \n     provide post-graduate education and supplemental training, \n     and to do so in a way that is cost effective.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense, in conjunction with the Chief \n     of Chaplains for each military service, should produce a plan \n     to ensure sustainable throughput of qualified chaplains in \n     the military chaplain centers and schools; and\n       (2) the plan should include integration of accredited \n     universities, seminaries, and religious schools to include \n     programmatic augmentation when efficient and fiscally \n     advantageous.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1096.

SENSE OF SENATE ON TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF \n                   THE ARMED FORCES AND VETERANS FOR TRAUMATIC \n                   BRAIN INJURY AND POST TRAUMATIC STRESS \n                   DISORDER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 1,400,000 Americans experience Traumatic \n     Brain Injury (TBI) each year, and an estimated 3,200,000 \n     Americans are living with long-term, severe disabilities as a \n     result of brain injury. Another approximate 360,000 men and \n     women are estimated to have been experienced a Traumatic \n     Brain Injury in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan to \n     date.\n       (2) Congressional funding for Traumatic Brain Injury \n     activities began with Public Law 104-166 (commonly referred \n     to as the ``Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 1996'') and has \n     subsequently been addressed in title XIII of Public Law 106-\n     310 (commonly referred to as the ``Traumatic Brain Injury Act \n     Amendments of 2000''), which mandated reports and \n     requirements for mild Traumatic Brain Injury, and in Acts \n     authorizing and appropriating funds for the Department of \n     Defense to date.\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\n       (3) In 1992 during the Persian Gulf War, Congress created \n     the Defense and Veterans Head Injury Program (DVHIP) to \n     integrate specialized Traumatic Brain Injury care, research, \n     and education across the military and veteran medical care \n     systems.\n       (4) With Congressional oversight and appropriations, the \n     Department of Defense subsequently transitioned the Defense \n     and Veterans Head Injury Program to the Defense and Veterans \n     Brain Injury Center (DVBIC) in order improve the military and \n     veterans medical communities ability to develop and provide \n     advanced Traumatic Brain Injury-specific evaluation, \n     treatment, and follow-up care for military personnel, their \n     beneficiaries, and veterans with mild to severe Traumatic \n     Brain Injury.\n       (5) Though Congress, the Department of Defense, and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs have increased the capacity to \n     provide health services, particularly in the areas of mental \n     health and Traumatic Brain Injury, gaps in access and quality \n     remain, to include a selected method for diagnosing a \n     Traumatic Brain Injury, a consistent process for treatment \n     for a Traumatic Brain Injury, availability of providers, \n     shortages of personnel, organizational deficiencies, cultural \n     understanding and acceptance, and available technology in \n     diagnosis and treatment.\n       (6) Gaps in quality of care and limited access to proper \n     care remain for both members of the Armed Forces and \n     veterans, especially veterans who are demobilized members of \n     the National Guard and Reserve.

The number of veterans receiving such compensation \n     for auditory impairment has risen each year since 2005, \n     increasing the number and cost of compensation claims paid by \n     the Secretary and prompting a series of reports on the \n     subject, include a January 2011 report by the Comptroller \n     General of the United States entitled ``Hearing Loss \n     Prevention: Improvements to DOD Hearing Conservation Programs \n     Could Lead to Better Outcomes''.\n       (3) Costs to the Department of Veterans Affairs relating to \n     compensation for hearing-related disabilities are expected to \n     double between 2009 and 2014, exceeding $2,000,000,000 by \n     2014.\n       (4) There is a growing body of peer reviewed literature \n     indicating a direct connection between traumatic brain \n     injury, post traumatic stress disorder, and auditory \n     disorders.\n       (5) 70 percent of members of the Armed Forces who are \n     exposed to a blast report auditory disorders within 72 hours \n     of the exposure.\n       (6) Section 721 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417; \n     122 Stat. 4506) requires the Secretary of Defense to \n     establish a center of excellence in the prevention, \n     diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, and rehabilitation of \n     hearing loss and auditory system injury.\n       (7) There is no cure for tinnitus, which consists of an \n     often debilitating ringing in the ear. The projected effect \n     of tinnitus on veterans, rise in new cases of tinnitus-\n     related service-connected disabilities among veterans, and \n     the correlating rise in disability claims and cost to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs make finding effective \n     treatment, abatement options, and a cure for tinnitus a \n     priority.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Secretary of Defense should, in cooperation with the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Director of the Hearing \n     Center of Excellence of the Department of Defense, implement \n     the recommendations of the Comptroller General of the United \n     States in the January 2011 report of the Comptroller General \n     entitled ``Hearing Loss Prevention: Improvements to DOD \n     Hearing Conservation Programs Could Lead to Better Outcomes'' \n     that address prevention, abatement, data collection, and the \n     need for a new interagency data sharing system so that \n     sufficient information is available to address and track \n     hearing injuries and loss.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1100.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY \n                   ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     historically set a target commitment for member states to \n     spend two percent of their gross domestic product on their \n     defense expenditures.\n       (2) In 2010, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     identified only 5 member states meeting this target for \n     defense expenditures, including the United States, Albania, \n     France, Greece, and the United Kingdom, leaving 23 member \n     states short of meeting the target.\n       (3) Secretary of Defense Robert Gates made the following \n     statement on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on \n     October 14, 2010, in a conversation with reporters: ``[m]y \n     worry is that the more our allies cut their capabilities, the \n     more people will look to the United States to cover whatever \n     gaps are created. . . And at a time when we're facing \n     stringencies of our own, that's a concern for me''.\n       (4) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in an interview \n     with the BBC on October 15, 2010, stated that ``NATO has been \n     the most successful alliance for defensive purposes in the \n     history of the world, I guess, but it has to be maintained. \n     Now each country has to be able to make its appropriate \n     contributions''.\n       (5) On March 30, 2011, Admiral James G. Stavridis stated in \n     a hearing before the Committee on Armed Services of the House \n     of Representatives that ``[w]e need to be emphatic with our \n     European allies that they should spend at least the minimum \n     NATO 2 percent''.\n       (6) In a speech delivered in Brussels on June 10, 2011, \n     Secretary of Defense Gates further stated that ``[i]n the \n     past, I've worried openly about NATO turning into a two-\n     tiered alliance: Between members who specialize in `soft' \n     humanitarian, development, peacekeeping, and talking tasks, \n     and those conducting the `hard' combat missions. Between \n     those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens \n     of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of \n     NATO membership - be they security guarantees or headquarters \n     billets - but don't want to share the risks and the costs. \n     This is no longer a hypothetical worry. We are there today. \n     And it is unacceptable''.\n       (7) In that same speech on June 10, 2011, Secretary of \n     Defense Gates added that ``I am the latest in a string of \n     U.S. defense secretaries who have urged allies privately and \n     publicly, often with exasperation, to meet agreed-upon NATO \n     benchmarks for defense spending. However, fiscal, political \n     and demographic realities make this unlikely to happen \n     anytime soon, as even military stalwarts like the U.K have \n     been forced to ratchet back with major cuts to force \n     structure. Today, just five of 28 allies - the U.S., U.K., \n     France, Greece, along with Albania - exceed the agreed 2% of \n     GDP spending on defense''.\n       (8) Secretary of Defense Gates also stated that ``[t]he \n     blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and \n     patience in the U.S. Congress - and in the American body \n     politic writ large - to expend increasingly precious funds on \n     behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the \n     necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be \n     serious and capable partners in their own defense. Nations \n     apparently willing and eager for American taxpayers to assume \n     the growing security burden left by reductions in European \n     defense budgets''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to commend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for \n     historically providing an extension to the United States \n     security capabilities; and\n       (2) to call upon the President--\n       (A) to engage each of the member states of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization in a dialogue about the long-\n     term health of the North Atlantic Alliance and strongly \n     encourage each of the member states to make a serious effort \n     to protect defense budgets from further reductions, better \n     allocate and coordinate the resources presently available, \n     and recommit to spending at least two percent of gross \n     domestic product on defense; and\n       (B) to examine and report to Congress on recommendations \n     that will lead to a stronger North Atlantic Alliance in terms \n     of military capability and readiness across the 28 member \n     states, with particular focus on the smaller member states.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1174.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TRANSITION OF MILITARY AND \n                   SECURITY OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) After al Qaeda attacked the United States on September \n     11, 2001, the United States Government rightly sought to \n     bring to justice those who attacked us, to eliminate al \n     Qaeda's safe havens and training camps in Afghanistan, and to \n     remove the terrorist-allied Taliban government.\n       (2) Members of the Armed Forces, intelligence personnel, \n     and diplomatic corps have skillfully achieved these \n     objectives, culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden.\n       (3) Operation Enduring Freedom is now the longest military \n     operation in United States history.\n       (4) United States national security experts, including \n     Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta, have noted that al \n     Qaeda's presence in Afghanistan has been greatly diminished.\n       (5) Over the past ten years, the mission of the United \n     States has evolved to include a prolonged nation-building \n     effort in Afghanistan, including the creation of a strong \n     central government, a national police force and army, and \n     effective civic institutions.\n       (6) Such nation-building efforts in Afghanistan are \n     undermined by corruption, high illiteracy, and a historic \n     aversion to a strong central government in that country.\n       (7) Members of the Armed Forces have served in Afghanistan \n     valiantly and with honor, and many have sacrificed their \n     lives and health in service to their country.\n       (8) The United States is now spending nearly \n     $10,000,000,000 per month in Afghanistan at a time when, in \n     the United States, there is high unemployment, a flood of \n     foreclosures, a record deficit, and a debt that is over \n     $15,000,000,000,000 and growing.\n       (9) The continued concentration of United States and NATO \n     military forces in one region, when terrorist forces are \n     located in many parts of the world, is not an efficient use \n     of resources.\n       (10) The battle against terrorism is best served by using \n     United States troops and resources in a counterterrorism \n     strategy against terrorist forces wherever they may locate \n     and train.\n       (11) The United States Government will continue to support \n     the development of Afghanistan with a strong diplomatic and \n     counterterrorism presence in the region.\n       (12) President Barack Obama is to be commended for \n     announcing in July 2011 that the United States would commence \n     the redeployment of members of the United States Armed Forces \n     from Afghanistan in 2011 and transition security control to \n     the Government of Afghanistan.\n       (13) President Obama has established a goal of removing all \n     United States combat troops from Afghanistan by December \n     2014.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should expedite the transition of the \n     responsibility for military and security operations in \n     Afghanistan to the Government of Afghanistan;\n       (2) the President should devise a plan based on inputs from \n     military commanders, the\n\n[[Page S7758]]\n\n     diplomatic missions in the region, and appropriate members of \n     the Cabinet, along with the consultation of Congress, for \n     expediting the drawdown of United States combat troops in \n     Afghanistan and accelerating the transfer of security \n     authority to Afghan authorities prior to December 2014; and\n       (3) not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, the President should submit to Congress a plan \n     with a timetable and completion date for the accelerated \n     transition of all military and security operations in \n     Afghanistan to the Government of Afghanistan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1175.

Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Blumenthal) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 1867, to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2012 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle H of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1088. SALE OF F-16 AIRCRAFT TO TAIWAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense, in its 2011 report to \n     Congress on ``Military and Security Developments Involving \n     the People's Republic of China,'' found that ``China \n     continued modernizing its military in 2010, with a focus on \n     Taiwan contingencies, even as cross-Strait relations \n     improved. The PLA seeks the capability to deter Taiwan \n     independence and influence Taiwan to settle the dispute on \n     Beijing's terms. In pursuit of this objective, Beijing is \n     developing capabilities intended to deter, delay, or deny \n     possible U.S. support for the island in the event of \n     conflict. The balance of cross-Strait military forces and \n     capabilities continues to shift in the mainland's favor.'' In \n     this report, the Department of Defense also concludes that, \n     over the next decade, China's air force will remain primarily \n     focused on ``building the capabilities required to pose a \n     credible military threat to Taiwan and U.S. forces in East \n     Asia, deter Taiwan independence, or influence Taiwan to \n     settle the dispute on Beijing's terms''.\n       (2) The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) conducted a \n     preliminary assessment of the status and capabilities of \n     Taiwan's air force in an unclassified report, dated January \n     21, 2010. The DIA found that, ``[a]lthough Taiwan has nearly \n     400 combat aircraft in service, far fewer of these are \n     operationally capable.'' The report concluded, ``Many of \n     Taiwan's fighter aircraft are close to or beyond service \n     life, and many require extensive maintenance support. The \n     retirement of Mirage and F-5 aircraft will reduce the total \n     size of the Taiwan Air Force.''\n       (3) Since 2006, authorities from Taiwan have made repeated \n     requests to purchase 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     from the United States, in an effort to modernize the air \n     force of Taiwan and maintain its self-defense capability.\n       (4) According to a report by the Perryman Group, a private \n     economic research and analysis firm, the requested sale of F-\n     16C/Ds to Taiwan ``would generate some $8,700,000,000 in \n     output (gross product) and more than 87,664 person-years of \n     employment in the US,'' including 23,407 direct jobs, while \n     ``economic benefits would likely be realized in 44 states and \n     the District of Columbia''.\n       (5) The sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan would both sustain \n     existing high-skilled jobs in key United States manufacturing \n     sectors and create new ones.\n       (6) On August 1, 2011, a bipartisan group of 181 members of \n     the House of Representatives sent a letter to the President, \n     expressing support for the sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan. On May \n     26, 2011, a bipartisan group of 45 members of the Senate sent \n     a similar letter to the President, expressing support for the \n     sale. Two other members of the Senate wrote separately to the \n     President or the Secretary of State in 2011 and expressed \n     support for this sale.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a critical element to maintaining peace and stability \n     in Asia in the face of China's two-decade-long program of \n     military modernization and expansion of military capabilities \n     is ensuring a militarily strong and confident Taiwan;\n       (2) a Taiwan that is confident in its ability to deter \n     Chinese aggression will increase its ability to proceed in \n     developing peaceful relations with China in areas of mutual \n     interest;\n       (3) the cross-Strait military balance between China and our \n     longstanding strategic partner, Taiwan, has clearly shifted \n     in China's favor;\n       (4) China's military expansion poses a clear and present \n     danger to Taiwan, and this threat has very serious \n     implications for the ability of the United States to fulfill \n     its security obligations to allies in the region and protect \n     our vital United States national interests in East Asia;\n       (5) Taiwan's air force continues to deteriorate, and it \n     needs additional advanced multirole fighter aircraft in order \n     to modernize its fleet and maintain a sufficient self-defense \n     capability;\n       (6) the United States has a statutory obligation under the \n     Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) to provide \n     Taiwan the defense articles necessary to enable Taiwan to \n     maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities, in furtherance \n     of maintaining peace and stability in the western Pacific \n     region;\n       (7) in order to comply with the Taiwan Relations Act, the \n     United States must provide Taiwan with additional advanced \n     multirole fighter aircraft, as well as significant upgrades \n     to Taiwan's existing fleet of multirole fighter aircraft; and\n       (8) the proposed sale of F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     to Taiwan would have significant economic benefits to the \n     United States economy.\n       (c) Sale of Aircraft.--The President shall carry out the \n     sale of no fewer than 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     to Taiwan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1201 Mr. WEBB submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to \namendment SA 1072 submitted by Mr. Leahy (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nRockefeller, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \nBoozman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. \nBurr, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Coats, Mr. \nConrad, Mr. Coons, Mr. Corker, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Heller, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johanns, \nMr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Ms. Klobuchar, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Lee, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Manchin, Mrs. \nMcCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Moran, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Risch, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \nSchumer, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, Mr. Udall \nof Colorado, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \nToomey, and Mr. Kerry) to the bill S. 1867, to authorize appropriations \nfor fiscal year 2012 for military activities of the Department of \nDefense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the \nDepartment of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for \nsuch fiscal year, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on \nthe table; as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n                   TITLE XVI--NATIONAL GUARD MATTERS\n\n     SEC. 1601.

The study shall \n     encompass, but not necessarily be limited to, the following \n     considerations:\n       (1) The roles and functions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       (2) The roles and functions of the Army National Guard, the \n     Air National Guard, the Army National Guard of the United \n     States, and the Air National Guard of the United States.\n       (3) The roles and functions of the Chief of the National \n     Guard Bureau.\n       (4) The effects on the principle of civilian control of the \n     military and accountability in adding a member to the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff who is not subject to the oversight of a \n     single appointed and confirmed Secretary of a military \n     department.\n       (5) The precedent and potential long-term implications of \n     adding a member to the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is not the \n     chief of an Armed Force.\n       (6) The impact, if any, on the deliberations of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff of including a member who has been \n     recommended for appointment as the Chief of the National \n     Guard Bureau by the governor of a State.\n       (7) The effects on the principles of unity of command and \n     unity of effort for the Department of the Army and the \n     Department of the Air Force.\n       (8) The potential for confusing lines of authority and \n     representation under title 10, United States Code, already in \n     place for the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of \n     Staff of the Air Force in meeting their responsibilities as \n     members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       (9) The effects of altering the current statutory balance \n     for representation by each branch of the Armed Forces on the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff by altering their statutory \n     representation and the possible consequences for intra-\n     service and inter-service integration, progress toward more \n     effective\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\n     jointness, and efforts to improve interoperability.\n       (10) The findings and recommendations contained in the \n     reports issued by the Commission on the National Guard and \n     Reserves.\n       (11) The transition of the National Guard from a strategic \n     reserve force to an operational reserve force for the All-\n     Volunteer Force.\n       (12) Possible impacts on the other reserve components of \n     the Armed Forces, including perceptions regarding the Chief \n     of the National Guard Bureau having added responsibilities \n     assigned as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       (13) The extent to which the existing statutory role of the \n     Chief of the National Guard as advisor to the Secretary of \n     Defense is sufficient for all matters involving \n     nonfederalized National Guard forces.\n       (14) The qualifications of the Chief of the National Guard \n     Bureau to provide requisite insight into all levels of \n     strategic planning as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     and the risk of diluting understanding in the Armed Forces of \n     the principle of supporting and supported command \n     relationships.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the study \n     required by subsection (a). The report shall set forth the \n     results of the study, including the matters specified in \n     subsection (b), and include such comments and recommendations \n     in light of the results of the study as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1202.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 333 which was submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 333) welcoming and commending the \n     Government of Japan for extending an official apology to all \n     United States former prisoners of war from the Pacific War \n     and establishing in 2010 a visitation program to Japan for \n     surviving veterans, family members, and descendants.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. President, I rise today in support of this resolution \nhonoring former World War II U.S. POWs from the Pacific theater and \nacknowledging the steps the Japanese Government has made to heal the \nwounds of the past.\n  My friend and colleague from California, Representative Mike Honda, \nintroduced this resolution in the House and I am proud to follow suit \nhere in the Senate. I applaud his leadership on this important matter.\n  Our resolution welcomes and commends the Government of Japan for \nextending an official apology to all U.S. former prisoners of war from \nthe Pacific War and establishing in 2010 a visitation program to Japan \nfor surviving veterans, their families, and descendants.\n  The resolution appreciates the recent efforts by the Government of \nJapan toward historic apologies for the war crimes of Imperial Japan.\n  The resolution requests that the Government of Japan continue its new \nJapanese/American POW Friendship Program of reconciliation and \nremembrance.\n  It requests that the Government of Japan respect the wishes and \nsensibilities of the United States former prisoners of war by \nsupporting and encouraging programs for lasting remembrance and \nreconciliation that recognize their sacrifices, history, and forced \nlabor.\n  It acknowledges the work of the Department of State in advocating for \nthe United States Prisoners of War from the Pacific war, and it \napplauds the persistence, dedication, and patriotism of the members and \ndescendants of the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, approximately 27,000 \nU.S. prisoners of war were held by Imperial Japanese forces during \nWorld War II.\n  They were often subject to brutal and inhumane treatment.\n  They were starved and denied adequate medical care and were forced to \nperform slave labor for private Japanese companies.\n  American POWs toiled in mines, factories, shipyards, and steel mills \nfor hours every day under extremely dangerous conditions. Many suffered \nhealth problems long after their time as POWs had ended.\n  Some 40 percent of POWs perished and never returned home to their \nloved ones.\n  We owe these brave heroes a debt that can never be fully repaid. It \nis critical that we never forget their sacrifice.\n  A lot has changed since the end of the war.\n  Japan has emerged from the ashes of war to develop into one of our \nclosest friends and allies and a responsible member of the \ninternational community.\n  Our relationship is sustained by shared values of democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law.\n  The American POWs--those that survived--returned home and tried to \nmove on with their lives.\n  They completed their education, got married, started families, began \nnew\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\ncareers and participated in all aspects of civic life.\n  But one thing was missing: recognition from the Japanese Government \nabout how they were treated as POWs.\n  In the simplest terms, they wanted an apology.\n  In order for Japan to fully rejoin the international community, it \nhad to acknowledge its treatment of POWs during the ware.\n  And groups like the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor and \nits Descendants Group worked tirelessly for this recognition.\n  And I am pleased to say that Japan has taken historic actions in this \narea.\n  On May 30, 2009, Japan's Ambassador to the United States, Ichiro \nFujisaki, told the last convention of the American Defenders of Bataan \nand Corregidor:\n\n  We extend a heartfelt apology for our country having caused \ntremendous damage and suffering to many people, including prisoners of \nwars, those who have undergone tragic experiences in the Bataan \nPeninsula, Corregidor Island, in the Philippines, and other places.\n\n  On September 13, 2010, in a message to all U.S. former POWs, Japan's \nForeign Minister Katsuya Okada said:\n\n       You have all been through hardships during World War II, \n     begin taken prisoner by the Japanese military, and suffered \n     extremely inhumane treatment. On behalf of the Japanese \n     government and as the foreign minister, I would like to offer \n     you my heartfelt apology.\n\n  The Government of Japan has also created a new program for former \nU.S. POWs and their family members to come to Japan for remembrance and \nreconciliation.\n  I commend the Government of Japan for taking these actions. Our \nformer POWs waited long enough.\n  There are fewer than 500 surviving POWs still alive today.\n  Let us take a moment today, while we still can, to honor them and pay \ntribute to their service to their country during difficult and trying \ntimes.\n  Let us also acknowledge the steps Japan has taken to come to terms \nwith its past and strengthen the friendship between our two peoples.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 333\n\n       Whereas the United States and Japan have enjoyed a \n     productive and successful peace for over six decades, which \n     has nurtured a strong and critical alliance and deep economic \n     ties that are vitally important to both countries, the Asia-\n     Pacific region, and the world;\n       Whereas the United States-Japan alliance is based on shared \n     interests, responsibilities, and values and the common \n     support for political and economic freedoms, human rights, \n     and international law;\n       Whereas the United States-Japan alliance has been \n     maintained by the contributions and sacrifices of members of \n     the United States Armed Forces dedicated to Japan's defense \n     and democracy;\n       Whereas, from December 7, 1941, to August 15, 1945, the \n     Pacific War caused profound damage and suffering to \n     combatants and noncombatants alike;\n       Whereas, among those who suffered and sacrificed greatly \n     were the men and women of the United States Armed Forces who \n     were captured by Imperial Japanese forces during the Pacific \n     War;\n       Whereas many United States prisoners of war were subject to \n     brutal and inhumane conditions and forced labor;\n       Whereas, according to the Congressional Research Service, \n     an estimated 27,000 United States prisoners of war were held \n     by Imperial Japanese forces and nearly 40 percent perished;\n       Whereas the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor and \n     its subsequent Descendants Group have worked tirelessly to \n     represent the thousands of United States veterans who were \n     held by Imperial Japanese forces as prisoners of war during \n     the Pacific War;\n       Whereas, on May 30, 2009, an official apology from the \n     Government of Japan was delivered by Japan's Ambassador to \n     the United States Ichiro Fujisaki to the last convention of \n     the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor stating, \n     ``Today, I would like to convey to you the position of the \n     government of Japan on this issue. As former Prime Ministers \n     of Japan have repeatedly stated, the Japanese people should \n     bear in mind that we must look into the past and to learn \n     from the lessons of history. We extend a heartfelt apology \n     for our country having caused tremendous damage and suffering \n     to many people, including prisoners of wars, those who have \n     undergone tragic experiences in the Bataan Peninsula, \n     Corregidor Island, in the Philippines, and other places.'';\n       Whereas, in 2010, the Government of Japan through its \n     Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established a new program of \n     remembrance and understanding that, for the first time, \n     includes United States former prisoners of war and their \n     family members or other caregivers by inviting them to Japan \n     for exchange and friendship;\n       Whereas six United States former prisoners of war, each of \n     whom was accompanied by a family member, and two descendants \n     of prisoners of war participated in Japan's first Japanese/\n     American POW Friendship Program from September 12, 2010, to \n     September 19, 2010;\n       Whereas Japan's Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada on September \n     13, 2010, apologized to all United States former prisoners of \n     war on behalf of the Government of Japan stating, ``You have \n     all been through hardships during World War II, being taken \n     prisoner by the Japanese military, and suffered extremely \n     inhumane treatment. On behalf of the Japanese government and \n     as the foreign minister, I would like to offer you my \n     heartfelt apology.'';\n       Whereas Foreign Minister Okada stated that he expects the \n     former prisoners of war exchanges with the people of Japan \n     will ``become a turning point in burying their bitter \n     feelings about the past and establishing a better \n     relationship between Japan and the United States'';\n       Whereas Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tetsuro \n     Fukuyama on September 13, 2010, apologized to United States \n     former prisoners of war for the ``immeasurable damage and \n     suffering'' they experienced;\n       Whereas the participants of the first Japanese/American POW \n     Friendship Program appreciated the generosity and hospitality \n     they received from the Government and people of Japan during \n     the Program and welcomed the apology offered by Foreign \n     Minister Okada and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Fukuyama;\n       Whereas the participants encourage the Government of Japan \n     to continue this program of visitation and friendship and \n     expand it to support projects for remembrance, documentation, \n     and education; and\n       Whereas the United States former prisoners of war of Japan \n     still await apologies and remembrance from the successor \n     firms of those private entities in Japan that, in violation \n     of the Third Geneva Convention and in unmerciful conditions, \n     used their labor for economic gain to sustain war production: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes and commends the Government of Japan for \n     extending an official apology to all United States former \n     prisoners of war from the Pacific War and establishing in \n     2010 a visitation program to Japan for surviving veterans, \n     their families, and descendants;\n       (2) appreciates the recent efforts by the Government of \n     Japan toward historic apologies for the maltreatment of \n     United States former prisoners of war;\n       (3) requests that the Government of Japan continue its new \n     Japanese/American POW Friendship Program of reconciliation \n     and remembrance and expand it to educate the public and its \n     school children about the history of prisoners of war in \n     Imperial Japan;\n       (4) requests that the Government of Japan respect the \n     wishes and sensibilities of the United States former \n     prisoners of war by supporting and encouraging programs for \n     lasting remembrance and reconciliation that recognize their \n     sacrifices, history, and forced labor;\n       (5) acknowledges the work of the Department of State in \n     advocating for the United States prisoners of war from the \n     Pacific War; and\n       (6) applauds the persistence, dedication, and patriotism of \n     the members and descendants of the American Defenders of \n     Bataan and Corregidor for their pursuit of justice and \n     lasting peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/17/senate-section/article/S7783-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7783-S7784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, \n                           NOVEMBER 18, 2011\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.
