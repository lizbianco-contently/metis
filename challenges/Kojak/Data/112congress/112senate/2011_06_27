Mr. President, last Thursday, Democrats sat down with the \nchief executives of three successful corporations. Their companies are \nresponsible for the jobs and livelihoods of about 100,000 workers. One \ncompany makes medications that help Americans live longer, healthier \nlives. Another invests in entrepreneurship, giving inventors the \ncapital they will need to bring their ideas to the production line. \nAnother employs scientists and engineers to make more efficient the \nthings we use every day, from jet engines to home thermostats.\n  These three CEOs understand what it takes to create jobs, so we asked \nthem what Washington can do to help. This is what they told us. All \nDemocratic Senators were there.\n\n[[Page S4108]]\n\n  First, we must improve and reform our education system, from \nkindergarten through 12th grade, so we produce the skilled workers of \ntomorrow. Plus we need to train more scientists, engineers, and \nmathematicians so we do not risk falling behind China, India, and other \nglobal competitors.\n  All three of these executives--all of them--believe we must reform \nour immigration system to stay competitive. The brightest students from \naround the globe come to the United States to take advantage of our \nworld-class universities. Unfortunately, our broken immigration system \nforces most of those students to go back to their home countries, where \nthey compete with American companies. We should be keeping the best \nhere, where they were educated, so they can build companies that employ \nU.S. workers.\n  Of course, we must simplify and streamline our broken tax system, \nlowering rates but eliminating loopholes so everyone pays his or her \nfair share, including corporations.\n  This is what three successful CEOs told us we should do to create \njobs for American workers. I know these are big issues. They are \ncomplicated and politically divisive. We cannot tackle them all at \nonce. But they are not the only solution. These three CEOs we met with \nlast week said there are smaller, more manageable issues we can tackle \nright now. There are things we can do to help create jobs right now.\n  Mother Teresa urged us to ``be faithful in small things because it is \nin them that your strength lies.'' Putting Americans back to work can \nand should start with the small things.\n  This is what these three successful CEOs told us we should do to spur \nhiring:\n  First, reauthorize a program that gives grants to the technology \ncompanies that are inventing new products, such as the electric \ntoothbrush or body armor for soldiers, so these innovators can continue \nto grow and hire. That is what we tried to do with the small business \ninnovation research legislation. The Republicans stopped it.\n  Second, they said we should modernize America's air travel system to \nmake it safer and more efficient to fly American skies. That is what we \ntried to do when we reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration, \nwhich is lost in the Republican-dominated House.\n  Third, we must reform our patent system and clear a 3-year backlog of \napplications. The next laptop computer or iPod could be in that pile, \njust waiting to be taken from the basement to the boardroom. That is \nwhat we tried to do with the America Invents Act. The House passed a \nversion of our bill, but the person--for example, Senator Coburn--said \nhe is going to stop this bill because it doesn't have the payment \nsystem that was a good idea. We all thought that here. We voted for \nthis 95 to 5. But, again, it has been stopped by the Republicans; that \nis, our patent system.\n  That is 580,000 jobs just for patents and FAA, and there are tens of \nthousands of jobs with small business innovation. These are commonsense \nsteps we can take today. Each would help put people to work across the \ncountry. That is not just what the Senate says, that is what business \nleaders say. Here is the catch. Congress has already taken up, as I \nindicated, all three of these measures. Not one has become law. Why? \nRepublicans have killed or stalled all three of these important pieces \nof legislation--legislation business owners say they need to put more \nthan \\1/2\\ million Americans back to work.\n\n  Putting Americans back to work must be our most important debt-\nreduction strategy. Democrats know it is critical that we reduce the \ndeficit and pay down the national debt, but we will never balance the \nbudget with 14 million people out of work.\n  Democrats know how to balance budgets. Remember, when Democrats in \nCongress helped President Clinton balance the budget in 1998, \nunemployment was 4.5 percent. Now, unfortunately, it is twice that. \nThat is why we must do two things at once: reduce the deficit and do \nwhatever it takes to get American workers back doing what they need to \ndo to bring in a paycheck. The business leaders we spoke with support \nthis two-pronged approach. Democrats and Republicans do not have to \nlook hard to find common ground; we only have to be willing to admit it \nwhen we see it.\n  I met with the President earlier today. We had a productive meeting. \nMy Republican counterpart will meet with the President this afternoon. \nI hope my Republican colleagues will put the economy ahead of politics \nand join us to create jobs and set aside their desire to please the tea \nparty and defeat President Obama. This is the way forward. Neither \nparty should confront this crisis alone, and no one will be successful \nunless we confront it together.\n  We owe the country our commitment to do at least the small things. \nAgain I repeat Mother Teresa when she said it is in them; that is, the \nsmall things, that our strength lies. And they, in turn, will inspire \nfaith that the big things will follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4108-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, a little later today, I will sit down \nwith President Obama to discuss his request to raise the Nation's debt \nceiling. When I do, I intend to make a request of my own. I intend to \nask the President what he is prepared to do, outside of raising taxes, \nabout the massive deficits and debt that have accumulated on his watch. \nI will tell him what Republicans are looking for in this debate: to cut \nspending now, cap runaway spending in the future, save our entitlements \nfrom bankruptcy, and get our economy moving. I will tell him the truth \nabout requests by some in his party that we increase spending and raise \ntaxes as a way of solving the debt and jobs crisis that precipitated \nthe President's request to raise the debt limit in the first place: Not \nonly are they counterproductive from the standpoint of an economic \nrecovery, they are also politically impossible since Republicans oppose \ntax hikes and Democrats have already shown they will not raise taxes in \na down economy either.\n  Let's start by taking both proposals off the table and focus on what \ncan actually pass Congress and what will actually spur the private \nsector in our future and create jobs. Those who are calling for tax \nhikes as a part of these debt discussions either have amnesia about the \nfate of similar proposals just 6 months ago when Democrats controlled \nboth Chambers of Congress by very large margins, as well as the White \nHouse, or they are acting in bad faith since we all know that including \nmassive job-killing tax hikes would be a poison pill.\n  Let's move past the tax hikes, talk about what is actually possible, \nand let's talk about what has and has not worked over the last 2 years. \nOn this second point, this much is clear: If government spending were \nthe answer to an economic slowdown, we would be in a boom time right \nnow. Instead, we are facing record deficits and debt and a seemingly \nendless stream of bad economic news. Despite massive spending increases \nby Democrats, millions have lost their jobs.\n  The problem is that Washington spends too much. That means Democrats \nare simply going to have to make the kinds of tough choices about \nWashington's budget that most other Americans have been forced to make \nabout their own budgets over the past couple of years.\n  Last week, President Obama told a group of people he was prepared to \nbring down the deficit by trillions of dollars but refused to list any \nof the ways he was willing to do it. All he did was list the things he \nrefused to cut. This weekend, the President proposed even more deficit-\nfinanced spending disguised as what he calls investment. You really \ncannot have it both ways.\n  At some point, the President needs to realize that the reason our \ndebt has skyrocketed 35 percent over the last 2 years and that our \nannual deficit is now three times greater than the highest deficit the \nprevious administration ever ran is that spending has spiraled \ncompletely and totally out of control and that the big-government \npolicies of the last 2 years simply have to change. Consider the failed \nstimulus bill when Democrats passed it. They said it was a one-time \ncash infusion that was supposed to keep unemployment below 8\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\npercent. Two years later, with unemployment still hovering around 9 \npercent, they are saying we need to keep up the stimulus-level \nspending, despite its obvious failure. Their commitment to spending and \ntax hikes is so deeply held, it seems they do not even recognize the \nstate of our economy or the fact that the tax-and-spend policies of the \npast 2 years have made matters worse, and they have to change if they \nare ever going to get out of the fiscal mess we are in.\n\n  Democrats seem to think the solution to our tax crisis is to ask \ntaxpayers and businesses to reward their economic stewardship with even \nmore money to spend as they please. They don't seem to understand that \nthe voters didn't elect dozens of additional Republicans to the House \nof Representatives last November because they wanted their taxes \nraised. They sent them to reverse policies that had failed. We have \nseen the consequences of giving Washington a blank check. It is the \nreason we are in the mess to begin with.\n  So my message to the President is quite simple. It is time for \nWashington to focus on fixing itself. It is time for Washington to take \nthe hit, not the taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4109-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, nearly every day we see scenes playing \nout in countries around the world where their financial security is in \nruins. This is the last thing we want to experience in our great \ncountry, and that is why we need to reform our fiscal policy and the \nway we have done business. There is too much at stake not to take \naction.\n  The International Monetary Fund urged us to address our soaring \nbudget deficits, and credit rating agencies Moody's and S may be \nforced to downgrade our government's AAA rating.\n  So what is the majority doing to address this fiscal crisis? \nAbsolutely nothing. It has been nearly 790 days without the majority in \nthis Chamber proposing a budget, and it appears the majority isn't \nanxious to work on one. The majority-led Budget Committee has failed to \nmeet this year to begin working on a resolution. We can't even have an \nopen debate in this Chamber about the budget. Instead of voting to \nstart the debate on budget measures last month, the majority squashed \nall proposals, including the President's own plan. This is failure to \ngovern at the most basic level and the American people deserve better. \nWe need a budget that puts us on the path to fiscal discipline.\n  Every week we hear warnings of why this must be done. Last week the \nCongressional Budget Office issued the starkest warning yet of the \ndanger posed by our spending problems. Our Nation's debt will exceed \nthe size of the U.S. economy by 2021 and will double the size of our \nNation's GDP within 25 years. This is not the way I want to leave this \ncountry for my kids, my grandkids, and the people of Arkansas.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Obama pushed for a \nconversation that will put us on the path to fiscal responsibility but, \nso far, he has been absent from the discussions. Only today, 36 days \nbefore the deadline given by Secretary Geithner to raise the legal \nlimit on Federal borrowing, is he beginning to take leadership in \nnegotiating for spending limitations.\n  Our debt is slowing the economic recovery. The simple truth is higher \ndebt leads to slower economic growth. We have seen this with the failed \nstimulus, but in the past week the Senate-led majority is once again \nproposing this flawed strategy. This failed policy of borrowing, \nspending, and taxing is just what the CBO is warning us to avoid. It \nhasn't worked in the past and it won't work in the future.\n  What we need are debt reduction measures in the form of spending \ncuts. The CBO's last report shows that spending is the primary cause of \nour fiscal crisis and supports spending cuts rather than tax increases \nto reverse this trend. I urge President Obama to take tax hikes off the \ntable. Let's get to work reining in the reckless spending and putting \nour Nation back on a fiscally responsible path.\n  If American families ran their household budgets the way Washington \nruns its budget, the utilities would be shut off and the collection \nagencies would be knocking on their doors. The American people are now \nknocking on the doors of the Capitol demanding the government limit its \nspending.\n  We must rein in our spending to protect programs such as Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security for current recipients and for future \ngenerations. In order to achieve this, we must reform the manner in \nwhich we budget and allocate Federal dollars. We need a mechanism to \ncap spending and force the government to spend within its means.\n  We must act now to move our country off the brink of financial \ncollapse, and we must make tough decisions because that is what the \nAmerican people deserve and expect of us.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for \nup to a half an hour in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week, three events conjoined to elevate \nthe subject of the U.S. debt crisis in this country and should energize \nus in the Senate and our colleagues in the House to redouble our \nefforts to find a solution to this serious problem.\n  I wish to briefly mention those three events and then talk about the \nproblem from my perspective, some of the potential solutions, and put \nan item in the Congressional Record for my colleagues' review.\n  The first of what occurred was a new report by the Congressional \nBudget Office which was a new projection about U.S. debt as a \npercentage of our economy. One of the things they said was that our \ndebt could almost double by the year 2035--far larger than they thought \nit would be as a percent of our economy or the GDP--and they said it is \ngoing to exceed 100 percent by the year 2021. Actually, it could get to \nthat point sooner than that. It is approaching 100 percent right now. \nGreece is a little bit over 100 percent. Countries that get to that \n100-percent level of public debt as a percent of GDP have a very hard \ntime ever recovering. As a result, the time is now for the U.S. \nGovernment to act on our huge and growing debt.\n  Secondly, we had reports by the Labor Department, the Commerce \nDepartment, and others that confirm what we already know about the \nstate of our economy and the state of joblessness in this country.\n  Applications for unemployment benefits rose. It was the biggest jump \nin a month. We are over 9 percent unemployment now. New home sales fell \nin May. The values of our homes in this country have decreased more \nthan they did during the Great Depression. That has been a horrible \nfactor for millions of American families. Stocks fell last\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\nweek. The Federal Reserve Board lowered its outlook for growth, which \nin the last quarter was less than 2 percent--it was 1.9 percent--and \nthis is unacceptable. It is much lower than ordinarily recovery is \ncoming out of a recession. Confidence is slipping among small \nbusinesses and households. There are higher gas prices, higher food \nprices.\n  All of this simply confirms what most of us have heard from our \nconstituencies; namely, this recovery is not much of a recovery and we \nneed to do everything we can to try to improve it.\n  Third, of course, is the news that negotiations with the White House \nover extending the debt ceiling had broken down. Actually, as a member \nof the group negotiating that, I would not say they had broken down. I \nthink the Vice President is correct that they have moved on to a new \nphase; namely, the phase where the President himself, the Speaker of \nthe House, and the two leaders here in the Senate are going to have to \ntry to resolve some of the largest issues--the kinds of issues that the \nnegotiators in the so-called Biden talks were simply not able to \nresolve because it would go against instructions from our principals.\n  The primary problem there was the insistence by the Democratic \nnegotiators that Republicans agree to tax hikes--something which we \nthink would be inimical to economic growth, the very problem of the \nslow recovery in the economy would be exacerbated by, if we were to \nincrease our tax rates. You do not add new taxes to an already \nstruggling economy. So the White House's insistence that had to be a \ncondition to approving the reductions in spending we had been talking \nabout made it impossible for us to go forward at that time.\n  There is an old saying that there is a difference between a pessimist \nand an optimist. I usually think of myself as optimistic. The saying \nis: The pessimist says things are so bad they can't get any worse. The \noptimist says, sure they can. And they could. If the Congressional \nBudget Office is correct about its projections here, we could be in a \nfar worse debt situation tomorrow or the year after that than we are \ntoday--a situation which would make it extremely difficult for us to \never recover and essentially relegate our children and our \ngrandchildren to a standard of living far below that which we have all \nbeen accustomed to, and which they deserve.\n  Looking at some of the other factors that should frame the problem \nfor us, we have over a $14 trillion debt--and growing every day. We are \ngoing to need $2.4 trillion in increased debt ceiling authority to get \nus through the end of next year. You cannot tax your way out of it. You \ncannot borrow your way out of it.\n  We have to reduce the level of spending, which is now approaching 25 \npercent of our gross domestic product. The average is around 20 \npercent, and that is where we were before President Obama took office. \nWe have to borrow now 40 cents of every $1 we spend. So when we talk \nabout spending more money in a new stimulus package--another new idea \nto come out of the Democratic Congress last week--we are talking about \nhaving to borrow 40 cents of all of that money that would be spent. \nThink of it now: For every program we have here at the Federal \nGovernment level, we have to borrow more than 40 cents of the money we \nare then going to spend. That takes money out of the private sector \nthat is needed to produce jobs and provide for investment in the \nprivate sector.\n  I mentioned before unemployment is over 9 percent now and according \nto the CBO projection is not going to go down by very much over the \ncourse of the next year, if at all.\n  So what is the solution? A lot of our Democratic friends have said we \nneed to have a new stimulus program, we need to spend even more, \nnotwithstanding we do not have the money, and we should be raising \ntaxes. As I mentioned, that is the reason why we terminated the \ndiscussion with Vice President Biden last week, because of the \ninsistence on the part of our Democratic colleagues that the only way \nthey were willing to move forward was if we committed to raising taxes, \nand I mean by a substantial amount. There was $400 billion in revenue \nraisers on the table, put there by our Democratic colleagues. That \nsimply will not pass the House of Representatives. But, more \nimportantly, it would be the worst medicine possible for an ailing \neconomy.\n  We cannot afford more spending. Even if we could, it would not put \nAmericans back to work. Jobs are created by private businesses, and the \nmore the government taxes or borrows, the less there is available for \nbusinesses to invest and hire. So the answer here is less government \nspending, not more taxation and more borrowing.\n  We put forth a budget. The Republicans passed it in the House of \nRepresentatives. We voted on it here in the Senate, and it did not pass \nbecause Democrats in the Senate would not support it. But it is a \nlegitimate effort to allow job creation, economic recovery, and \neventually get our budget balanced at the Federal Government level back \nhere in Washington.\n  People have said it is a radical budget. It is not. Even under the \nso-called Ryan budget, we would go another $5 trillion in debt. You \ncannot call that radically slashing spending if over the next 10 years \nwe add another $5 trillion to our national debt. That shows you how \nhard it is to reduce spending. People say: Well, you can't cut this \nprogram, you can't cut that program. You cut them in a way that still \nadds $5 trillion in debt over 10 years, and they say it is radical, you \nare slashing spending.\n  The Obama budget, by contrast, would add $12 trillion in debt. So \nboth of them would add to our debt. But at least under the Ryan budget \nthat was passed by the House of Representatives, over time we would get \nback into balance. In fact, it would be in primary balance by the year \n2014, meaning except for interest payments it would be a balanced \nbudget, and we would reduce Federal spending from 25 percent of our \neconomy back down to a little over 20 percent, which is the historic \naverage. Excuse me, it would be a little under 20 percent, which would \nbe close to our historic average of spending as a percent of the gross \ndomestic product.\n  One of the best ways for us to ensure we are in balance is to adopt a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. All 47 Senate \nRepublicans have cosponsored the balanced budget amendment. It is \ncarefully written so that even though it requires balance in the \nbudget, it does not easily allow Congress to raise taxes as a way of \nachieving balance. That would require a two-thirds vote. It also \ncontains a very important spending limitation as a percent of the gross \ndomestic product. So we would achieve balance, but we would achieve \nbalance by reducing our appetite for Washington spending here and, as a \nresult, could achieve the kind of balance that would promote economic \ngrowth.\n  You could spend more money if we had more economic growth because \nspending would be tied to the gross domestic product. So it is a \nperfect solution for Republicans and Democrats alike. If you like to \nspend more money, there is a perfectly good way to get to spend more \nmoney: Do that which would enhance the recovery of our economy--because \nthe bigger our economy got, the higher the percentage of money \nWashington could spend. The incentives are aligned properly. We propose \nto promote economic growth. So this balanced budget amendment would \naccomplish that. For those who like to spend money, the more growth, \nthe more money you would get to spend.\n  We hope that balanced budget amendment will come to the Senate floor \nin the next week or two or three. We certainly look forward to the \nopportunity to debate it and getting a vote on it.\n  But when you look at the alternative that has been proposed by a lot \nof our colleagues on the other side--a new stimulus program and \nincreased taxes--you have to wonder: How serious are they about \nactually helping our economy recover? Everything so far that the other \nside has tried under the leadership of the President has failed to \nwork. In fact, it has actually made things worse.\n  We are all familiar with the stimulus that did not help, did not \nbring unemployment down as the President promised. It made things \nworse. That is why I have this chart here in the Chamber that shows the \nObama economic record has not made things better. It has made things \nworse.\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\n  Look at a few of the things that are afflicting our economy today, \nthe indicia of what is wrong. You start with the Inauguration Day for \nPresident Obama, where we are today, and what the change has been.\n  If you look at unemployment, unemployment has gone up by 1.9 million \nAmericans. The unemployment rate has gone up 17 percent since the \nPresident took office. This is not like the situation where he said: \nWell, I inherited a bad economy, but I am gradually making it better. \nHe is making it worse.\n  Gas prices have gone up 101 percent under President Obama. He will \nnot approve the leases that would allow our oil companies to explore \nfor more oil and gas, thus bringing the prices down.\n  The Federal debt has gone up 35 percent since the President took \noffice.\n  The debt per person has increased by $11,311. It has gone up from \n$34,000 to over $46,000. That is the debt each one of us has.\n  So it has increased that much in just 1 year. By the way, health \ninsurance premiums have gone up 19 percent, notwithstanding the passage \nof the so-called ObamaCare.\n  Getting back to this matter of debt, just to put it in perspective, \nif we took all of the Presidents of the United States from George \nWashington all the way through the Presidency of George W. Bush, if we \ntook all of those Presidents and added up all of the debt--the debt \nfrom the Civil War, the debt from World War I, World War II, Vietnam, \nall of the debt that all of the Presidents of the United States \naccumulated--in one budget, President Obama will double that debt.\n  Each one of the years he has been President we have had a deficit of \nover $1 trillion, closer to $1.5 trillion. So at the end of 5 years, he \nwill have doubled the debt. At the end of 10 years, he will have \ntripled the debt that all of the other Presidents of the United States \ncombined accumulated. Now, I say the Presidents. Obviously, it takes a \nCongress to do this as well.\n  What the Members of the House of Representatives are saying to the \nObama budget is, no. Even the President decided not to pursue his \nbudget. When that was offered on the Senate floor, not a single Member \nof the Senate, Democrat or Republican, voted for the Obama budget \nbecause it takes us in the wrong direction. It would make things even \nworse than they are today.\n  At least with the Republican budget we have an effort to begin to \nsolve the problem, even though a lot of people say it is not enough in \nthe way of cuts, and they have proposed alternatives to reduce spending \neven more. I am all for reducing spending even more. The bottom line \nis, however, we have to get something passed. That is going to take \nDemocrats and Republicans working together. So I am happy to work with \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but we have to have some \ncooperation to reduce spending and not insist on tax increases.\n  What we have said as a part of these negotiations to increase the \nbudget deficit is, some of us might be willing to increase the debt \nceiling if we do not have to keep doing it. We need reforms that will \nenable us to not have to keep raising the debt ceiling, or at least not \nso much. The way we achieve those reforms is, first of all, to identify \nsavings that can be made. There is an enormous amount of wasteful \nWashington spending. We have identified it is closer to $500 billion. \nThe Vice President has said more than $1 trillion. The money is \ncertainly out there to be saved. We need to save that kind of money on \nthe front end as a downpayment to let the markets know and to let the \nAmerican people know we are serious. That is savings that we can pass \nthat can be locked in.\n  By the way, there is a little bit of revenues involved in that. It is \nnot just all savings. There are some fee increases. There are user \nfees. There are some means testing of various Federal programs that can \nactually result in some increased revenue.\n  So when our Democratic friends say, well, there has to be revenue on \nthe table, there is revenue on the table, but it is not tax increases. \nSo if you are so ideological that you have to insist on tax increases \nin order to cut spending, unfortunately, you have taken yourself out of \nthe game.\n  The bottom line is, there is somewhere between at least $500 billion \nand $1 trillion, probably more, in various kinds of mandatory savings \nthat we could achieve. Then we have discretionary spending. We need to \nset a budget number since the Senate has not passed a budget in over \n700 days now--I forget the exact number. We have not had a budget, so \nwe do not have a number that the Appropriations Committee can deal with \nto appropriate funds for the discretionary part of our spending in this \ncountry.\n  We need to set that number. The Ryan budget set that number, and we \nwere negotiating with the White House as to what that number would be. \nBut we need to set that number. Then we need to make sure in the \nensuing years Congress will actually live with that number. The \ntendency around here has been to set a budget number, then we have an \nemergency here, and we need to waive it there. The next thing we know, \nwe are way over the number that we all agreed to in the beginning.\n  So we need something that will constrain both discretionary and \nmandatory spending over the course of the next 10 years and, hopefully, \nbeyond. A lot of us believe the best constraint is the balanced budget \namendment. But for colleagues who say: No, we are never going to agree \nto that--and, of course, we would have to get 20 colleagues in the \nSenate to agree in order pass it; it takes a two-thirds majority--then \nat least agree with us to put handcuffs on the Congress and the \nPresident, some kind of straitjacket so we do not spend beyond the \nnumber we agree on for next year and the year after that.\n  We can save well over $1 trillion, somewhere between $1 trillion and \neven more than $1.5 trillion in discretionary spending over the next 10 \nyears if we would agree to these so-called section 302(a) top-line \nbudget numbers, and then constrain ourselves to sticking with those \nnumbers over time.\n  The reason? It is kind of like compound interest. Let's say we reduce \nspending in next year's budget by $30 billion over the previous year. \nThat is not a huge amount of money. But over a course of 10 years, when \nwe set a new baseline, that translates into hundreds of billions of \ndollars if we really do it.\n  The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office says: We are not sure we \nwant to score that as real savings because we are not sure you will \nreally do it. But if we are able to pass some kind of constraint--such \nas the old Gramm-Rudman bill, for example--then I think the \nCongressional Budget Office will give us some credit for those \nconstraints.\n  The best proposal I have seen is one proposed by Senator Corker and \nSenator McCaskill. It is bipartisan, a Republican and a Democrat, and \nthey have Republican and Democrat cosponsors for the same proposal in \nthe House of Representatives. It is called the CAP Act, to cap \nspending. So once the level is determined--they do it as a percentage \nof GDP.\n  I think that is the smartest way because that is an incentive for \neverybody to help the economy grow more. The more it grows, then the \nmore, as a percentage, the spending can be. Over 10 years, we save a \nlot of money that way. It is enforced by the simple mechanism that if \nwe do not achieve the savings that is called for, then there is an \nautomatic sequester where all of the accounts of the government--\ndefense spending, nondefense spending, mandatory spending--would all \nhave to save a little bit. They would not be able to spend quite as \nmuch money so that we could make up the difference between the target \nor the goal and what the law called for.\n  There are other ways to do it as well. We were discussing different \nalternatives in the conversations with Vice President Biden. But the \npoint is, we cannot allow waivers. We cannot have exemptions and \nemergencies and all of that--at least not without a supermajority vote, \nsuch as a three-fourths vote or a two-thirds vote--or else it is going \nto be too easy for Congress to do what it has done in the past, which \nis to simply say: This is too uncomfortable for us to comply with. We \nare going to declare this an emergency, vote for it by a majority vote, \nand then it is done.\n  If we mean it, we would have to be willing to abide by it. So we have \nto have a meaningful downpayment. We can do that. We have already \nidentified substantial savings. We need to have a 302(a) budget number \nfor at least the next couple of years and a mechanism\n\n[[Page S4112]]\n\nfor enforcing that over the next decade and beyond.\n  Finally, we need to have a way to help the markets actually believe \nwe are serious about entitlement reforms so the biggest part of our \nbudget--representing two-thirds of all of the money we spend; namely, \nthe entitlements--is actually beginning to grow at a slower pace.\n  We are not talking about drastic cuts, but we are talking about \nslowing the pace of growth. We can do that without having huge benefit \ncuts or without slashing payments to the providers. I mean, the last \nthing we want to do for Medicare--for example, I am concerned about my \nmother. We can use any of our mothers or dads or grandparents \non Medicare. The last thing we want to do is say we have a great \nMedicare Program except for one thing: there is no doctor or hospital \nto take care of people because they will not because we are not paying \nthem enough. So we need to be able to pay the people we rely upon for \nthe medical treatment we have promised. We cannot do that by slashing \npayments to providers. Too many physicians have already said they \ncannot afford this program anymore and therefore are not going to take \nany more new Medicare patients--we have all had that experience--nor \nshould we do it by slashing benefits. But we do not have to do either \nof those two things to have reforms.\n\n  I mentioned in these negotiations we have been discussing a lot of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse-type reforms. Those of us in the Senate and the \nHouse kind of smiled because we always talk about the amount of money \nthat can be saved because of the amount of waste, fraud, and abuse in \nthe system. But the reality is, there is a lot of waste, fraud, and \nabuse and we can save a lot of money if we put our minds to it.\n  But what that means is, for example, we have to enforce the law. I \nwill pick a hypothetical program because we are not going to be talking \nabout the specifics with our negotiations. I am assuming we will get \nback to those negotiations at some point.\n  But we have eligibility standards to receive a certain Federal \nbenefit, let's say. But 20 percent of the benefits that are being paid \nout are being paid out erroneously to people who do not qualify. They \nare not supposed to get the benefit. So we have to enforce the law.\n  We say: Sorry, you do not qualify for this benefit. This is a benefit \nfor the elderly or this is a benefit for poorer Americans or for \nwhatever. If we just enforce the law, we can save a lot of money, and \nthat is not cutting benefits for anyone.\n  We can also do means testing. Republicans, for years, have said--\nwell, I will use a couple of names because they both said we do not \nneed the benefits of all of these Medicare Programs. People such as \nWarren Buffett, for example, have made it clear, and Bill Gates. They \nhave both made it clear they do not need to have the government take \ncare of their medical requirements when they are age 65 or older.\n  There are a lot of Americans who are in the position to be able to \nafford a lot more of their own care, and they do not have to rely \nexclusively on the Federal Government. So through means testing we can \neither provide that their benefits will not be as generous as for \npeople who are less fortunate economically or that they will pay a \nlittle bit more in the way of a copay or a deductible or maybe even a \npremium.\n  The bottom line, there are ways to ensure the future success of a \nprogram such as Medicare without affecting people who cannot afford to \nhave big benefit cuts. One idea that has not been discussed--but I have \nheard it discussed--is to simply conform Medicare benefits to the same \nage eligibility as Social Security. That would save a great deal of \nmoney. It would represent a slowing in the time when people are \neligible for the benefit.\n  Maybe some people believe, therefore, that it should not be \nconsidered. My point is that there are a lot of ways the entitlement \nprograms can be reformed so they will be there when people need them. \nIf we do not, if we say we do not want to touch them, here is what is \ngoing to happen. I will give one program as an example: Medicare Part \nA, the hospital part.\n  The Medicare trustees say by the year 2021, Medicare Part A will \nbegin to run out of money. There will not be as much money in the trust \nfund, and it could well therefore happen in the following years if \npeople need to go to the hospital, the hospital is not there anymore. \nIf one lives in a small town, and it is the only hospital there and \nthey cannot afford to stay open, they are going to close. So someone \nthinks they have Medicine Part A benefits, but the hospital either is \nnot there or it cannot take care of them because it does not have the \nmoney to do so because it is not being reimbursed by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  So the choice is not to do something or to do nothing. If we do \nnothing, the benefits will not be there--the benefits we have promised \nto senior citizens will not be there. Doing nothing is not an option. \nWe have to do something. So instead of demagoguing the issue \npolitically, some politicians need to be responsible, get in the game \nand say: Let's figure out a way to save these programs so they will be \nthere when we want them.\n  I also wanted to mention--this is a little bit off point, but it just \nshows how some of these things work. I mentioned high gas prices \nbefore. Ironically, one of the things the President has said we want to \ndo is to tax the oil companies.\n  Well, of course, if we tax the oil companies more, then gas prices \nare going to be higher. The President just released some of the \npetroleum from the National Petroleum Reserve to try to bring gas \nprices down. It will bring them down a little bit temporarily. But why \nwould we then want to have those prices go right back up again by \ntaxing the oil companies, which everyone knows will flow through to the \nconsumer? It does not make sense.\n  There is something else, however, that does make sense, and this has \nhad an impact on gas prices. The Federal Reserve Board has been buying \nbonds under a program called QE2--buying Treasury bonds. The purchase \nof those Treasury bonds has made our dollar less valuable. That means \nit takes more dollars to buy the same amount of gasoline. So, \nironically, this effort by the Fed to put more money into the economy \nhas had the pernicious effect of raising gas prices, raising food \nprices, and raising other prices because the dollar is not as valuable \nas it used to be, and to buy some commodities, especially commodities \nthat are bought and sold on the world market such as gas, we have to \nhave more dollars to pay for the same amount. So gas prices are \nincreased. This QE2 program is going to come to an end at the end of \nthis month. The Federal Reserve has already announced that. What will \nhappen as a result is that the value of the dollar will not be cut by \nthe amount of this selling of bonds, and so the expiration of the \nprogram lets the dollar strengthen, causing oil to return to levels we \nsaw in the beginning of the year. That will have the result of having \nmore purchasing power with the dollar you have, so you can buy the same \namount of gasoline for fewer dollars or, to put it another way, the \nsame amount of dollars you have will buy you more gasoline. That is one \npositive effect as a result of that change in policy by the U.S. \nGovernment.\n\n  The key is to allow our economy to work without too much government \ninterference. That is a good example of government interference that \ndisplaces or reduces the value of the dollar and therefore hurts the \nconsumer.\n  I heard our colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, say the other \nday--this is reported on June 14--in his first speech on the Senate \nfloor:\n\n       There is nothing wrong with our people. Americans haven't \n     forgotten how to start a business. They haven't run out of \n     good ideas. Americans are as great as we have ever been. But \n     our government is broken. And a broken government is keeping \n     us from doing what we have done better than anyone in the \n     world for over a century: create jobs.\n\n  He is right. If the government will get out of the way and not insist \non burdening our economy with new taxes and let Americans do what they \nhave always been able to do well, I think we will be able to come out \nof this economic downturn and come back to life as an economy, helping \nfamilies, small businesses and, ironically, by making more money and \npaying taxes at the same tax rate, the Federal Government will have the \nbenefit of our increase in salaries, profits, and so on, and will have \nmore money to spend as well.\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\n  Spending more money, taxing more, having the government try to \nstimulate the economy has never worked. I want to put into the Record a \nquotation from the Wall Street Journal of today, June 27, which is as \nfollows:\n\n       With spending at 24 percent and debt held by the public at \n     70 percent of GDP--both modern records--the U.S. needs \n     drastic spending cuts to head off a downward future spiral of \n     tax increases and unaffordable interest payments. As Milton \n     Friedman taught, spending is the real measure of government's \n     burden on the private economy, and reducing it leaves more \n     resources for private actors to spend and invest.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the point they are trying to make is, \ngovernment spending is a pretty good indicator of what is left over for \nthe private sector to invest and spend, for example, on new jobs. When \nthe government spends more, inevitably, it has to borrow more--40 cents \non every $1--or increase taxes--either way, reducing what is available \nfor the private sector to invest and hire.\n  We should be focused, as a result, as the editorial notes, on \nreducing wasteful Washington spending and allowing the genius of the \nAmerican people to do what Senator Rubio has made very clear: We have \nalways had the capability of creating jobs, unfettered by too much \ngovernment taxation and regulation. So we need to do away with those \npolicies, such as the Federal policy that reduced the value of the \ndollar, we need to try to eliminate as many regulations that burden the \nAmerican people as possible, and we need to avoid raising taxes.\n  Bear in mind, we are not talking about cutting taxes. We are not \ntalking about cutting taxes for the wealthy or cutting taxes for \nbusiness or cutting taxes for people, generally. Leave them alone, \ndon't raise them, is all we are saying. When you hear some politicians \nsay you want to cut taxes for the wealthy or give oil companies big tax \nbreaks--no, leave it alone. Don't touch it. Let businesses and families \nand small businesses do what they have always done best. If you want to \nmess up the economic growth, to use the colloquialism, follow what the \nadministration has been doing. We will have higher unemployment, higher \ngas prices, higher Federal debt, higher debt per person, and higher \nhealth insurance premiums, not to mention other pernicious effects. \nThose policies have made it worse, not better.\n  That is why Republicans have said don't force us to raise taxes as \npart of this increase in the debt ceiling. Let's reduce spending, and \nlet's enforce that through a balanced budget amendment and other kinds \nof spending constraints. We are not talking about drastic cuts, as I \nsaid. Think about this again.\n  The Ryan budget that passed in the House, and that most of us on the \nRepublican side voted for over here, adds $5 trillion to the debt over \nthe next 10 years. That is $500 billion a year. That is higher than any \nother budget deficit in history, until President Obama came into \noffice. We talked about the Bush budget deficits. It is a lot higher \nthan any deficit under President Bush--$500 billion a year for 10 \nyears. That is another $5 trillion. You can't say that is drastically \ncutting spending. The alternative, though, is the Obama budget, which \nwould add $12 trillion. At least the Ryan budget gets us on a path \nwhere we can get back into balance and back to the standard or the \nnormal historical average of spending, as a percent of our GDP, around \n20 percent.\n  If you don't like that budget, then produce one that you think will \nget us to the same place. We have laid that challenge down. Our \nDemocratic colleagues have not produced a budget. It is pretty obvious \nthey are not going to do so. That is why we have had to have these \ndiscussions with the Vice President. At least, perhaps as a conclusion \nto those discussions that the President is now involved in, we can make \na big downpayment on spending reductions, set the budget levels for the \nnext several years that represent a real reduction. It doesn't have to \nbe huge. Even a $30 billion reduction over last year will save a huge \namount of money in the outyears. We need to ensure that those \nreductions will be enforced, that we will not return to our wayward \nspending ways, and we need to deal with the two-thirds of the budget \nthat represents the big money; namely, entitlements.\n  There are ways to do so that don't represent big benefit cuts and \nthat don't represent slashing payments to providers, although we would \nnot have any more doctors to take care of them. We can effectuate \nreforms that will send the right signal to our constituents and also to \nthe markets, which will have a lot to say about interest rates in the \nfuture and whether they believe in the recovery we would like to \nachieve.\n  I hope my colleagues will be very open to the consideration of a \nbalanced budget amendment when we bring that up. I wish the President \nand the leaders of the House and Senate all the best in their \ndiscussions now on how to deal with this problem. The President will \nhave to make a decision: Is raising taxes more important than trying to \nget our budget back into balance and reduce spending? He will find \nthere is support on both sides for the latter. There would not be much \nsupport for the former. By getting together and achieving those goals \nwithin the next 4 weeks or so, we can both meet the deadline of August \n7 that he has set for a debt ceiling increase and also get our country \non a more sound fiscal path. We can do that to give confidence to the \nmarkets and to the American people. We owe our constituents, our \nchildren, and our grandchildren nothing less.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 27, 2011]\n\n   Spending His Way to Austerity--President Obama's Latest Economics \n                                 Lesson\n\n       President Obama enters the debt-ceiling talks today when he \n     meets with members of both parties, and in his Saturday \n     weekly radio address he unveiled a new line of argument \n     against significant spending cuts: ``We can't simply cut our \n     way to prosperity.''\n       That's a nifty rhetorical riff, a play off the old Ronald \n     Reagan line that we can't tax our way to prosperity. The \n     argument is that if we cut too much spending on too many good \n     things--like education, ``clean energy'' and ``advanced \n     manufacturing,'' to name three examples highlighted by the \n     President--the economy will suffer.\n       Too bad it won't fly. It's a truism that budget cuts alone \n     will not guarantee faster economic growth, but at the current \n     moment they will get us closer to it. With spending at 24% \n     and debt held by the public at 70% of GDP--both modern \n     records--the U.S. needs drastic spending cuts to head off a \n     downward future spiral of tax increases and unaffordable \n     interest payments. As Milton Friedman taught, spending is the \n     real measure of government's burden on the private economy, \n     and reducing it leaves more resources for private actors to \n     spend and invest.\n       It is also true that some government spending can be \n     economically useful--to the extent that it enhances \n     productivity more than it would have in the private economy. \n     But the irony is that it is precisely the spending priorities \n     that Mr. Obama mentions that will be crowded out because of \n     his refusal to cooperate in reforming entitlements like \n     Medicare and Social Security. By trying to protect all \n     federal spending except defense, liberals are guaranteeing \n     that many of their most cherished plans will be squeezed. \n     They're the ones who are spending us into austerity.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I stand to talk about a looming crisis in \nthis county, a problem that has the potential to affect every American \nfrom every State, from every political party, of every political \nideology. That issue relates to our national debt.\n  We have accumulated nearly $15 trillion in debt through the Federal \nGovernment, which is a lot of money split up amongst 300 million \nAmericans. It works out to close to $50,000 a head. A lot of people \ndon't make that much money in a year, and yet that is what every man, \nwoman, and child owes on a per capita basis the moment they are born. \nIf it is calculated out on the basis of debt per taxpayer, the number \nis much larger, anywhere between $120,000\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\nand $150,000 per head, depending on how you calculate it.\n  We are now approaching the August 2 deadline given to us by Secretary \nGeithner that has been identified as the time by which we must increase \nour national debt yet again, a debt that has been raised time and time \nagain, resulting in our accumulation of about $10 trillion of new debt \nin roughly the last decade. This is a problem, and it is a problem that \nis only going to become more severe the longer we kick this can down \nthe road without doing anything to change the way Washington brings \nmoney in and the way Washington spends money.\n  I want to talk for a minute first about how Washington brings money \nin. There are those who have suggested in this town very recently that \nwhat we need right now is a tax increase in order to address the debt \ncrisis. I could not disagree more, and I need to state with the \ngreatest emphasis I am able to place on this issue that a tax increase \nis something I would oppose, something I would devote every ounce of \nenergy in me to opposing. The reason is we have in Washington something \nthat is not a revenue problem. What we have is a spending problem. \nSpending is the crisis that we need to address.\n  But on a more fundamental level we have to remember what we do when \nwe raise taxes. When we raise taxes, we chill investment. It is \ninvestment that we rely on for the creation of jobs. We have to \nremember that government doesn't have the power to create jobs, because \nit can't create wealth. It can create policies. It can adopt laws and \nregulations designed to promote or deter certain kinds of behavior. It \ncan raise revenue through taxation. But it can't create wealth. All it \ncan do is set in place certain circumstances that might allow wealth to \nbe created or, in other circumstances, might deter new wealth from \nbeing created.\n  To have true wealth creation leading to true job creation, you have \nto have a circumstance in which willing investors with capital are \nready to invest, have the reasonable assurance and promise that if they \ninvest their money and thereby place it at risk, any gains resulting \nfrom that risky behavior will be gains that inure to their benefit, not \ntaken away by some third party and not taken away by the government. So \nwhen we raise taxes, in effect what we are doing is deterring \ninvestment, deterring investment at a time when we are hemorrhaging \njobs, and we can ill afford to lose any more. Not one job should be \nlost as a result of something the government does. We need to find ways \nto get the government out of the way so job creation can occur. But it \ncan't occur whenever we punish the investor, whenever we tell the \ninvestor: Invest at your own risk, because if you dare to make a \nprofit, we are going to take away more of that money than we have \npreviously been taking away in taxes.\n  For that reason, I continue to emphasize the fact that I will oppose \nany attempt to address this debt limit crisis by raising taxes, and I \nwill continue to oppose any effort to raise taxes. Spending is the \nproblem.\n  As to the question of how Washington spends money, if the definition \nof insanity is the practice of doing something again and again \nexpecting to achieve different results than we have achieved every time \nin the past, then we would be insane if we approach this debt limit \ndiscussion with the same kinds of tired, malfunctioning, unproductive \nstrategies that have been employed in the past, strategies that focus \nexclusively on immediate cuts or even long-term cuts. Let me explain \nwhat I mean.\n  As we approach the debt limit discussion, there will be those who \nwill want to focus a lot of the attention on long-term spending cuts. \nIn other words, they might say, If we are going to raise the debt limit \nby $1 trillion, then we need to find $1 trillion in cuts that can be \nmade. If we are going to raise it by $2 trillion, then we need to find \n$2 trillion to cut.\n  But of course we can't cut $1 trillion out of our budget immediately. \nThat is not possible. We can't do that in 1 year. That would have to be \nstretched over a period of many years. Most likely, in this scenario, \nas it has been discussed, it would be stretched over a period of a \ndecade or more.\n  We do have the power to control what we do in this Congress, but we \ncan't bind the Congress that will take power in January of 2013, \nJanuary of 2015, or 2017. Every 2 years, we get a new Congress in place \nand that Congress has the power to make those decisions that will best \nfit what they decide is in order at that time. We can't bind them \npermanently. So any promise that we make right now to cut, let's say, \n$2 trillion relies on the promise that that will be honored by future \nCongresses. We can't bind them to do that.\n  There is one way, however, we can bind them. That is by amending for \nthe 28th time that 224-year-old document that has fostered the \ndevelopment of the greatest civilization the world has ever known. When \nwe amend the U.S. Constitution, that is the one credible way, the one \nbinding way in which one group of Americans can bind a future group of \nAmericans. That is why I have said that the only circumstance in which \nI think it is appropriate for us to raise the debt limit is a \ncircumstance in which Congress has first passed a balanced budget \namendment out of Congress by the requisite two-thirds margin in this \nbody and in the House of Representatives, and submitted it to the \nStates for ratification. In that scenario, and only in that scenario, \ncan we proceed with any degree of confidence that the commitments we \nmake now to the American people, to make not just immediate cuts but \nlong-term changes to the way we spend money, it is only in that \nscenario that those promises can be and will be honored, because it is \nonly in that scenario that we can bind a future Congress.\n  That is why I have pledged to vote against, and to oppose in any way \nI can, any debt limit increase that involves something short of prior \npassage of a balanced budget amendment, in addition to any caps, in \naddition to any immediate cuts that may be raised.\n  We have got to have cuts. We have got to have some kind of spending \ncap, where we cap spending as a percentage of gross domestic product \nevery year, and we have got to have a constitutional amendment \nrequiring that and requiring the revenues and outlays match each other \nfrom year to year. If we don't have this, then we are at great risk for \nthe practice of perpetual deficit spending in which Congress year in \nand year out spends more than it takes in. Congress can sustain this \nfor a period of time. But where, as is now the case, the amount of \nmoney Congress spends is in excess of $1.5 trillion a year more than it \nbrings in, we have reached a certain point of unsustainability at \nwhich, if we continue with this practice, a halt in borrowing will be \nmuch more immediate, much more Draconian than anything that could be \nwithin our control. At some point, those who would be willing to loan \nus that money, who would be willing to buy U.S. Treasury instruments of \none form or another to finance our debt, will eventually start \ndemanding a higher and higher yield. That means that instead of \nspending about $250 billion a year on interest on our national debt, as \nwe are currently paying, the time could very soon come in which we \nmight have to pay something closer to $700 billion just to pay the \ninterest on our national debt. In fact, if we were now required to pay \ninterest rates on our Treasury instruments consistent with the 40-year \naverage, we would be about there.\n\n  Mr. President, $700 billion is a lot of money. Seven hundred billion \ndollars in a year is roughly what we spend on Social Security. It is \nroughly what we spend on Medicare and Medicaid combined in a year. It \nis roughly what we spend in national defense in an entire year. If we \nhave to spend that amount of money every year, as we could easily have \nto spend within just few years' time if we continue spending at this \nrate, that is going to crowd out funding for every Federal program out \nthere.\n  Whether you are most concerned, as many conservatives might be, about \nprotecting national defense or whether you are most concerned, as many \nliberals are, about protecting our entitlement programs, you ought to \ninsist, as I have been insisting, that we will not raise the debt limit \nuntil such time as the Congress has passed a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution. That is why I am pleased to support the \n``cut, cap, and balance'' pledge and why I will continue to take this \nposition in addition to standing\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\nfirm on my position that we ought not even consider any tax increase at \na time when we can least afford it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this is a pivotal moment in the history \nof our country. In the coming days and weeks, decisions will be made \nabout our national budget that will impact the lives of virtually every \nAmerican in this country for decades to come. The time is now for the \nAmerican people to become significantly involved in that debate and not \nleave it to a small number of people here in Washington.\n  At a time when the wealthiest people and the largest corporations in \nour country are doing phenomenally well and in many cases have never \nhad it so good, while the middle class is disappearing and poverty is \nincreasing, it is absolutely imperative that any deficit-reduction \npackage that passes this Congress not include the horrendous cuts, the \ncruel cuts in programs that working people desperately need that are \nutilized every day by the elderly, by the sick, by our children, and by \nthe lowest income people in our country, that the Republicans in \nCongress, dominated by their extreme rightwing, are demanding.\n  America is not about giving tax breaks to billionaires and attacking \nthe most vulnerable people in our country. We must not allow that to \nhappen.\n  In my view, the President of the United States needs to stand with \nthe vast majority of the American people and say no to the Republican \nleadership and make it clear that enough is enough. No, we will not \nbalance the budget on the backs of the most vulnerable people in this \ncountry--on our children, on our seniors and the sick. No, we will not \ndo that. Working families in this country have already sacrificed \nenough in terms of lost jobs, lost wages, lost homes, lost pensions. \nThe working families of this country are hurting right now. Enough is \nenough.\n  Now is the time to say to the millionaires and the billionaires in \nthis country and to the largest corporations that in many ways have \nnever had it so good that they must participate in deficit reduction, \nthat there must be shared sacrifice, that deficit reduction cannot be \nbased on cutting back on the needs of working families and the middle \nclass but that the rich and large corporations have also got to \nparticipate in this process.\n  Furthermore, it is absolutely necessary, if we are talking about a \nsensible deficit-reduction package, that we take a hard look at \nunnecessary and wasteful spending at the Pentagon.\n  Let's make it very clear that we will not be blackmailed again by the \nRepublican leadership in Washington that is threatening to destroy the \nfull faith and credit of the U.S. Government so that, for the very \nfirst time in our Nation's history, we might not pay the bills we owe. \nThat is their threat. We will destroy the record of always paying our \nbills, never failing to do that, unless they get everything they want.\n  Instead of yielding to the incessant, extreme Republican demands, as \nthe President in many respects did in last December's tax cut agreement \nand this year's spending negotiations, the President has to get out of \nthe beltway. He has to connect with the needs of working families and \nordinary Americans and rally the overwhelming majority of our people \nwho believe that deficit reduction must be based on shared sacrifice, \nthat the wealthy and the powerful and the large corporations cannot \ncontinue to get everything they want while we wage a cruel and \nunprecedented attack on the most vulnerable people in this country. It \nis time for President Obama to stand with the millions who have already \nlost their jobs, their homes, their life savings, instead of the \nmillionaires, who in many cases have never had it so good.\n  Unless the American people in huge numbers tell the President not to \nyield 1 inch to Republican demands to destroy Medicare and Medicaid \nwhile continuing to provide tax breaks to the wealthy and the powerful, \nunless the American people rise up and say enough is enough, I am \nafraid that what will happen is the President will yield once again and \nthe wealthy and the powerful will laugh all the way to the bank, while \nworking people will be devastated.\n  Today, I am asking the American people that if you believe deficit \nreduction should be about shared sacrifice; if you believe the \nwealthiest people in our country and the largest corporations should be \nasked to pay their fair share as part of deficit reduction; if you \nbelieve that, at a time when military spending has almost tripled since \n1997, we must begin to take a hard look at our defense budget; and if \nyou believe the middle-class and working families have already \nsacrificed enough, I urge you to make sure the President hears your \nvoice, and he needs to hear it now. I urge the American people to go to \nmy Web site, sanders.senate.gov, and sign a letter to the President \nletting him know that enough is enough. I also urge the American people \nto contact the White House directly through their Web sites and leave a \nmessage for the President there.\n  As you know, this country faces enormous challenges. In fact, we have \nnot suffered through such a difficult moment since the Great Depression \nof the 1930s. We do not talk about it very much, but the reality is \nthat the middle class in this country is disappearing while at the same \ntime poverty is increasing.\n  When we talk about the state of our economy, it is important to talk \nabout it within the context of deficit reduction because when you \nunderstand what is going on in the economy, you know you cannot get \nblood out of a stone. You cannot keep attacking people who have been \ndevastated in the last few years in terms of unemployment, in terms of \nlosses of pension, in terms of losses of health care.\n  When we talk about the economy, we have to understand that the \nsituation is in many cases even worse than official statistics \nindicate. For example, we read in the papers that the official \nunemployment rate is now 9.1 percent. But the truth is--and no \neconomist disagrees with this--that official statistic ignores the \nnumber of people who have given up looking for work and people who are \nworking part time when they want to work full time. If you add all of \nthat together, you are looking at a real unemployment rate in this \ncountry of about 16 percent. Are those really the people whom we should \ngo to for deficit reduction? Are they not suffering enough right now? \nYoung people graduating college who can't find a job, let's hit them \nhard. Older people who have lost their jobs and can't find a new one or \nare working for half the wages they previously worked at, let's go \nafter those people. Fifty million people have no health insurance. \nLet's attack them. Working mothers and fathers cannot find affordable \nchildcare. Let's go after them.\n  We must understand that when we look at the economy, the middle class \nis hurting and hurting badly. Over the last 10 years, on top of the \nhigh unemployment rates, the median family income in this country has \ndeclined by over $2,500. Do you know why working families are angry? \nThat is why they are angry. They are working longer hours for lower \nwages. Are those really the people you want to ask to balance the \nbudget? I don't think so. I think any sense of fairness, any sense of \nmorality that one might have suggests you do not beat up on people who \nare already suffering. You don't try to get blood out of a stone.\n  As a result of the greed and the recklessness and the illegal \nbehavior on Wall Street which caused this terrible recession, millions \nmore Americans have lost their homes, they have lost their pensions, \nand they have lost their retirement savings. We hear it every day in \ncalls that come to our offices. Unless we reverse our current economic \ncosts, our children will have, for\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\nthe very first time in modern American history, a lower standard of \nliving than their parents. It is the American dream in reverse. Kids \nare going to do worse than their parents unless we reverse current \neconomic trends.\n\n  We can throw out a lot of numbers around here, a few hundred billion \nand a trillion. But the truth is that behind those numbers in my State \nof Vermont and all over this country, there are real people who are \nhurting terribly, and as Members of the Senate our job is to pay \nattention to those people and not just the well-paid lobbyists, \nrepresenting the most powerful special interests in the world, who \nsurround this Capitol every single day.\n  Last year I asked my constituents in Vermont to share some personal \nstories with me. I asked them basically: How are you doing in this \nrecession? The stories I got back from Vermont, I am sure, are \nabsolutely similar to the stories you would get in Delaware or anyone \nwould get in Michigan or any other State in this country. I asked them: \nHow are things going? Let me tell you as a result of the e-mail we sent \nout, we had more than 400 Vermonters responding to that e-mail, and \nwhat they had to say was poignant. Sometimes these stories were so \npowerful, it was almost hard to read more than a few at a time. The \nmessage I received from Vermont--I suspect similar messages are coming \nfrom every State in this country--is that people are finding it hard to \nget jobs. They are now working for lower wages than they used to earn. \nWe are seeing older workers who have depleted their life's savings, and \nthey are worried about how they are going to retire. What happens to \nthem when they are unable to work anymore? Who is going to take care of \nthem?\n  We hear from young adults in their twenties and thirties who are \ndeeply in debt from college loans, and they don't know how they are \ngoing to pay off those loans. We hear from people of all ages, all \nwalks of life, from every corner of Vermont, who have sent us their \nstories. Let me read a few of them, to make the point to put some flesh \nand blood behind the statistics we often throw out.\n  We have a letter from a 51-year-old woman from central Vermont. This \nis what she wrote:\n\n       Dear Senator Sanders, Don't really know what to say, I \n     could cry. My significant other was out of work for a year, \n     now he works in another state. I've been out of work since \n     April. Our mortgage company wants the house because we can't \n     make the payments. I can't find a job to save my soul that \n     will pay enough to make a difference. How bad does it have to \n     get! My mother went through the Great Depression and here we \n     go again. I figure that I'm going to lose everything soon! \n     I'm a well educated person who can't see through the fog.\n\n  A gentleman in his mid-fifties from Orange County, VT, writes:\n\n       After being unemployed three times since 1999 due to global \n     trade agreements, I now find myself managing a hazardous \n     waste transfer facility that pays about 25 percent than what \n     I was making in 1999.\n\n  You hear that all of the time. Yes, many people, of course, are \nworking, but many older workers today are dealing with the humiliation \nand the economic tragedy of now earning substantially less than they \nearned 10 or 20 years ago.\n  He continues:\n\n       My wife's children have moved back in, unemployed. And we \n     are saving very little for retirement. If things don't \n     improve soon we will likely have to work until we die. We \n     consider ourselves lucky that we are employed. Our children's \n     friends tend to show up around meal time. They are skinny. We \n     feed them. This is no recession, it's a modern day \n     depression.\n\n  Are those the people we want to go after when we talk about deficit \nreduction? Are they not suffering enough already?\n  A woman in her late forties from Westminster, VT, writes:\n\n       I am a single mom in Vermont, nearly 50. I patch together a \n     full time job making $12 an hour and various painting jobs \n     and still can't afford to get myself out of debt, or make \n     necessary repairs on my home. No other jobs in sight, I apply \n     all the time to no avail. Food and gas bills go up and up, \n     but not my income. I have no retirement at all, can't afford \n     to move, feeling stuck, tired, and hopeless.\n\n  ``Stuck, tired and hopeless.'' I suspect that sentiment reflects how \nmany millions of Americans are feeling today.\n  I have another letter from a 26-year-old man from Barre, VT. He \nwrites:\n\n       In 2002, I received a scholarship to Saint Bonaventure \n     University, the first in my family to attend college. Upon \n     graduation in 2006, I was admitted to the Dickinson School of \n     Law at Penn State University, and graduated in 2009 with \n     $150,000 of student loan debt.\n\n  Mr. President, $150,000. That is high. But there are people all over \nthis country who have extremely high student loans, and they don't know \nhow they are going to pay them off.\n  Then he continues:\n\n       In Western New York I can find nothing better than a $10 an \n     hour position stuffing envelopes. I live in a small studio \n     apartment in Barre without cable or Internet. I have told my \n     family I don't want them to visit because I am ashamed of my \n     surroundings. My family always told me that an education was \n     the ticket to success, but all my education seems to have \n     done in this landscape is make it impossible to pull myself \n     out of debt and begin a successful career.\n\n  On and on it goes. Over the last couple of weeks we have been \nfocusing in my office on the crisis in dental care, the fact that in \nVermont and all over this country millions of people cannot find a \ndentist.\n  I want to give you an idea. I am raising these issues today, and I am \nquoting from folks in Vermont. Again, these stories are not just from \nVermont. In fact, Vermont is doing better in this recession than most \nStates in this country are doing. So take what we are talking about \nhere in Vermont and multiply it by several times for other States.\n  A gentleman writes to me within the last couple of weeks. He says: \n``I can't afford health insurance, so dental work is definitely out.'' \nAnd he talks about how studies have linked bad dental care to heart \nproblems and cancer, but he cannot get to a dentist.\n  The reason I raise this issue is to try to give us a better \nunderstanding of who some of the people are who will be impacted by the \nDraconian cuts the Republicans are talking about. Let us be clear. They \nare talking about throwing millions and millions of people off \nMedicaid.\n  Let me tell you what that means. Earlier this year, as you know, \nArizona passed budget cuts that took patients off its transplant list. \nRemember reading about that? I think most of the country read about \nthat. Essentially because of the financial reasons, what they said in \nArizona is: Yes, you need a transplant; yes, you are not all that old, \nbut I am sorry, we cannot afford it for you, and you are going to have \nto die. And people have died. In that State and in other States \nthroughout this country hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people \nare being thrown off Medicaid.\n  So what does that mean? What does it mean if you are a low-income \nworker and you are getting your health insurance through Medicaid and \nyou lose Medicaid? What happens when you develop a pain in your chest \nand you think you may be having a heart problem but you cannot get to a \ndoctor? What happens? Have our Republican friends thought that through \nwhen they proposed $700 billion in cuts in Medicaid? What happens to \nthe children by the millions who are thrown off Medicaid? We have 50 \nmillion people today who have no health insurance. If the Republican \nplan goes through, we are talking about tens of millions more. What \nhappens to those people? As Americans are we content to see kids get \nsick because they cannot get to a doctor or people die because they \ndon't get to a doctor on time? I don't think so.\n  I have learned and have been told throughout my whole life that \neducation is the key to success. We hear that on the floor of this \nSenate every single day. Education, education. Kids have got to do well \nin high school so they will be able to go to college. The reality right \nnow is hundreds of thousands of bright young people cannot afford to go \nto college because they don't have the money, and we are losing their \nintellectual capabilities to make us a stronger nation. If the \nRepublicans get their way, and make savage cuts in Pell grants, no one \nhas any doubt that hundreds of thousands more young people will never \nbe able to walk into a college or a university. That is not only a \ntragedy for the individuals, for the young people themselves, it is a \ntragedy for this Nation. Every day we are involved in fierce \ncompetition in the global economy, and we are not doing well in \neducational levels. We are\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\nseeing other countries graduate more of their students from college, \nand that gap is growing wider. If you cut back on Pell grants and other \nforms of college aid, it is clear that a bad situation will be made \nmuch worse.\n\n  Let's get even more basic, more basic than health care, more basic \nthan education, and that comes to nutrition, whether people in larger \nand larger numbers in this country are going to go hungry. According to \na 2009 study, there are over 5 million seniors who face the threat of \nhunger, almost 3 million who are at risk of going hungry and almost 1 \nmillion seniors who do go hungry because they cannot afford to buy \nfood. In that context our Republican friends want to balance the budget \non the backs of the hungry, cut back on food stamps, cut back on other \nnutrition programs. So what happens if you are 80 and food prices are \ngoing up and you don't have enough to eat? Well, apparently there are \nsome people here in the Senate who don't worry about that, but I \npersonally do not believe that is what America is about. I think the \nAmerican people, by huge numbers, do not want to see hunger increase \nfor our seniors or our children.\n  This is a lot of pain the Republicans are tossing out while at the \nsame time they are vigorously protecting their wealthy and powerful \nfriends. In my view, the President of the United States has to stand \ntall. He has to take the case to the American people and he has to hold \nthe Republicans responsible if, in fact, the debt ceiling is not \nraised, and all of the repercussions that will occur if that happens.\n  I have given you just an inkling of what is going on in the real \nworld, and I know all over this country, ordinary Americans, working-\nclass people, have a lot more to say about what is going on in their \nlives. As we speak, people are fighting desperately to keep their homes \nfrom falling into foreclosure. They are struggling with 29 percent, 30 \npercent interest rates on their credit cards, which they are never able \nto pay off. Marriages have been postponed because the young people \ndon't have the money to settle down, lives have been derailed, \nretirement savings have been raided to pay for college tuition or to \nkeep businesses afloat or to simply put gas in the car at $3.80 a \ngallon in order to get to work. That is what is going on in the real \nworld. That is what it means when we talk about the middle-class \ncollapsing and poverty is increasing.\n  While all of that happens, it is important to note there is another \neconomic reality taking place in this country. Poverty is increasing. \nWe have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on \nEarth. We are seeing an increase in senior citizens who are going \nhungry, more and more families unable to send their kids to college. \nBut there is another reality out there, and that is that the gap \nbetween the wealthiest people in this country and everybody else is \ngrowing wider and wider and has not been this wide since before the \nGreat Depression of 1929 began. Let us be very clear, and there is \nnothing to be proud about, but the United States today has, by far, the \nmost unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country on \nEarth.\n  Today, the top 1 percent earns over 20 percent of all income in this \ncountry, which is more than the bottom 50 percent. One percent owns \nmore income than the bottom 50 percent. Over the recent 25-year period, \n80 percent of all new income created in this country went to the top 1 \npercent. Even more dramatic, even more incredible, even more unfair in \nterms of distribution of wealth, which is accumulated income, as hard \nas it may be to comprehend, in America today the top 400 individuals \nown more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans. Again, 400 \nAmericans own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans.\n  Given those realities, it doesn't take a Ph.D. in economics to \nsuggest that when we move forward with deficit reduction, that deficit \nreduction must include shared sacrifice. The wealthy and large \ncorporations also have to help this country deal with record-breaking \ndeficit.\n  The reality is simple but unfortunate. That reality is that the rich \nare getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, and the middle class \ncontinues to disappear. That is what is going on in this country, and \nthere is no hiding it. We have to acknowledge it. We have to go on from \nthere.\n  Everyone knows that in our country today we are facing a major \ndeficit crisis, and we have a national debt of over $14 trillion. What \nhas not been widely discussed and what must be discussed is how we got \ninto that deficit situation in the first place. If we are going to deal \nwith the deficit, we have to know how we got into it. What is very \nclear is that this huge record-breaking deficit and a $14 trillion \nnational debt did not just happen overnight, and it didn't happen by \naccident. It happened, in fact, as a result of a number of policy \ndecisions made over the last decade and votes that were cast right here \non the floor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives.\n  When we talk about the deficit and the national debt, let's never \nforget that in January of 2001--a little over 10 years ago--when \nPresident Bill Clinton left office, this country had an annual Federal \nbudget surplus of $236 billion with projected budget surpluses as far \nas the eye could see. That was when Clinton left office some 10 years \nago. Now we have a $1.5 trillion deficit and a growing national debt.\n  It is totally appropriate as we talk about deficit reduction that we \nask some simple questions: How did we get to where we are today in \nterms of the deficit? What happened in that ensuing 10 years? How did \nwe go from huge projected surpluses into horrendous debt? The answer \nreally is not complicated, and there is not a lot of disagreement. We \nknow exactly what has happened. The Congressional Budget Office has \ndocumented it. There was an interesting article on the front page of \nthe Washington Post on April 30 talking about it as well, and here is \nwhat happened. I don't think there is a lot of disagreement about this.\n  When our Nation spends $1 trillion on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq \nand forgets to pay for those wars, we run up a deficit. When we provide \nover $700 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry and choose not to offset those tax breaks, we run up a deficit. \nWhen we pass a Medicare Part D prescription drug program written by the \ndrug companies and the insurance companies that does not allow Medicare \nto negotiate prescription drug prices and ends up costing us far more \nthan it should--$400 billion over a 10-year period--and we don't pay \nfor that, we run up a deficit. When we double military spending since \n1997, not including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we don't pay \nfor that, we run up the deficit.\n  Now, I always find it amusing when some of my Republican colleagues \ncome to the floor and lecture some of us about how serious the deficit \nis and how serious the national debt is. Yet, ironically, many of us \nvoted against those proposals which, in fact, caused the deficit crisis \nwe are in right now. I paid a lot of attention during the debate over \nthe war in Iraq. I don't recall many of our friends on the Republican \nside or the Democrats who voted for that war saying: Gee, we can't go \nto war because it is going to cost this country a huge sum of money. I \ndon't remember hearing that.\n  When we bailed out Wall Street to the tune of $700 billion, I don't \nrecall many of my friends saying: Oh, my goodness, we can't afford to \ndo that. When we gave $700 billion in tax breaks to the wealthiest \npeople in this country, where was the concern then about deficit \nreduction? Further, and maybe even most significant, the deficit we are \nin right now was caused by the recession we are in, which was, of \ncourse, caused by the greed and illegal behavior on Wall Street, which \ncaused the economic condition of the moment: massive unemployment and \nloss of a very substantial amount of revenue that otherwise would have \ncome into our tax coffers.\n  The end result of all of these unpaid-for policies and actions year \nafter year of the deficits I just described is a staggering amount of \ndebt. When President Bush left office, President Obama inherited an \nannual deficit of $1.3 trillion with deficits as far as the eye could \nsee, and the national debt more than doubled--more than doubled--under \nPresident Bush because of all of these policy decisions made by \nRepublicans and some Democrats. The reality is, if we did not go to war \nin Iraq, if we did not pass huge tax breaks for millionaires and \nbillionaires, if we did not pass\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\na prescription drug program with no cost control written by the drug \nand insurance companies, and if we did not deregulate Wall Street which \nallowed them to do the things they did, which ended up in Wall Street's \ncollapse and the ensuing recession, we would not find ourselves in the \nmess we are in today. It really is that simple.\n  In other words, the only reason we have to increase our Nation's debt \nceiling today is that we are forced to pay the bills the Republican \nleadership in Congress--and some Democrats--and President Bush racked \nup.\n  Given the decline in the middle class, given the increase in poverty, \nand given the fact that the wealthy and large corporations have never \nhad it so good, Americans might find it strange that the Republicans in \nWashington would use this moment to make savage cuts in Medicare, \nMedicaid, education, nutrition assistance, and other life-and-death \nprograms, while at the same time pushing for even more tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations. \nUnfortunately, while the average American may think this is pretty \nweird, inside the beltway that is exactly what happens, and this is \nvery much part of the Republican ideology.\n  Republicans in Washington have never believed in Medicaid or in \nMedicare or in Federal assistance in education or providing any direct \ngovernment assistance to those in need. They have always believed tax \nbreaks for the wealthy and the powerful would somehow miraculously \ntrickle down to every American despite all history and all evidence to \nthe contrary. So in that sense it is not strange at all that they would \nuse the deficit crisis we are now in as an opportunity for an \nideological attack against some of the most vulnerable people in our \ncountry.\n  That is exactly what the Ryan Republican budget, passed in the House \nof Representatives earlier this year and supported by the vast majority \nof Republicans in the Senate just last month, is all about. It is a \nlong budget, so let me give just a few examples of what the Ryan \nRepublican budget would do.\n  The Republican budget passed by the House this year would end \nMedicare as we know it within 10 years. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that under the Ryan proposal, in 2022, a \nprivate health care plan for a 65-year-old equivalent to Medicare \ncoverage would cost about $20,500. Yet the Republican budget would \nprovide a voucher for only $8,000 of those premiums. Seniors would be \non their own to pay the remaining $12,500, a full 61 percent of the \ntotal. Now, how many of the 20 million near elderly Americans who are \nnow ages 50 to 54 will be able to afford that?\n  So let's review what we have. Let's say when a person becomes 65 in \n10 years and they are earning or living on $15,000 in Social Security, \nthey are going to be asked to pay $12,500 more for health care than is \ncurrently the case. How do they do that? What kind of health care plan \nare they going to buy when they are old and sick and are given an \n$8,000 voucher? How many days in the hospital will they be able to \nhave? You can run up an $8,000 bill in 1 day, in 2 days. So this ending \nof Medicare as we know it, forcing seniors to somehow come up with all \nkinds of money that in many cases they don't have, will be a disaster \nfor tens of millions of people.\n  The Republican budget would also force 4 million seniors in this \ncountry to pay $3,500 more on average for their prescription drugs by \nreopening the Medicare Part D doughnut hole. That goes into effect as \nsoon as that bill would be passed, if it were to be passed.\n  Under the Republican budget, nearly 2 million children would lose \ntheir health insurance over the next 5 years by cuts to the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program according, again, to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. At a time when 50 million Americans have no health insurance, \nthe Republican budget would cut Medicaid by over $770 billion, causing \nmillions and millions of Americans to lose their health insurance, and \nit would cut nursing home assistance in half.\n  Right now, Medicaid pays the lion's share of nursing home care. If we \nmake savage cuts in Medicaid, what happens to the elderly who are in \nnursing homes and what happens to their children in terms of trying to \nprovide the help their parents desperately need?\n  The Republican budget would completely repeal the affordable health \ncare act, preventing an estimated 34 million uninsured Americans from \ngetting the health insurance they need.\n  At a time when the cost of college education is becoming out of reach \nfor so many Americans, the Republican budget would slash college Pell \ngrants by about 60 percent next year alone, reducing the maximum award \nfrom $5,500 to $2,100.\n  At a time when over 40 million Americans do not have enough money to \nfeed themselves or their families, the Republican budget would kick \nsome 10 million Americans off of food stamps. What kind of sense of \nmorality is that, that when people today are struggling hard in order \nto feed themselves, we throw another 10 million people off food stamps?\n  It is no secret to anyone that our Nation's infrastructure is \ncrumbling. The Republican budget passed in the House and supported by \nall but a handful of Republicans here in the Senate would slash funding \nfor our roads, bridges, rail lines, transit systems, and airports by \nnearly 40 percent next year alone. One of two things would happen: \nEither, as a result of this, our infrastructure continues to \ndeteriorate or else hard-pressed cities and towns are going to have to \nraise property taxes and other regressive taxes in order to come up \nwith a differential. Yet, despite the fact--we talked about cuts in \nhealth care, Medicare, Medicaid, education, nutrition, environmental \nprotection--yet, despite all of those cuts, when it comes to military \nspending, which has tripled since 1997, the House Republican budget \ndoes nothing to reduce unnecessary defense spending. In fact, defense \nspending would go up by $26 billion next year alone under the \nRepublican plan.\n  Interestingly enough, at a time when the rich are becoming richer, \nwhen the effective tax rates for the wealthiest people--at 18 percent--\nare about the lowest on record, at a time when the top 2 percent have \nreceived hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks, at \na time when corporate profits are at an alltime high and major \ncorporations making billions of dollars in profits are not paying a \nnickel in taxes, my Republican colleagues, in their approach toward \ndeficit reduction, do not ask the wealthiest people in this country or \nthe largest corporations to tribute one penny--one penny--toward \ndeficit reduction.\n  Poverty is increasing. Republicans cut programs for the most \nvulnerable people in this country. The middle class is disappearing, in \nneed of great help. Republicans cut the safety line from them. The \nrich, who are getting richer, and large corporations, making huge \nprofits and in many cases not paying anything in taxes at all, their \nrequirement is to receive even more in terms of tax breaks.\n  Now, that may make sense to some people. It does not make sense to \nme. In fact, what the Republicans want to do is provide over $1 \ntrillion in tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires by permanently \nextending all of the Bush income tax cuts, reducing the estate tax for \nmultimillionaires and billionaires, and lowering the top individual and \ncorporate income tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent. The rich get \nricher. They get tax breaks. The poor get poorer. They lose their \nability to send their kids to college or to have nutrition programs or \nhealth care.\n  The Republican idea of moving toward a balanced budget is to go after \nthe middle class working families and low-income people, and to make \nsure millionaires and billionaires and the largest corporations in this \ncountry, which are in many cases doing phenomenally well right now, do \nnot have to share in the sacrifices being made by everybody else. They \nwill be protected.\n  The Republican approach to deficit reduction in Washington is the \nRobin Hood philosophy in reverse: We take from the poorest people and \nwe give to the richest people. And it is not as if that approach is \ngood for our economy. Mark Zandi, the former economic adviser to John \nMcCain when he was running for President, has estimated that the \nRepublican budget plan will cost 1.7 million jobs by the year 2014, \nwith 900,000 jobs lost next year alone.\n  The House Republican budget is breathtaking in its degree of cruelty. \nBut do not take my word for it. In a\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\nletter to congressional leaders, after the House GOP plan was \nintroduced, nearly 200 economists and health care experts wrote:\n\n       Turning Medicare into a voucher program would undermine \n     essential protections for millions of vulnerable people. It \n     would extinguish the most promising approaches to curb costs \n     and to improve the American medical care system.\n\n  Ezra Klein, a columnist at the Washington Post, wrote last April:\n\n       The budget Ryan released is not courageous or serious or \n     significant. It's a joke, and a bad one. For one thing, \n     Ryan's savings all come from cuts, and at least two-thirds of \n     them come from programs serving the poor. The wealthy, \n     meanwhile, would see their taxes lowered, and the Defense \n     Department would escape unscathed. It is not courageous to \n     attack the weak while supporting your party's most inane and \n     damaging fiscal orthodoxies. But the problem isn't just that \n     Ryan's budget is morally questionable. It also wouldn't work.\n\n  The deficit we are struggling with right now has been caused by \nunpaid-for wars, tax breaks for the rich, a Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program written by the insurance companies, the \nbailout of Wall Street, a declining economy, and less revenue coming \ninto our Treasury. The Republican ``solution'' is to balance the budget \non the backs of the sick, the elderly, the children, and the poor, to \ncut back on environmental protection, to cut back on transportation, \nwhile providing even more tax breaks to those who do not need it. That \nis unacceptable, and that is what the American people have to stop.\n  It is not just wealthy individuals who are making out like bandits. \nAs hard as it may be to believe, some of the largest, most profitable \ncorporations in this country are not only avoiding paying any Federal \nincome taxes whatsoever, but they are actually receiving tax rebates \nfrom the IRS. The Republican response to this reality is to provide \neven more tax breaks to these corporate freeloaders. That may make \nsense to someone. It does not make sense to me.\n  What I want to do, Mr. President--and I ask unanimous consent to do \nso--is to have printed in the Record a list of a number of corporations \nthat are making huge profits and are paying virtually nothing in taxes \nand in some cases getting a rebate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (1) Exxon Mobil. In 2009, Exxon Mobil made $19 billion in \n     profits. Not only did Exxon avoid paying any federal income \n     taxes that year, it actually received a $156 million rebate \n     from the IRS, according to its SEC filings.\n       (2) Bank of America. Last year, Bank of America received a \n     $1.9 billion tax refund from the IRS, even though it made \n     $4.4 billion in profits and just a couple of years ago \n     received a bailout from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury \n     Department of nearly $1 trillion.\n       (3) General Electric. Over the past five years, while \n     General Electric made $26 billion in profits in the United \n     States, it received a $4.1 billion refund from the IRS.\n       (4) Chevron. In 2009, Chevron received a $19 million refund \n     from the IRS after it made $10 billion in profits.\n       (5) Boeing. Last year, Boeing, which received a $30 billion \n     contract from the Pentagon to build 179 airborne tankers, got \n     a $124 million refund from the IRS.\n       (6) Valero Energy. Last year, Valero Energy, the 25th \n     largest company in America with $68 billion in sales last \n     year received a $157 million tax refund check from the IRS \n     and, over the past three years, it received a $134 million \n     tax break from the oil and gas manufacturing tax deduction.\n       (7) Goldman Sachs. In 2008, Goldman Sachs paid only 1.1 \n     percent of its income in taxes even though it earned a profit \n     of $2.3 billion and received an almost $800 billion bailout \n     from the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury Department.\n       (8) Citigroup. Last year, Citigroup made more than $4 \n     billion in profits but paid no federal income taxes, even \n     though it received a $2.5 trillion bailout from the Federal \n     Reserve and U.S. Treasury.\n       (9) ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips, the fifth largest oil \n     company in the United States, made $16 billion in profits \n     from 2007 through 2009, but received $451 million in tax \n     breaks through the oil and gas manufacturing deduction during \n     those years.\n       (10) Carnival Cruise Lines. Over the past five years, \n     Carnival Cruise Lines made more than $11 billion in profits, \n     but its federal income tax rate during those years was just \n     1.1 percent.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me briefly read from this list of corporate \nfreeloaders.\n  No. 1, ExxonMobil, the largest oil company in the world. In 2009, \nExxonMobil made $19 billion in profits, and not only did ExxonMobil \navoid paying any Federal income taxes that year, they actually received \na $156 million rebate from the IRS, according to its SEC filings. Well, \ndo you think maybe we might want to ask ExxonMobil to pay a little in \ntaxes so we do not have to throw children off their health insurance? \nMaybe.\n  Bank of America. Last year, Bank of America, the largest bank in \nAmerica, received a $1.9 billion tax refund from the IRS even though it \nmade $4.4 billion in profits and just a couple of years ago received a \nbailout from the Federal Reserve in the Treasury Department of nearly \n$1 trillion. Well, what do you know about that? We are bailing out the \nlargest banks in this country, whose greed caused the recession, and \nthen they get a rebate from the IRS rather than paying any taxes. Yet \nour Republican friends think the solution to deficit reduction is not \nto ask Bank of America to pay its fair share but to end Medicare as we \nknow it and force low-income seniors to pay substantially more for \ntheir health care.\n  No. 3, General Electric. Over the past 5 years, while General \nElectric made $26 billion in profits in the United States, it received \na $4.1 billion refund from the IRS. I do not know. What do you think? \nDo you think we should ask GE maybe to help us out just a little bit \nwith deficit reduction?\n  Chevron, a major oil company, received a $19 million refund from the \nIRS after it made $10 billion in profits.\n  Last year, Boeing, which received a $30 billion contract from the \nPentagon to build 179 airborne tankers, got a $124 million refund from \nthe IRS.\n  And on and on it goes.\n  Valero Energy.\n  Goldman Sachs. In 2008, Goldman Sachs paid only 1.1 percent of its \nincome in taxes even though it earned a profit of $2.3 billion. Gee, \nmost Americans would be pretty happy to pay 1.1 percent of their income \nin taxes. But then again, they are not Goldman Sachs.\n  Citigroup, ConocoPhillips, Carnival Cruise Lines.\n  On and on and on. You have large, extremely profitable corporations \nthat either pay nothing in taxes or get a rebate from the IRS. Maybe--\njust maybe--when we talk about deficit reduction, we might want to ask \nthose people to help us out rather than go after the elderly, the sick, \nthe children, and the poor.\n  Large corporations today are sitting on a recordbreaking $2 trillion \nin cash. The problem is not that corporations are taxed too much; the \nproblem is that consumers do not have enough money to buy their \nproducts, and the Republican agenda would make that far worse. \nCorporate tax revenue last year was down by 27 percent compared to 2000 \neven though corporate profits are up 60 percent over the last decade. \nThese guys make more and more money; their contribution to the Treasury \ngoes down.\n  When we talk about how we can--in a fair way, in a responsible way--\ndeal with our deficit and our national debt, man, here is one very \nclear example, as shown in this picture. Here you have, in the Cayman \nIslands, a building. I think it is a four-story building, and it looks \nlike a normal-size four-story building. Yet it has 18,857 companies \nthat call this building their home. Now, one of two things is going on: \nEither these guys are very, very crowded--18,000 corporations in this \none four-story building; maybe they are very crowded, and we should \ncall in the zoning people in the Cayman Islands to check that out--or \nmaybe something else is going on. Of course, what is going on is this \nis a total, absolute fraud. This is a building that does not house \nanybody. It is a phony address that 18,000-plus corporations use for \nthe explicit purpose of not paying taxes to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  There are studies out there which suggest that large corporations and \nwealthy individuals are avoiding $100 billion in taxes every year by \nsetting up these offshore tax shelters in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, \nand the Bahamas. Maybe, maybe, maybe, before we tell young people they \ncannot go to college or single moms they cannot get childcare for their \nkids or low-income seniors we are going to cut back on their nutrition, \nmaybe, just maybe, we might want to end this blatant outrage, which \ncosts us $100 billion every single year.\n  In 2005, one out of four large corporations paid no income taxes at \nall even\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\nthough they collected $1.1 trillion in revenue. What about looking \nthere for revenue? Our Republican friends say: Oh, no, no, no. We can't \ndo that. We have to force elderly people to pay more in Medicare, throw \nkids off Medicaid.\n  Now, what is a very interesting point--and, frankly, we are all \npoliticians. You do not get elected to the Senate if you do not \nunderstand something about politics. What I do not understand--and \ncertainly what President Obama needs to understand--is that the \noverwhelming majority of the American people do not agree with the \nRepublican approach, which says: Give tax breaks to billionaires and go \nafter the elderly, the sick, the children, and the poor. That is not \njust Bernie Sanders talking. I am not much into polls, to be honest \nwith you, but I think it is important to just try to get a little bit \nof a reflection of where the American people are coming from.\n  According to a recent Boston Globe poll--a couple weeks ago, the \nBoston Globe did a poll in the State of New Hampshire and was mostly \ninterested in the Presidential campaign, how Presidential candidates \nare doing in New Hampshire, but they asked some other questions. In New \nHampshire--I know because they are a neighbor of mine--they are the big \nantitax State. They are the conservative State in New England. Here is \nwhat the folks in New Hampshire said in that recent poll.\n  Seventy-three percent support raising taxes on people making over \n$250,000 a year, 78 percent oppose cutting Medicare, 71 percent oppose \ncutting Medicaid, and 76 percent oppose cutting Social Security.\n  The Republican approach is the opposite. They want to cut Medicare, \nthey want to cut Medicaid, they want to cut Social Security, and they \ncertainly do not want to ask the wealthiest people in this country to \npay a nickel more in taxes.\n  That is one poll. Let's look at another poll. In fact, poll after \npoll has more or less mirrored what New Hampshire voters are saying.\n  A recent NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll found the following: 81 \npercent of the American people believe it is totally acceptable or \nmostly acceptable--that is how they frame these polls--to impose a \nsurtax on millionaires to reduce the deficit. Let me repeat that. \nEighty-one percent of the American people--in the Wall Street Journal-\nNBC poll--think it is totally acceptable or mostly acceptable to impose \na surtax on millionaires to reduce the deficit.\n  Eighty-one percent of the American people think it is a good idea. \nYet we cannot get one Republican to ask the wealthy to pay a nickel \nmore in taxes. Talk about being out of touch with what the American \npeople want.\n  Seventy four-percent--in that same poll--of the American people \nbelieve it is totally acceptable or mostly acceptable to eliminate tax \ncredits for the oil and gas industry, and on and on it goes.\n  Seventy-six percent believe it is totally unacceptable or mostly \nunacceptable to cut Medicare to significantly reduce the deficit.\n  Here is an interesting poll that maybe some of my Republican friends \nwant to pay attention to; that is, that while the leaders of the tea \nparty here in Washington are fighting to dismantle Medicare and \nMedicaid, it turns out that in another poll done by McClatchy, 70 \npercent of those people who identify themselves with the tea party \noppose cutting Medicare and Medicaid to reduce the deficit. That is the \ntea party.\n  Here is the last poll I wish to highlight. There are many more out \nthere. It was done by the Washington Post and ABC News. Here is what \nthat poll says. It says 72 percent of Americans support rising taxes on \nincomes over $250,000 to reduce the national debt, including 91 percent \nof Democrats, 68 percent of Independents, and 54 percent of \nRepublicans.\n  So here you have in Congress, surrounded by lobbyists and powerful \nspecial interests, a Congress heavily dominated by large campaign \ncontributors, of Members of the Senate moving in exactly the opposite \ndirection of where the American people want to go. The American people \nwant shared sacrifice. The American people believe that when the \nwealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well and the \ngap between the rich and everybody else is growing wider, yes, the \nwealthiest people have to contribute to deficit reduction.\n  The American people believe we have corporations making \nrecordbreaking profits and not paying a nickel in taxes. Yes, they have \nto start paying taxes. The American people overwhelmingly believe it is \nbad for this country to go after Medicare and Medicaid and programs \nthat working families desperately depend upon.\n  Instead of listening to millionaires and billionaires, it is time for \nour leaders in Washington to start listening to the overwhelming \nmajority of the American people who do want the wealthiest people in \nthis country and the most profitable corporations to contribute to \ndeficit reduction. It is time for shared sacrifice.\n  The middle class, the elderly, the sick, the children, and the poor \nhave already sacrificed enough. It is time for those people on top, the \npeople who are doing extremely well, to also understand they are \nAmericans, they are part of our country, and they have to contribute to \ndeficit reduction. The fact is, moving toward deficit reduction in a \nway that is fair is not as complicated as some would have us believe. \nIn fact, if you are not beholden to Wall Street, large corporations and \nwealthy campaign contributors and you are not frightened about the \nnumber of 30-second ads that may be thrown at you if you take these \nguys on, it is quite easy.\n  I know there are many people out there of good faith who have \ndifferent ideas about how we can move forward toward a balanced budget, \ntoward deficit reduction. I am not saying I have all the answers. But \nlet me just give you a few examples, a few examples as to how we can \nreduce the deficit by more than $4 trillion over the next decade, and \nthat includes, of course, asking the wealthy and large corporations to \nbegin paying their fair share of taxes and does not do undue harm for \nordinary Americans.\n  We can do it. We can do it. If you are concerned about deficit \nreduction, I am concerned about deficit reduction. But we can do it, \ncalling for shared sacrifice and in a way that does not attack programs \nthat millions and millions of children, elderly, and working families \nare terribly dependent upon.\n  Let me just give you a few ideas. I know other people have other good \nideas. First, we simply repeal the Bush tax breaks for the top 2 \npercent. We can raise at least $700 billion over the next decade. That \nis it. The rich are getting richer. Bush gave them huge tax breaks. You \nrepeal that, $700 billion.\n  I know some of my Republican friends say: Oh, my goodness. If you do \nnot give tax breaks to the very wealthy, it will have a negative impact \non jobs. This is the trickle-down economic theory. You give tax breaks \nto the rich, large corporations, and we create all kinds of great jobs. \nThat idea has been tested. That idea was tested. That was the idea of \nformer President George W. Bush. But during his 8 years as President, \nwhen that idea was in effect, the private sector lost--lost--over \n600,000 jobs, and we had one of the worst economic decades, in terms of \njob creation, ever seen in this country. We tried that theory. We did \ngive tax breaks to the rich and large corporations, and we lost 600,000 \njobs during that 10-year period.\n  Meanwhile, when Bill Clinton raised taxes on the top 2 percent, you \nknow what. The world did not quite cave in. In fact, during Clinton's \nPresidency, we created over 22 million jobs, and he left office with a \nhuge budget surplus. But that is just one argument. You heard polls say \nwe should impose a surtax on millionaires. The vast majority of the \nAmerican people believe that. If you did a 5.4-percent surtax on \nmillionaires and billionaires, that would raise $383 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  You want another idea? At a time when our manufacturing sector is \ncollapsing, when 50,000 factories have shut down in the last 10 years, \nwhen millions of workers have lost good-paying jobs, the U.S. \nGovernment continues to reward companies that move U.S. manufacturing \njobs overseas through loopholes in the Tax Code known as deferral and \nforeign source income.\n  That, clearly, from a financial point of view, in terms of revenue to \nour government, as well as policies which result in the loss of \nmillions of good manufacturing jobs, is not something we should \nsustain. If we ended that absurdity, that policy alone, the Joint\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\nTax Committee has estimated we could raise more than $582 billion in \nrevenue over the next 10 years. So what about that--$582 billion of \nrevenue and we stop the outsourcing of jobs so maybe we can rebuild our \nmanufacturing sector. Sounds to me like a pretty sensible idea.\n  My Republican friends think it is a better idea to throw poor \nchildren off Medicaid or force elderly people to pay far more than they \ncan afford for Medicare. But ending this absurd policy, which \nencourages companies to throw American workers out on the street, makes \na lot more sense to me than what the Republicans are talking about.\n  Fourth, if we ended tax breaks and subsidies for big oil and gas \ncompanies, we can reduce the deficit by more than $40 billion over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Fifth, if we prohibited abusive and illegal offshore tax shelters--\nwhat I just talked about a moment ago--we could bring in $1 trillion \nover 10 years. That says to the corporations and the wealthy: Sorry, \nyou are no longer going to be able to stash your wealth in the Cayman \nIslands and avoid paying taxes.\n\n  Sixth, if we established a Wall Street speculation fee of less than 1 \npercent on the sale and purchase of credit default swaps, derivatives, \nstock options and futures, we could reduce the deficit by more than \n$100 billion over the next decade and also--also--tell Wall Street we \nare not going to tolerate their outrageous behavior which led us into \nthis recession in the first place. We are going to try to get a handle \non their speculation.\n  Seventh, if we tax capital gains and dividends the same way we tax \nwork, ordinary work, we can raise more than $730 billion over the next \ndecade. Why should somebody who clips dividend coupons pay a \nsubstantially lower tax rate than somebody who is out working on our \nstreets or is a nurse or is a teacher? Warren Buffett has often said he \npays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary. Today, the \neffective tax rate of the wealthiest 400 Americans is just 18 percent, \nthe lowest on record.\n  On and on. We have a number of ideas out there, not the least of \nwhich is taking a hard look at the military. There are debates as to \nhow much we can cut, but certainly we should all be in agreement that \nit no longer makes sense to sustain weapons systems that were built in \norder to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union. They are not our \nenemy right now.\n  I can tell you that I, my office, requested a GAO report that found \nthat the Pentagon had $36.9 billion in spare parts it does not need and \nwhich are collecting dust in government warehouses. We can do better \nthan that. Frankly, in my view--I think I speak for the majority of the \npeople in my State of Vermont, I suspect, in this country--it is time \nto begin bringing the troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan at an \naccelerated rate. We have been in Afghanistan now for 10 years. It is \ntime for the Afghan people and their military to take responsibility, \nin terms of defeating the Taliban. We should be supportive of those \nefforts. But we should bring our troops home a lot sooner than the \nPresident has suggested. When we do that, among other things, we are \nalso going to save a substantial sum of money.\n  Further, I will not deny for one second that there is waste and fraud \nand bureaucracy in almost every government program out there. I think \nwe have to take a hard look at them all. I believe that in addition to \nthe Pentagon, we can save hundreds of billions of dollars a year by \neliminating unnecessary bureaucracy.\n  The ideas I have enumerated, and some I have not but which will \nbecome part of the Record, if we did all or some of these things, we \ncould easily reduce the deficit by well over $4 trillion over the next \ndecade, if not, in fact, much more. It would be done in a way that is \nfair, and it would not unnecessarily and needlessly ruin the lives of \nsome of the most desperate and fragile and hurting people in our \ncountry today, millions of people who are just struggling to make ends \nmeet. Those people would be spared.\n  The extreme rightwing agenda of more tax breaks for the wealthy, paid \nby the dismantling of Medicare, Medicaid, education, nutrition, and the \nenvironment, may be popular in the country clubs and cocktail parties \nof the wealthy and the powerful, but it is way out of touch with what \nthe overwhelming majority of Americans want.\n  As you know, late last week Congressman Cantor, the Republican \nmajority leader in the House, and Senator Jon Kyl, the Republican whip, \nwalked out of the budget negotiations being led by Vice President \nBiden. The reason they walked out was pretty clear. They were not \nwilling to close one single loophole in the Tax Code that allows the \nwealthy and large corporations to avoid paying taxes by stashing their \nmoney in the Cayman Islands and all the other loopholes that currently \nexist.\n  My sincere hope is that President Obama will use this Republican \nwalkout, their unwillingness to talk about the wealthy and large \ncorporations contributing anything toward deficit reduction--that he \nwill use this as an opportunity to rally the American people and make \nit clear he will never support Republican demands to move toward a \nbalanced budget solely on the backs of working families, the elderly, \nthe children, the sick, and the poor. But I don't think the President \nwill do it unless the American people send him a message that enough is \nenough.\n\n  The American people do not support the Republican agenda. The \nAmerican people support the concept of shared sacrifice as we move \ntoward deficit reduction. But the President has to hear from the \nAmerican people. He has to hear that they will not accept decimating \nMedicare, Medicaid, Pell grants, education, and the environment in \norder to give more tax breaks to the wealthy. The President has to \nstand up for the millions of Americans who have seen their homes, their \njobs, and their savings vanish, instead of the millionaires who have \nnever had it so good.\n  It is my belief if the American people make that demand of the \nPresident and tell the President not to yield on this issue, we can win \nthis budget struggle. If people would like to sign it--and I hope they \nwould--we have a letter to the President, which I will read in a \nmoment, on my Web site, sanders.senate.gov--and, also, as I mentioned \nearlier, they can contact the White House directly by going straight \nthrough the White House Web site and sending a message.\n  If hundreds of thousands of people do that, the President, I hope, \nwill have the strength and determination to say to the Republicans: \nSorry, we are not going to balance the budget on the weak and the \nvulnerable.\n  This is the letter that is on my Web site, which I hope the people \nwill sign. This is what it says, which encapsulates much of what I have \nbeen saying for the last hour:\n\n       Dear Mr. President,\n       This is a pivotal moment in the history of our country. \n     Decisions are being made about the national budget that will \n     impact the lives of virtually every American for decades to \n     come. As we address the issue of deficit reduction, we must \n     not ignore the painful economic reality of today--which is \n     that the wealthiest people in our country and the largest \n     corporations are doing phenomenally well, while the middle \n     class is collapsing and poverty is increasing. In fact, the \n     United States today has, by far, the most unequal \n     distribution of wealth and income of any major country on \n     earth.\n       Everyone understands that over the long term we have got to \n     reduce the deficit--a deficit that was caused mainly by Wall \n     Street greed, tax breaks for the rich, two wars, and a \n     prescription drug program written by the drug and insurance \n     companies. It is absolutely imperative, however, that as we \n     go forward with deficit reduction, we completely reject the \n     Republican approach that demands savage cuts in desperately \n     needed programs for working families, the elderly, the sick, \n     our children, and the poor, while not asking the wealthiest \n     among us to contribute one penny.\n       Mr. President, please listen to the overwhelming majority \n     of the American people who believe that deficit reduction \n     must be about shared sacrifice. The wealthiest Americans and \n     the most profitable corporations in this country must pay \n     their fair share. At least 50 percent of any deficit \n     reduction package must come from revenue raised by ending tax \n     breaks for the wealthy and eliminating tax loopholes that \n     benefit large, profitable corporations and Wall Street \n     financial institutions. A sensible deficit reduction package \n     must also include significant cuts to unnecessary and \n     wasteful Pentagon spending.\n       Please do not yield to outrageous Republican demands that \n     would greatly increase suffering for the weakest and most \n     vulnerable members of our society. Now is the time to stand \n     with tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to \n     survive economically, not with the millionaires and \n     billionaires who have never had it so good.\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\n       Respectfully yours.\n\n  That letter is at sanders.senate.gov. I think we have many thousands \nof signatures on that letter already. I hope we can get more. If people \nprefer to go to the White House Web site, they can do that. That would \nbe important. The main point is that the President has to know that we \nwill not accept a deficit reduction package that just comes out heavily \non working families.\n  The reason I raise these issues today is that I am, frankly, very \nworried because we have gone through this negotiating process two times \nin the last 6 months. That is why we need the American people to weigh \nin on this issue.\n  In fact, we have seen this movie before. The Republicans, led by \ntheir extreme right wing, have been successful in getting their way \nbecause of their refusal to compromise and willingness to hold the \ncredit and economic security of the American people hostage.\n  As many people will remember, in December the Republican leadership \nwas prepared to hold the middle-class tax cuts and unemployment \nbenefits hostage in order to extend the Bush tax breaks to the top 2 \npercent. As we all know, the Republicans won. As a result, over $200 \nbillion was added to the deficit over the next 2 years. Not only did \nthe Bush tax breaks for the wealthy get extended, they also got a \nreduction in the estate tax which benefits the top three-tenths of 1 \npercent.\n  Specifically, the December tax cut agreement extended the Bush income \ntax rates, and it cost us very substantially.\n  It is not just the Bush tax cuts that were extended. In March of this \nyear our Republican friends said that unless we made very significant \ncuts, the Republicans were prepared to shut down the government, \ndisrupt the economy, and deny paychecks to some 800,000 Federal \nworkers--if they could not get their way. They said: We are going to \nshut down the government unless you make these Draconian cuts.\n  One of the cuts I was disturbed about--among many--was $600 million \nto build new community health centers, which would keep people alive \nand end up saving money. There are other Draconian cuts, as well. They \nalso cut Pell grants, making it harder for students to go to college. \nThe point is, they acted as bullies and said: If we don't get our way, \nwe are prepared to shut down the government.\n  Now we are back here again, and this is part 3 of the act. Part 1 was \nwhether the middle class would get its tax breaks and whether \nunemployment benefits would be extended. The Republicans won. Part 2 is \nwhether the government would be shut down. The Republicans mostly won \nand got almost everything they wanted.\n  Here we are, act 3, the biggest act of all; and the question is \nwhether the Republicans will, in fact, not raise the debt ceiling. If \nthey do that, it is quite possible that not only our country but the \nentire world might be plunged into a major financial crisis.\n  This is what they are threatening: If we don't get everything we \nwant, we are prepared not to pay our government's debt for the first \ntime in the history of our country. We are prepared to see interest \nrates go up in a very fragile global economy. And we are prepared to \nsee more and more instability.\n  In many ways, the Republicans in Washington are acting like \nschoolyard bullies. As we know, bullying is a very serious problem in \nour schools. Every educator worth his or her salt would tell us that \nwhen dealing with a bully, we must not give in to their tactics or \ntolerate their temper tantrums or allow them to hurt innocent people. \nWe have to deal with them sternly and consistently. We cannot allow \nthem to win by dictating the rules of the game and trampling over \neverybody else if they don't get their way.\n  We have a serious debt problem that must be solved, but it must be \nsolved in a way that is fair and in a way that calls for shared \nsacrifice.\n  Let me conclude by suggesting that the American people are concerned \nabout the deficit. They are also concerned about the economy, and they \nare also concerned that so many of our people--of all ages, in all \nparts of this country--are hanging on economically by their \nfingernails.\n  The American people understand that it is just not fair at all to \ncome down on people who are already hurting and leave unscathed the \nwealthiest people in this country and large profitable corporations.\n  What I say today to the President of the United States is this: Mr. \nPresident, stand tall. Do not yield to Republican blackmail. Stand with \nthe vast majority of the American people who believe that deficit \nreduction requires shared sacrifice--that everybody makes a sacrifice, \nnot just working families, the elderly, the sick, and the poor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4122-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4122-S4124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO OPAL OVERBEY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndevoted and hardworking Kentuckian. Ms. Opal Overbey has been honored \nin her hometown and will have her life story submitted to the Library \nof Congress for being an extraordinary woman who dedicated her life to \nher family and her work.\n  Born December 2, 1929, on Tom Cat Trail in Laurel County, KY, Opal \nwas the fourth of eight children. Growing up, Opal remembers a \nchildhood filled with love, laughter and hard work. Following the \nguidance of her parents--her mother, a committed housewife and her dad, \na diligent farmer--she learned that a little hard work and \ndetermination goes a long way. Driven by a desire to be independent and \nearn her own money, Opal worked two jobs. After many years at the local \nlaundromat as well as working part time at the Crystal Kitchen, Opal \nmoved into a small room in a house behind a jeweler with her cousins. \nSoon after, she met her husband of 62 years, Virgil Overbey.\n  When Opal was 17 she and Virgil got married. Together they had four \nchildren. Being a mother at a young age was a difficult feat to master, \nbut Opal was determined to give her children a childhood similar to her \nown. As they got older, her eldest son Jim found a common interest with \nhis mom, and together they built a greenhouse supplying flowers and \ncrops for the community. After Virgil Overbey's unfortunate death on \nNovember 24, 2008, the greenhouse was a way for the family to stay \ntogether and enjoy each other's company while doing something they all \nloved.\n  Opal's greenhouse business continues today. She says that working at \nthe greenhouse has always been a pleasurable experience, but it's the \npeople and the customers that make it worthwhile: ``I think in life you \nhave to just work and treat people right, and be honest and the Lord \nwill bless you.'' Her children have grown up and started families of \ntheir own, and Opal continues to help in any way that she can.\n  Kentucky is fortunate to have a hardworking and devoted woman like \nOpal Overbey. At 81 years of age, Opal has lived a lifetime of service \nto her community. I am sure her children Jim, Denver, Glenda, and \nEvelyn, as well as her whole family, are very proud of everything that \nshe has accomplished and provided for her loved ones.\n  Mr. President, the Laurel County Sentinel Echo recently published an \narticle highlighting Ms. Opal Overbey's life and career. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n          [From the Sentinel Echo, Laurel County, June 8, 2011\n\n                   London's Living Treasures: Part 3\n\n       In the third installment of the Living Treasures project, \n     we meet 81-year-old Opal Overbey, a fixture at Overbey's \n     Greenhouse on Ky. 229. The only Living Treasure nominee who \n     is a native of Laurel County, Overbey shared her life story, \n     one that is characterized by love of family, love of the land \n     and a tireless work ethic.\n       ``I was born Dec. 2, 1929 here in Laurel County on Tom Cat \n     Trail near Bush. My mother just raised all us youngin's, she \n     was a housewife, and my dad farmed everything, tobacco, corn, \n     whatever people grew then. He had about 80 acres of \n     pastureland. He was a good, honest man. My mom was the same. \n     There was eight of us, six sisters and two brothers. I was \n     the fourth child down.\n       I had a happy childhood. Honey, we just played and had fun \n     and worked also. Dad always made us hoe corn and whatever he \n     was doing. He learned us to work. But we would play Hoopy \n     Hide, tag, hopscotch, whatever kids played at that time. We \n     used to take washes down to the creek where the water\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\n     was. And we'd swim, we had a good swimming hole place. That \n     was fun-fun, we loved that. We had a childhood that was as \n     normal as normal could be.\n       I went to Weaver School, a one-room school. We would walk \n     to school, to and from it was probably about three miles. I \n     wasn't in particularly a great student. I really didn't like \n     school; I would rather stay home and wash clothes or \n     something, if she would let me. I didn't really like any \n     subject, except recess.\n       Whenever I was a kid you didn't go to the store to get what \n     you needed, you put it up in the summertime. That was what \n     she fed us on. She had a big garden, potatoes. corn, beans, \n     cucumbers, just anything she could get seed for. She saved \n     quite a lot of seed and kids used to go around and sell \n     packets of seed back then and that's how she would get \n     cucumber and beets and stuff like that.\n       My chores were milking, gathering the eggs, cleaning up, \n     dishes, drawing water, we drew our water out of a well, you \n     know. Mom caught her wash water when it came off the house. \n     No plumbing, not when I was home, no electricity.\n       We had a big house with plenty of room. It was like \n     everybody else's house then. It was made of weatherboarding. \n     Our nearest neighbors were about a quarter of a mile away. A \n     lot of them was my relatives. Uncle Perry and Aunt Rhilde \n     Root and Ed and Polly Jones lived real close to us.\n       I had an uncle, Charlie, that got a radio, and we would go \n     listen to the Grand Ole Opry at Uncle Charlie's on Saturday \n     night. I was probably 6 or 8 years old. We would just sit \n     around and listen at the radio.\n       We went to Flatwoods Christian Church. That was the only \n     place we had to go. We went there quite a lot. I liked to go \n     to church. Everybody in the community went, it was just a \n     gathering place. You didn't have no movies or anything like \n     that back then. Sometimes mom would take us all to a \n     neighbor's house and we'd have dinner. Sometimes they went \n     over with us. We had a real close neighborhood there, very \n     good people.\n       Our mother basically made all of our dresses until we were \n     big enough to work and earn them ourselves. I remember one \n     dress in particular. Back then, I don't know if I was a state \n     thing or something, anyway, we got some free clothes. That \n     was my first ready-made dress and I never forgot that. It was \n     just a solid brown, cotton summer dress, but it was made \n     pretty and I loved it.\n       I was probably about 12 when I stopped going to school. I \n     didn't get very much schooling. I wasn't interested in \n     continuing. I just wanted to work.\n       I went to London and got me a little job in the laundry, \n     and I worked there for Mr. Terry until me and Virgil got \n     married. They had these presses and usually I pressed jeans \n     and passed them on to somebody else. Me and a couple of my \n     cousins, Eula Mao Smith and Deloris Smith, we got us a room \n     in a big house that sat back from Barton's Jewelry Store and \n     I worked, part-time now, not all the time.\n       London was pretty low back then. I remember when they had \n     boards for the sidewalks. People tied their horses and their \n     wagons at the foot of Manchester Street, where it started \n     leveling out. Going out from London, it was on the left. Then \n     they finally got Black Brothers buses running from Manchester \n     to London, and then we still had to walk two or three miles \n     down to catch that bus. A lot of walking went on back in them \n     days. I went home every weekend on that bus.\n       I guess I got grown before my time and I wanted to work. \n     I'm thinking I made about 20 cents an hour. I believe, best I \n     can remember. I made $18 to $25 a week, but that was good \n     money then. I always tried to buy me an outfit. You could buy \n     one for a little bit of nothing, and I'd get me a new dress \n     or a new something or other each week. I liked working. \n     Honey, I liked making money, that's mostly what you worked \n     for, ain't it? I worked off and on at the laundry for three \n     or four years. I also worked at a restaurant part-time too, \n     Crystal Kitchen. It was right by the bank, it was First \n     National then. I would serve cheeseburgers and hot dogs and \n     that's basically what we did. But when dad had gardening and \n     stuff going on, I worked at home. That's why I only worked \n     part-time. He'd let me work if we didn't have anything to do \n     on the farm.\n       Honey, I met Virgil, who would become my husband, about \n     three times. Before I even knew who he was, he'd always try \n     to take me home. The first time I met him it was way on \n     Blackwater or Cane Creek. We had took a cousin home and \n     that's where I met him first. I was very young, probably 15.\n       When I first went out with him was probably maybe six or \n     eights months after that. He was the nephew of my aunt that \n     lived across the creek there. That was a great courtship. \n     First place we went was to Renfro Valley. That was actually \n     my first date with him. Honey, we got there too late for the \n     first show so we just didn't wait for the second one, we come \n     back home. Didn't even get to go in. I was sort of \n     disappointed, but was having a good time. I knew right away \n     that I liked Virgil. He was just a nice person. He was \n     someone you was comfortable with.\n       I was barely 17 when we married. He was 23. He had just got \n     out of the Army, he was in World War II. He asked me to marry \n     him when I was 16, but I said, ``Wait 'til I get 17.'' When I \n     was, he just plain asked, we just set the date right after he \n     asked me. I think maybe then I was staying with one of my \n     aunts where she was having baby. I did that a lot when I was \n     a kid. I worked all the time. I think that was my hobby.\n       We married Jan. 23, 1943. Lived here ever since. He had a \n     couple of uncles that drove taxis and that's how we got to \n     London to get married. Back then, you didn't have a big \n     wedding. We got married by Morgan Williams, he was a preacher \n     back then, at the courthouse. My aunt and uncle went with us \n     to sign me. Honey, I wore a pretty, little, blue cotton \n     dress, don't remember what I paid for it but it wasn't much. \n     Then we took a taxi back.\n       We lived together almost 62 years. We stayed with his \n     mother and dad for a week or two and we moved in this house. \n     Virgil built it. Over the years, we just done things we \n     wanted to the house. At the time, he went to work at a \n     sawmill and worked there for a few years and then he went to \n     Chaney's logging. Then he went straight into farming. That's \n     basically what we've always done.\n       I was 18 when had my first child, my son Jim. Then three \n     years later, I had Denver. Later on, I had two girls, Glenda \n     and Evelyn was the baby. I had Evelyn six years after Glenda. \n     I spread 'em out. I had little children there for about 20 \n     years.\n       I remember having Jim. It was terrible. I had him at home, \n     you know. Doctor Walthen, he came to the house. I think he \n     was born about 2 in the morning. Doctor Walthen stayed I \n     think a couple of nights because I had false labor. He hunted \n     him a bed and went to sleep and stayed until Jim was born.\n       Once he was born, I just loved him to death--like any \n     mother that's a good mother loves her children. Being a young \n     mother, that took a little training. Virgil's mother, Nanny \n     Overbey, she come every day and bathed the baby and did \n     whatever needed to be done. I was grateful for her help \n     because I didn't know the first thing.\n       I raised my children how I was raised. My kids played \n     outside a lot. My days were getting up and cooking for them \n     and doing my washing. I always cooked 'em three meals a day \n     so that takes a good part of your day right there. Honey, I \n     canned a lot, and potatoes saved a lot of lives back then. Of \n     a morning, you'd fry eggs. Virgil always kept us plenty of \n     meat in the freezer, so I'd fix meat and gravy, everybody \n     always had gravy then, and biscuits. I cooked full meals \n     then. That was how I was raised too. That's one thing you \n     done, you ate good.\n       Honey, we had enough to get by on. You didn't have any \n     bills back then. There was no bills to pay, so you just fed \n     your family and bought what you had to buy and did whatever \n     you had to do. We sure wasn't rich by no means, but we got \n     by.\n       We got electricity the evening after Jim was born, on the \n     19th of October in '43. Oh, that was great. Got a \n     refrigerator and a washer and the few things you had to have \n     then. That beat washing on the board.\n       Jim was the leader. He always made sure they caught the bus \n     on time; he was very reliable. They went to Camp Ground. They \n     liked school pretty well. Well, Denver didn't, but Jim \n     graduated from high school. My oldest girl got married about \n     15 and Evelyn started high school, and quit.\n       When Jim was about 9, he sold the first bushel of beans we \n     ever sold. Set up on the road, it was just a gravel road back \n     then. I think he got $1.50 or $2. Jim was like me, he liked \n     to make money, he liked to have something going all the time. \n     He was very inventive. From there, we just kept planting \n     other stuff. It was right up my alley because we like to do \n     the same thing. Selling, I was better at selling than \n     anything else, that's what I liked to do. Both of my grandads \n     had little country stores so I had that in me.\n       When Jim and his wife come back from Indiana, he started a \n     greenhouse on the porch. Of an evening, we'd go and pick \n     beans after we'd close from selling. We'd sell up near the \n     road at first and several years ago, we backed off of the \n     road when the main road come through, it got too dangerous. \n     It got so hot that one year we put fans in the greenhouse \n     there and that cooled us. It was a lot more comfortable when \n     we moved off the road.\n       Having a greenhouse wasn't common back then, not in this \n     community. It took a while. We even sold in the yard under a \n     tree for a while. And we'd roll our wagon with the shade as \n     the day wore on.\n       Virgil died Nov. 24, '08. We lived together 62 years and \n     that was a great loss for me. He always farmed, that's what \n     he loved to do. And he loved working in the greenhouse and he \n     watered and did a lot of the greenhouse work. It was always a \n     family affair, we all worked.\n       Jim still runs the greenhouse and I just help him a little \n     whenever I can, which is basically every day, except Sunday. \n     Honey, I still work anywhere from eight to 10 hours a day. I \n     go over there at 8 and we was closing at 6, but now we're \n     there 'til 7 or 7:30. But I don't do a lot of work back in \n     the greenhouse. I like visiting with people. It's just what I \n     like.\n       Since Virgil's gone, we don't do a whole lot of gardening. \n     He was our plower, our planter, everything. He was a good \n     farmer, Virgil was. I've worked ever since just for my \n     children, help my youngin's, that's what I like to do. I like \n     to talk and visit with people and I meet so many nice people. \n     I do anything I can to help someone who comes along, that's \n     my nature. I think in life you have to just work and treat \n     people right, and be honest and the Lord will bless you.''\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4124-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                HAWAII 2011 NATIONAL HISTORY DAY WINNERS\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate a group \nof exceptional students and teachers from the State of Hawaii for their \nparticipation in the 2011 Kenneth E. Behring National History Day \nContest. This year's theme, ``Debate and Diplomacy in History: \nSuccesses, Failure, Consequences,'' was the starting point for student \nprojects nationwide.\n  The National History Day, NHD, is a highly regarded academic program \nfor elementary and secondary school students. Each year, over a half a \nmillion students participate in the NHD contest where students choose \nhistorical topics related to a theme and conduct extensive primary and \nsecondary research through libraries, archives, museums, oral history \ninterviews and historic sites. Once students draw their conclusions \nabout their topics' significance in history, they present their work in \noriginal papers, Web sites, exhibits, performances and documentaries. \nThe projects are entered into competitions in the spring at local and \nstate levels where they are evaluated by professional historians and \neducators. National History Day culminates with the Kenneth E. Behring \nNational Contest at the University of Maryland at College Park each \nJune.\n  This year, two student teams from Hawaii received national honors. \nKamaile Aluli, Kaylee Alana Miller and Truman Spring from Laie \nElementary School placed first in the junior Web site competition with \ntheir entry titled, ``Between a Rock and a Hard Place: the Battle over \nHetch Hetchy.'' Their teachers are Serena Tuliloa and Colleen Spring. \nMoanalua High School students Janal Kim, Keri Ann Nagaishi and Kelly \nZakimi took second place for their senior group exhibit, ``Creation of \nPakistan.'' Their teacher is Angela Brooks.\n  As a former educator, I am pleased to see our keiki succeeding on a \nnational level. Throughout my career in Congress, I have worked closely \nwith my colleagues to ensure that students in Hawaii and the nation \nhave quality teachers, schools and academic programs. The Kenneth E. \nBehring National History Day Contest is one such program that offers \nchildren who have a passion for history, a way of rewarding them for \ntheir hard work.\n  Once again I offer my sincere congratulations and aloha to all the \nstudents and teachers who participated in the 2011 Kenneth E. Behring \nNational History Day Contest and wish them all success in their \nacademic futures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4124-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AWWA PIPE TAPPING CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

This was the third AWWA \nChampionship for the team, having won in 2010 and 2005.\n  The Wahine faced off against four rivals in a contest where top \nutility teams race to tap a cement-lined, ductile iron pipe. The women \nof HBWS demonstrated amazing skill and showcased the expertise of AWWA \nmembers.\n  The HBWS Wahine includes Cat Sawai, setter, Susan Oda, copper, and \nDanielle Ornellas, cranker. The team was led by coach Gary Fernandez.\n  I congratulate the Honolulu Board of Water Supply Wahine on their \naccomplishment, and I wish all of them the best in their future \nendeavors. I extend the same congratulations to all members of the \nHonolulu Board of Water Supply who participated in this year's AWWA \nConference on a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4124-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO LARRY AND BARBI WEINBERG\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Winston Churchill once said, ``We \nmake a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.'' \nToday I honor two great Americans who have made a wonderful life by \nwhat they have given. Lawrence and Barbara Weinberg, or Larry and Barbi \nas their family and friends know them, have given much to their faith, \nto their country, and to their family and friends. Today I call \nattention to their service that the good life they have made can serve \nas an example to us all.\n  Larry answered our Nation's call to duty and served in the U.S. \nInfantry in France during World War II. He was nearly killed by the \nexplosion of a landmine. While he was injured on the ground, a German \nsoldier bayonetted him in the stomach. He remained motionless and \nisolated for over thirteen hours. Against all odds, he was rescued by a \nCatholic Army Chaplain and spent a year recovering in the hospital.\n  After Larry was discharged from both the hospital and the Army, he \nmet Barbi. It was the summer of 1946. They married 6 months later. \nLarry then started a Los Angeles homebuilding business. He began with \njust four houses, but built his company to become the Larwin Group \nCompanies, the largest privately owned single-family housing producer \nin the United States. He later became the principal owner and CEO of \nthe Portland Trailblazers from 1975-1988, and served on the board of \ngovernors of the National Basketball Association from 1980-1983.\n  Together, Larry and Barbi have been unwavering supporters of the \nJewish community and Israel. In 1973, Barbi was elected president of \nthe Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles, becoming the \nfirst woman to be elected president of a major federation in the United \nStates. She used her position to expand the previously secular \nFoundation to Orthodox, Conservative, and Reformed Jewish \ncongregations.\n  Larry also continued his work supporting the American-Israeli \nrelationship. He was elected president of the American Israel Public \nAffairs Committee, AIPAC, in 1976 for 5 years, later serving as its \nchairman from 1982-1987. He is known as the founder of modern AIPAC.\n  Larry established the Jewish Foundation Barbi Weinberg Chai Award to \nhonor individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the \nenhancement of and appreciation for Jewish life. Barbi sponsored a \nprogram to prepare junior and senior high school students with the \nknowledge, confidence, and training to speak up for themselves and for \nIsrael, and to fight anti-Semitism and anti-Israel bias on college \ncampuses. These programs are so important for our Nation's youth.\n  In 1984, Barbi founded the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \nThis research foundation has become one of the most influential think \ntanks in Washington, advising policymakers on Middle East issues.\n  Larry and Barbi have lived a life of dedicated public service. They \nare most proud, however, of their loving dedication to their family. \nDuring their 64 years together, Larry and Barbi have 4 children, 12 \ngrandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren. All are hardworking, \nsuccessful Americans that share Larry and Barbi's commitment to public \nservice.\n  Larry and Barbi truly have made a good life by what they have given. \nI am proud to consider myself a friend. And may their service be an \nexample to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4124-4", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4124-S4125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LUBEC, MAINE\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Lubec, ME, is the easternmost town \nin the United States, the place where the rising Sun first shines on \nAmerica. That unique geographic location has special meaning in this, \nLubec's bicentennial year. Today, as they have for two centuries, the \npeople of Lubec greet every day with the optimism and determination \neach dawn brings.\n  Located on a slender peninsula that separates Passamaquoddy Bay and \nthe Atlantic Ocean, Lubec is more than a town on the sea. It is a town \nof the sea. Its 95 miles of shoreline once were lined with cargo-filled \ndocks, shipyards, sail makers, canneries, smokehouses, and tide-powered \nsawmills. Its namesake, Lubeck, Germany, was chosen to emulate that \nancient seafaring city's role as a center of open and free trade. The \nmagnificent sea captain homes throughout the town stand as monuments to \nLubec's role as an early hub of America's global commerce.\n  Now, it is a shoreline of aquaculture pens, lobster traps, and urchin \nand scallop boats. For those seeking a genuine downeast Maine \nexperience, the\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n\nformer ``Sardine Capital of the World'' has become an outdoor \nrecreation paradise, an ecotourism destination, and a haven for \nartists. The West Quoddy Lighthouse, with its iconic red and white \nstripes, is recognized the world over. The Franklin Delano Roosevelt \nMemorial Bridge, the link to Campobello Island, New Brunswick, gives \nLubec an international flavor.\n  The town of Lubec was incorporated on June 21, 1811, but its origins \nlie in prehistory. For 12,000 years before the first European settlers \narrived, the land was home to the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the original \n``People of the Dawn'' still are part of the community today.\n  Lubec is a town of the first light and of the first patriots. One \nearly settler was Colonel John Allan who in 1777 was charged by General \nGeorge Washington with defending the remote yet vital region. He \nrepelled a British amphibious invasion and forged an alliance for \nliberty with the Passamaquoddy, Penobscot, and Micmac tribes. Another \nearly resident was Hopley Yeaton, who served in the Continental Navy. \nIn 1790, he was appointed by President George Washington as the first \ncommissioned officer in our young Nation's maritime security and safety \nservice--he is known today as the ``Father of the United States Coast \nGuard.''\n  During the War of 1812, Lubec stood strong against a British \noccupation just 2 miles across the bay. In the Civil War, 200 young \nmen--one-eighth of the town's entire population--answered the call of \nfreedom. Lubec's commitment reaches from the front lines to the home \nfront--during World War II, the workers at the R.J. Peacock Canning \nCompany received a special citation from the War Food Department for \ntheir untiring efforts and patriotic service.\n  And the town has found itself on the front lines in the conflicts of \nour time. On September 11, 2001, Jackie and Robert Norton were flying \nto California for a family wedding. They perished at the World Trade \nCenter. The people of Lubec will always remember those dear neighbors \nwho, from their beautiful gardens to their community service, gave so \nmuch to the town.\n  The spirit of Lubec is exemplified in the life of Myron Avery. From \nthe tiny North Lubec Grammar School and the village high school, he \nwent on to Bowdoin College and Harvard Law School to become a jurist of \nnational renown. He served our Nation in both world wars as a Navy \nofficer. In between, he turned the vision of the Appalachian Trail into \nreality and was the first to hike its entire 2,000 miles in one effort, \nfrom Georgia to Maine. Commitment to service, reverence for nature, and \nbuilding for the future--that is the spirit of Lubec.\n  On this Fourth of July, Lubec, ME, will hold its Grand Bicentenary \nJubilee. It will be a day of great food, music, and fun. It will be a \nday for the people of this wonderful town to look back at the past two \ncenturies with pride, and to look ahead at the century to come with \noptimism and determination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4125-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ARMOUR, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I recognize \nthe community of Armour, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its \nfounding. Armour is a energetic community, which serves as the county \nseat for Douglas County, and will be celebrating its quasiquicentennial \nJuly 1 through 4.\n  The town Armour, being founded in 1886, has the notable distinction \nof being a city before South Dakota achieved statehood. On the day that \nPresident Benjamin Harrison's proclamation of statehood for South \nDakota reached Armour, the residents rang the brand new school bell to \ncelebrate and alert the town. The children of Armour have always come \nfirst in the eyes of the residents; the first school was built just 1 \nyear after the city was founded. Armour also claims to be home to the \nfirst Boy Scout Troop in the State of South Dakota.\n  Today the town of Armor still holds education and children in high \nregards, and in 2008 Armour was one of only 320 schools in the Nation \nto be honored as a blue ribbon school for academic excellence. Armour \nwill celebrate its 125th anniversary by holding an all-school reunion, \nas well as many other community events such as trolley rides, a 5K \nrace, and chili cook-off.\n  Armour is a thriving community that maintains small town values. Even \n125 years after its founding, Armour remains a vital community and a \ngreat asset to the wonderful State of South Dakota. I am proud to \npublicly honor Armour on this historic milestone, and congratulate the \npeople of Armour on their achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4125-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CLAREMONT, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I recognize \nthe 125th anniversary of the founding of Claremont, SD. Claremont, home \nof the Honkers, is a thriving community located in Brown County. The \ncity of Claremont is a town that contributes greatly to the identity of \nrural South Dakota.\n  Located along the Great Northern Railway, the vibrant community of \nClaremont was founded in 1886 and formally incorporated in 1903. \nClaremont's rich history began with its prosperous farmers and railroad \nworkers. The creation of the railroad was essential to the survival of \nthe town. Claremont thrived thanks to the rich soil and accessibility \nto clean water. Like many frontier towns, the residents endured \nblizzards, droughts, and fires. The commitment of the early settlers to \nthe land truly embodied the pioneer spirit, and can be seen in the \nactions of the residents even today.\n  The men's softball team, the Honkers, calls Claremont home. They are \nthe pride of the town and bring the community together to celebrate \nAmerica's pastime. Along with sports, Claremont is well known for the \nample geese that fly over the town, providing enjoyment to hunters and \nnature enthusiasts alike.\n  Claremont will be commemorating its quasquicentennial celebration \nwith softball and volleyball games, a parade, a 5K road race, food, \ndancing, and fireworks. To wrap up a fun-filled weekend, Claremont has \nplanned an outdoor church service and potluck lunch. Other festivities \ninclude an all school reunion, old time photos, and a historical \ndisplay.\n  Mr. President, 125 years after its founding, Claremont is still a \nwholesome, rural community with true South Dakota values. I am proud to \nrecognize the achievements of Claremont and to congratulate its \nresidents on this memorable occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4125-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4125-S4126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FERNEY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

Ferney, located in Brown County, truly is \na community born from the railroad and will be celebrating its \nquasquicentennial the weekend of July 2-3.\n  Named after the French hometown of the wife of a railroad official, \nFerney is a community with a colorful past. For many German families, \nFerney was a treasure they could call home. The local Lutheran Church \neven held services in both German and English into the 1930s. During \nprohibition Ferney was one of the few cities in South Dakota to \ncontinue the sale of alcohol. Fernery's past was born from the Chicago \nNorthwestern Rail Road, but the town was sustained through agriculture.\n  Today agriculture still plays a major role in the life of the \nresidents of Ferney. The local co-op provides the area with the farming \nneeds to keep the crops fertile. While small, Ferney continues to \nprosper with local business such as the Ferney Farmers Bar and Grill \nand Harry Implements, Inc. These small businesses make each and every \ntown in South Dakota a unique treasure. Ferney plans to celebrate this \nmilestone by holding numerous events, including a parade, tractor pull, \nsoftball tournament, and street dance.\n  South Dakota has a reputation for kindness and hard work. The \nresidents of Ferney embody this wholesome reputation that makes South \nDakota a place you want to call home, and I congratulate the citizens \nof Ferney on their accomplishments over the last 125 years and look \nforward to their future endeavors.\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4126-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         HARROLD, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I recognize \nthe community of Harrold, SD, for the tremendous milestone of reaching \nthe 125th anniversary of its founding. Harrold is a close-knit \ncommunity located in Hughes County, and represents the small town \nspirit that makes South Dakota stand out in the Midwest.\n  Named after Harrold McCullaugh, an officer of the Chicago and North \nWestern Railroad, people began settling in the Harrold area around 1883 \nthanks in part to the newly built railroad line and rich farm land. \nHarrold was incorporated in 1886. The town thrived with the creation of \na post office, new businesses, churches, and a school. Through \nadversity over the years including crop failures, blizzards, and \ntornadoes, the people of Harrold have shown resiliency and maintain \npride in their community.\n  Today the town of Harrold has become a hunter's paradise. Many \nhunting lodges call Harrold home and offer visitors and community \nmembers the thrill of hunting game such as pheasant. Even with the \ngreat hunting opportunities, agriculture still exists as the lifeblood \nof the community. In more recent years, the Global Harvest Birdseed \nCompany has expanded their business and brought needed jobs to this \nMidwest community.\n  Harrold will be celebrating its quasquicentennial the weekend of July \n2-3. The town will celebrate this milestone with many community \nactivates including a parade, antique tractor pull, nickel in a \nhaystack scramble, rib fest, and street dance.\n  Even 125 years after its founding, Harrold remains as a shining \nexample of the steadfast spirit of small-town South Dakota. Harrold was \nbuilt on hard work and solid values, and serves as a reminder of South \nDakota's rich heritage. This grand achievement will serve to bring this \nclose-knit community even closer.

Mr. President, today I pay \ntribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of Tripp, SD. Tripp, a \nsmall town located in Hutchinson County, will be celebrating its \nquasquicentennial the weekend of July 1-3.\n  Tripp was incorporated in 1888 and named after Judge Bartlett C. \nTripp. On his way to California, Judge Tripp fell in love with the area \nand chose to make it his home. Judge Tripp was later appointed chief \njustice of the Dakota Supreme Court in 1885 by President Cleveland, and \nalso served as the U.S. Minister to Austria-Hungary. Although a \ndiplomat, Judge Tripp identified with the possibilities that South \nDakota offered.\n  Today, the importance of community to this vibrant town is evident in \nthe presence of their well-maintained school, local businesses, and \nchurches. The Veteran's Memorial is a popular tourist attraction and \nbrings community pride to the residents and honors the military members \nthat served their country. Tripp will celebrate its 125th anniversary \nwith many activities including a race on the local fairgrounds.\n  Tripp is a thriving town that maintains true South Dakota values. I \ncongratulate the citizens of Tripp on their accomplishments over the \nlast 125 years and look forward to seeing their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4126-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4126-S4127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SCHLOSSBERG COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, any of us who have been in public \nlife have learned--sometimes the hard way--the virtues of something our \nlate colleague Ted Kennedy believed was a secret to success \nparticularly in the U.S. Senate, which is the importance of taking our \nwork seriously but not taking ourselves too seriously. We still miss \nthe booming laughter of Ted Kennedy that seems still today to echo \nthrough the Democratic cloakroom. It was a trait Ted shared with his \nbrother, President Kennedy, whose quick wit is still celebrated today, \nthe self-deprecating humor which summarized his World War II exploits \non PT 109--``they sank my ship''--and described the joys of the \nPresidency--``the pay is good and I can walk to work''--which too often \nis missing in a modern day Washington where self-importance can \nsometimes trump the important work to be done. As President Kennedy \nhimself once said, ``There are three things which are real; God, Human \nFolly and Laughter. The first two are beyond our comprehension so we \nmust do what we can with the third.''\n  A sense of humor is not genetic, but apparently in the Kennedy family \nit can be inherited. In President Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, \nthis quality seems to abide.\n  I got to know Jack well when he spent time here in the Senate both as \na page and as an intern in my office. It was a difficult time for the \nKennedy family when Teddy himself couldn't be here as he was battling \nillness, but Ted enjoyed very much the stories he heard and the photos \nhe cherished of his great-nephew hard at work in the Senate Ted loved. \nWhen Jack wasn't busy with his page duties, particularly during the \nlate night votes when in previous years Teddy himself would have been \nfound regaling his colleagues with stories and laughs, I enjoyed \nhearing from Jack about all the lessons he had learned from his uncle.\n  One of those lessons--the importance of humor--was clearly taken to \nheart by young Jack--something I learned last week reading Jack's \nvaledictory address this month to his classmates at the Collegiate \nSchool and delivered his speech as valedictorian. Jack's speech is \nflavored with all the inside jokes that will forever be the shorthand \nhistory of the 13 years he and most of his classmates spent at \nCollegiate--the cello body slam, the sumo wrestler videos, the ballad \nof Bubba Grandoo, when Carlo broke the silence--all the absurdity and \nantics of years fully enjoyed while learning. Jack's speech is also \ndefined by a deep understanding of what holds real value in this life--\nteachers who care, friends who share, parents who love--truths that \nJack and his classmates will surely carry in the years ahead after \ngraduating from Collegiate.\n  Mr. President, particularly for all of us who know it is important to \nstop and laugh from time to time, Jack's speech really is required \nreading, and I would like to have printed in the Record, with \ncongratulations to Jack, and the knowledge that Teddy's booming \nlaughter could be heard echoing all over heaven following along with \nevery word.\n  The information follows.\n\n                          Commencement Address\n\n                         (By Jack Schlossberg)\n\n       Faculty, parents, students, esteemed guests, present \n     clergy, Mr. Rosenthal, I thank you for your warm welcome and \n     for being here today. I wanted to discuss my time at \n     Collegiate and my class, but this is neither the time nor the \n     place. But really, it is with great honor that I make my \n     speech as your valedictorian, looks like my hard work paid \n     off.\n       I want to begin with our teachers. My class would not be \n     sitting here, heading to the fantastic places we're going \n     next year, without our teachers. The curiosity, the energy, \n     the devotion . . . the tolerance that you bring to this \n     school is what makes it so great . . . Doctor Clarke and Mrs. \n     Heard taught us history and her story. Doctor Bresnick, Mrs. \n     Beresford and Mrs. Hansen have introduced us to characters \n     and explored philosophy. Mrs. Foley has taught us, well \n     actually on the smart kids, how to understand things that I \n     never will, and Dr. Sigismondi has brought us to appreciate \n     the high levels math has to offer. We also thank the \n     maintenance staff and those administrators who make our \n     school run smoothly despite the mess we make.\n       We understand that we do not come by the strength and unity \n     of our school by ourselves. Our teachers encourage us just as \n     much as we encourage each other to--get weird. In what other \n     school, I ask you, could El Hajj and Todd Layton be clapped \n     offstage for no apparent reason? The things we say at Friday \n     night games would not be tolerated on any TV show or in any \n     public venue. We're able to act this way because our teachers \n     love us no matter what. And, although some are more lenient \n     than others, Hola Senor, each teacher entertains our \n     absurdity because they understand how important it is for us \n     to have the freedom to be ourselves. Sometimes we go too far, \n     Hola Mrs. Aidoo, and for this we apologize, but we are \n     grateful for all the love and support of our antics.\n       On a different note, Collegiate has provided me with \n     something truly irreplaceable: a second set of parents, and a \n     third, and a fourth, and a fifth, and I think this is true \n     for all of us. While my mother and father provide me with \n     more than enough parenting, who wouldn't want 54 other sets \n     of parents watching over their every single move?\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\n       You, the Collegiate parents, are what make this day \n     possible. You have you each raised one of the greatest \n     children of all time, you have dealt with all of us during \n     the most stressful times of our lives, you have helped each \n     other through hardships, you have taught us so much of what \n     we know; we can only hope to grow up to be nothing like you.\n       Surprisingly, now I would like to say a few words about my \n     class. For many of us, Collegiate has been our life since the \n     age of 5. That's 13 years, or 91 in dog years, looking at you \n     Bresnick, you dog--probably the longest time most of us will \n     ever stay in one place. So condense with me, if you will, \n     those thirteen years into a time span of but a week here at \n     school. On Monday morning, under this standard, we arrived at \n     school, some of us potty trained, and some of us not quite \n     there, Spazznick you dog, and began our Collegiate careers.\n       Things started fast that Monday morning. Star Sawyer \n     introduced us all to the language of love. Abby Newlan \n     renamed Pinsky, ``Mikey'' but was soon left due to a job \n     opening at Oprah's famed girls school in South Africa. Wait, \n     no, wrong joke. K1 ran train on K2, a trend that has since \n     continued. And that afternoon, after nap time, we entered \n     First grade. Sadly, Eliot Snyder overslept and missed moving \n     up day.\n       Under the reign of Beth Tashlik, our serious academia \n     began. We counted and estimated the number of peanut M's in \n     a jar, getting our first proverbial nut. Then, Mrs. \n     Hutchinson met Andrew Newhouse, and it took her less than a \n     month to literally ``hit the roof'' after his contagious \n     laughter got the better of our entire grade in an assembly \n     featuring several videos of sumo wrestlers. That afternoon we \n     went home, entirely unsuspecting of the rude awakening \n     Tuesday morning and Second grade would bring us.\n       Second grade was a roller coaster of a year, let me tell \n     you. I had my first kiss, and no, not with Martha Miasaka as \n     the legend suggests, instead it came from the wonder from \n     down under, Mrs. Brydon on Kissmiss eve. We went on ``mini-\n     trips'' and hit all New York's hotspots. Some went to the \n     Statue of Liberty; some went to Dannie and Eddies, and some \n     to the Empire State building. We also got our first new kid, \n     a great addition to our grade, William Janover. But, it \n     wasn't all fun and games. We learned to write cursive, which \n     none of us can still do, and we lost some real good men out \n     there: Drew Glicker and Spensor Ong left Collegiate for the \n     greener pastures of . . . God knows where.\n       We then went to lunch in the third floor cafeteria, came \n     upstairs, and were wonderfully surprised with what the lower \n     school handed us: Mrs. Dopp, Mrs. McCauley, Mrs. Thompson and \n     Mrs. Mullis taught us 3rd grade. All were great, but only one \n     gave Doug Gleicher the finger. We learned our times tables \n     and got separated into reading groups. During music, Chris \n     Cargill was crowned our major-minor king, but was soon \n     usurped by his twin, the evil Courtland.\n       By the end of Tuesday, we were the seniors of the lower \n     school. I finally had final cut on my Iktome story, and \n     Abowitz couldn't do a thing about it. Science got interesting \n     when Mr. Duarte mixed one of his own pellets in with the \n     owls'. Oddly enough, that group still found a mouse's \n     skeleton.\n       On Wednesday, we were thrown into the world of Tashjinian \n     metaphors: the Canada Goose, the Pythagorean theorem, Phil \n     the Lobsterman, and the Purple Cabbage provided us all with \n     limitless inspiration. Needless to say, things were different \n     in 5th grade. We were at the mercy of a new set of teachers. \n     We were asked to turn in homework. We got four new kids, four \n     studs, Ola, Darien, Adam, and Billy Janover. We almost got \n     one more, but instead we were left with the four first names \n     that still make our fingers tingle: Aaron Ashley Marshall \n     Bob.\n       We then began 6th grade and had a ball. Rolling Thunder \n     Heard our Cry when we were forced to spend three days with \n     the George Jackson School on a wilderness trip. May Mandeep \n     Singh rest in peace. And, in the funniest memory I have of \n     Collegiate, David Wilks body slammed a cello, I kid you not. \n     David felt badly, but Mr. Lastraps kindly turned his blind \n     eye to the wreckage.\n       Many of us became men on Wednesday afternoon, as Bar \n     Mitzvah season quickly changed our lives. At the time, I was \n     not built for the hora. A portly young man with a sweet \n     tooth, I had trouble with the chocolate fountains, the \n     neckties, and the dance floor. Many of you felt my pain, \n     looking at you Jeff Wilks, but others capitalized on it. \n     Nissan moved well to hip-hop and Lynfield was built for slow \n     songs. Still, I danced with a few cuties on those fine \n     evenings, and all too often the party went from 6 all the way \n     to midnight. Things got even crazier during school, we had \n     sports teams and final exams. I never got above a B in \n     either. Plus, no one felt safe in the lunch room, as Henri \n     MacArthur's ridicule knew no bounds.\n       Finally, Wednesday afternoon and 8th grade provided our \n     first taste of entitlement. We didn't get away with much \n     though, as Ms. Bell made men of us boys. By then Alvin, Will \n     Grant, Yuri David Yan and Bill Janover had joined us due to \n     the gigantic void left by Cary Jones. Alvin and Grant sang us \n     the ballad of Bubba Grandoo, at first this and their other \n     songs seemed impressive, but later we found out they stole \n     all but the nonsensical lyrics from Madonna. The other two \n     were even more controversial. Yan took away Sam Bresnick's \n     only claim to fame: height. And Yuri made us all look like \n     morons.\n       Hump day had passed and when a new day dawned, 9th grade \n     slapped us all across the face. Along with 11 new kids, \n     William included, Mrs. Hansen joined our grade in entering \n     the Upper School, and she loved everything about us from day \n     1. Things definitely changed for us, grades started to \n     matter, which gave Mr. Rubin way too much leverage. The work \n     was more demanding, but our classes and teachers were more \n     dynamic. Yes, Biology and Mr. Wong intrigued us all, but you \n     all know that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about \n     our Geometry teacher, whose name I am not permitted to say. I \n     cannot begin to describe him to younger grades, I dare not \n     make fun of his table manners, teaching style, physique or \n     general disposition in front of his colleagues, and \n     uncovering the truth behind he and Dustin Satloff's SatBat \n     contract may require legal action. So, I decided it best to \n     leave him out entirely. Some things didn't change though. \n     Maybe it was something in the water, or maybe it was the \n     fertility pills hidden in the Muenster bagels, but French \n     teachers came and went like they had since Middle School. And \n     even though school took over my entire life starting Thursday \n     morning, I truly believe it was the start of a great four \n     years, an endeavor that improved and matured us all.\n       There was a fire drill on Thursday afternoon. That was 10th \n     grade.\n       TGIF had a whole new meaning as Junior year began. You all \n     remember the constant work, the SAT prep, and the terrors of \n     applying to College looming at all times. If it weren't for \n     the constant influx of cheerful show tunes from Dr. Maglione \n     I doubt I would have made it through the year. But we all did \n     make it through, and we came out much stronger than we went \n     in. We learned a lot about each other and our grade came \n     together, especially after our trip to Shelter Island. In \n     fact, I think the 4 time champion Collegiate Basketball team \n     owes a lot to Shelter Island and to Matt Roth. Finally, \n     Friday nights were filled with spirits, spirits that cheered \n     our team to victory.\n       Friday afternoon was our turn to show Collegiate what we \n     were made of. With Nissan at the helm, we made use of our \n     final year. At first though, our future was uncertain. \n     Overwhelmed with College apps, we rarely made time for fun or \n     games. Some just couldn't take the stress. After his year of \n     fine women and tanning, Jamie broke out in hives upon his \n     first glance at the common app. But we all calmed down after \n     a while. We slowly recuperated and got back to our roots. We \n     cared and we shared. Cared about each other, and if you're \n     Jesse, shared Taxis with girls. We then emerged as a talented \n     bunch. The debate team, with outstanding speaker Hunter Ford \n     competed valiantly at Yale and the Science Olympiads made \n     states and traveled to West Point. Eric Judge finally decided \n     to get a freakin' job and the basketball team made us all so \n     proud when they brought back a 4th consecutive championship. \n     And finally, let us not forget, we produced Upper West: the \n     duo that has been called Sultry meets Punk meets Rap meets \n     Techtonique meets . . . Dub Step meets Flogenic meets a lot \n     of criticism.\n       To top it off, one more extraordinary thing happened, \n     joking aside. When Carlo broke the silence last year, I \n     thought I'd never see something more moving or inspirational. \n     This is not something to be overlooked. It is rare. It is \n     powerful. It is a testament both to the strength of Carlo and \n     of our entire school. We hope we've risen to the occasion, \n     and we thank you for your example.\n       I never thought we would be seniors, and certainly never \n     imagined we would graduate, not because we're not smart--\n     we're geniuses, and not because we're bad people--we're \n     saints, but because 2011 was always the year that was miles \n     away.\n       That brings us to this moment, Friday afternoon of our \n     final day at school. Collegiate has made us who we are today, \n     and we will strive to live by the values we learned here. We \n     leave Collegiate with the hopes of a fun weekend ahead--a \n     weekend that should last the rest of our lives. Thank \n     you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4127-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4127-S4128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WISCONSIN TECHNICAL COLLEGE\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am honored to have the opportunity \nto congratulate the Wisconsin Technical College System on their \ncentennial celebration marking 100 years of contributing to my State \nand our Nation.\n  The early 1900s brought the Industrial Revolution and marked the \nonset of what would ultimately become a pivotal time in our Nation's \nhistory. In Wisconsin, our paper, shipbuilding and steel industries \nwere poised for growth and required workers who were highly skilled and \neducated in these burgeoning trades.\n  It was this critical need that inspired one of Wisconsin's foremost \neducational pioneers, Dr. Charles McCarthy, the first director of what \nis now known as the Legislative Reference Bureau, to suggest a new \nmodel of education for Wisconsin. Dr. McCarthy's idea was based on the \nbelief that, for many in Wisconsin, higher education could be obtained \nthrough a new model of learning. This model of learning would not only \nassist in meeting the\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nnew workforce demands of the Industrial Revolution, but would also \nprovide expanded access for all residents to a higher level of \neducation. In 1911, my home State of Wisconsin became the first State \nto establish a system of support for technical, vocational and adult \neducation.\n  What ensued in the following decades through the first World War and \nthe Great Depression emphasized the importance of vocational skills \ntraining and propelled the growth of the technical system. By the time \nthat World War II began, Wisconsin's Technical College System had \ngarnered a national reputation for excellence, prompting the Federal \nGovernment to allocate over $4.6 billion into the State to aid the war \neffort. By the 1960s, the success and value of the system had been \nfirmly established and the State legislature mandated that vocational \ndistricts be established throughout Wisconsin by 1970.\n  What began with an idea more than a century ago, the Wisconsin \nTechnical College System has continued to set the standard for our \nNation. The system currently serves 400,000 students on 47 campuses \nevery year, helping to shape the future of our State and prepare the \nworkers for tomorrow. Even in these difficult economic times, access to \nhigh quality education for all people remains crucial in ensuring that \nnot only Wisconsin but the Nation, moves forward. I am very proud to \nrecognize the Wisconsin Technical College System on its centennial \ncelebration and for all it has done for the State of Wisconsin and its \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4128-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4128-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4128-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1249.

Res. 15\n\n       Whereas April 25th of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being completely \n     preventable and treatable;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 35 countries, the majority of them in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, account for 98 percent of global malaria deaths;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, with \n     estimates that children under the age of 5 account for 85 \n     percent of malaria deaths each year;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal health, \n     causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth \n     weights, with estimates that malaria infection causes 400,000 \n     cases of severe maternal anemia and from 75,000 to 200,000 \n     infant deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria over recent years have \n     made measurable progress and have helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization's World Malaria \n     Report 2010 reports that in 2010, more African households (42 \n     percent) owned at least one insecticide-treated mosquito net \n     (ITN), more children under 5 years of age (35 percent) were \n     using an ITN compared to previous years, and household ITN \n     ownership reached more than 50 percent in 19 African \n     countries;\n       Whereas the World Health Organization's World Malaria \n     Report 2010 further states that a total of 11 countries and \n     one area in the African Region showed a reduction of more \n     than 50 percent in either confirmed malaria cases or malaria \n     admissions and deaths in recent years (Algeria, Botswana, \n     Cape Verde, Eritrea, Madagascar, Namibia, Rwanda, Sao Tome \n     and Principe, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zanzibar, \n     United Republic of Tanzania), and that in all countries, the \n     decreases are associated with intense malaria control \n     interventions;\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment is critical to continue to reduce malaria deaths \n     and to prevent backsliding in those areas where progress has \n     been made;\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a major \n     leadership role in the recent progress made toward reducing \n     the global burden of malaria, particularly through the \n     President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) and the United States \n     contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria;\n       Whereas on World Malaria Day in 2009, President Barack \n     Obama stated, ``The U.S. stands with our global partners and \n     people\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\n     around the world to reaffirm our commitment to make the U.S. \n     a leader in ending deaths from malaria by 2015. . . . It is \n     time to redouble our efforts to rid the world of a disease \n     that does not have to take lives.'';\n       Whereas under the Global Health Initiative (GHI), the \n     United States Government is pursuing a comprehensive, whole-\n     of-government approach to global health, focused on helping \n     partner countries to achieve major improvements in overall \n     health outcomes through transformational advances in access \n     to, and the quality of, healthcare services in resource-poor \n     settings; and\n       Whereas recognizing the burden of malaria on many partner \n     countries, PMI has set the target for 2015 of reducing the \n     burden of malaria by 50 percent for 450,000,000 people, \n     representing 70 percent of the at-risk population in Africa: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day, \n     including the achievable target of ending malaria deaths by \n     2015;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria \n     prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal \n     health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing \n     global malaria deaths and prevalence, particularly through \n     the efforts of the President's Malaria Initiative and the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       (4) welcomes ongoing public-private partnerships to \n     research and develop more effective and affordable tools for \n     malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;\n       (5) recognizes the goals to combat malaria in the Tom \n     Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership \n     Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization \n     Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-293);\n       (6) supports continued leadership by the United States in \n     bilateral and multilateral efforts to combat malaria as a \n     critical part of the President's Global Health Initiative; \n     and\n       (7) encourages other members of the international community \n     to sustain and scale up their support and financial \n     contributions for efforts worldwide to combat malaria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/27/senate-section/article/S4133-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PEACEFUL AND MULTILATERAL RESOLUTION TO MARITIME TERRITORIAL DISPUTES \n                           IN SOUTHEAST ASIA\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 217\n\n       Whereas, on June 9, 2011, 3 vessels from China, including 1 \n     fishing vessel and 2 maritime security vessels, ran into and \n     disabled the cables of an exploration ship from Vietnam, the \n     VIKING 2;\n       Whereas that use of force occurred within 200 nautical \n     miles of Vietnam, an area recognized as its Exclusive \n     Economic Zone;\n       Whereas, on May 26, 2011, a maritime security vessel from \n     China cut the cables of another exploration ship from \n     Vietnam, the BINH MINH, in the South China Sea in waters near \n     Cam Ranh Bay;\n       Whereas, in March 2011, the Government of the Philippines \n     reported that patrol boats from China attempted to ram 1 of \n     its surveillance ships;\n       Whereas those incidents occurred within disputed maritime \n     territories of the South China Sea, including the Spratly \n     Islands, composed of 21 islands and atolls, 50 submerged land \n     atolls, and 28 partly submerged reefs over an area of 340,000 \n     square miles, and the Paracel Islands, a smaller group of \n     islands located south of China's Hainan Island;\n       Whereas China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, \n     and Brunei have disputed territorial claims over the Spratly \n     Islands, and China and Vietnam have a disputed claim over the \n     Paracel Islands;\n       Whereas the Government of China claims most of the 648,000 \n     square miles of the South China Sea, more than any other \n     nation involved in those territorial disputes;\n       Whereas, in 2002, the Association of Southeast Asian \n     Nations and China signed a declaration on the code of conduct \n     of parties in the South China Sea;\n       Whereas that declaration committed all parties to those \n     territorial disputes to ``reaffirm their respect for and \n     commitment to the freedom of navigation in and overflight \n     above the South China Sea'' and to ``resolve their \n     territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, \n     without resorting to the threat or use of force'';\n       Whereas the South China Sea contains vital commercial \n     shipping lines and points of access between the Indian Ocean \n     and Pacific Ocean;\n       Whereas, although not a party to these disputes, the United \n     States has a national economic and a security interest in \n     ensuring that no party uses force unilaterally to assert \n     maritime territorial claims in East Asia;\n       Whereas, in September 2010, the Government of China also \n     deliberately provoked a controversy within the waters of the \n     Senkaku Islands, territory under the legal administration of \n     Japan in the East China Sea;\n       Whereas the actions of the Government of China in the South \n     China Sea have also affected United States military and \n     maritime vessels transiting through international air space \n     and waters, including the collision of a fighter plane of the \n     Government of China with a United States surveillance plane \n     in 2001, the harassment of the USNS IMPECCABLE in March 2009, \n     and the collision of a Chinese submarine with the sonar cable \n     of the USS JOHN MCCAIN in June 2009;\n       Whereas, like every nation, the United States has a \n     national interest in freedom of navigation and open access to \n     the maritime commons of Asia;\n       Whereas the Government of the United States expressed \n     support for the declaration by the Association of Southeast \n     Asian Nations and China in 2002 on the code of conduct of \n     parties in the South China Sea, and supports a collaborative \n     diplomatic process by all claimants for resolving the various \n     territorial disputes without coercion;\n       Whereas the United States has a national interest in \n     freedom of navigation and in unimpeded economic development \n     and commerce;\n       Whereas, on October 11, 2010, Secretary Gates maintained \n     ``The United States has always exercised our rights and \n     supported the rights of others to transit through, and \n     operate in, international waters.'';\n       Whereas, on June 3, 2011, at the Shangri-La Dialogue in \n     Singapore, Secretary Gates stated that ``[m]aritime security \n     remains an issue of particular importance for the region, \n     with questions about territorial claims and the appropriate \n     use of the maritime domain presenting on-going challenges to \n     regional stability and prosperity'';\n       Whereas, on June 4, 2011, at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Liang \n     Guanglie, the Defense Minister from China, said, ``China is \n     committed to maintaining peace and stability in the South \n     China Sea.'';\n       Whereas, on June 11, 2011, the Government of Vietnam held a \n     live-fire military exercise on the uninhabited island of Hon \n     Ong, 25 miles off the coast of Vietnam in the South China \n     Sea; and\n       Whereas, on June 11, 2011, Hong Lei, the Foreign Ministry \n     spokesman of China, stated, ``[China] will not resort to \n     force or the threat of force'' to resolve the territorial \n     dispute: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms the strong support of the United States for \n     the peaceful resolution of maritime territorial disputes in \n     the South China Sea, and pledges continued efforts to \n     facilitate a multilateral, peaceful process to resolve these \n     disputes;\n       (2) deplores the use of force by naval and maritime \n     security vessels from China in the South China Sea;\n       (3) calls on all parties to the territorial dispute to \n     refrain from threatening force or using force to assert \n     territorial claims;
