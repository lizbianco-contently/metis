Mr. President, I would yield to my friend from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Welcoming the Guest Chaplain\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for that \ncourtesy. I will only take a moment to recognize and welcome Rev. \nRebecca Spencer who shared with us the prayer that began the Senate \nsession this morning.\n  She has been the senior pastor of the Central Congregational Church \nin Providence, RI, since 1988. It was my congregation for the years \nthat I lived in Providence. My wife and I renewed our vows under her \ncare. She is a wonderful and thoughtful preacher from the pulpit. Her \nchurch has perhaps the best musical and choral program certainly \nanywhere in Rhode Island and probably for a good distance around. If \nyou have not heard the ``Hallelujah Chorus'' sung at Easter at Central \nCongregational Church, you have missed an extraordinary experience.\n  But her greatest contribution in a community that she has served now \nfor 24 years has been pastoral work with the families who make Central \nCongregational their home and the home of their faith. From birth to \nbaptisms and for kids coming up through the youth programs the church \nruns, through marriages and unfortunately sometimes divorces, and \nthrough illness and death, Reverend Spencer is a wonderful friend and a \nwonderful solace and a wonderful gift to all of the congregation that \nshe serves.\n  She is joined today by her sons Tom and Ezra. We welcome them as \nwell, and are delighted that she has taken the time to come down from \nProvidence, RI.\n  I thank our Chaplain, Chaplain Black, for his courtesy in helping to \nfacilitate this visit.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the motion to \nproceed to the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. Following my \nremarks and those of the Republican leader, if any, the first hour will \nbe equally divided between the two sides. The Republicans will control \nthe first 30 minutes, the Democrats the final 30 minutes.\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\n  I note that the filing deadline for second-degree amendments to the \nsubstitute amendment and to the postal reform bill is 11 a.m. today. We \nare still hopeful of working out an agreement on the postal reform \nbill. If no agreement is reached, there will be a cloture vote on the \nsubstitute amendment this afternoon at 2:15.\n\n\n                             Postal Reform\n\n  Mr. President, for more than two centuries, 200 years, America's \npostal system thrived and grew in spite of rapidly changing technology. \nThe Postal Service survived the invention of the telegraph, the \ntelephone. It expanded despite radio and television. It grew regardless \nof the fax machine.\n  The post office was created in the day of the quill and ink--these \ninkwells we talked about yesterday--and mailbags slung across horses. \nThe post office survived all of that. It grew through the days of horse \nand buggy, steamboat and railroad, into the age of airplanes. It \nadjusted to the expansion of the suburbs, to the growth of cities, and \nthe explosion of our population generally.\n  It adapted from hand sorting and conveyer belts, with the invention \nof ZIP Codes and optical sorting machines. The post office has always \nfound creative, cutting-edge ways to do more and more to move mail more \nquickly, and more of it.\n  In fact, for two centuries, the Postal Service relied on technology \nto cope with constant growth, growth in the volume of mail it delivered \nand the number of homes and businesses to which it delivered. And for \n200 years, the Postal Service kept up with a flood of packages and \nletters and mail orders and online purchases, catalogues and fliers, \nlife-saving medications and absentee ballots, bulk mail and overnight \ndelivery. The post office survived.\n  Today the Postal Service handles nearly half the world's mail--554 \nmillion pieces every day, 6,400 pieces every second. That feat would be \nimpossible without modern technology and world-class workers and \nfacilities. But now technology is both a solution and a problem. In the \nlast 5 years, the Postal Service has seen mail volume drop by more than \n20 percent. That trend is expected to continue.\n  E-mail and online bill payments significantly contributed to this \ncrisis. Today letters, orders, payments across the world happen with \nthe click of a mouse. And the challenge facing the Postal Service is \nhow to adapt to a decreasing volume of mail rather than how to deal \nwith increasing demand.\n  The bipartisan compromise before the Senate will help the system do \nthat. It will build a leaner, smarter post office which offers new \nproducts and services while protecting its mission--delivering the mail \n6 days a week to every corner of our great Nation.\n  The postal reform legislation before this body will sensibly \nrestructure the system while preserving overnight and Saturday \ndelivery. The legislation will save the Postal Service from insolvency. \nIt will responsibly reduce the Postal Service workforce and the number \nof facilities it maintains. But it will also protect postal employees, \nincluding 130,000 veterans from our Armed Forces. It will also \nsafeguard the more than 8 million jobs that depend on a vibrant postal \nsystem. And, most importantly, it will account for the needs of \nmillions of seniors, people with disabilities, small business owners, \nand rural Americans for whom the U.S. mail is an important lifeline to \nthe outside world.\n  Unlike the unacceptable bill Congressman Issa is pursuing in the \nHouse, this bipartisanship Senate bill preserves the Postal Service we \nknow and rely on. The House bill, by contrast, would immediately \neliminate Saturday delivery, and it would set up commissions to \nunilaterally cut costs by closing post offices and processing plants, \nvoiding union contracts and laying off tens of thousands of workers \nwhen our economy can least afford it.\n  That may be why Congressman Issa's bill has not come up for a vote. \nThere could be other reasons. But even the tea party advocates have \ntrouble supporting his reckless ideas. The Senate bill we are \nconsidering today is not perfect. It will not save every post office, \nevery job, or every distribution center. It will not please every \nSenator, every postal worker, or every customer. But unlike the House \nlegislation, it is a strong, bipartisan bill that will modernize an \ninstitution enshrined in the Constitution without gutting its mission.\n  I hope we can continue to work together to pass this worthy \nlegislation, but we are going to have to make a decision on that this \nmorning. I appreciate everyone's cooperation. I especially appreciate \nthe hard work of Senator Joe Lieberman and Senator Susan Collins, the \ntwo floor managers of this legislation. There have been others who have \nworked very hard on this legislation, not the least of whom is Tom \nCarper who has devoted a lot of the last few years of his life to this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          Svinicki Nomination\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday I came to the floor to call \nattention to a woman named Kristine Svinicki, a widely respected \nnuclear engineer who sits on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the \nFederal agency charged with ensuring the safety of our Nation's nuclear \npowerplants. At the moment, Commissioner Svinicki is in Africa, sharing \nher expertise on nuclear safety at the request of the Obama \nadministration, which should not surprise anybody, since she is one of \nthe world's leading experts on the topic, and since President Obama's \nown Chief of Staff signed a letter a few months ago expressing the \nadministration's confidence in her commitment to the mission of the NRC \nand her ability to fulfill it.\n  I have the letter. It is dated December 12. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2011.\n     Hon. Gregory B. Jaczko,\n     Chairman, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. George Apostolakis,\n     Commissioner, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. William D. Magwood IV,\n     Commissioner, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. William C. Ostendorff,\n     Commissioner, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Kristine L. Svinicki,\n     Commissioner, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Commissioners: I am writing to you regarding the \n     internal management issues at the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission raised in the Commissioners letter to me dated \n     October 13, 2011.\n       As an initial matter, I would like to thank you again for \n     raising these concerns with me, and for your commitment to \n     fulfilling the agency's important mission to ensure the safe \n     civilian use of nuclear materials. The Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission has an important mission, and we respect and \n     appreciate your strong commitment to the Commission's work \n     and values.\n       As you know, upon receipt of the October 13 letter, I \n     arranged to meet personally with each of you so that I would \n     have opportunity to discuss these matters with you. I also \n     met with the agency's Executive Director of Operations. By \n     letter dated December 7, 2011, Chairman Jaczko subsequently \n     responded in writing to the concerns raised in the October 13 \n     letter.\n       While I recognize that there are tensions and disagreements \n     among the Commissioners, each of you made it clear in your \n     conversations with me that these management differences have \n     not impaired the Commission's ability to fulfill its mission \n     or in any way jeopardized the safety and security of nuclear \n     facilities in the United States.\n       I share your commitment to the mission of the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission and agree that sound leadership and \n     management practices are essential to its proper functioning. \n     In our meetings each of you expressed your strong commitment \n     to the agency and to ensuring that it fulfills its mission. \n     We have confidence in your ability to do so, and urge each of \n     you to make every effort to improve the internal \n     communications at the agency.\n       The Chairman has committed to improve communications \n     amongst you, including by keeping fellow Commissioners better \n     informed, and has proposed that all of the Commissioners meet \n     with a trusted third\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\n     party to promote a better dialog. I urge you to pursue such a \n     course of action and to keep me apprised of your progress \n     and, as appropriate, any findings or recommendations of the \n     agency's Office of Inspector General, as I intend to continue \n     to monitor the situation.\n       I have also enclosed for your information my response to a \n     letter I received on this matter from Chairman Issa.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William M. Daley,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what is surprising is that despite all \nof this, despite her expertise, despite the administration's own stated \nsupport for her work, she has not yet been renominated. The White House \nalone has the power to renominate. For some reason they have not. Look, \nthe only possible reason for this delay is the fact that she had the \ncourage to blow the whistle on the Commission's Chairman Gregory \nJazcko, a guy whose temper and condescension toward subordinates, \nparticularly women, nearly cost him his job.\n  So let's be clear about this. The only reason we are even talking \nabout Kristine Svinicki right now is because she had the courage to \nstand up to a hostile work environment and the bully who was \nresponsible for it. That is the only reason we are even having this \nconversation. She should be applauded for that, not hung out to dry.\n  Yet that is precisely what has been happening here. Commissioner \nSvinicki is one of the world's leading experts on nuclear safety. She \nwas confirmed in her current term without a single dissenting vote--not \none. She enjoys the respect of her colleagues and, as the letter I just \ncited shows, of the Obama administration as well. Her renomination \npapers were completed more than a year ago, as was the FBI report that \nnominees have to complete ahead of being confirmed.\n  If this nomination continues to be held, after she had the courage to \ntake a stand, it will send a chill up the spine of every whistleblower \nin Washington. Commissioner Svinicki spoke out against a guy that even \nDemocratic commissioners say bullied employees and intimidated female \nworkers. Kristine Svinicki did the right thing in raising the alarm. \nShe should not pay a price for it. The White House says it likes the \njob she is doing. They sent her to Africa to give a keynote address on \nnuclear safety. Yet for over a year there has been silence. It is my \nhope they are not rewarding abusive behavior by silencing someone who \nhad the courage to speak out. There is no reason for this renomination \nand reconfirmation to wait another single day.\n  If Democrats have a problem with Commissioner Svinicki, then let's \ndebate it.\n  This morning, I renew my call for the White House to send this \nnomination over immediately and for the Senate to act quickly to get \nCommissioner Svinicki reconfirmed. The White House said just yesterday \nthere should be no interruption in service on the Commission, so why \ndon't we get this done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the first \nhour will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders, or \ntheir designees, with the Republicans controlling the first 30 minutes \nand the majority controlling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                          Conference Spending\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout what is occurring with the GSA conference waste that has been in \nthe news of late. My criticisms are not mainly directed toward GSA.\n  Over 3 years ago, I started doing oversight on conferences by \ngovernment agencies. Today I have an amendment, which will not be \nallowed to be considered, that will hold the agencies accountable in \nterms of their conferences. Through the years I have put out five \nreports on wasteful conference spending from the Department of Justice, \nwhere it spent $380 million over a 5-year period on conferences, to the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and to the Department of HHS in terms of \nsending thousands of people to one conference at a time. All of it went \nunheeded.\n  Now we have the GSA--with Members of the Senate and the House aghast \nat the waste that has been spent in terms of the GSA conference out \nWest. Had we been doing our job--and there were multiple amendments I \nhave offered over the last 6 years to control conference spending, \nwhich have been rejected on party-line votes, to try to bring some \nsemblance of reasonableness and control to conference spending by the \nvarious Federal Government agencies.\n  So we have this problem with the GSA today, but not because of the \nGSA; it is because of ourselves. We refused to do the hard work of \npassing requirements that would hold Federal agencies accountable.\n  My hope is that we would, in one small step, accept an amendment on \nthe postal bill that would allow us to start holding the agencies \naccountable. It makes for great press and great TV when we stand aghast \nat what is obviously wasteful spending by an agency, but that \naccomplishes nothing other than advancing the political careers of my \ncolleagues. We can accomplish something with real legislation that has \nreal teeth and holds the agencies accountable. It is my hope we can \nhave a vote--I don't even think it would take a vote; I think it would \nbe accepted by unanimous consent--that would force the agencies to now \ncome into compliance both in terms of transparency and accountability \nin how they spend their money.\n  Every Federal Government agency today has the capability for \nteleconferencing. We don't have to send 1,000 people, at $2,000 apiece, \nto a conference to accomplish education and training. We all have it in \nour offices. The GAO has determined that most Federal employees see \nconferencing as one of the perks of their job, which is in one of their \nreports.\n  I invite the American constituency to look at my Web site, \ncoburn.senate.gov, and go to the studies we put out and oversight \nreports on wasteful conference spending over the last 3 to 5 years and \nask themselves a question: Why didn't Congress act on it? Why didn't \nthey do something about it?\n  Now we claim we are insulted at the waste. We have had five different \nopportunities with amendments to do something about it, and we rejected \nthem. We have seen oversight reports that are fully documented which \nshow the waste. Yet we have not done anything.\n  If Americans are upset with the waste of the GSA conference, they \nneed to be upset with Members of the Senate who have rejected time and \nagain the ability to hold agencies accountable on conference spending. \nIt is my hope that in a bipartisan manner we can address this issue--\nand not just for GSA but for every government agency so that now we can \nsee transparency and accountability in how the hard-working American \ntaxpayers' dollars are spent, not wasted, and they will know when money \nis spent on a conference, everybody will see it, and they are going to \nhave to justify not only the expenditure but the reason they are \nsending people to vacation spots when they should be doing it through \nteleconferencing and bringing needed updates to Federal employees in a \nmuch more efficient and effective way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank my friend and my congressional \nneighbor. When we were in the House, we represented adjoining districts \nin Missouri and Oklahoma, and it is good to be serving in the Senate \nwith my friend and to hear his commonsense approach on how we need to \nsolve the problems we are facing as a country and the needless problems \nthe government seems to be willing to create for itself.\n  We have been talking so much--at least the President has been talking \nabout economic fairness as the principal goal of the Tax Code. Frankly, \nthe most fair thing we can do in the Tax Code and in the Senate would \nbe to work to be sure we are dealing with the important issues the job \ncreators and families are dealing with across the country today.\n  All of us have had the opportunity to be home over the last 2 weeks. \nI was able to be in the last of the 115 Missouri counties that I hadn't \nbeen in since I was sworn into the Senate 15 or so months ago. I learn \na lot when I am out there.\n  What I learned this time is that people are focused on fuel costs. \nFuel costs\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\nare on track to hit an average of $4 per gallon by summertime. This is \nmore than double what fuel costs were in January of 2009, and it set \nthe all-time record for the last 2 months. I talked to the people in \nsouth central Missouri who are trying to provide transportation for \nolder Americans and disabled Americans, and the fuel cost increase of \n$150,000 means they have to cut back their services.\n\n  The chamber of commerce survey this week found that nearly one out of \nfour small businesses reported that their top concern was gas prices. \nWhen we think about that, whether it is delivery or whether it is \nemployees getting to work or whether it is people deciding they cannot \ngo to that small business--the restaurant, the bowling alley, a movie \ntheater, or whatever it might be because they just put too much money \nin the gas tank of their cars--we should be concerned.\n  Unfortunately, instead of working to pass solutions that would \njumpstart our economy and restore consumer confidence, we simply want \nto talk about the wrong thing over and over. We had a vote on the so-\ncalled Buffett tax this week, which almost everybody who talked about \nit said it is more of a gimmick than a solution because even if we \ncollected this new tax on Warren Buffett and his wealthy friends, in a \nyear we would collect what the Federal Government deficit is in a day. \nWe will not solve this problem dealing with one three-hundred sixty-\nfifth of the deficit like it is the solution to the problem.\n  The lead sponsor of the Buffett tax in the Senate, Senator \nWhitehouse, said on the Senate floor that the aim of the bill is not to \nlower the unemployment rate or the price of gasoline. Why would we not \nhave a bill on the Senate floor the aim of which is either to do \nsomething about energy prices or job creation?\n  This bill would generate less than 1 percent of the $7 trillion \ndeficit projected in the 2013 budget during that same period of time. \nIt would take 250 years to collect enough money under the so-called \nBuffett rule to pay the 2011 deficit. If the solution to last year's \ndeficit would take us 250 years of recovery, the truth is we are just \nwasting a lot of time on little things rather than big things. We can \nmake little things sound big.\n  We can make it sound as though fairness is the critical element of \neverything the government should do, as opposed to opportunity being \nthe critical element of everything the government should do. We can \nmake it sound as though people will still invest money, their IRAs or \ntheir lifetime savings--their return is, even if they are successful, \nzero. But that is not what is going to happen.\n  I just finished reading a book about President Eisenhower and General \nEisenhower. There are many pertinent things in that book, but one was \nwhen General Eisenhower and others came back from World War II, the top \ntax rate was 90 percent. From 1933 1934 until 1981, it was at least 70 \npercent.\n  Two points can be made there. Nobody paid it if they figured out how \nto avoid it, and almost everybody figured out how to avoid it--lots of \npassive investments instead of active ones. It had to be a good time \nfor municipal bonds because there was no tax on them. So why not put \nyour money there. If you made any money, 70 percent would go to the \nFederal Government or, in 1946, 90 percent would go to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  But the capital gains rate--which happened to be the rate at which \nWorld War II memoirs were taxed, which is why it was in this book--was \n25 percent. Even when the top rate in the country was 90 percent, \nnobody thought the capital gains rate should be even one-third of that \nbecause they knew people would not invest money if there was no return. \nWe need tax policies that multiply the opportunities created in our \neconomy rather than subtract from those opportunities.\n  If we want this not to be about politics but about math, it needs to \nbe about multiplication not subtraction and about how to drive an \neconomy to encourage more private sector jobs.\n  How do we encourage investment and encourage people to take risks? If \nnobody takes a risk, somebody else doesn't get an opportunity. People \nbeing willing to take a risk means that an opportunity is created for \nsomebody else that would not have been created otherwise. Last month, \nwe were here talking about tax hikes on American energy producers that \nclearly would be passed along to consumers. Nobody even argues if we \nhad passed those tax hikes last month that gas prices would not go up.\n  Why in the world would we argue about anything that would raise gas \nprices rather than lower gas prices? The sponsor of that bill said \nnobody has made the claim that this bill is about reducing gas prices. \nThe majority leader, Mr. Reid, admitted that this is not a question of \ngas prices. Senator Schumer said this was never intended to talk about \nlowering gas prices. Senator Begich said the bill would not decrease \nprices at the pump for our families and small businesses--and these \nwere the supporters of the bill.\n  Why would we have a bill on the Senate floor to do that when we could \nsupport what the President says he is for, which is an ``all-of-the-\nabove'' energy strategy? Let's do what we can to solve this problem. \nThe most glaring recent example is, of course, the Keystone Pipeline, \nwhich would run through North Dakota, go through Nebraska and other \nStates, and get to our refineries. It would create 20,000 jobs, and it \nwould decrease our country's dependence upon people who don't like us \nvery much. It would also encourage more North American energy and \nencourage energy from our best trading partner, Canada. It is just one \nof the commonsense steps we can make.\n  If someone would have told me a couple years ago that when we went \nhome in the spring of 2012, one of the things people would be talking \nabout is why aren't we building a oil pipeline from Canada, I would \nhave said that is a pretty detailed understanding of our energy \nproblem, but it is an understanding that is out there. If we are going \nto create real economic fairness, we need to work together to pass \nsolutions that will bring down the prices at the pump and get Americans \nback to work. That is why I believe we need to utilize all forms of \nAmerican energy, including wind, solar, renewable, biomass, shale gas, \nshale oil, coal, and nuclear alternatives.\n\n  An announcement is being made today by one of our Missouri utility \ncompanies and Westinghouse about small nuclear and how that might be \npart of this all-of-the-above solution.\n  I am ready to work with my colleagues across the aisle and anywhere \nelse to do what we can to help American families. I hope we can do this \ntogether. The shortest path to more American jobs is more American \nenergy. The best and the most fair thing we could do is what is good \nfor American families and small businesses and job opportunities. I \nhope we can get to work on that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss what I did in the \nBudget Committee yesterday, why I did it, and where we are headed.\n  I have heard people say repeatedly that the Senate has now gone for \nsome 1,000 days since passing a budget resolution. What they are not \ntelling people is that last year, instead of a budget resolution, the \nSenate and the House and the President signed a budget control law. The \noccupant of the chair knows very well, being a former attorney general, \nthat a resolution is purely a congressional document. It never goes to \nthe President for his signature. The Budget Control Act we passed last \nyear, while it is true it is not a resolution, was a law signed by the \nPresident of the United States, and that law--the Budget Control Act--\nsaid we are going to set the budget for this year and next, but beyond \nthat we are also going to put in place 10 years of spending caps, \nsaving $900 billion.\n  On the question of whether the Budget Control Act represents or takes \nthe place of a budget resolution for this year and next, let me read \nfrom the text because I think it makes it abundantly clear. It says: \nThe allocations, aggregates, and levels set in the Budget Control Act \nshall apply in the Senate in the same manner as for a concurrent \nresolution on the budget.\n  That is pretty clear. This law, the Budget Control Act law, is to \nserve in the same manner as a budget resolution for 2012 and 2013, and \nit sets out the spending limits for those years.\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\nBut it even goes further and sets spending caps for 10 years--something \nthat, in my time here, has never been done in a budget resolution. \nNever in a budget resolution, while I have been here, has there been \nthe setting of 10 years of spending caps, but that is what was done in \nthe Budget Control Act last year.\n  But that law went even further than that. It also created a special \ncommittee and empowered that committee to come up with a proposal to \nreform the entitlement programs--Social Security and Medicare--and \nreform the tax system of the United States, and it told that special \ncommittee that if it came to an agreement, that legislation could come \nto the floor without fear of filibuster--without fear of filibuster. \nExtraordinary powers were granted in that Budget Control Act to reform \nSocial Security and Medicare and the tax system as well.\n  That special committee did not agree, and the Budget Control Act \nsaid: If you don't agree, there are consequences, and the consequences \nare another $1.2 trillion of spending cuts on top of the $900 billion \nof spending restraint that was in the underlying act.\n  So the special committee didn't agree, and now we have the prospect \nof a sequester imposing another $1.2 trillion of spending cuts on top \nof the $900 billion of spending cuts in the underlying act, for a total \nof over $2 trillion of spending cuts. That is the biggest spending cut \npackage, as far as I know, in the history of the United States. Yet the \nother side suggests repeatedly that nothing has been done to set \nspending limits when they know full well what the Budget Control Act, \npassed last year, does. Yes, it wasn't a resolution; it was a law. Boy, \nthat is sort of civics 101, that a law is stronger than a resolution.\n  I said several days ago I would go to markup in the Budget Committee \nand I would lay out a long-term plan because while it is true that we \nhave in place for the next 2 years a budget under the Budget Control \nAct, what we don't have is an overall long-term plan. The Budget \nControl Act limits discretionary spending for the next 10 years, but we \nalso need a program that outlines what we are going to do about \nentitlement programs--Medicare, Social Security--and what we are going \nto do to reform our tax system, which is badly broken.\n  So several days ago I said I would lay before the Budget Committee \nthe Bowles-Simpson plan, which is the only bipartisan plan that has \nemerged. It was supported by 11 of the 18 Commissioners. I was proud to \nbe one of five Democrats, five Republicans, and one Independent. Eleven \nof the 18 voted to support that Bowles-Simpson package. Unfortunately, \nit took a super supermajority for that plan to come to the floor of the \nHouse and the Senate; it required 14 of the 18 members to agree. Eleven \nof 18 did, which is more than 60 percent. Even in Washington, usually \n60 percent carries the day, but it didn't with respect to the Bowles-\nSimpson recommendations.\n  So I said several days ago I would put before the body the Bowles-\nSimpson plan. I did not suggest we would complete action on it at the \nbeginning of the markup. Why? Because we already have in place the \nspending limitations for this year and next. What we don't have is a \nlonger term plan. We don't need that longer term plan right at this \nmoment, but we need it before the end of the year because at the end of \nthe year all of the Bush-era tax cuts are going to expire, and at the \nend of this year we are going to face that sequester I mentioned that \nis in the Budget Control Act law that we passed last year instead of a \nbudget resolution.\n  Why do we need this longer term plan? Well, because we are borrowing \nabout 40 cents of every dollar we spend, and that is unsustainable. It \nhas to change. I have warned repeatedly of where we are headed if we \ndon't change course. And here is where we are headed. This chart shows \nthe gross debt of the United States if we stay on the trajectory we are \non. We can see we are here in 2012. At the end of this year, the gross \ndebt of the United States will be 104 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct, headed for 119 percent on our current trajectory. That \nshouldn't be permitted to happen, and under the plan I laid before our \ncolleagues yesterday, it won't happen.\n  If we look at the underlying cause of these deficits and debt, we can \nsee it is the relationship between spending and revenue. The red line \nis the spending line, the green line is the revenue line of the United \nStates looking back to 1950, and what one sees is that spending is at \nor near a 60-year high. Actually, we have fallen back somewhat from the \n60-year high we reached 2 years ago. Revenue is at or near a 60-year \nlow. Actually, we can see it bumped up to a 70-year low back in 2010. \nBut still we see a very wide gap between revenue and spending. As a \nresult, there is a very large deficit--a deficit of $1.2 trillion.\n  Now, I could have gone before the Budget Committee yesterday and laid \nout another partisan plan, because that is what is happening. \nCongressman Ryan, to his credit, laid out a plan, and in the House they \npassed his plan. I give him credit for laying out a plan. I think the \nplan is a very bad plan for the country and completely lacks balance. \nIt is all done on the spending side of the equation, which leads him to \ntruly Draconian cuts--dramatic changes in Medicare, for example, \ndramatic changes in Medicaid, dramatic changes in the whole structure \nof services the government provides people in this country. And the \nAmerican people don't want a plan that is just a partisan plan. They do \nnot want a plan that lacks balance. They do not want a plan that is \njust on one side of the ledger.\n  As I showed in the previous chart, we have a problem on both sides of \nthe ledger--on revenue and on spending. We have to work on both sides \nof the ledger. And the American people believe that as well. When asked \nin the Pew Research Center poll last year in November, ``What is the \nbest way to reduce the Federal budget deficit?'' 17 percent said just \ncut major programs--only 17 percent, 1 7. On increasing taxes, 8 \npercent said just increase taxes. And 62 percent said a combination of \nboth. I think the American people have it right. They are pretty smart. \nThey are pretty smart.\n  In 2010 we had the Bowles-Simpson Commission, the so-called fiscal \ncommission. Eighteen of us were named to serve. It was created by the \nPresident after a legislative attempt, led by Senator Gregg of New \nHampshire, a Republican, and myself, failed here. We got a majority but \nwe didn't get a supermajority. So our attempt to form a commission \nlegislatively was thwarted. President Obama showed leadership and named \na Presidential commission in order to take on the subject, and in \nDecember of 2010 that commission reported their conclusion, with 11 of \nthe 18 of us agreeing to the recommendations.\n  Here are the principles and values the fiscal commission used to \nguide their efforts: that it is a patriotic duty to make America \nbetter; that we shouldn't do anything that would disrupt the economic \nrecovery; that we ought to cut and invest to promote economic growth \nand keep America competitive; that we ought to protect the truly \ndisadvantaged; that we ought to cut spending we cannot afford, with no \nexceptions; that we ought to demand productivity and effectiveness from \nWashington; that we ought to reform and simplify the Tax Code; that we \nshouldn't make promises we can't keep; and that the problem of deficits \nand debt are real and the solution will be painful.\n  Let's be honest. When you are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar you \nspend, you are not going to solve this in a way that doesn't affect \nanyone. All of us are going to have to participate in the solution.\n  The last principle that was used to guide the commission was that we \nshould do things to make America sound over the long run.\n  So what does the fiscal commission plan I laid out do? It puts in \nplace $5.4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, including \nsavings that have already been enacted in the Budget Control Act. It \nlowers the deficit from 7.6 percent of GDP in 2012 to 2.5 percent in \n2015 and down to 1.4 percent in 2022. So because of the reductions in \ndeficits, it stabilizes the debt and begins to bring it down. In fact, \nit stabilizes the gross debt by 2015 and lowers it to 93 percent of GDP \nby 2022.\n\n  Remember my previous slide? Here is the quiz. What did it say the \ndebt would become by 2022 if we don't do anything as a share of GDP? It \nsaid it would become 119 percent if we didn't\n\n[[Page S2524]]\n\nact. Under the proposal I laid before the Budget Committee yesterday, \nit would bring down the debt to 93 percent of GDP--the gross debt to 93 \npercent of GDP by 2022 instead of 119 percent if we fail to act.\n  The plan I laid out reduces overall spending to 21.9 percent of GDP \nby 2022, discretionary spending to 4.8 percent of GDP by 2022, a record \nlow--a record low. In fact, this overall spending level is lower than \nthe average spending level during the Reagan administration.\n  Our colleagues on the other side are always eager to embrace Ronald \nReagan's policies. The proposal I laid out yesterday has a lower \naverage spending as a share of our national income than did President \nReagan during the entire period of his Presidency.\n  The plan I laid out also builds on health care reform with additional \nhealth care savings and fully funds the doc fix. What is the doc fix? \nThat is the measure to prevent the doctors who treat Medicare patients \nfrom taking a cut of more than 20 percent.\n  The plan also calls for Social Security reform that ensures the 75-\nyear solvency of Social Security, with the savings only to extend \nsolvency, not for deficit reduction. In other words, Social Security \nreform, those savings are not used for deficit reduction. They are only \nused to extend the solvency of the program itself. The plan I laid out \nincludes fundamental tax reform; makes the Tax Code simpler, fairer, \nmore efficient, while raising more revenue to reduce our deficit and \ndebt.\n  This chart shows the deficit as a percentage of GDP under the fiscal \ncommission budget plan I laid before our colleagues yesterday. We can \nsee, it takes the deficit from 7.6 percent of GDP this year--which is \ndown, by the way, substantially from 10 percent, which is where it has \nbeen--down to 1.4 percent in 2022. The fiscal commission budget plan \nreduces the deficits below the 3-percent-of-GDP level that is \nconsidered sustainable by economists, and it does that by 2015.\n  Again, the gross debt under the plan I put before colleagues that \ncomes from the fiscal commission work, the Bowles-Simpson plan that was \nconcluded and recommended in 2010, would take the gross debt down to 93 \npercent of GDP from the 104 percent it is now and, as I indicated \nearlier, an even more dramatic improvement compared to what the debt \nwould be if we failed to act.\n  As I indicated, the spending level under the fiscal commission budget \nplan is about 21.8 percent of GDP. During the Reagan administration, \nspending was 22.1 percent of GDP. So we have lower overall spending as \na share of the national income than was the case during the Reagan \nadministration. In fact, discretionary spending goes to an all-time low \nof 4.8 percent by the end of the 10-year plan.\n  We can see, discretionary spending--that is distinct from mandatory \nspending. Mandatory spending are things such as Social Security and \nMedicare. Discretionary spending are things such as defense and \nnational parks and law enforcement and education. We can see, \ndiscretionary spending as a share of our national income is dropping \nvery sharply under this plan.\n  What is happening on the other side of the spending ledger is the \n800-pound gorilla, which is health care. That is the thing that \nthreatens to swamp the boat around here because we can see what is \nhappening. Back in 1972 Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health \nspending was about 1 percent of our gross domestic product. If we don't \ntake further steps by 2050, it is going to be 13 percent of our gross \ndomestic product, from 1 percent to 13 percent. Right now in this \ncountry, 18 percent of our GDP is going to health care. One in every \nsix dollars in our whole economy is going to health care--more than $1 \nin every $6. So that is something we have to focus on like a laser, and \nin the fiscal commission plan, we do focus on it like a laser. It \ndoesn't open the health care reform debate that we just concluded, but \nit does provide an option to phase out the tax exclusion for health \ncare that economists tell us would be one of the most effective things \nwe could do to change the direction of health care expenditure.\n  It fully offsets the cost of the so-called doc fix, so our doctors \ntreating Medicare patients don't face this huge cut that is currently \nin the law. We have additional savings proposals with Medicare \nbeneficiary cost sharing, payments to health care providers being \nreformed, eliminating State gaming of the Medicaid tax, and providing \nthe Medicaid drug rebate for those who are duly eligible in Medicare. \nThis would save hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  While the fiscal commission did make a recommendation on Social \nSecurity, those numbers are not included in the proposal I put before \nour colleagues yesterday because I am precluded from doing so by the \nlaw. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 prohibits the inclusion of \nSocial Security in deficit totals of a budget resolution. So I did lay \nout the proposal from the fiscal commission on reforming Social \nSecurity; but I could not include it in the numbers because I am \nprecluded from doing so by the law.\n  Here are the recommendations from the fiscal commission that I \nincluded in my proposal to our colleagues but that are not in the \nnumbers for the reason I have given: calls for Social Security reforms \nto make it solvent, not for deficit reduction; restores 75-year \nsolvency and puts it on a stable path beyond 75 years; strengthens the \nsafety net by enhancing the minimum benefit for low-wage workers and by \ngiving an actual bump up in benefits for the oldest seniors and the \nlong-time disabled. One of the things we know, people who live a long \ntime run out of their benefits. So in the fiscal commission we proposed \nto actually give them a little bump up after they have been in \nretirement for an extended period of time.\n  We also provided a hardship exemption for those who are unable to \nwork past the age of 62. One of the things we know is a person can take \nearly retirement at age 62--and we are going to have to increase the \nretirement age of Social Security over time, over a very long time, by \nthe way. In this proposal, we increase the retirement age to 69 over \ndecades.\n  We have to increase also the maximum level of wages that are taxed \nfor Social Security because the traditional standard is no longer being \nfollowed. We are not taxing 90 percent of wages. That doesn't mean the \ntax is 90 percent, by the way. It means 90 percent of wages is being \nsubjected to the tax. What has been happening over years is we have \nbeen getting a reduced share of income in this economy to apply the \nSocial Security tax to. That is one of the reasons we have a shortfall \nover time. Under this plan, we raise the retirement age--but only very \ngradually--reaching 69 by 2075. This is 2012. So we don't raise the \nretirement age to 69 until 2075. That is 63 years from now. But make no \nmistake, that is important because people are living longer. In fact, \npeople are living much longer.\n\n  We also have a need for tax reform. The Tax Code is out of date, it \nis inefficient, and it is hurting U.S. competitiveness. The complexity \nimposes significant burden on individuals and businesses. The expiring \nprovisions create uncertainty and confusion. We are hemorrhaging \nrevenue to the tax gap, to tax havens, to abusive tax shelters.\n  Many times on this floor I have shown a picture of a little building \ndown in the Cayman Islands called Ugland House. Ugland House claims to \nbe the home to 18,000 corporations. A little 5-story building down in \nthe Cayman Islands claims to be the home to 18,000 companies. Are all \nthose companies doing business out of that little five-story building? \nNo. The only business they are doing down there is monkey business, and \nthe monkey business they are doing is ducking their taxes here and \nshoving the burden onto all the rest of us who pay our taxes. That is \nnot right.\n  We have to go after these tax havens, these abusive tax shelters, and \nwe can do it. We need to restore fairness. The current system is \ncontributing to growing income inequality, and our long-term fiscal \nimbalance, the deficits and debt we talked about, must be addressed.\n  CBO Director Elmendorf talked about the economic benefits of tax \nreform in a hearing before the Budget Committee. He said:\n\n       I think analysts would widely agree that reform of the Tax \n     Code that broadened the base and brought down rates would be \n     a positive force for economic growth, both in the short term \n     and over a longer period.\n\n  Tax reform has to be part of the agenda of this Congress. Here is \nwhat is happening to income disparity in\n\n[[Page S2525]]\n\nAmerica. Look at what is happening. The top 1 percent--and I am all for \nthe top 1 percent doing well. I want everyone to do well in America, \nbut look what is happening. Since 1979, the top 1 percent, their \nincomes have gone up almost 300 percent. Look at what has happened to \nthose in the middle and those at the bottom. Their incomes have \nstagnated. They have been about stable--gone up a little bit but not \nvery much. The top 1 percent has gone up like a rocket. One of the \nreasons is the Tax Code of the United States has dramatically reduced \nfor the wealthiest in our country the tax burden they shoulder. They \nwill show us, oh, their taxes have gone way up. Sure, they have because \ntheir incomes have gone way up. What has gone down--what has gone way \ndown is the effective tax rate they pay. The top 400 families, the \nwealthiest 400 families in America, have had their effective tax rate \nalmost cut in half since 1995.\n  Again, I am not one who is against success. I come from a family who \nhas succeeded. I come from a family who has done well, and I am deeply \nappreciative. I am grateful for the opportunity this country has \nprovided to my family. But do you know what. What is fair is fair. What \nis fair is fair. We have to ask everybody to help pull this wagon out \nof the ditch. We are in the ditch, and let's get serious about getting \nout.\n  If we broaden the base of our tax system, the people who will be most \naffected are the wealthiest among us because look what happens. Here is \nthe increase in aftertax income, on average, from tax expenditures in \nthis country; that is, the loopholes, the deductions, the credits, the \nexclusions that are in the current Tax Code. The average benefit for \nthe top 1 percent is $219,000 a year. The middle quintile, their \nbenefit is $3,000. If we reform tax expenditures, which we should do, \nthat will put some additional burden on those who are the wealthiest \namong us.\n  By the way, not everybody who is doing well is treated the same way \nunder this Tax Code. There are many people who are doing well who are \npaying a tax rate that is very close to the top rate of 35 percent. \nThere are others who are paying at a level one-half as much; the same \nincome but paying much less in taxes. Why? Because they have set up \ntheir affairs in a way that they especially benefit from the credits, \nthe exclusions, the deductions, and all the rest of the tax gimmicks \nthat riddle the current Tax Code.\n  Here is what one of the most conservative economists in the country \nsaid about reducing tax expenditures. This is Martin Feldstein, \nprofessor of economics at Harvard, Chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers under President Reagan. This is what he said about cutting tax \nexpenditures:\n\n       Cutting tax expenditures is really the best way to reduce \n     government spending. . . . [E]liminating tax expenditures \n     does not increase marginal tax rates or reduce the reward for \n     saving, investment or risk-taking. It would also increase \n     overall economic efficiency by removing incentives that \n     distort private spending decisions. And eliminating or \n     consolidating the large number of overlapping tax-based \n     subsidies would also greatly simplify tax filing. In short, \n     cutting tax expenditures is not at all like other ways of \n     raising revenue.\n\n  That, from one of the most conservative economists in the country.\n  Our colleagues on the other side say wait a minute, we should not \nhave revenues more than 18 percent of gross domestic product because \nthat is, on average, what it has been over the last 30 or 40 years. The \nproblem with their analysis is the last five times we have balanced the \nbudget the revenue has not been 18 percent of GDP. The last five times \nwe have balanced the budget, revenue has been at 19.7, in 1969; 19.9, \nin 1998; 19.8 percent of GDP in 1999; 20.6 percent of GDP in 2000; and \n19.5 percent of GDP in 2001. If people want to be serious about \nbalancing the budget, we are going to have to have a revenue level, \nbased on what we see historically, that is more than 18 percent of GDP.\n  The fiscal commission plan I laid before colleagues yesterday, the \nso-called Bowles-Simpson plan, does this with respect to tax reform. It \neliminates or scales back those tax expenditures we were discussing but \nlowers tax rates. You can lower tax rates and get more money if you \nbroaden the base, if you reduce some of these tax expenditures that \nfrankly go disproportionately to the wealthiest among us and have grown \nlike Topsy in the Tax Code.\n  We can promote economic growth and improve America's global \ncompetitiveness, we can make the Tax Code more competitive, we can have \nwhat was included in the fiscal commission, an option, a reform plan \nthat calls for three rates for individuals: 12 percent, 22 percent, and \n28 percent. The top rate now is 35 percent. A corporate rate of 28 \npercent. The corporate rate now is 35 percent.\n  The fiscal commission plan called for capital gains and dividends to \nbe taxed as ordinary income. Instead of having a differential for \ncapital gains and dividends, they were taxed at ordinary rates. But the \nfiscal commission also said if you want to have a differential, you \nhave to pay for it by buying up the top rate.\n  For those who believe strongly you need to have a differential for \ncap gains and perhaps dividends, you can do that, but then you have to \nhave a higher top rate than 28 percent.\n  The fiscal commission plan reforms the mortgage interest and \ncharitable deductions, it preserves the child tax credit and earned-\nincome tax credit, and completely repeals the alternative minimum tax.\n  Under this plan, revenues grow to 20.5 percent of GDP by 2022. In \nfact, the revenue under the fiscal commission plan during the 10 years \nof the plan averages 19.7 percent. That is right at the level that has \nbeen required the last five times we have balanced the budget. That is \nvery close to the revenue level during the Clinton administration, the \nlast time we did balance the budget. By the way, that was a Democratic \nPresident.\n  Some say that is a big tax increase you are talking about, Senator. \nNo, it is not a big tax increase. It is additional revenue of $2.4 \ntrillion compared to roughly current policy, what is happening right \nnow. But compared to current law it is actually a $1.8 trillion tax cut \nbecause all of the tax cuts that were put in place in the Bush \nadministration are about to expire. So if you compare it to that law, \nthis proposal represents a $1.8 trillion tax cut. It is more revenue \nthan we would get under current policy but less revenue than we would \nget under current law.\n  The fiscal commission plan I laid before colleagues yesterday, the \nso-called Bowles-Simpson plan, also had certain process changes to \ntighten things up around here, to become more disciplined. It set \ndiscretionary spending caps through 2022 enforced by a 60-vote point of \norder and sequester; firewalls between security and nonsecurity \nspending so money could not be diverted between the two; a separate cap \nfor war funding with annual limits proposed by the President; more \nrigorous emergency designation procedures and annual budgeting for \ndisasters; a fail-safe to pressure Congress to maintain a stable debt-\nto-GDP ratio starting in 2015; more accurate inflation adjustments for \nindexed programs--that is the so-called chained CPI, a more accurate \nmeasurement for inflation adjustment; and a process to ensure more \nreliable and timely extended unemployment insurance benefits.\n  I have heard from my colleagues repeatedly that the President showed \nno leadership. I don't believe that. I think the President showed \nextraordinary leadership. He averted a depression--and make no mistake, \nthat is where we were headed when he came into office. When he came \ninto office here is what was happening. We were losing 800,000 jobs a \nmonth in the private sector. That is what he walked into. He did not \ncreate the conditions that led to losing 800,000 jobs a month, he \ninherited that.\n  Look at the progress that has been made. Since 24 months ago we have \nseen jobs in the private sector on the positive side of the ledger--4 \nmillion jobs created. That is after he was in a situation in which we \nwere losing 800,000 jobs a month. In the last 4 months we have been \naveraging 200,000 jobs created. That is pretty good leadership. That is \na dramatic turnaround.\n  The same is true of economic growth. When he came into office the \neconomy was shrinking at a rate of almost 9 percent. Now it is growing \nat a rate of about 3 percent. That is pretty good leadership. That is a \ndramatic change from what he inherited.\n  When I hear that the President did not show leadership--oh, yes? I \nwould\n\n[[Page S2526]]\n\nsay he showed pretty good leadership. He stopped the hemorrhaging. He \ngot us going back in the right direction. It is not everything we hoped \nfor, but my goodness, what a remarkable turnaround. Two of the most \ndistinguished economists in this country said if we had not taken the \nactions that were taken by the Federal Government at the end of the \nBush administration and during this administration, we would be in a \ndepression.\n\n  We are not in a depression. In fact we are growing. We are growing \nmodestly but we are growing. We are creating jobs in the private \nsector. The private sector is growing. It added 4 million jobs since \nthis President got things turning around. This President named the \nfiscal commission. There would not be a Bowles-Simpson commission had \nthe President not appointed it. The Bowles-Simpson commission plan is \nwhat I put before our colleagues yesterday.\n  Some have criticized me to say: You didn't vote on it. That is right. \nWe are not going to vote on it until we believe there is the best \npossible chance to actually get results. If you go back to the Bowles-\nSimpson commission approach, what you saw is they did not time the vote \nuntil after the 2010 election. What I am saying to colleagues is I \nthink we ought to follow their good example. That is because the truth \nis, people are not likely--all sides are unlikely to get off their \nfixed position right before a national election.\n  Let me end as I began. We have a budget for this year and next. It is \ncontained in the Budget Control Act, a law that was passed last year. \nWhen my colleagues say there was no budget resolution passed, what they \nare not telling you is instead of a budget resolution, we passed a \nbudget control law. A law is stronger than any resolution. A resolution \nis purely a congressional document and never goes to the President for \nhis signature. The Budget Control Act passed the House and the Senate \nand was signed by the President of the United States.\n  It says in part:\n\n       The allocations, aggregates and levels of spending set in \n     this act shall apply in the Senate in the same manner as for \n     a concurrent resolution on the budget.\n\n  What could be more clear? This law is in place of a budget \nresolution. It is stronger than any resolution because it is a law. \nNext time somebody tells you there has been no budget resolution for \n1000 days, ask them, but did they pass a law that set spending limits? \nThat set the budget for this year and next? That set 10 years of \nspending caps that saved $900 billion, that gave a special committee \nthe ability to change Social Security and Medicare and the tax system \nof the United States and not face a filibuster? And if they did not \nsucceed, there would be another $1.2 trillion of cuts? And because they \ndid not agree, that additional $1.2 trillion of cuts is now in law and \nwill begin to be imposed at the beginning of next year?\n  That is a total of more than $2 trillion of spending cuts in the \nBudget Control Act passed by the Congress, signed by the President, and \nin force today. That is the biggest spending cut package in the history \nof the country.\n  If anybody suggests to you no spending limits have been put in place, \nask them: What about the Budget Control Act? Didn't you vote on that? \nBecause it passed the House. The Republican-controlled House, they \npassed it. It passed the Senate and it was signed by the President of \nthe United States. It is the law. A law is stronger than any \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague, Senator Kent \nConrad from North Dakota. To say he is going to be missed is an \nunderstatement as he goes back to the private sector with his beautiful \nwife and family. But his steadfast commitment to this country to put \nour financial house back in order is the direction we should be going. \nWe should have the courage to do that. I believe we will with his \nleadership because he has laid out a plan that is more reasonable. \nThere has been more bipartisan support for a longer period of time, and \nit has grown. It is the only plan since I have been here, less than 2 \nyears, that has maintained that bipartisan support because of the \nleadership of Senator Kent Conrad. On behalf of the grateful State of \nWest Virginia and the people of America and my colleagues here in the \nSenate, we thank Senator Conrad. We thank him for his leadership.\n\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with you the deep \nconcerns that I am hearing from my constituents all across the great \nState of West Virginia, who are worried about what will happen to their \nrural communities if their local post offices are forced to shut their \ndoors. In our State, we know that the Postal Service is at the very \ncore of what makes this country great, and what connects us all. In \nfact, the Postal Service is America. That is why we are willing to come \ntogether across party lines to fight hard to preserve the essential \nservices the Postal Service provides.\n  We also know that serving rural communities is not always profitable \nand private companies will not come in to fill the gap if the Postal \nService leaves. As Americans, we need our rural communities to stay in \ntouch with this great Nation. I am fighting, along with the members of \nour delegation, to put a stop to these proposed closures.\n\n  These concerns for the future of the Postal Service are bringing all \nWest Virginians--Democrats and Republicans alike--together for \nprotests, rallies, and letter-writing campaigns.\n  In communities where people were told their post offices down the \nroad might be closed, I am hearing people's fears of unacceptable \nconsequences: seniors who wouldn't be able to get their medicines \ndelivered, problems receiving important checks and other financial \nservices, and, just as importantly, the loss of the ability to stay \nconnected to the community and to the country as a whole.\n  This note comes from Mr. George Jones in Nebo, WV, which is in Clay \nCounty. He writes:\n\n       Few people in this area have access to the Internet. They \n     still rely on the post offices to keep them connected to the \n     world. And our people still use the post office. It just \n     makes no sense to cut services to the people who still use \n     them.\n\n  They need them as well.\n  In communities where the post office has already closed, I have heard \nabout what it means to the town and its residents.\n  This note comes from Delores Wilson in Norton, WV, which is in \nRandolph County:\n\n       Our Post Office was closed last November. We now have \n     cluster boxes which are out there in the weather, and our \n     residents are scared to have their prescription drugs mailed \n     to their home or these boxes. Our community has been severely \n     affected. We used to see each other while getting our mail. \n     Our postmaster would let us know when children were born and \n     neighbors passed away. We collected funds at the post office \n     to help our neighbors when they fell on hard times or were in \n     need. Now we don't have this central location to do that \n     because our small community no longer has its post office.\n\n  I have always said that we as a people and a country need to pick our \npriorities based on our values. In West Virginia, keeping the Postal \nService intact is one of the things our people truly care about. That \nis why I have raised very serious concerns about this bill which does \nnothing to keep the 3,700 post offices open, and they are currently on \nthe list for potential closure, including 150 of these proposed \nclosures in West Virginia.\n  Today I wish to encourage all of my colleagues to vote for an \namendment I have offered that would prohibit any postal facility from \nbeing closed for 2 years while the Postal Service figures out better \nways, working with the Postal Service unions, to get its financial \nhouse in order. I have offered this amendment because, as I have heard \nfrom my constituents, we simply cannot afford to let these facilities \nclose in the communities that need them most. In our rural towns--\nplaces such as Norton and Nebo, WV--the Postal Service is about much \nmore than a place to send and receive mail. Our postal facilities are \nthe centerpieces of our communities. They are places where people \ngather and share important information. They are a symbol of the \nimportance of our small towns to the people whose families have always \nbeen there. They are our little place on the map.\n  This note came from Deanna Halstead from Boone County, where the \nUneeda Post Office could soon be closed. She writes:\n\n\n[[Page S2527]]\n\n\n       We have had a post office in this area since 1902. In fact, \n     the story goes that the citizens petitioned for a post office \n     and were asked what to name it back in 1902. A gentleman saw \n     a can of Nabisco's Uneeda Biscuits, and that is how the post \n     office and town got their name. It would be a shame to lose \n     that history, and it would be hard for our elderly and \n     disabled citizens to travel farther for these services. \n     Fifteen miles does not sound like much to people in \n     Washington, but when you rely on public transportation or a \n     neighbor to take you, it becomes a big burden.\n\n  I myself grew up in the small town of Farmington, WV, a community of \njust a few hundred people. I speak from experience when I say the post \noffices in these rural communities serve as a critical lifeline.\n  Even now, as an elected representative, I receive dozens, sometimes \nhundreds of letters a day from my constituents, many of whom don't have \naccess to the Internet and can only reach me by writing me a letter. \nThat is what is so unique about our post offices. They are a vital link \nfor West Virginians and many others throughout the country, and for \nthem it is so important that their mail service remain uncompromised.\n  We all know the U.S. Postal Service is in dire straits. The \ncombination of the recent recession, the increased use of e-mail and \ntext messages, and the cost of retiree health benefits has put the \nPostal Service on a path to financial ruin. In order to remain solvent, \nthe U.S. Postal Service must cut costs by $20 billion by 2015.\n  Anyone who has heard me speak before knows I share a deep commitment \nto fiscal responsibility, and we just heard our dear friend, Senator \nKent Conrad, lay it out for us. I truly believe this Nation's out-of-\ncontrol finances are the biggest threat we face. I am not alone. At a \nSenate Armed Services Committee hearing a year ago, the then-Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, was asked his opinion on \nthe greatest threat to our national security. Coming from the Defense \nDepartment and the person in charge, Admiral Mullen--I would have \nthought he would have said something about all the turmoil around the \nworld, the wars that are going on, the unease and unrest that could \ncontribute to more wars. I thought he would tell us about some rising \nmilitary power we should be concerned about or another uprising of a \nviolent attack on this country or a terrorist group wishing to do us \nharm. But what he said was very simple, and it was a defining moment \nfor me as a Senator when he said that our national debt is the greatest \nthreat this Nation is concerned about, it is the greatest threat this \nNation faces. It was a sobering moment. So believe me when I say I \ntruly believe we all have to set our priorities based on our values and \nlearn very quickly to live within our means. That is right. There is a \nright way and a wrong way to go about this.\n  The bill we have before us proposes to close 3,700 rural post \noffices--I am sure including some in the Presiding Officer's own \nState--for a total savings of $200 million--a figure that is less than \n1 percent of the Postal Service's $20 billion and is roughly \nequivalent--listen to this figure--to the amount we spend in 1 day in \nthe Afghanistan war. We spend that amount in 1 day fighting in \nAfghanistan, which I think everyone knows I am totally opposed to. Yet \nwe are going to close 3,700 post offices for that 1-day savings for a \nwar in Afghanistan. While achieving very little in terms of the Postal \nService's bottom line, this proposal would have an enormous impact on \npeople all over the United States of America, including the people in \nWest Virginia who would lose up to 150 of their post offices. This bill \nwould also lower delivery standards by allowing the Postal Service to \ngo to 5-day service and eliminating door delivery. It would add to our \nnational deficit. In short, I am not sure what exactly we are hoping to \naccomplish with this piece of legislation.\n\n  Already in West Virginia we know for certain that three of our mail-\nprocessing facilities will be closing, one in Clarksburg, one in \nParkersburg, and one in Petersburg. We still don't know the fate of our \nfacility in Bluefield. The impact those closures will have on the \nPostal Service's bottom line is minimal, but the impact to those \ncommunities is widely felt and deep.\n  Rather than making drastic cuts on the front lines, the Postal \nService needs to consider a different approach to getting its financial \nhouse in order. I truly believe we can save the Postal Service without \nmaking cuts to the services our communities rely on and the lifeline \nthat they are, and they are needed, and without adding to our enormous \ndeficit. We can work together on a way to keep our postal facilities \nopen, expand services that raise revenue, eliminate enormous bonuses \nfor executives, and sustain 6-day-a-week delivery service.\n  My colleagues and I have suggested many commonsense ideas that could \nhelp solve the problem. For one, current law caps pay for Postal \nService executives at $199,700--the rate of pay for most Cabinet-level \nSecretaries--but provisions in the law allow for bonuses and other \ncompensation to increase total take-home pay for these executives to \n$276,840. That figure is 20 percent higher than the salary of the Vice \nPresident of the United States. In addition, the Congressional Research \nService has noted that ``postal executives may be eligible for deferred \nannual incentive bonuses that exceed existing caps, the payment of \nwhich can be deferred until after he or she leaves the postal \nservice.'' As an example, according to CRS, former Postmaster General \nJohn Potter earned $501,384 in total compensation in fiscal year 2010. \nI think most Americans would be shocked to know Postal Service \nexecutives can earn larger salaries in the form of bonuses and deferred \ncompensation than Cabinet-level Secretaries. These excesses must be \neliminated.\n  We know from an August 2011 report by the Postal Service inspector \ngeneral that the Postal Service maintains 67 million square feet of \nexcess interior space and that getting rid of this unneeded real estate \ncould net $3.4 billion over 10 years. I think this is a revenue raiser \nthat deserves some serious consideration, and I believe most of my \ncolleagues would think the same.\n  I would also ask, during a time when finances are tight, why did the \nPostal Service spend advertising dollars sponsoring the U.S. Tour de \nFrance team and is now sponsoring a NASCAR racing team? I love NASCAR \nracing, but I am not sure they can afford to be sponsoring a team.\n  There are a variety of ways for the Postal Service to get its \nfinancial house in order without closing their doors in the communities \nthat rely on them most.\n  Back in April my office coordinated regional open meetings in the \ncommunities where post offices are on a list for potential closure. \nAlong with representatives from the U.S. Postal Service, my staff was \non hand at these meetings in McDowell, Raleigh, Wood, and Randolph \nCounties to give local residents the opportunity to share their \ncreative proposals and commonsense ideas to help preserve post offices \nin their communities. We got the message loudly and clearly: West \nVirginians do not want to see their post offices closed. They are the \nlifeblood of the community.\n  We continue to hear from hundreds of West Virginians in letters, \nphone calls, and petitions, folks such as Rebecca from Raleigh County, \nwhere the Clear Creek Post Office is facing closure. Her community has \nhad a post office for 140 years--140 years. Tell me anything that is \nmore American than that. Here is her letter:\n\n       We are an isolated area. The roads are curvy and our \n     citizens are elderly. If this post office closes, it will \n     mean 20 miles round trip to the nearest post office.\n\n  It is rare to see a community--hundreds of communities, really--come \ntogether around a single issue such as this one. But we are seeing \nhundreds of people rush to the defense of an institution that has built \nthis Nation and connected this Nation into what we are today. West \nVirginians do not want to see that disappear, and neither do I. That is \nwhy I will fight, along with my colleagues, to find a solution that \nforces the Postal Service to get its financial house in order, which I \nbelieve can be done, without balancing its books on the backs of our \nrural communities and the people who depend on that lifeline most--our \ncitizens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that \ngoes to the very heart of our rural communities: our rural post \noffices. I am speaking while negotiations are going on regarding the \nPostal Service reform bill that has many dimensions to it, attempting \nto put the Postal Service on stable financial grounds. But I want to \nfocus on this particular aspect: that today we must modify the bill \nthat is before us so we do not end up destroying our rural post offices \nthat are at the heart of the communities they serve.\n  It was a few months ago that I was in eastern Oregon and received a \nmessage that the Postmaster General had put on the list for closure 41 \nrural community post offices--and that was just in my State of Oregon. \nIn the next couple days, I dropped by several of those rural community \npost offices. In two cases they were open. I talked to the postmaster, \nI talked to citizens who were nearby, and I quickly got feedback on the \ndestruction that would happen in that rural community if we do not \naddress this issue in this bill.\n  Specifically, there will be a huge impact on the small businesses \nthat use the post offices to receive orders and to ship orders on a \ndaily basis. Those businesses will not be able to function if they have \nto drive 30, 40, 50, 60 miles roundtrip each day to pick up orders and \nto ship products--a huge waste of time, often on dangerous, winding, \nnarrow roads; a huge additional cost, a huge distraction from the work \nthey do on their farms or on their ranches. In short, this will shut \ndown a lot of small businesses or those small businesses will have to \nmove. They will move to larger towns. When they move, the retail \ndollars move, and it will not be long before that small store at the \nheart of that town shuts down.\n  In addition, I heard from seniors who receive their medicines through \nthe mail. In some cases, they are controlled medicines for which they \nhave to sign. They have to be there in person. They cannot simply \nreceive them through a mailbox, if you will. Certainly, often our \nseniors are not always in the shape where they can drive daily to see \nif a medicine they are waiting for has arrived--that they would have to \ngo 40, 50, 60 miles roundtrip to check and see if their medicines came \nin. Those folks will start thinking: Well, maybe I can't live in this \nrural community anymore. Maybe I need to move to a larger town that has \na post office.\n  Part of the irony of the bill we have before us is often on the \nSenate floor we are talking about spending government resources for \neconomic development. Well, if you go to a small town and ask people \nwhat is the most essential component for the success of their small \ntown, their small businesses, they are going to tell you the rural post \noffice; that without that they are pretty much out of business. So how \nis it we spend so much time talking about jobs and economic development \nand small business as the factory of job creation, and yet we have a \nbill before us that basically cuts the heart out of the small town \neconomy?\n  I originally come from a very small town, the small town of Myrtle \nCreek. When I was a small child--born there--the Dairy Queen at the \nheart of town was the place we occasionally went as a family. That \nDairy Queen is still there, and I still often drive through Myrtle \nCreek just to go by and have a hamburger as I am going north and south \nthrough Oregon.\n  Now, Myrtle Creek does not happen to be on the list of the 41 towns \nwhere the post offices would be shut down.\n  But visit my hometown and one would get a real sense of the damage \nthat would occur if the post office were shut down. So I bring a very \nkind of personal sense that this battle matters. I wanted to share some \nof the feedback I have had from a couple towns. I wish to start with \nthe town of Tiller in Douglas County. Tiller is not that far away. \nMyrtle Creek is in Douglas County; Roseburg is in Douglas County where \nI started grade school; Tiller is in Douglas County.\n  This is the post office in Tiller. It is 16 miles from the next \nnearest post office. Imagine that a person lives 10 miles from Tiller \nand then they have to drive another 16 miles to get to the next nearest \ntown. Now we are talking about 50 miles round trip. That is an hour or \nmore out of their day, and that is a lot of cost in gas. That might be \n$10 a day in gas right there, and that is a huge factor for many of our \nfamilies.\n  I am going to share with everyone some passages from a letter from \nDiana Farris, a former postmaster in Tiller. She writes:\n\n       Tiller is one such community where, in many ways, time \n     stands still and new technology is beyond their grasp. In \n     Tiller, cellular phone service is unavailable, DSL and cable \n     internet service are unavailable, satellite service is \n     overpriced with the majority of residents in the area unable \n     to afford it and there is no Wi-Fi access.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       Dial up internet is available (when the poorly maintained \n     telephone system is operational) at top speeds of \n     approximately 24 26k, so slow that many websites, including \n     USPS, time out before you can access the needed information.\n\n  Diana Farris, former postmaster, then says:\n\n       The unemployment rate has risen to 13 percent in Douglas \n     County, and the lowest gas price in Tiller in the last few \n     months has been $3.95 per gallon. For communities like this, \n     the local Post Office remains the only option.\n\n  Many folks in the Senate may think in terms of big cities they \nrepresent that have many options, that have FedEx, that have all forms \nof electronic communications. They have all kinds of alternatives. But \nthose alternatives, as Diana points out, are not options they have in a \nsmall town. Indeed, one of my colleagues said: I do not understand why \nyou are so concerned because FedEx can deliver the medicines.\n  If one has been to a small town, they would find out that FedEx uses \nthe post office system to complete the last mile of their deliveries. \nSo, no, FedEx does not provide an answer for our veterans, for our \nseniors, for others who need medicines or other products being \ndelivered through the mail.\n  Because of that difficult drive from Tiller to the next post office, \nbecause of the time, because of the distance, the closing of the Tiller \nPost Office would have a devastating impact on the small businesses \nthat rely on the U.S. Postal Service.\n  Here is a letter from Alexandra Petrowski, who owns a small business. \nIt is called Singing Falls Mohair. She owns the business with her \nhusband, lives in Tiller, and she writes:\n\n       We utilize the services of the U.S. Post Office \n     extensively. I would estimate that between 3 and 5 packages \n     go out from our home to destinations all over the world on a \n     daily basis. We sell our products on EBay and the business is \n     flourishing. Our growing market is worldwide using the U.S. \n     mail system every day of the week excluding Sundays.\n       In the EBay marketplace, timely mailing is an integral part \n     of good customer service. As it is, the Tiller post office is \n     7 miles from our mountain ranch. A closure of the Tiller Post \n     Office would require an approximately 45 mile round trip \n     journey that would severely impact our modest profit margin.\n\n  She concludes:\n\n       We have been engaged in this business for 30+ years. We are \n     seniors and rely extensively on our cottage industry to \n     sustain our ranch operation. Would closing Tiller's post \n     office mean effectively an end to the home business?\n\n  Then she answers her own question.\n\n       The answer at this point in time is that it would seriously \n     jeopardize our business.\n\n  So here there is a family living on a ranch quite a ways outside \nTiller, but Tiller is the closest place. They would have to drive into \nTiller, then drive this additional 16 miles to the next post office, \nwould have to do this on a daily basis to ship products.\n  They are fortunate to have Internet and have been able to advertise \nand have the world see their products and advertise them through eBay, \nbut they get customer ratings on eBay. If you have ever been on eBay, \nyou will see that people who have these small businesses establish \nonline reputations because they are judged by each of their customers. \nThey are rated by each of their customers.\n  We feel pretty comfortable ordering from someone who, say, has \nshipped 500 orders and has a 5-star rating and not that comfortable \nordering from someone who has a 3-star rating and customer after \ncustomer has said: The product does not come in a timely manner or it \nis not packaged well, it is not shipped well. So this model, small \nbusinesses completely depend on the U.S. Postal Service serving that \nsmall community.\n\n[[Page S2529]]\n\n  Let me turn to Malheur County, a different part of the State, and the \ntown of Juntura. I will get a picture of the Juntura Post Office before \nus. We will see it is quite a simple looking structure, a manufactured \nbuilding, not very expensive to build, certainly not very expensive to \nhave it open a couple hours a day. So we are talking about microscopic \ncosts in the context of postal reform that have a monumental impact on \nthe success of our small communities--low cost, high impact.\n  Is that not the type of deal we argue for every day: government \nefficiency, low cost, high impact. This little, simple modular \nbuilding, a few wooden steps going up to the door, may not look like \nmuch, but it is a shipping hub and a communications hub that makes the \neconomy work in Juntura, OR.\n  I have a report from a Juntura resident named Laura Williams. She \nwent into a comprehensive analysis of the impact of this very modest \nbuilding. She wrote up a 42-page report. It examines every aspect of \nhow this very inexpensive investment--the returns it has for the \ncommunity. I thought I would read to all of you a little bit from that \nreport.\n  She writes that the residents of Juntura:\n\n       Will either have to drive to Drewsey, to the west, to mail \n     packages, buy money orders and complete a variety of other \n     transactions--or they'll have to drive east to Harper, 34 \n     miles away, a route that winds through a river canyon \n     dangerously choked with deer during the winter months.\n\n  That is the end of that first part of the passage. When I looked at \nher report, she actually compiled numbers of the number of collisions \nper week with deer on this road as one drives from Juntura to Drewsey. \nI was astounded by the high rate. It was a rate of several collisions a \nweek.\n  I remember when I was a kid, a small child, and we would be driving \nthe rural roads in Douglas County and my parents would say: We have to \nwatch for deer. If you have a deer come through your windshield, you \ncan be pretty much toast if you are traveling at any substantial speed. \nIf you are on a motorcycle and you go around a curve and you hit a \ndeer, the deer is going to do a lot of damage.\n  So it may not sound like something folks who come from cities would \nunderstand, but driving roundtrip--in this case to Harper, 34 miles \naway--70 miles roundtrip through a road that is dangerous, in dangerous \nweather conditions, dangerous because of deer and certainly an enormous \nwaste of time and fuel, doesn't make any sense.\n  She continues, and this is an analysis of Laura Williams from \nJuntura:\n\n       In essence, Juntura is between a rock and a hard place.\n\n  She then analyzes that 25 percent of Juntura's post office users are \nseniors who would be particularly impacted by these changes, as they \nrely heavily on the Postal Service to receive medication and may have \nmore difficulty driving long distances in hazardous conditions.\n  She has one word in bold on the front page which sums up her analysis \nof the impact of closing this humble post office, ``disastrous.'' It \nwould be disastrous for seniors, for veterans, and for small \nbusinesses. It is disastrous for the sense of the community that uses \nthis as a place to connect with each other.\n  Two weeks ago when we were on the State work period, I visited Fort \nKlamath, which is also on the list to be closed. When I came, they \nwanted to share their stories, and I want to share several of those \nwith you now.\n  The first comment is from Jeanette and Bob Evans. Bob is a veteran, \nand he receives medication through the mail that often needs to be \nscanned and signed for. They would have to take a 30-mile trip to pick \nup the medication if Fort Klamath post office was closed. They will \nfeel the impact in that manner, and then they might make that trip and \nfind out the medicine hasn't arrived yet. So they may have to make \nmultiple trips.\n  They have a rental business that must follow State law requiring many \ndocuments be sent via first-class U.S. mail in order to verify the date \nof notification. Again, closure of the Fort Klamath Post Office will \nforce them to take more 30-mile trips to Chiloquin to process this mail \ncorrectly.\n  So there are a couple hundred families in this community. It is a \nbeautiful area and has a lot of residences rented out in the summer. \nThose folks who rent need to have timely service or they are not going \nto come to town. This point was made. Once the summer renters arrive, \nwhich drives the economy of the town, those renters want to be able to \nmail their letters, and they want to be able to receive their packages.\n  So that post office--I don't have a picture of the Fort Klamath Post \nOffice here, but closing that post office would take away not only from \nthe business of renting out summer residences but from the number of \nfolks who believe they want to go there and spend their vacation.\n  Heidi McLean is the proprietor of the Aspen Inn in Fort Klamath, \nwhich operates seasonally. Heidi uses the post office daily to send out \ninformation packages to everybody interested in staying with them \nduring the season. Once they get word of somebody being interested, \nthey send out the details. They have to be received on a timely basis \nor the customer will say they got information from somewhere else and \nthat is where they are going to go for their summer vacation. Then \nHeidi will have lost that business.\n  Heidi said they could get by with fewer days or partial days, but \nthey feel very strongly they need access to a local post office and \nthat a 70-mile roundtrip to Chiloquin to access their mail would be a \nserious problem for their small business.\n  Currently, several of my colleagues have worked to put together a \nprocess in the managers' amendment. They have been working hard. I \napplaud them for taking a step forward from the basic bill. I \nappreciate the hard work Senator Carper from Delaware has been doing \nand the hard work Senator Lieberman from Connecticut has been doing. \nThey have both indicated a willingness to continue working to try to \nmake sure we do not destroy our rural communities by shutting down \ntheir post offices. So we are continuing that conversation.\n  We have a group of us who have an amendment now, including Senator \nMcCaskill, who is the lead on it. Many other folks are involved, \nincluding Senators Tester, Baucus, and Leahy. I don't have the full \nlist. I thank them all. They understand this basic notion of little \nmoney and the huge impact. It is a type of solution we should be \ndriving through this Chamber.\n  Currently, the plan in the managers' amendment is a step forward but \nnot quite far enough. I will explain. It says the post office will \ndesign a series of service standards, and they will design a procedure. \nEssentially, before they close a post office they will have to do an \nanalysis of whether closing the post office meets the retail service \nstandards they have laid out, and after they announce the decision \nthere will be an opportunity for the decision to be appealed. That \nappeal will go to the PRC, Postal Review Commission. The PRC will \nevaluate whether they met their own standards, and they will evaluate \nwhether the procedures were followed. If they were not, then the PRC \ncan say to the post office that they must go back and look at this \nagain.\n  It sounds like a system that has some routine to it. But why is that \nnot sufficient to protect our rural post offices? Very simply, the post \noffice management is trying to save money. If they set service \nstandards, those standards will be set in a manner that allows many of \nour small towns to be shut down--many of our post offices to shut down. \nIt is the same reason they put up a list of 41--let me put up Tiller \nagain. Forty-one of these small town post offices already said--from \ntheir internal review, from their sense of responsibility, and from \ntheir service standards they want to shut down 41 of these.\n  After a lot of protests, we got a 6-month delay, and I am very \nthankful for that. The Postmaster General also said: Maybe not 41. For \nnow, we will take 20 of them off the list. And he took one more off. So \nwe are down to about 20 in Oregon. Others could be added back at any \ntime.\n  The post office has already said they want to shut down 41 based on \ntheir understanding of their service responsibilities. So a process we \nput into statute that simply says: Will you be a little more clear \nabout writing your service standards or your procedures is just window \ndressing.\n  So we need the Senate to say: Here are service standards for \ndelivering\n\n[[Page S2530]]\n\nmedical supplies to our seniors, veterans, and others. Here are \nstandards for the communities that do not have all the electronic \ncommunications that big towns have. Here are standards for supporting \nthe small businesses in these communities. We need to set those \nstandards because it is we on the Senate floor who have been elected to \nfight for the people of America. The post office is trying to balance \ntheir budget. That is why they said they think it is OK to shut down \nthese 41.\n\n  The amendment that Senators McCaskill, Tester, Baucus, Leahy, and a \nnumber of others have put forward is completely compatible with the \ngeneral vision of having an appeal process with the Postal Review \nCommission. But it gives the Postal Review Commission an actual \nstandard by which to make a decision; otherwise, all the post office \nhas to say is, yes, we considered the issue--and the word ``consider'' \nis right in the current amendment, the managers' amendment. It is not \nenough for the post office to say: Yes, we considered the fact that it \ndoes affect small businesses, such as the Mohair Company that I \ndescribed. There has to be a standard of service that we in this body \nare comfortable with in defending the commerce of the small town and \nfor small businesses.\n  So I appreciate the work Senators Collins, Carper, and Lieberman are \ndoing and that they are engaged in this dialog about defending our \nsmall towns. I know they understand the impact that would occur. Maybe \nit is an impact that hits harder in some States than others. It \ncertainly hits hard in Oregon.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the sponsors of our \namendment, lead by Senator McCaskill, and to working with the floor \nleaders of the bill because we must not pass through this Chamber a \nbill that would carve the heart out of the economy and the \ncommunications of rural America.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I rise to urge the reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  In 1994, this very important act became law. It was groundbreaking \nfor women, for law enforcement, and for local advocacy organizations \nthat received the resources they needed to better protect victims of \nabuse. It empowered us to combat domestic and dating violence and to \nprevent sexual assault and stalking.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has improved the criminal justice \nsystem's ability to keep victims safe and to hold perpetrators \naccountable. It has been a valuable tool for so many women, so many \nchildren, so many families, and law enforcement to make sure we can \nkeep people safe. It is vital we ensure these services remain intact.\n  Last year, the law expired. Critical efforts that help women and \ntheir children protect themselves from domestic violence and stalking \nand now cyber threats continue only on a short-term basis.\n  As a husband, as a father of three daughters and a daughter-in-law \nand as a Senator, I find any further delay of reauthorization of the \nViolence Against Women Act to be simply unacceptable. Our mothers, our \nsisters, our daughters deserve more protection and security and less of \nthe political bickering.\n  In 2011, there were more than 38,000 reported cases of domestic \nviolence in Ohio. Of course, many more than that--thousands more, we \nthink--went unreported. Women live, as do children, with fear and pain. \nThese women live with the fear and pain of their partner's physical and \nemotional abuse. It is because of the Violence Against Women Act that \nthey have somewhere to turn. It is because of that law that when they \ndo, they have the help to escape violent relationships and the support \nto seek legal representation when they need it. It is why authorizing \nthe Violence Against Women Act is so important.\n  Women's shelters and domestic violence centers clearly would have \ntrouble existing without this law. These are the very organizations \nthat connect women with legal help, emergency housing, transportation, \nand like services. They help with primary prevention programs so \nchildren grow up learning the importance of healthy and safe \nrelationships.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is about assisting law enforcement \nofficials who place themselves in danger when they investigate and \nprosecute cases of abuse and violence.\n  Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act would invest in State \ngrant programs--such as the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and \nEnforcement of Protection Orders Program--that help law enforcement \nrespond to assault crimes. The bill provides tools for law enforcement, \nvictim service providers, and court personnel to better identify and \nmanage high-risk offenders and prevent domestic violence homicides.\n  Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act is long overdue. It is \ntime to stand for the women in this country so they are no longer \nsubject to neglect and abuse and the law's inaction. I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to reauthorize, finally, after the opposition--opposition I \ndon't even understand--from a number of my most conservative \ncolleagues, how important it is to reauthorize one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation affecting women in our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, my friend and colleague Senator Conrad \nsaid earlier this morning, protesting a bit, that he never said we \nwould have a markup in the Budget Committee--mark up a budget, as \nrequired by law. But that was what I understood. I am not here to argue \nthe details of it. But he said publicly, as I understood it, that he \nwas going to have a markup. Our people were working on as many as 80 \namendments. I was working on amendments, key health care amendments, at \nthe time. I heard the Senator was having a press conference, we turned \nit on, and he basically said we are not going to have a markup.\n  He said there was a markup, we started a markup, we had opening \nstatements, and I offered a bill but we just did not have votes, no \namendments, no final vote on passage; didn't ask a single member on the \nDemocratic team on the Budget Committee to vote for or against \nanything. That is how it happened.\n  I am not accusing him of deliberately misleading me. What I would say \nis I thought we were going to have a markup--and a markup means the \nchairman lays down the chairman's mark, it is marked up with \namendments, others can offer substitutes, and you vote, and citizens of \nthe United States of America can hold us accountable for what we do and \nif they do not like what we do, they vote us out of office. They have \nbeen pretty good at that in recent years. A couple of times they \nwhacked the Republicans, last time they whacked the big-spending \nDemocrats in 2010. That is what America is all about. We are \naccountable. But there is no ability or need or right to avoid \nresponsibility for the critical issues of America. I wanted to say \nthat.\n  Let me tell you what happened. This is not a mystery here. There is \nno mystery here. This started 3 years ago when the Senate Budget \nCommittee--Senator Conrad was chairman--moved out a budget. But the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, decided it was going to be uncomfortable \nto vote on that budget. The United States Code requires that by April 1 \nthe Budget Committee produce a budget and by April 15 it is voted on, \non the floor. Congressmen and Senators who passed the Congressional \nBudget Act in 1974 did it because we were not having budgets moved \npromptly, on time. They laid out how it should be conducted. They did \nnot put down that you lose your pay if you do not produce a budget, \nthey did not put down you go to jail if you violate\n\n[[Page S2531]]\n\nthe statute, they just said that you should do it. So there is no \npenalty in the code. Senator Reid blocked the budget from coming to the \nfloor 3 years ago.\n  Then last year, despite the code requiring that we have a budget, \nSenator Reid and his Democratic colleagues decide they did not want to \nhave a budget even in committee. There was no budget in committee as \nthe law requires, no budget was brought to the floor, except Senator \nMcConnell forced a few votes but without the normal debate that you \nhave on a budget as it moves through the Senate.\n  What was going to happen this year? What happened this year is that \nSenator Conrad is not going to be running again. He is proud of his \nservice on the Budget Committee. He served on the Erskine Bowles-\nSimpson fiscal commission, the Gang of Six he was involved in--he had \nsome ideas. He wanted to do what the law said, I think. I think he \nwanted to bring forth a budget. At least the last thing he did, he was \ngoing to comply with the law--at least that is what I thought.\n  He got started. We were prepared. On the eve of the hearing to mark \nup the budget we were told we were going to not have a normal markup, \nbut a markup in which we would not vote. You get to have opening \nstatements--everyone could make one--and then he would lay down the \nmark, but nobody would vote for it or any amendment or any other \nsubstitute mark.\n  I think that is a pretty sad thing. The reason Congress passed the \nCongressional Budget Act in 1974 is that Congress recognized they were \nnot fulfilling a fundamental responsibility of good government, and \nthat as the largest entity in the world, the entity that spends more \nmoney than any other government agency or so forth in the world, the \nUnited States of America, ought to lay out in advance a plan for \nspending its money. That is so basic. So it required a budget and \nusually we have had one--at least with regard to committee work.\n  We do not produce budgets in election years, they say. There have \nbeen times in election years when budgets have not been passed and \nreconciled with the House. But I have never known in the 15 years I \nhave been in the Senate, other than these 3 years, a year when the \nBudget Committee did not move a budget. The Budget Committee has always \nmanaged at least to move forward. And usually we have had votes on the \nfloor--virtually every year. I think this is all miscommunication. It \nis a concern to me.\n  The question that we need to ask--and what the American people need \nto ask is this: Why don't you consider a budget? Why don't you have a \nbudget?\n  There have been several excuses in the last 3 years about why we do \nnot have a budget. Senator Durbin, Speaker Pelosi, Jack Lew, Chief of \nStaff at the White House and former Director of OMB, who ought to know \nbetter, said on television: You can filibuster a budget and we can't \nhave a budget because you can filibuster it.\n  Wrong, you cannot filibuster a budget. The Congressional Budget Act \nwas passed in 1974 to make sure we pass the budget. It is passed with a \nsimple majority. You are guaranteed 50 hours of debate and then you \nhave a vote. But in that 50 hours of debate you can offer amendments. \nSo it cannot be filibustered. That is a bogus excuse. So that is not \nthe real reason, is it?\n  They said we had the Budget Control Act last summer and that takes \ncare of it; we don't need a budget. Wrong. If it is ``the budget \ncontrol act is the excuse,'' why didn't we have a budget last year, \nbefore the Budget Control Act passed? Why didn't we have one the year \nbefore that? That was not an election year; last year was not an \nelection year. Why? The Budget Control Act is not the reason they did \nnot bring up a budget. It was not the reason they did not bring up a \nbudget last year and the year before, because we did not have the \nBudget Control Act last year or the year before and a budget was not \nbrought up. It was not brought up for other reasons.\n\n  This is the code book, United States Code, Annotated, where the \nCongressional Budget Act is, and it requires us to pass a budget out of \ncommittee by April 1.\n  If the Budget Control Act said we did not need to have a budget, why \ndid the President submit a budget this year? He submitted a budget. The \nBudget Control Act was passed last summer. If that obviated the need to \npass a budget, why did Congressman Ryan and the House lay out an \nhistoric budget that would change the debt course of America, put us on \na path to prosperity and not decline? Why did they do it? There were \nsix other budgets offered in the House, some by Democrats, some by a \nbipartisan group, and some by conservative Republicans. But the Ryan \nbudget passed and the others were voted on, too. Why did they go \nthrough that process if the Budget Control Act eliminated the need for \na budget? So that is not the reason.\n  All they said is that we cannot have a budget during an election \nyear. What does that mean? We don't want to vote on tough economic \nissues with an election coming, do we? Somebody might note how we \nvoted. They might not be happy with it. They might vote us out of \noffice and the last thing we want is to be voted out of office. We \ndon't want to be held accountable. We don't want the American people to \nknow what we are doing. We want to allow the debt to continue year \nafter year without taking any leadership to change it. That is getting \nclose to the matter.\n  Senator Conrad said we may reconvene the committee after the \nelection. But we don't want to bring it up before the election. I have \nto tell you, in this town, with the media, old hands around Washington, \nlobbyists, political gurus--they probably think that is clever. They \nsay it is clever on TV. ``Oh, Senator Reid didn't want to bring up a \nbudget because his people would have to vote. That's good politics,'' \nthey would say. Senator Reid said he would not bring up a budget last \nyear because it would be foolish to bring up a budget. Foolish for the \nUnited States of America to have a budget at a time when the debt is \nthe greatest threat to our future of any thing that is out there? It \ndwarfs any other danger our Nation faces, our surging debt, and yet it \nis foolish to have a budget?\n  No, he wasn't saying it is foolish to have a budget. He was basically \nsaying it was foolish for us Democrats to lay out a plan on how we are \ngoing to spend the Nation's money, because we are going to propose big \ntax increases in our plan and if we put it out there they are not going \nto like it. The great unwashed out there, these tea party people, they \nmight be angry with us if they find out how much we are going to \nincrease taxes and how little spending is going to be cut in our \nbudget. That is what he meant, ``it is foolish.'' It was politically \nfoolish, not substantively foolish.\n  We were at this so-called markup--this faux markup I called it \nyesterday--and the Democratic members were speaking, and you would have \nthought they were serving the Nation's interest by not having a vote: \nYou know, we are going to talk about this. We should talk about it so \nwe can begin to make plans for next year. Next year? We have gone three \nyears without a budget. They were serving the national interest?\n  All that was rhetoric. The interest they were serving was political, \nand the political interest was not to have to vote and be held \naccountable, because the President's budget is so irresponsible. I \noffered it last year. Senator McConnell called it up and got a vote on \nit. We did not get to debate it. We called it up, and Senator McConnell \nwas able to force a vote--97 to 0 against the President's budget. Every \nDemocrat voted against the President's budget last year.\n  Earlier this year the President's budget was brought up in the House. \nIt went down 414 to 0. Then they brought up Congressman Ryan's budget \nhere in the Senate. All our Democratic colleagues voted against it \nbecause it cuts spending and doesn't raise enough taxes. They voted \nagainst it, but they did not say what they would do. They brought up \nSenator Toomey's budget, which would balance the budget in 10 years, \nlast year. He has one that would balance maybe even sooner this year--a \ntough thing to do, but he has a budget that would do that. It was \nbrought up on the floor of the Senate, and every Democrat voted against \nit.\n\n  So with regard to budgets last year, what happened? Our Democratic \ncolleagues voted against the President's budget, they voted against the \nToomey budget, they voted against the Ryan\n\n[[Page S2532]]\n\nbudget, they voted against the Rand Paul budget, and they didn't vote \nfor anything. They didn't go on record for anything because they don't \nhave the courage or the coherence or the willingness to agree on a \nvision for America. It is that simple. One can spin all this any way \none wants to, but the Democratic majority in this Senate is incapable \nof uniting behind a plan that the American people would see as credible \nand would change our dangerous debt path.\n  Alan Simpson, the former Senator, and Erskine Bowles, former Chief of \nStaff to President Clinton, chaired the Fiscal Commission. The \nPresident appointed them to the Fiscal Commission. They told us this \nNation has never faced a more predictable financial crisis, and they \nwere talking about the surge in debt. I think that is true. I think the \nneedle is in the danger zone. Our debt-to-GDP is now over 100 percent. \nOur total gross debt is greater than the entire gross domestic product \nof our country. Our debt per capita is greater than Europe's. Our debt \nper capita is greater than Greece's. Our debt per capita is $50,000 per \nperson, and under the President's 10-year budget, it would go to \n$73,000 per person--greater than Europe, which is in a financial crisis \ntoday. We have some unique advantages now, but we could lose those. We \nare heading to a crisis unless we change our path.\n  I am so disappointed in the President. This is the leader of the \nNation. What does he do? Not only does he not lay forth a credible plan \nfor the future, he attacks Congressman Ryan. He invites him to come sit \nin on a meeting and then attacks him. Meanwhile he says he wants to \nhave a bipartisan plan to change America.\n  We need to make some tough decisions--a lot of tough decisions. They \nare not going to be easy when we borrow 40 cents of every dollar we \nspend. Last year we were taking in $2,300 billion and spending $3,600 \nbillion. I know people think this is not true. I am telling my \ncolleagues that it is true. That is why Republicans and Democrats, \nliberals and conservatives acknowledge we are on the wrong path.\n  The budget that Senator Conrad laid down but none of his colleagues \nvoted for--and he didn't vote for it either--the budget he laid down \nyesterday would not cut any spending over the agreement of the Budget \nControl Act next year. After the Budget Control Act passed, we were \nprojecting to spend $44 trillion over 10 years, and under Senator \nConrad's budget, we would spend $44 trillion over 10 years. But he \nclaimed we are going to reduce deficits. How? By getting $2.6 trillion \nin new taxes--no cuts, but $2.6 trillion in new taxes. No wonder they \ndon't want to have it out here on the floor where it can be talked \nabout and amendments can be offered and the American people can know \nwhat is in it. That is no way to solve our Nation's problem.\n  The President goes around saying we need the Buffett tax. We know the \nBuffett tax and how horrible it is, and people don't see that as a \nsolution to our problem when, in fact, it would raise $4 billion a year \nand this year our deficit is projected to be, again, $1,300 billion. \nThis Buffett tax is going to raise $4 billion. How irresponsible is \nthat? Is this all we are getting from the other side? Tax oil \ncompanies, raise the Buffett tax--there is no reality here.\n  So what I believe is this: A budget lays out a comprehensive plan. It \nlays out a plan for 10 years. We have some smart people around here, \nand they can add up the numbers, and they will know how that budget \nraises taxes, how little it may be cutting spending, how much debt we \nwill be accumulating each and every year in the years to come, and the \nCongressional Budget Office tells us how much interest we will pay on \nour debt each year.\n  We could ask Congressman Ryan: How much interest are we going to have \nto be paying on our debt over the next 10 years? We could ask Senator \nConrad or Senator Reid: How much interest will your budget cause us to \npay? For example, President Obama's budget--last year we paid $230 \nbillion in interest on the debt of the United States. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, which has analyzed the numbers, they \ncalculated that at the end of the 10th year, we would pay $743 billion \nin interest--in one year. The Federal highway program spent faster to \nmeet the $40 billion budget this year for highways. Federal aid to \neducation is $70 billion. The Defense Department's base budget is $530 \nbillion. Interest would be the fastest growing item in the Federal \nbudget based on the fact that we are running virtually trillion-dollar \ndeficits for the rest of the decade.\n  Also, the President's budget fails to alter the debt course in the \nfuture. Congressman Ryan's does. It deals with the surging \nentitlements--at least the ones that can be dealt with. We can't deal \nwith Social Security in a budget by law, but we can deal with Medicare, \nMedicaid, and other surging entitlement programs that have to be \nbrought into some sort of stable control so they don't go bankrupt. \nCongressman Ryan dealt with that, but the President doesn't deal with \nit in a realistic way, and he has failed to lay out a plan.\n  I guess what I am saying is I am just frustrated this morning to hear \nthat our colleagues are aggrieved that they did not get--that we felt \nwe should have had a markup on the budget, but we didn't get one. The \nreason we didn't get one is because a decision has been made in the \nhighest counsels of the majority party of the U.S. Senate that they do \nnot want to be held accountable for the votes necessary to put our \ncountry on a sound path. I am very disappointed about it, and that is \nthe bottom line. Hopefully, as time goes by, we can come together and \nwork together to pass a plan for America--including tax reform--that \nwill put us on the right path. That certainly is what is needed.\n  I would just say, though, that a budget can be passed on a party-line \nbasis. It has been done many times in the past. The majority party in \nparticular has a responsibility, in my view, to lay out its vision for \nthe country, and the biggest part of that vision is where they intend \nto spend the taxpayers' money. I can't imagine they would want to go to \nthe American people and ask for higher taxes when they refuse to comply \nwith the plain statutory law that says they should have a budget to \nshow where that money is going to be spent. If they won't tell the \nAmerican people where they are going to spend the money, how much debt \nthey are going to run up, how much spending they are going to cut or \nnot cut, then I don't think the American people ought to send another \ndime to this place--not another dime. That is why the polling numbers \nshow we are in such sad shape.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                      Retirement of Kathy Kerrigan\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, all of us who work here in the Senate and \nwho are privileged to serve as Senators know on a personal level that \nwe are always only as good as our staff and staff work that we are \nprivileged to have from them. I think every Senator is enormously \ngrateful for the hours all of our staffs invest to help us do our work. \nOftentimes, that means missing weekends, deferring, delaying, or plain \ncanceling vacations, or working away on a beautiful Saturday morning \nwhen other people are out and about, and I am sure the best of them \nwould readily admit they would rather be spending their time somewhere \nother than perhaps the Russell Senate Office Building.\n  That is why today I mark a very bittersweet transition on my team \nbecause tomorrow is Kathy Kerrigan's last day on my Senate staff. After \nhaving been confirmed at the end of the last work period, she is \nleaving the Senate to serve as a judge on the U.S. Tax Court, and that \nis the capstone in an already distinguished life spent in public \nservice.\n  As proud as I am to see her serve on the Tax Court, it is really \ndifficult to imagine my office without her. She has had the title of \n``tax counsel,'' but she really was a lot more than that. The chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Max Baucus, and my colleague from \nMassachusetts in the House, Kathy's old boss, Richie Neal, all know \nbetter than anyone just how much--on almost every single issue in the \nCongress, it always somehow comes to be a tax issue, a Finance \nCommittee issue. So for 6 years Kathy has been my indispensable utility \nplayer. It didn't matter if it was on health reform, climate change, \nenergy, infrastructure, or supercommittee, if it was anything I was \nworking on with a fairly high level\n\n[[Page S2533]]\n\nof focus, you can bet Kathy was there. I can tell my colleagues that \nshe wasn't just there, she was invariably the indispensable player.\n  I don't know if she will like it, but I would say at times she was a \nwonk's wonk. She knew the Finance Committee brilliantly, and sometimes \nI had to struggle to follow Kathy because Kathy talked tax, and tax is \na different language. She was almost a charter member of the very \nunique clique of the Finance Committee staffers, and Max Baucus knows \nwhat I am talking about from his staff director, Russ Sullivan. They \nactually had their own annual tax prom, and that is how exclusive a \nbunch they are. There are a lot of us who are a little scared to think \nof what a tax prom looks like. I once said it was probably a prom for \npeople who didn't go to their own proms once upon a time, but, in fact, \nit is a party for the smartest, most detail oriented, hardest working \nstaffers the Senate has because they are always in the middle of \neverything around here and, boy, do they deliver.\n  That is really where Kathy was in her element--driving into the \nminutiae of issues, crystal-balling legislation better than just about \nanybody with whom I have ever worked. I will tell my colleagues, if she \nhad chosen the Navy instead of the Finance Committee, we would be here \ntoday saluting Admiral Kerrigan. She comes to an issue always armed \nwith facts. She has always thought through every question a Senator or \nanybody else might ask about a particular issue. She is driven to get \nthe job done, and she always did.\n  On health care, she was a phenomenal thinker as we worked through the \nFinance Committee issues and the funding mechanisms.\n  Last summer, she was nominated for the court. But then, nevertheless, \nI asked her to serve on the deficit committee. She promised to stay \nuntil the work was done, and I cannot emphasize how valuable she was \nthere also. On the Joint Select Committee, there were many times when \ncommittee members from both parties would ask if Kathy could join a \nmeeting. That is a sign of respect and of ability. She was someone who \nquietly, head down, did the work, and let the work try to find a way \ntoward a solution.\n  Everything I admire about her as a public servant is written into her \nDNA. I think it is the result of growing up in Springfield, MA, where \nher father Bill Sullivan served as mayor. She had a front-row view of \nwhat it is like in public life, of what the demands are, and of what a \ndifference earnest people like her father can make in government--\npeople who do the work without worrying about the limelight or who gets \nthe credit.\n  She never lost sight of that through Boston College and Notre Dame \nLaw School and 14 years on Capitol Hill working on tax policy. As much \nas I admire the special energy Kathy brought to her job, what I admire \nmost about her is her ability to distinguish between right and wrong \nand her moral compass that always guided her in her public service.\n  I will just share one quick story before I wrap up. Last summer, \ndeadly tornadoes clippered through her hometown of Springfield, MA. The \nfirst thing Kathy did was, obviously, make sure her parents were safe. \nBut the second thing she did was get in her car and drive to work \nimmediately. Instead of going home to Massachusetts, she came to work \nin the Senate on a bright Sunday morning and immediately got busy \nworking on tax disaster legislation to help the people of Springfield, \nthe small businesses, the people who had been impacted. She did not see \narcane tax legislation; what she saw were bricks and mortar, lumber and \nnails and lives that had been disrupted.\n  That is the Kathy Kerrigan I know. That is the Kathy Kerrigan I have \nbeen privileged to have working with me through some of the most \ninteresting, most grueling, most productive legislative years I have \nhad the privilege of being part of in 27 years in the Senate. I will \nmiss her energy, her creativity, and the dedication she brought to my \noffice.\n  But it is good to know and we will all be reassured by the fact that \nshe will bring those same qualities, heart and head to the Federal \nbench. She will be a phenomenal tax judge, and she will continue to \nmake her family and her friends and her home State of Massachusetts \nvery proud.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \nproceed to the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am glad we are doing that. I want to thank the majority \nleader for moving to proceed to the reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act as the next legislative measure for the Senate to \nconsider. He made the motion Tuesday afternoon.\n  My hope is that it is not going to be necessary to have extended \ndebate or a filibuster or the filing of a cloture motion and a delay of \nseveral days and then a delay of 2 more days even after more than 60 \nSenators vote to bring the debate to a close and proceed to the bill \nand then another vote on the motion to proceed before the Senate is \npermitted to consider this important measure.\n  I expect anybody listening got lost through that whole process. That \nis something we Senators should think about. The American public \nexpects us to vote yes or no, not maybe. The longer the delay and the \nmotions go on, the more we are voting maybe. Let's vote yes or no.\n  For almost 18 years, the Violence Against Women Act has been the \ncenterpiece of the Federal Government's commitment to combat domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The impact of \nthis landmark law has been remarkable. It has provided lifesaving \nassistance to hundreds of thousands of women and children and men. I \nappreciate the bipartisan support that this bill has had from the \nbeginning.\n  Senator Crapo and I introduced a reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act last year after months of discussion. We wanted it to \nbe a bipartisan bill, and it is. Too often in recent times, the Senate \ngoes through all kinds of delaying moves before they proceed to \nlegislation. Again, as I said, the American people elect us. They \nexpect us to vote yes or no not maybe. The delays are a big fat maybe.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is a measure that is cosponsored by 61 \nSenators. It is a bipartisan measure cosponsored by Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents, and passed out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in February. So I hope Democrats and Republicans and \nIndependents will come together to proceed to consider the bill without \ndelay. I would hope they step forward and do the right thing and send \nthe message to America that we are united in the effort to see the \nViolence Against Women Act reauthorized.\n  It is an opportunity for the Senate to come together and renew what I \nbelieve is a shared commitment among Senators to end violence against \nwomen. For generations, violence against women in this country was \ncondoned. Too often these insidious crimes were dismissed with a joke \nor a shrug or that ``they involve somebody else.'' Rape was too often \nexcused and domestic violence was tolerated as a family matter.\n  Victims were blamed, humiliated, and ignored. They had nowhere to \nturn. There were no crisis centers, there were no shelters. Far too \nmany women and families were left to fend for themselves with no help. \nThe Violence Against Women Act was passed nearly 18 years ago and has \nhelped to change that. It sent a powerful message that violence against \nwomen is a crime and it is not going to be tolerated, no matter where \nit happens.\n\n  It transformed the law enforcement response and provided services to \nvictims all across the country. Now is the time to renew our commitment \nto these victims by passing this legislation. We need to move forward. \nWe need to reaffirm that ending violence against women is a priority \nfor all Americans. We need to be a beacon to others around the world in \nthis regard.\n  With this effort we set the standard. We show that America \nunderstands\n\n[[Page S2534]]\n\nequality and recognizes human dignity. We are going to fight injustice \nagainst the most vulnerable among us.\n  The legislation that I introduced with Senator Crapo last November is \ndrawn from the needs of survivors of domestic and sexual violence. It \nis based on the recommendations of the tireless professionals who serve \nthose survivors every day.\n  It includes improvements suggested by law enforcement officers across \nthe country. As we build on the progress we have made in reducing \ndomestic and sexual violence, we made vital improvements to respond to \nremaining, unmet needs to better serve the victims of violence.\n  We incorporate the important work that Chairman Akaka, Senator \nMurkowski, and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee have been doing to \ntry to respond to the epidemic of domestic and sexual violence in \ntribal communities. We increase the focus on effective responses to \nsexual assault.\n  While the annual incidence of domestic violence has fallen since VAWA \nwas introduced by more than 50 percent, the progress has not yet \ntranslated to reducing sexual assault. Incidents of sexual assault \nremains high, while reporting rates, prosecution rates, and conviction \nrates remain appallingly low.\n  So we faced that problem head on. We ensure that funds are allocated \nto law enforcement and victims service responses to sexual assault and \nauthorize support for law enforcement sexual assault training and the \nreduction of the backlogs of untested rape kits.\n  In a lot of places, they say: We cannot test this rape kit for \nseveral months. So often the perpetrator comes back. So during the \nseveral months it takes to test the rape kit, they say to the victim: \nBe sure and keep your door locked. This is not how victims should be \ntreated; they should not have to live in fear. We should be able to say \nwe can test this immediately, and then go get the person involved.\n  My early experience with the question of sexual assault was not as a \nSenator but as a local prosecutor. Senator Crapo has been visiting \nwomen's shelters and working on these issues for decades as well. His \nprincipled bipartisanship should be respected and celebrated as being \nin the best traditions of the Senate, the Senate I came to 37 years \nago. From the outset, we have consulted to make this bill the best it \ncan be.\n  More than a month ago, Senators from both parties came forward to \nurge the Senate to take up and pass the reauthorization of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. The Senate heard that day from Senator Klobuchar, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Mikulski, Senator Murray, Senator Hagan, \nSenator Shaheen, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Boxer, who was the \nauthor of the House bill in 1990. Eight Senators came to the floor to \nremind us all why this bill is important and why the Senate should pass \nit.\n  There is nothing radical or new about saying that all victims--all \nvictims--are entitled to services. I have been at some of the most \nhorrendous crime scenes you can imagine in my earlier career. I never \nasked, and certainly none of the police officers ever asked, whether \nthe victim was a Democrat or Republican, rich or poor, or from a \nminority. A victim is a victim, and we should be helping all victims \nnot discriminating among them.\n  We know that even though the economy is improving, these remain \ndifficult economic times and we have to spend our taxpayer money \nresponsibly. That is why in this bill, we consolidated 13 programs into \n4 to reduce duplication and bureaucratic barriers. We cut the \nauthorization level by more than $135 million a year, a decrease of 20 \npercent from the last reauthorization.\n  We have significant accountability provisions including audit \nrequirements, enforcement mechanisms, and restrictions on grantees and \ncosts. I sought to consult with Senator Grassley and others in making \nthese changes to authorization levels and for increased accountability, \nknowing how important these aspects are to them. In the Senate \nJudiciary Committee those who opposed the bill were given an \nopportunity to offer a substitute and other amendments. Senator \nGrassley offered a substitute which was voted on and rejected. In the \nminority views of the Committee report, Senator Kyl noted disagreement \nwith the provisions of the bill responding to the crisis of violence \nagainst Native women that incorporated a provision for the SAVE Native \nWomen Act to provide domestic violence jurisdiction over those \nperpetrators with significant ties to the prosecuting tribes.\n  Opponents have noted their disagreement with the U visa provisions \nrequested by law enforcement. Some opposed the provisions intended to \nensure against discrimination in services based on sexual orientation \nor gender identity.\n  Again, I will say what I have said over and over again: a victim is a \nvictim is a victim. We should not ask what category they fall in.\n  Since the bill was passed by the Judiciary Committee I have continued \nto reach out to Senator Grassley and ask what amendments opponents wish \nto offer during Senate consideration. While amendments to strike the \ntribal, U visa and sexual orientation provisions were not offered \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, I would understand if opponents wished \nto do so before the Senate. I have reached out to try to construct a \npathway for consideration of the bill pursuant to an agreement that is \nfair to opponents of these various provisions. If they have other \namendments, let's bring them up. Let's vote on them. Let's vote this up \nor down. Do not vote maybe.\n  I hope we can reach out to the leadership on both sides, get a time \nto get this done, do not keep holding up legislation that has been \nendorsed by more than 700 State and national organizations, numerous \nreligious and faith-based organizations, and our partners in law \nenforcement. Let's show the country we will not duck this issue. We \nwill vote for it or we will vote against it.\n  The Violence Against Women Act should not be a partisan matter. The \nlast two times the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized, it was \nunanimously approved by the Senate.\n  Although it seems that partisan gridlock is too often the default in \nthe Senate over the last couple of years, it remains my hope that those \nwho have voted for VAWA in the past will come forward and join our \neight Republican cosponsors to support it. If so, we can pass our VAWA \nreauthorization with a strong bipartisan majority as we always have.\n  Domestic and sexual violence knows no political party. Its victims \nare Republican and Democrat, rich and poor, young and old, male and \nfemale, gay and straight. Let's pass this without delay. It is a law \nthat has saved countless lives, and it is an example of what can be \ndone when we work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I salute and thank the Senator from \nVermont for his extraordinary leadership on this issue of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. He has been truly and deservedly a hero in \nchampioning a measure that has saved countless lives and prevented the \nkinds of suffering and brutality we have seen all too often.\n  I join in his remarks, and I will speak at greater length about the \nneed for that bill in the future.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Blumenthal pertaining to the introduction of S. \nRes. 428 are located in today's Record under ``Submissions of \nConcurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                50th Anniversary of Seattle World's Fair\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, this Saturday marks the 50-year \nanniversary of Seattle's World's Fair. The fair was a presentation of \nwhat the world would be like in the 21st century. The Space Needle was \nbuilt and it gave us an iconic symbol that still lasts and defines our \nskyline today.\n  More than 9 million people visited that World's Fair in 1962. Elvis \nPresley stopped by during the filming of a\n\n[[Page S2535]]\n\nmovie, because the movie was called ``It All Happened at the World's \nFair.'' All the visitors to the fair saw a very futuristic rendition of \nwhat boundless energy and innovative spirit in America would be all \nabout.\n  President Kennedy opened the fair, highlighting the innovations of \nscience and technology. He said, ``These accomplishments are a bridge \nwhich will carry us confidently toward the 21st century.'' Indeed, the \nWorld's Fair was a bridge toward the 21st century, especially for our \nWashington State economy.\n  The fair foreshadowed the Puget Sound and the entire State as a \nregion that would look to innovation and entrepreneurship. It gave the \npublic a glimpse of what life would be like in the 21st century. And in \nthe years following the fair, Washington State was home to many of the \ninnovations and technologies that revolutionized the way we live and \nwork.\n  In 1962, Seattle was home to the first satellite transmissions of \ntelephone calls and television broadcasts. That same year, the Seattle \nTimes declared, ``Boeing Is In Space Age to Stay.'' The rest of the \nchanges that we have continued to see have led to many things, \nincluding Boeing's 787 Dreamliner--a true 21st century plane.\n  Also, it helped in setting a tone. Bill Gates took his company from \nhis parents' house to a global headquarters in Redmond, WA. The \nMicrosoft Company was founded in 1975. After the opening of its first \nstore in Seattle in 1983, Costco became the first company ever to go \nfrom zero to $3 billion in sales in just under 6 years. Amazon \nrevolutionized the way people shop online and it is a company that has \ncontinued to make innovations.\n  Today many other companies in Washington State--producing everything \nfrom composites for airplanes to lean manufacturing to mobile apps \nsoftware to clean energy technology--are continuing to innovate because \nof Washington State's reputation for making sure we have a talented \nworkforce.\n  So 50 years ago, the World's Fair, and what was announced there, made \nsure the United States was poised for bigger things to come. Some of \nthe predictions we saw about life in the 21st century may not have come \ntrue yet, things such as flying cars--although I recently saw an \narticle about flying cars, so maybe they weren't too far off--but other \nthings were just as they predicted, such as that one day we would be \nable to have a telephone in our pocket.\n  Fifty years later, we can look back and see a glimpse of the 21st \ncentury in the exhibitions and booths that were at the fair, but we \nalso see how fast the future can come and what we need to do to keep \nmoving forward, not just in Washington State but around the country, in \nan innovation economy.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 2303 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvotes with respect to the Lieberman-Collins substitute amendment 2000, \nas modified, and S. 1789 be postponed to a time to be determined by me \nafter consultation with Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated this morning, we are real \nclose to an agreement. The main issue now is whether there will be a \n50-vote hurdle or 60-vote hurdle. We have been through that before. \nObviously, we know where we are going to wind up, in my opinion, if we \nare going to have a bill. So we will work on that for the next hour or \nso and see what we can come up with.\n  We are very close to getting something done. As I have said here \nbefore the last few days, Senators Lieberman and Collins have done an \noutstanding job to the point we are. We have made progress. We are \nhere. We are trying to legislate. We have a rule of relevance. It is \nvery broad. That is indicated by the amendments that people have \nsuggested.\n  So I hope we can work this out very soon. If we cannot, we will have \nto come back and I guess walk away from postal reform, which is a \nshame. But everyone who is holding up things should understand, if \nthere is no bill, you are not going to get what you want. If there is \nno bill, the post office will be drastically hit. The Postmaster gave \nus until May 15 to come up with something. We have come up with nothing \nto this point. So if people are concerned about some rural post \noffices, as well they should be, or about processing centers, as of May \n15, the Postmaster General, unless we do something, will have carte \nblanche to do almost anything he wants to do.\n  That is not what the Senate wants. So those Senators who are holding \nup the bill because they do not like it, they may not like what the \nresult of having no bill is.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          For-Profit Colleges\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor a number of times \nto talk about a new business in America that has become a major source \nof income and a major source of Federal subsidy that most people are \nnot aware of. The business I am talking about is the for-profit \ncollege. These are schools which are popping up everywhere across my \nState and across the Nation. You can hardly go to the Internet and put \nin the word ``college'' or ``university'' that you will not be \nbombarded by all these for-profit schools that try to entice young \npeople to sign up.\n  Some of them, I am sure, offer valuable courses. But too often these \nschools offer worthless diplomas. They entice young people into a \ncurriculum that is vastly overpriced, and it turns out these schools \nthey attend and the education they achieve doesn't lead to a job.\n  Here is this young person, all full of hope and idealism, signing up \nto go in one direction or the other, and they find themselves lured \ninto a school which is, frankly, not much of a school at all. I have \nseen these cases over and over again.\n  I was just in southern Illinois last weekend and a young girl came \nup--she was a high school senior, standing there with her mom--and I \nsaid: So what is next for you? She said: Well--and I am not going to \nuse the name of the school--I have just been accepted at the XYZ \ncooking school in St. Louis.\n  I said: Well, that is interesting. How much does it cost?\n  She said: Well, after I give them my Pell grant--$5,500--my mother \nwill cosign a note for $17,000 for me to go to this cooking school.\n  That is the tuition, and it is a 2-year course. Well, it turns out \nshe is getting off easy.\n  In the Chicagoland area I ran into a student who was actually \npicketing outside a hearing I had on for-profit schools. He was dressed \nup like a chef, and I asked him: So you are going to culinary school?\n  He said: Oh, I love these food shows. I watch the Food Channel all \nthe time. I think this is great.\n  I said: So you are studying to be a chef.\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\n  Yes.\n  I said: How much will it cost you? How much do you have to borrow to \nfinish a 2-year course in culinary school in the Chicagoland area?\n  He said $57,000--$57,000.\n  The point I am trying to get to, Mr. President, is student loan debt \nin America has surpassed credit card debt in America, and it is growing \nby leaps and bounds. Decisions are being made by young people and their \nsupportive parents and grandparents--and I will talk about that in a \nminute--to get deep in debt to go to a school. These young people think \nthey are doing the right thing. They have been told all their lives not \nto quit after high school; that they need to pick up additional \neducation or additional skills, perhaps a bachelor's or a professional \ndegree. So they instinctively believe they are doing the right thing \nfor themselves, and they instinctively believe if the Federal \nGovernment is loaning money to the students to go to the school that it \nmust be a good school; right? The Federal Government wouldn't loan \nmoney if it were a bad school.\n  But the honest answer is that some of these are very bad schools. \nThere are three numbers to remember when we talk about for-profit \nschools: 10, the percentage of college students that attend for-profit \nschools, 10 percent; 25, the percentage of Federal aid to education \ngoing to for-profit schools, 25 percent; and 40, the percentage of \nstudents defaulting on their student loans--40 percent going to for-\nprofit schools.\n  The reality is that the student loan default rate on for-profit \nschools is substantially higher than for any other schools. We can just \nopen the box and look inside and say: I think I understand why. They \nare being charged too much in tuition, and they end up with training or \nan education that doesn't lead to a job or doesn't lead to a job that \npays money--enough money to pay back their student loans.\n  The other thing is we passed a law that said for-profit schools in \nAmerica can receive no more--get ready--than 90 percent of their \nrevenue directly from the Federal Government. How close is this to a \nFederal agency? Ten percent, that is all they need to be a complete \nFederal agency. We send subsidies to these for-profit schools by way of \nPell grants and student loans to the tune of 90 percent. If they train \nveterans, we waive that and let them go to 95 percent and higher.\n  In the academic year 2009 2010, for-profit colleges took in $31 \nbillion in title IV Federal student aid--Pell grants and student loans. \nFor-profit colleges received one out of every four Pell grants given to \ninstitutions of higher education--only 10 percent of the students going \nto these schools, 25 percent of the Pell grants. As I mentioned, \ncurrent law allows them to receive up to 90 percent--90 percent.\n  The for-profit college industry is just 10 percent away from being an \nactual Federal agency. Let's put that aside for a moment and think \nabout what $31 billion means to the private for-profit school industry. \nThis chart is interesting because it compares the amount of money we \nspend in a given fiscal year for a variety of things.\n  How much does it cost us to run the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nfor a year? Less than $10 billion. The Environmental Protection Agency, \nless than $10 billion; Customs and Border Patrol, about $10 billion; \nthe Coast Guard, $10 billion; the Federal Aviation Administration, \nresponsible for the safe landing of airplanes all across the United \nStates, comes out to about $16 billion or $17 billion. The space \nprogram is about $18 billion. How about the National Institutes of \nHealth? This is where we do all the medical research to find the new \ndrugs and cures for diseases all across America. The annual expense \nthere is right at $30 billion.\n  Now, take a look at the last bar. This is the Federal subsidy to for-\nprofit colleges. Over $31 billion a year--$31 billion a year.\n  Fifteen percent of the students who take out loans at for-profit \ncolleges default within 2 years. That is double the rate of public \ncolleges and three times the rate of private nonprofit colleges, which \nare historically more expensive. We spend more on for-profit schools \nthan we do keeping planes in the sky or protecting our borders or \ntracking down criminals through the FBI or responding to disasters \nthrough FEMA or researching cures for cancer at the National Institutes \nof Health or protecting the Nation's food supply or making sure our air \nand water are safe for the people in America or exploring the outer \nreaches of our universe. That is how much we are investing in this \nrelatively new and horrendously expensive industry.\n\n  I think the question we face with the deficit is where are we going \nto make our choices. I have been a reflexive voter for student aid all \nthe time I have been in the House and Senate. Why? That is why I am \nstanding here. I got National Defense Education Act loans to pay for my \ncollege and law school. That is why I am here. I know it, and I think \nthe next generation deserves the same opportunity. So I have \nreflexively voted for these things.\n  Then someone said: Have you looked at where this money is going? Do \nyou realize 25 percent of it is headed to an industry where so many \nstudents are being sucked into signing up, dropping out, and carrying \nloans for the rest of their lives?\n  Mr. President, you and I know this, but everybody should know there \nis something different about a student loan from another loan you take \nout. The loan you take out for your home, the loan you take out for \nyour car, maybe the loan to buy some appliances is a lot different from \na student loan.\n  Do you know what the difference is? It is not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy.\n  No matter how badly things go for you at any stage in your life, you \nare going to carry that student loan debt to the grave. It is there \nforever. It can't be wiped out.\n  There are Federal college loans, such as the ones I took out, they \nare different today. But they are much more reasonable. Do you know \nwhat the difference is between the private loans these schools are \npushing on families and students and the Federal student loans? Start \nwith the interest rate.\n  The interest rate on Federal student loans is 3.4 percent. The \ninterest rate on private loans can be up to 18 percent. It is like \ncredit card debt. Do you have any idea what that means when you borrow \n$50,000 or $60,000 and you face an 18-percent interest rate? Do the \ncalculation and math, and I will tell you some stories about what it \ndoes when you start falling behind in your payments.\n  Brandy Walter grew up in a small town in Indiana. She wanted more out \nof life so she left for college right out of high school. She enrolled \nin the International Academy of Design and Technology in Chicago, a \nfor-profit school owned by the Career Education Corporation. She \nswitched later to Harrington College in Chicago, also owned by the same \nfor-profit corporation.\n  Brandy took out a total of $99,844 in private and Federal student \nloans to cover the cost of her attending these for-profit schools, and \nthen she ran out of money. She hadn't finished her degree. She took out \nthe maximum amount of Federal student loans, she took out the private \nstudent loans, and without any cosigners she couldn't get any more \nloans. She was all in. Without any advanced notice from her school or \nher lender, one day her student ID card just stopped working. She \ndropped out and returned back home to Indiana with no options. She \ncan't get a job in her field, and she doesn't have a degree because she \ndidn't finish. So $99,000 into it and she didn't finish.\n  She is 24 years old. Think about being 24 years old and owing $99,000 \nin student loans, unemployed. Her private student loans have interest \nrates between 9 and 11\\1/2\\ percent. Not the highest, but still much \nhigher than the Federal loans. The monthly loan payment for this young \nwoman for her private loan is around $900. Her total loan balance has \nballooned because she couldn't find a job, from $99,000 to $139,000. \nShe has been unable to save any money to go back to school or to even \nhave a place to live on her own. She doesn't know what to do with her \nlife at this early stage because of bad decisions to go to worthless \nschools.\n  She says:\n\n       If I could erase that student debt, I could move on with my \n     life, and hopefully return to school to finish my degree.\n\n  Mr. President, 139,000 bucks.\n  Let me give you a taste of what kind of business Career Education \nCorporation runs. The Career Education Corporation that owned the two \nschools Brandy went to owns 83 schools and enrolls almost 100,000 \nstudents across\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\nAmerica. Many of them are in Illinois. I have spoken on this floor \nabout several of their schools and, unfortunately, my office continues \nto be contacted regularly by students who have attended the Career \nEducation Corporation school and left with a worthless degree.\n  In 2011, Career Education received $1.4 billion in title IV student \naid. Career Education schools received about 83 percent of their total \nrevenue from the U.S. Department of Education's student aid programs, \nand that doesn't include the money they get from the GI bill program. \nSo 81 percent of the students take out student loans, and of those \nstudents who take out loans over 14 percent will default on their loans \nwithin 2 years.\n  On November 1 of last year, Career Education Corporation's CEO \nresigned while admitting that some of their schools, had falsified the \nemployment rate of graduating students. Their accreditors--the people \nwho say they are a real school--require a job placement rate of at \nleast 65 percent for schools to remain eligible for title IV \nassistance. Career Education Corporation job placement rates were below \n65 percent and, incidentally, the departing CEO who falsified the \ninformation to the Department of Education was run out of town on a \nrail with a $5 million bonus payment as he left.\n  I have met the new head of this Career Education Corporation. As with \nevery for-profit school that actually sends someone in to see me, he \nhas said: We are changing everything. We are going to straighten this \nmess out.\n  I will believe it when I see it. And I will believe it when Brandy \nand students like her are given a chance.\n\n  It is hard to believe that we live in a time when student borrowers \nand their families risk losing their homes because of student loan \ndebt. I have introduced legislation that would permit private student \nloans to be discharged in bankruptcy like every other private loan. \nThis legislation will help these young people.\n  Let me tell you one other story that was in the Washington Post. \nRecently, one of the headlines in that paper read ``Senior Citizens \nContinue to Bear the Burden of Student Debt.'' Senior citizens. The \nstory highlighted one of my constituents, 58-year-old Sandy Barnett.\n  As an adult, Sandy found herself in a familiar situation: Her husband \nwas laid off, and she wanted to go back to school. When she was \nyounger, college wasn't an option. Sandy enrolled in a bachelor's \ndegree program in psychology. Concerned about the debt, Sandy didn't \ntake out any student loans. She worked full time while in school and \npaid her tuition as the bills came due.\n  Balancing work and school was difficult, but Sandy graduated in 1987 \nwith a bachelor's degree in psychology and no student loan debt. The \nschool adviser told her it would be a good idea to keep going to school \nand get a master's degree. Because the degree program required a number \nof internships, she decided she wanted to focus on her studies and not \nwork. She was going to be a full-time graduate student. Then, for the \nfirst time, she took out a student loan.\n  Sandy graduated in 1989 with a master's degree in psychology and \n$21,000 in debt. She taught part time for the next 10 years at Lincoln \nLand Community College in my hometown of Springfield, IL. By then she \nwas divorced and it was tough for her to make the $300 monthly payments \non her student loan. It took a few years for her to find a good job, \nbut as soon as she did, she started paying back the loans again.\n  By 2005 she was already too far in debt to ever work her way out of \nit, and she filed for bankruptcy, but her student loan debt was not \nforgiven. They are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Fortunately, many \nof her other debts were relieved, and she thought she just might be \nable to get back on track.\n  In 2008 she got a job with AT as a customer service representative, \nwhere she still works. Currently, 15 percent of her wages are garnished \nby the Federal Government to pay her student loans. That is $200 to \n$300 a month, depending on her income. Her total loan balance is now up \nto $54,000--more than double the amount she started with. The loan \nservicer will not work with her on a payment plan. And we hear that \ncomplaint all the time. What is worse is that her balance keeps going \nup because her payment doesn't cover the interest on the loan.\n  You may wonder what Sandy's life is like as a 58-year-old with a \nstudent loan debt. How did she get there? Does she live an extravagant \nlifestyle? The answer is a resounding no. Sandy's coworkers drive her \nto work because the cost of gasoline is now too much for her to pay. \nShe has no money to do anything, is what she tells us. She owns a \nmobile home that needs a lot of repairs she can't afford.\n  When asked if, looking back, she would have taken the same path, \nSandy says she would have absolutely not gone to school if she had \nknown this was going to happen. Her degree is the worst thing that ever \nhappened to her, she said. She doesn't think she will ever be able to \nretire. She said: I just don't have any money. I have nothing because \nof student loans.\n  Her advice, 58-year-old Sandy's advice to others? Don't do it. Do not \ngo to college. There is no guarantee your college degree will help you \nget a job that will pay for your student loans.\n  What a sad statement. All of us tell our children: Keep going; go to \nschool. And we should. It is the right thing to do. But she has a right \nto be disappointed, even cynical about what has happened to her.\n  Sandy isn't alone. Other older Americans out there are bearing the \nburden of student loan debt because of different situations. Do you \nknow why? They were generous to their children and grandchildren and \nsaid: Let me sign the loan with you. Do you want to go to school? It is \nthe dream of your life. Let me cosign.\n  Tim Daniel's grandparents are two of them. When Tim signed up for \n$80,000 in student loans, he had no idea that years later his \ngrandparents would be at risk of losing their home because of his \nstudents loans. Tim dreamed of going to college. In 2004 he enrolled in \nthe Illinois Institute of Art, a for-profit school owned by the Career \nEducation Corporation, I talked about before. Tim's grandparents were \nso proud and happy, they cosigned his loans.\n  Like many students who contact my office, Tim says he would have \nnever taken out the loans if it was clearly stated to him how much his \nmonthly payments would be. He put his trust in the school and he \nthought the counselors really had his best interests in mind, so he \ntook out the loan.\n  Tim makes $25,000 a year. That is a modest income. He can't afford to \nget a car loan, and he says he will probably have to rent for the rest \nof his life. His Federal loans, which have a balance around $23,000--\nFederal Government loans--have a manageable monthly payment, but his \nprivate student loans are completely unmanageable. The lenders won't \nwork with him to come up with a reasonable payment plan, leaving the \nburden of debt on his grandparents, who cosigned his loans. His \ngrandparents don't have any money. They filed for bankruptcy, too, but \nbecause the private student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, \nthey risk losing their home to pay off their grandson's student loans.\n  This isn't the American dream. This is a nightmare, and we are \ncomplicit. We are complicit because this Federal Government continues \nto offer Pell grants and student loans to worthless schools. And \nstudents who sign up there think, well, if the Federal Government is \ngoing to loan some money, this must be a good school. So we are \ncomplicit in not policing the ranks of these for-profit schools on \nbehalf of these students.\n  Secondly, the outrage I hear expressed on this floor all the time \nabout overspending by the Federal Government should be directed as well \nat these for-profit schools. The annual subsidy of these for-profit \nschools--$31 billion--is greater than the amount we spend as a nation \nfor medical research in a given year--as a nation. So people who are \nintensely aware of our deficit--as the Presiding Officer is--who want \nto cut spending and wasteful areas, join me in taking a look at these \nfor-profit schools.\n  Congress could start by passing legislation to keep interest rates on \nthe Federal Government student loans at a manageable level of 3.4 \npercent. They are going to double in July if we don't take action, so \nwe had better do that.\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\n  Senator Harkin of Iowa and I recently introduced legislation that \nwill help educate borrowers about private student loans.\n\n  Actually, there are situations where students at these for-profit \nschools are still eligible to borrow money from the Federal Government \nat 3.4 percent, and the so-called counselors at these schools steer \nthem into private loans at 5, 11, and up to 18 percent interest rates, \nand the students don't know it. They sign up not realizing they could \nstill borrow the money under manageable terms from the Federal \nGovernment if they wish. There ought to be clear disclosure to the \nstudents, their families--and their grandparents.\n  Our legislation, the Know Before You Owe Private Student Loan Act, \nwill require private student loan lenders to certify a potential \nborrower's enrollment status and cost of attendance with the borrowing \nschool and require institutions of higher education to counsel students \nabout all their student aid options before the private student loan is \nactually disbursed. Most importantly, schools would have to inform the \nstudents about the differences between private student loans and \nFederal student loans. Federal student loans have consumer protections \nbuilt in but not the private loans.\n  I encourage my colleagues to go home and listen to these families. On \nyour Web site, ask for the victims of student loan abuse to write in, \nas they have to my office, and you will come to realize this is a \ngrowing problem in this country. Student loan debt is greater than \ncredit card debt, and it is coming due. Less than 40 percent of student \nloan borrowers today are current on their payments. This is a problem \nthat is going to haunt our Nation for a long time.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in bringing some real changes. If \nthe for-profit school industry has anything to offer by way of real \neducation and training, they had better shape up and they had better be \nhonest with their students. They shouldn't drag them deeply in debt for \nworthless diplomas which could literally ruin a life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner).

Mr. President, first of all, let me express my appreciation \nto every Senator. We tried something a little different, and I think it \nis something we can look to in the future. We decided we were going to \nhave an amendment process. Maybe it is not as far as everyone wants to \ngo, but it is a pretty good step in the right direction. Rather than \nhaving no amendments, rather than having only germane amendments, we \ndecided we would have a standard that is very broad; that is, relevant \namendments. It has given people the opportunity to offer lots of \ndifferent things. So I hope in the future--it may not happen on every \npiece of legislation that comes along, but I hope we get in the habit \nof being able to do things such as this; that gives Senators wide range \non things they can do. But anyway, we have done it on this and I \nappreciate everyone's cooperation.\n  I also appreciate the good work of Senator Lieberman and Senator \nCollins. I have many times in the last week or so expressed that \nappreciation to them for their leadership. This has been extremely \ndifficult. It is a massive bill dealing with more than one-half million \npostal employees, more than 30,000 post offices, 500 or so processing \ncenters, and it has been extremely difficult to get to a point where I \nhope we can arrive shortly. So we are here. I have been given the nod.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motions with \nrespect to the Lieberman-Collins substitute amendment and the bill be \nvitiated; the motion to recommit be withdrawn; that the pending \namendments Nos. 2013 and 2015 be withdrawn and that the following \namendments be the only amendments in order to S. 1789 or the pending \nsubstitute amendment No. 2000, as modified: McCain 2001; Tester 2056; \nCoburn 2060; McCain 2033; Wyden-Feinstein 2020; Coburn 2058; McCaskill-\nMerkley 2031; Coburn 2061; Snowe 2080; Udall of New Mexico 2043; Durbin \n2082; Akaka 2034, with a modification agreed to by the two managers; \nBennet-Blunt 2047; Corker 2083; Mikulski 2003; Akaka 2049; Paul 2025; \nManchin 2079; Paul 2026; Bingaman 2076; Paul 2027; Cardin 2040; Paul \n2028; Carper 2065; Paul 2029; Carper 2066; Paul 2039; Casey 2042; Paul \n2038; Landrieu 2072; DeMint 2046; McCaskill 2030; Coburn 2059; Pryor \n2036; Rockefeller 2073; Rockefeller 2074; Schumer 2050; Tester 2032; \nand Warner 2071, with a modification agreed to by the two managers; \nthat on Tuesday, April 24, at a time to be determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate vote \nin relation to the amendments in the order listed; that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided in the usual form prior to each vote; that all \nafter the first vote be 10-minute votes; that the amendments be subject \nto a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that there be no other amendments \nin order to the bill, the substitute amendment, as modified, or the \namendments listed; and there be no points of order or motions in order \nto any of these amendments, the substitute amendment or the bill, other \nthan budget points of order and the applicable motions to waive; that \nupon disposition of the amendments, the substitute amendment, as \nmodified and amended, if amended, be agreed to; further, the bill, as \namended, then be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended; finally, that the vote on passage of \nthe bill be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Reid, and, of \ncourse, thank Senator Collins. We have again worked very closely \ntogether. I thank the staff on both sides who worked very hard, and I \nthank all of our colleagues.\n  I know it took a lot of effort, because people have strong opinions \nabout the crisis in the Postal Service of the United States, but we \nhave ended with a process here that will allow a discussion and votes \non a wide range of amendments on both sides. I would say based on the \nknowledge we have of this list that not all of these amendments listed \nwill actually require rollcall votes.\n  We will be working over the weekend trying to see if we can find \ncommon ground, accept some of these amendments or modify them. But \nbottom line, this consent agreement, though we are not there yet, gives \nme great hope that the Senate is going to prove that we are capable of \ntaking on a crisis situation which the post office is in, losing $13 \nbillion plus over the last 2 years. If we do not do anything, it is \nonly going to get worse and a lot of people are going to lose their \njobs and a lot of people who depend on the mail are not going to get it \nin the same way.\n  This is a bill that will provide an orderly reform that will keep the \npost office not only alive but change it so it can survive throughout \nthe 21st century.\n  Senator Collins and I will be here at noon on Monday to debate any of \nthe amendments people want to come to debate. I believe I am speaking \nfor both of us in saying--I know I am--that after the votes Monday \nafternoon unrelated to this matter, we are prepared to remain here into \nthe evening to continue debating amendments before the actual votes \noccur on Tuesday afternoon.\n  Again, I thank everyone involved, particularly Senator Collins.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We will \nbe available over the weekend and tomorrow, and then on Monday to begin \nthe debate on the amendments. But, again, I want to thank everyone \ninvolved. I think this is how the Senate should operate. It took a lot \nof work to get here, but no one gave up. Everyone kept working away.\n  I believe we have come up with a very fair agreement to allow us to \nproceed on a bill of great significance.

CHIP HUTCHESON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand before you today in honor of \nsomeone who has made a substantial contribution to the people of \nCaldwell County, KY, for his work in the field of journalism: Mr. Chip \nHutcheson, publisher of Caldwell County's local periodical, the \nPrinceton Times Leader. Mr. Hutcheson was recently inducted into the \nKentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in Lexington, KY, along with five \nother esteemed broadcasting and journalism colleagues from all over the \nCommonwealth.\n  The relationship between Chip Hutcheson and the paper that would \nbecome the Princeton Times Leader began when Chip was just 10 months \nold. His parents, the late John and Betsy Hutcheson, purchased the \nthen-Princeton Leader and moved to Princeton, KY, just after the birth \nof their son, Chip. John and Betsy shared a love for their chosen \nprofession of journalism, a love of the trade that Chip, too, would \ninherit at a young age.\n  Looking back, Chip recalls the paper being a big part of his \nadolescent life. He remembers writing sports news all throughout his \nteenage years. Chip left Princeton after high school to attend the \nUniversity of Kentucky, just like his father before him. He enlisted in \nthe U.S. Army after graduating from the college and served 4 months of \nactive duty in Vietnam.\n  Upon his return from the service, he immediately re-entered the field \nhe had been passionately involved with for so long. He understood that \njournalism was his calling, and he wanted to make a career out of \nbringing the news to the people of Caldwell County, just as his beloved \nmother and father had. Chip remembered a piece of advice his father \ngave him about the media industry: ``He said, This is a good business, \nbut remember this--you will never be caught up; there will always be \none more advertiser you can see, one more story you can write.'''\n  After watching his parents run a newspaper throughout his childhood, \nChip was no doubt aware of the difficulties of producing a new edition \nday in and day out, but he was okay with it. He had a deep desire to be \nin the thick of reporting. He wanted to follow leads, piece together \nstories, record monumental events, and most importantly, inform the \ncitizens of Princeton of the goings on of the world around them.\n  Chip became publisher of the Princeton Leader in 1976, assumed the \nrole of publisher of the Times Leader in 1992, and has been doing an \noutstanding job ever since. Chip Hutcheson is a testament to the \nsuccess one can achieve when one enters a field of work one has a true \npassion for.\n  It is with the most sincere gratitude that I congratulate Mr. Chip \nHutcheson on his induction to the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame and \nthank him for the heartfelt devotion he has shown the people of \nPrinceton, Caldwell County, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky throughout \nthe years. And I would like to ask my colleagues in the United States \nSenate to join me in commemorating Mr. Chip Hutcheson for his many \naccomplishments in the field of journalism.\n  There was recently an article published in the Princeton Times Leader \nwhich made note of Chip Hutcheson's induction into the 2012 Kentucky \nJournalism Hall of Fame. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nsaid article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n            [From the Princeton Times Leader, Apr. 14, 2012]\n\n                 TL Publisher Joins Hall of Fame Ranks\n\n                           (By Jared Nelson)\n\n       Times Leader Publisher Chip Hutcheson and two others with \n     western Kentucky connections were among a class of six \n     individuals inducted into the 2012 class of the Kentucky \n     Journalism Hall of Fame this week.\n       The induction ceremony followed a luncheon hosted by the \n     University of Kentucky Journalism Alumni Association and the \n     UK School of Journalism and Telecommunications in Lexington \n     Wednesday.\n       Other inductees included: D.J.

Mr. President, religious institutions play an important \nrole in communities across the Nation. They are places where families \nbond; they are places where culture and traditions are handed down from \ngeneration to generation; and they are places where many turn for \nguidance. This Saturday, April 21, marks a significant milestone for \none such place of worship in Jackson, MI. On Friday evening, Temple \nBeth Israel will celebrate the sesquicentennial anniversary of its \nfounding on April 21, 1862. This momentous occasion will be \ncommemorated through a service that highlights the congregation's rich \nhistory and important place within the greater Jackson community.\n  Since 1862, this close-knit synagogue has been a mainstay in Jackson \nand has helped to preserve and instill religious values and culture \nfrom one generation to the next. Nowhere is this better portrayed than \nin a short vignette on Temple Beth Israel's web site, which brings to \nlife what may seem to be routine--scores of proud families pouring out \nof a service laughing, smiling and bonding with one another; providing \na place for members of the Jewish community to come together in \nfellowship to learn, to seek spiritual guidance and to celebrate \nimportant religious and life events is at the core of Temple Beth \nIsrael's mission.\n  Temple Beth Israel, situated on West Michigan Avenue, is the first \nand only synagogue in the city of Jackson and is at the center of \nJewish life there. Four stained glass windows representing the ideals \nthe congregation holds dear--Torah, peace, justice and good deeds--\nadorn the synagogue's sanctuary. Through the years, there have been \nabundant examples of these ideals put into action.\n  Temple Beth Israel is a landmark, literally. Preceding the Temple's \nfounding was the Hebrew Benevolent Society. One of the lasting \nachievements of the Benevolent Society was the purchase, along with \nothers in the community, of land for burial in 1859. Today, it stands \nas one of the oldest Jewish cemeteries in continuous use in Michigan \nand has been recognized nationally as an important landmark through its \nlisting in the National Register of Historic Places. Notable, also, is \nthat Temple Beth Israel served as the student pulpit for Rabbi Sally \nPriesand, the first female rabbi in the United States.\n  I extend my very best to the Temple Beth Israel community as they \ncommemorate this wonderful milestone. Through strong spiritual \nleadership and an active congregation, they have etched an impressive \nlegacy for all to see. Jackson, MI is a better place because of their \nwork, and as they look toward the future, I am certain it is equally \nbright. A hearty mazel tov to Temple Beth Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/19/senate-section/article/S2540-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2540-S2542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, Thursday, April 19, is Holocaust \nRemembrance Day. Observances and remembrance activities are taking \nplace across the Nation in civic centers, schools, churches and \nsynagogues, on military bases and in workplaces.\n  As always, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum--created as a \npermanent living memorial to its victims--is taking a leading role in \nthis annual observance.\n  We must never forget the horrors of the Holocaust, we must never let \nthe world forget, and we must never forget or neglect the Holocaust's \nlessons.\n  Never forgetting means keeping alive the memory of those who suffered \nand died in the Holocaust.\n  Never forgetting also means declaiming against crimes against \nhumanity that erupt in our midst, and on our watch.\n  As searing as the Holocaust's lessons are, the world is too easily \ntempted to avert its eyes from heinous crimes committed by governments \nand others against our fellow human beings. The community of nations \nwill always bear the shame of doing so little during the massacres on \nthe killing fields of Cambodia, and in the villages of Rwanda.\n  The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum itself has taken the lead \nin shining a light on atrocities in our time in Darfur, and I commend \nits Committee on Conscience for lending its unmatched moral authority \nto the crusade to bring an end to the violence there.\n  In that spirit, our voices are also needed to expose the crimes \nagainst humanity that are occurring behind the walls of the prison \ncamps of North Korea. More and more information now is coming to light \nabout the systematic, state-sponsored brutality that is being waged \nupon some 200,000 people, according to the State Department, in those \ncamps. The fact of these prison camps is not new. But horrifying new \nglimpses are now coming to light from those who have successfully \nbroken free and crossed the frontier to eventual freedom. Publicly \navailable satellite photos are helping to expose a system whose very \nexistence the North Korean government continues to deny.\n  A new report on these prison camps, authored by David Hawk, has been \nreleased by the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, a U.S.-\nbased, private organization. It documents the imprisonment of entire \nfamilies, including children and grandparents for the ``political \ncrimes'' of other family members.\n  At the report's Washington release this month, a young man born to \nprisoners--and thereby condemned to spend his entire life in one of \nthese camps--spoke about visiting the United States Holocaust Memorial \nMuseum, every time he comes to Washington. Shin Dong-hyuk's harrowing \nescape is detailed in a new book by Blaine Harden, a former Washington \nPost reporter.\n  We have vital national security interests at stake in our dealings \nwith the North Korean regime, which has acquired nuclear weapons. I am \none\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\nwho believes that we can fully and effectively pursue these interests \nthrough diplomacy and other means, without having to mute our outrage \nabout human rights atrocities like these.\n  I welcome the strong comments about this report made by Robert King, \nthe United States human rights envoy for North Korea, who said that \nconditions in North Korea's prison camps are worse than in the former \nSoviet Union's gulag. I would hope that today's leaders of Russia and \nChina would voice similar outrage about these atrocities.\n  Social media and a powerful video recently brought the story of the \ncrimes of Joseph Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army to an audience of \nmillions of people around the world. Let us individually and together \nsimilarly raise our voices against the crimes against humanity that are \ntaking place behind the walls and barbed wire of North Korea's labor \ncamps, where some one in four people die each year--starved to death, \nor worked to death, or executed.\n  Let it not be said by future generations that though we knew enough, \nwe did not care enough to condemn and to lend our efforts to end this \nbrutal system.\n  Several news organizations have reported or commented on this new \ninformation about North Korea's prison camps. I commend to the Senate's \nattention two recent such writings. I ask unanimous consent that an \neditorial, and a commentary by Fred Hiatt, both from the Washington \nPost, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 12, 2012]\n\n          Turning a Blind Eye to North Korea's `Hidden Gulag'\n\n                              (Editorial)\n\n       While attention focused on North Korea this week ahead of \n     Friday morning's missile launch, hundreds of Americans, \n     Koreans, Japanese and others gathered in Washington to \n     examine a different aspect of life in that communist nation: \n     its ``hidden gulag.''\n       That was the title of an unprecedented conference organized \n     by the U.S. Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK) \n     and the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of \n     Human Rights. The gulag is a network of labor camps that \n     houses 150,000 to 200,000 prisoners. They are generally \n     arrested for no crime, sent away with no trial, never again \n     allowed to communicate with anyone outside the camps, fed on \n     starvation rations and forced to work until they die. Other \n     than from one camp, according to South Korean expert Yoon \n     Yeo-sang, no one deported to North Korea's gulag is ever \n     released.\n       As noted by Blaine Harden, author of the recently published \n     book ``Escape from Camp 14,'' the North Korean gulag has \n     existed twice as long as did the Soviet network of labor \n     camps created by Lenin and Stalin, and 12 times as long as \n     Hitler's concentration camps. Yet, for the most part, \n     ``Americans don't know anything about these camps,'' Mr. \n     Harden said. ``They don't know they exist.''\n       This is not, the title of the conference notwithstanding, \n     because the gulag is all that hidden, although North Korea's \n     regime continues to deny its existence. In fact, as David \n     Hawk said, a great deal is known about the camps, both from \n     the testimony of those who have escaped and from satellite \n     imagery. Mr. Hawk has just published the second edition of \n     his definitive survey, also called ``The Hidden Gulag,'' \n     which draws on horrifying testimony from 60 former prisoners.\n       The reason for the ignorance is mostly political. The \n     United States, with a goal of keeping the peace and depriving \n     North Korea of nuclear weapons, has not made human rights a \n     priority. In South Korea, the gulag has been a political \n     football between left-wing politicians favoring warmer ties \n     with the North and right-wing politicians pushing a harder \n     line. China, North Korea's neighbor to the north and west, \n     abuses the human rights of its own population and does not \n     believe any country's freedom to abuse its population in the \n     same way should be interfered with.\n       China, in fact, is complicit in North Korea's abuses, since \n     it sends many defectors who have made it across the Yalu \n     River back into North Korea, where they face punishment or, \n     if they are repeat escapees, execution. North Korean women \n     who have become pregnant in China often are forced to abort \n     their children. ``In cases where the pregnancy is too \n     advanced, guards beat the infants to death or bury them alive \n     after they are born,'' writes Roberta Cohen, the chair of \n     HRNK.\n       Inevitably, there remains much that is unknown. It's \n     impossible to be confident of a population count for the \n     gulag, Mr. Hawk said, because it's not clear whether deaths \n     are outpacing deportations.\n       Enough is known, however, for indifference to be \n     inexcusable. As a first step, the United Nations could \n     establish a commission of inquiry to investigate crimes \n     against humanity taking place inside the prison camps. As Ms. \n     Cohen said, ``It is not just nuclear weapons that have to be \n     dismantled but an entire system of political repression.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 25, 2012]\n\nNorth Korea's Dehumanizing Treatment of Its Citizens Is Hiding in Plain \n                                 Sight\n\n                            (By Fred Hiatt)\n\n       With President Obama in Korea this week, we will hear a lot \n     about the dangers of North Korea's nuclear aspirations.\n       We're unlikely to hear about a young man named Shin Dong-\n     hyuk, who was bred, like a farm animal, inside a North Korean \n     prison camp after guards ordered his prisoner-parents to \n     mate. But Shin arguably has as much to teach about Korea's \n     past and future as about the cycle of negotiation, bluster \n     and broken promises over the nuclear issue.\n       ``Shin was born a slave and raised behind a high-voltage \n     barbed-wire fence.''\n       So writes Blaine Harden, a former East Asia correspondent \n     for The Post, in a soon-to-be-published account of Shin's \n     life, ``Escape from Camp 14.''\n       Harden describes a closed world of unimaginable bleakness. \n     We often speak of someone so unfortunate as to grow up ``not \n     knowing love.'' Shin grew up literally not understanding \n     concepts such as love, trust or kindness. His life consisted \n     of beatings, hunger and labor. His only ethos was to obey \n     guards, snitch on fellow inmates and steal food when he \n     could. At age 14, he watched his mother and older brother \n     executed, a display that elicited in him no pity or regret. \n     He was raised to work until he died, probably around age 40. \n     He knew no contemporaries who had experienced life outside \n     Camp 14.\n       At 23, Shin escaped and managed, over the course of four \n     years, to make his way through a hungry North Korea--a \n     larger, more chaotic version of Camp 14--into China and, \n     eventually, the United States. He is, as far as is known, the \n     only person born in the North Korean gulag to escape to \n     freedom.\n       Improbably, his tale becomes even more gripping after his \n     unprecedented journey, after he realizes that he has been \n     raised as something less than human. He gradually, \n     haltingly--and, so far, with mixed success--sets out to \n     remake himself as a moral, feeling human being.\n       How is this tale even possible in the 21st century, the era \n     of ``Never Again,'' of the United Nations proudly (in 2005) \n     declaring that all nations have a ``responsibility to \n     protect'' civilian populations abused by their own \n     governments?\n       ``Fashioning a comprehensive policy to deal with North \n     Korea's nuclear programs, its human rights abuses, and its \n     failed economy is hardly child's play,'' explains Victor Cha, \n     a Georgetown University professor, in his forthcoming book, \n     ``The Impossible State.'' ``No administration thus far has \n     been successful at addressing one, let alone all three.''\n       Cha, who helped shape Korea policy on the National Security \n     Council under President George W. Bush, describes a nation \n     where schoolchildren learn grammatical conjugations by \n     reciting ``We killed Americans,'' ``We are killing \n     Americans,'' ``We will kill Americans.''\n       With 25 million people, it is a failed state in every way \n     but one, which is coddling the regime and a small elite that \n     resembles a criminal syndicate more than a traditional \n     bureaucracy. While cautioning that predictions are risky, Cha \n     argues that ``the end is near.'' The next U.S. presidential \n     term, he predicts, is likely to face ``a major crisis of the \n     state in North Korea, and potentially unification.''\n       When that happens, ``what is likely to be revealed is one \n     of the worst human rights disasters in modern times.''\n       Only, as both books make clear, it won't be much of a \n     revelation. Harden points out that North Korea's labor camps \n     ``have now existed twice as long as the Soviet gulag and \n     about twelve times longer than the Nazi concentration \n     camps.'' They are easily identified in satellite photographs. \n     One is larger than the city of Los Angeles. Altogether they \n     house about 200,000 people.\n       They are visible, in other words, but people do not want to \n     see them, and Shin's story helps explain why.\n       It's no surprise that China, with its own gulag \n     archipelago, objects to any suggestion that a government \n     can't abuse its citizens as it pleases.\n       But South Koreans, living in freedom, also fear a North \n     Korean collapse--not only for the potential financial cost \n     but also because they sense how different their erstwhile \n     countrymen have become. Not all North Koreans live as stunted \n     a life as Shin did inside Camp 14, but generations of \n     isolation, propaganda and warped morality take a toll. And 20 \n     years of post-Soviet experience have taught us that civic \n     virtues can be far more difficult to rekindle than private \n     markets or democratic forms.\n       When he watched his teacher beat a six-year-old classmate \n     to death for stealing five grains of corn, Shin says he \n     ``didn't think much about it.''\n       ``I did not know about sympathy or sadness,'' he says. \n     ``Now that I am out, I am learning to be emotional. I have \n     learned to cry. I feel like I am becoming human.''\n       But seven years after his escape, Harden writes, Shin does \n     not believe he has reached that goal. ``I escaped \n     physically,'' he says. ``I haven't escaped psychologically.''\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/19/senate-section/article/S2542-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     FOOD SAFETY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one year ago, the Senate unanimously passed \nthe Food Safety Accountability Act. This week, the Food and Drug \nAdministration announced that raw tuna from a California supplier has \nsickened more than 100 people in 20 States with salmonella poisoning. \nWe do not yet know the cause of the current outbreak, but if enacted, \nthe Food Safety Accountability Act would help stop outbreaks of illness \nrelated to food safety. It is time for the House to pass this \nnoncontroversial legislation.\n  The Food Safety Accountability Act promotes more accountability for \nfood suppliers by increasing the sentences that prosecutors can seek \nfor people who violate our food safety laws in those cases where there \nis conscious or reckless disregard of a risk of death or serious bodily \ninjury. Current statutes do not provide sufficient criminal sanctions \nfor those who knowingly violate our food safety laws.\n  Knowingly distributing adulterated food is already illegal, but it is \nin most cases merely a misdemeanor, and the Sentencing Commission has \nfound that perpetrators generally do not serve jail time. The \nalternative, fines and recalls, fall short in protecting the public \nfrom harmful products. Too often, those who are willing to endanger our \nAmerican citizens in pursuit of profits view such fines or recalls as \nmerely the cost of doing business.\n  Salmonella poisoning is all too common and sometimes results from \ninexcusable, knowing conduct such as that carefully targeted by the \nFood Safety Accountability Act. The company responsible for a \nsalmonella outbreak last summer had a long history of environmental, \nimmigration, labor, and food safety violations. It is clear that fines \nare not enough to protect the public and effectively deter this \nunacceptable conduct. We need to make sure that those who knowingly \npoison the food supply will go to jail. This bill will significantly \nincrease the chances that those who commit serious food safety crimes \nwill face jail time rather than merely a slap on the wrist.\n  Food safety received considerable attention in the last Congress, and \nI was pleased that we finally passed comprehensive food safety reforms, \nbut our work is not done. A provision almost identical to the Food \nSafety Accountability Act has previously passed the House with strong, \nbipartisan support. Now that the Senate has unanimously passed this \nbill, it is long overdue for the House to act.\n  The American people should be confident that the food they buy for \ntheir families is safe. The uncertainty and fear caused by the current \nsalmonella outbreak only reinforces the need to pass the common sense \nFood Safety Accountability Act. I urge the House to quickly pass the \nSenate bill and join us in taking this important step toward protecting \nour food supply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/19/senate-section/article/S2542-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO IRENE DAVEY\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts.

It is a privilege for me to join her family, friends and \nveterans everywhere in extending warm wishes to Irene.\n  In March of 1943, Irene joined the U.S. Army and served until \nNovember 1945. Irene had a distinguished military career where she \nearned the rank of staff sergeant. She was part of a force of about \n351,000 women who served in World War II. Irene served in the Women's \nArmy Auxiliary Corps and was assigned to motor transport.\n  While serving in the Army, Irene directly contributed to the success \nof the motor corps by training the other women in the auxiliary corps \nto drive trucks and provide vehicle maintenance. One of her duties \nwhile serving in the motor corps included transporting sick and injured \nsoldiers home by ambulance. She even became a recruiter, using what she \nhad learned in the Army to bring in the next generation of soldiers.\n  Irene understood the true meaning of shared sacrifice. The motto of \nthe time was ``release a man to help your man.'' According to Irene it \nmeant that if a woman could take a man's job, that man was released to \njoin the armed forces. That made the armed forces stronger, helping \nyour man who was in the armed forces be that much safer.\n  After World War II, Irene continued her service by becoming a warden \nat the election polls in her hometown of Attleboro. Irene is an \nexceptional woman who has served her country and community in many \nways. Irene has been a champion for veterans all her life and the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts owes her its deepest gratitude.\n  There is nothing Irene likes more than hearing someone thanking a \nveteran for their service. Today, however, the Senate recognizes Irene \nDavey the poet, songwriter, and lifelong public servant.\n  Irene has witnessed many wonderful events during her long and \ndistinguished life. Throughout her years, she has demonstrated that one \nperson can make a difference. It is people as dedicated as Irene who \ncontinue to make a difference in this world. Others should take notice \nand become inspired by the example that she has set.\n  I would like to thank Irene for her tremendous service to our country \nand our communities. I know that her family and friends, as well as the \npeople of Massachusetts are extremely proud of her selfless service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/19/senate-section/article/S2542-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BOWEN FLOWERS\n\n Mr. COCHRAN.

The Delta Council was formed in 1935 and has grown into a \nwidely respected economic development organization representing the \nbusiness, professional, and agricultural leadership of the alluvial \nfloodplain commonly known as the Mississippi Delta. I am grateful to \nDelta Council for its continuous role in meeting the economic and \nquality of life challenges which have historically confronted this part \nof my State.\n  Bowen Flowers' tenure as president of Delta Council has coincided \nwith the development of a new farm bill, the primary legislation for \nestablishing Federal agriculture and food policies. Mr. Flowers has \nused his insight and judgment to lead the Delta Council in effectively \nworking with Congress to help ensure that the priorities of those \nliving and working in rural America are met. He is also recognized for \nhis dedication to conservation and wildlife as part of his ongoing \nservice to Mississippi.\n  In addition to his role as president of Delta Council, Mr. Flowers is \na director of Staplcotn Producer Cooperative and the Covenant Bank, and \nis a commissioner on the Coahoma County Soil and Water Commission. Some \nof his previous leadership positions include director of the \nMississippi Association of Conservation Districts, president of the \nMississippi Soybean Promotion Board, producer director of the National \nCotton Council, president of Delta Wildlife, and chairman of the Delta \nCouncil Soil and Water Committee.\n  Bowen Flowers is well respected in Mississippi and his performance as \npresident of the Delta Council will add to his well-earned reputation \nof working to improve the quality of life of rural America. His \ndedication to the future of the Mississippi Delta and those who live \nthere speaks highly of him as a person.

Washington County has historically faced a unique set of \nchallenges, and I am grateful for the board's consistent leadership in \nwillingly addressing these challenges on a daily basis.\n  Al Rankins has served Washington County long enough to understand the\n\n[[Page S2543]]\n\ndynamics of the local economy and the needs of the region. Mr. Rankins \nserved on the Board of Supervisors since 1990 and served as its \npresident. His tenure was characterized by consistent focus on \nretaining and recruiting new businesses and industries to the area. \nDuring his career, Al Rankins has also been a member of the Mississippi \nWater Management Advisory Board and the Allied Enterprise Advisory \nBoard. On the Delta Council, he served as the longtime chairman of the \nCouncil's Flood Control Committee and as chairman of the Development \nDepartment Board of Directors.\n  Prior to serving in these important jobs, Al Rankins worked almost 21 \nyears as a police officer for the city of Greenville, retiring in 1990 \nas deputy chief. He also served his country honorably during a tour of \nduty in Vietnam with the U.S. Air Force.\n  Related to his career as a civic leader and business owner, Al \nRankins has received many accolades and honors, including the Lifetime \nAchievement Award for Civil Service to the Community, the Outstanding \nCitizen Achievement Award, and the Outstanding Service to the Community \nAward. These awards are examples of the recognition extended to Mr. \nRankins for his public service and community volunteer contributions to \nthe Mississippi Delta Region.\n  Al Rankins and his wife Mary are a credit to my great State. In \nconjunction with the end of his long service with the Washington County \nBoard of Supervisors, I join many Mississippians in commending Alfred \nRankins, Sr., for his dedication and service to the people of \nMississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/19/senate-section/article/S2543-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BRUNO BENNA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \nNevadan who spent his life working to strengthen his local community \nand enrich the lives of its residents. After a courageous 9-year battle \nwith cancer, Bruno Benna passed on April 1, 2012. Our State has lost a \nselfless and giving Nevadan. My thoughts and prayers continue to be \nwith his family.\n  From starting a small concrete company that would later become a \nstaple in Reno to his patronage for the fine arts, Bruno was involved \nin nearly every facet of Northern Nevada's community. In 1958, he co-\nfounded C.B. Concrete Company, which literally laid the foundations for \nmodern Reno. For the next 50 years, Bruno contributed to the \nconstruction of Reno's major infrastructure projects. Generations of \nReno residents have become familiar with C. B. Concrete Company's \niconic yellow trucks emblazoned with the bumble bee logo.\n  C. B. Concrete Company exemplifies the vital role small businesses \nplay in both our economy and local community. As the backbone of our \neconomy, they must continue to remain vibrant and healthy in order to \ncreate jobs at a time when Nevadans need them the most. I am saddened \nthat Reno has lost such a passionate entrepreneur who was responsible \nfor employing hundreds of Nevadans. Northern Nevada was fortunate to \nhave such a talented businessman who was continuously striving to \nimprove the business community while serving on the Reno Chamber of \nCommerce Board, the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission, and as an \nadvisor to the U.S. Small Business Administration.\n  In 1997, Bruno and his wife, Edna, started the Benna Family \nFoundation to give back to their community. Through the foundation, the \ncouple were avid supporters of the University of Nevada, the Nevada \nDiscovery Museum, the Nevada Opera, the Nevada Art Museum, and the Reno \nLittle Theater. In 2002, Governor Kenny Guinn awarded the Bennas with \nthe Governor's Arts Award for their decades of service for arts in \nNorthern Nevada.\n  Bruno's extensive philanthropic endeavors and generous contributions \nto our State continue to be inspiring to those within the Reno and \nlarger northern Nevada community. I am both grateful for and humbled by \nhis commitment to the Silver State. I ask my colleagues to join me \ntoday in remembering the life of a great Nevadan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/19/senate-section/article/S2543-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING WEST BRANCH HERITAGE TIMBER, LLC\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, my home State of Maine, with its \nvast acres of trees, has traditionally been a hub for the lumber \nindustry since the advent of wood pulp in paper making. In recent \nyears, the lumber industry has suffered due to the economic downturn, \nand the resulting decline in the housing market has reduced the need \nfor wood products to build homes such as hardwood flooring and cabinet \nconstruction. Despite this, there are companies that persevere in the \nface of such hardships, confronting economic challenges with innovation \nand creativity. Today, I rise to commend and recognize one such \ncompany, West Branch Heritage Timber, for helping to revive the lumber \nindustry while creating a beautiful and artistic product inscribed with \nMaine's rich history.\n  Since 2010, West Branch Heritage Timber located in Millinocket, ME, \nhas harvested 20,000 tons of wood from Quakish Lake--part of the \nPenobscot River system--which became a repository for thousands of tons \nof lost timber cut by river-driving loggers over a century ago. The \nextensive wood inventory remained preserved under the water for over \n100 years, until coowners Steve Saunders and Tom Shafer developed an \nidea to retrieve the unique and magnificent lumber. To put it simply, \nthese two innovators have been ``fishing'' this timber from the bottom \nof the lake for the commercial value it holds today.\n  Currently, West Branch Heritage Timber is in the process of \nreclaiming an estimated 1 million cord of timber at the bottom of the \nWest Branch of the Penobscot River, making it the largest timber \nreclamation project ever conducted in New England. The quality of their \nproduct has not gone unnoticed as this small firm was recently selected \nby another local business, Shaw & Tenney of Orono, as the primary wood \nsupplier for the paddles they are producing for L.L. Bean's 100-year \nanniversary. Lake wood contains aesthetically impressive designs which \ndevelop and evolve as minerals from the lake's water seeps deep into \nthe wood over many years, creating rich earth tones. Shaw & Tenney saw \nan opportunity to utilize this niche-commodity offered by West Branch \nHeritage Timber to demonstrate the beauty of Maine in L.L. Bean's \ncommemorative paddles.\n  However, the artistic preservation of history is only one purpose \nthat the wood of Quakish Lake serves. Steve hopes that the business \nwill soon obtain a paper mill contract as West Branch would be able to \nprovide pulping wood at a substantially less cost than competitors. \nSteve has attested to the feasibility and value of such a venture by \nestimating the potential to produce 40,000 tons of wood annually for \nthe next 20 years. While the company currently employs nine full-time \nemployees, obtaining a pulp contract would allow for expansion and job \ncreation.\n  The ingenuity and creativity of the West Branch Heritage Timber team \nembodies the entrepreneurial spirit of our country's history and serves \nas an exemplary small business that so ardently comprises the backbone \nof the American economy. I am proud to extend my congratulations to \nSteve and Tom, as well as everyone at West Branch Heritage Timber, for \ntheir hard work in providing a product that is both beautiful and vital \nto the resurgence of Maine's lumber industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/19/senate-section/article/S2543-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2543-S2544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               2012 NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY--PM 46\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit the 2012 National Drug Control Strategy, \nwhich follows through on the commitment made by my Administration to \nchart a new course in our efforts to reduce illicit drug use and its \nconsequences in the United States. The balanced approach outlined in \nthe Administration's inaugural National Drug Control Strategy has \nyielded significant results, which are detailed in the following pages.\n  Our Nation still faces serious drug-related challenges, however. Too \nmany Americans need treatment for substance use disorders but do not \nreceive\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\nit. Prescription drug abuse continues to claim American lives, and \nthose who take drugs and drive threaten safety on our Nation's \nroadways. Young people's perceptions of the risks of drug use have \ndeclined over the past decade, and research suggests that this often \npredicts future increases in drug use. There is still much left to do \nto reform our justice system and break the cycle of drug use and crime. \nOur commitment to work with partner nations must remain steadfast to \nreduce drug production, trafficking, and related transnational threats.\n  Based upon the progress we have achieved over the past three years, I \nam confident we can address these challenges through concerted action \nalong the entire spectrum of prevention, early intervention, treatment, \nrecovery support, criminal justice reform, law enforcement, and \ninternational cooperation. However, we must match our commitment with \nthe appropriate resources.\n  Illicit drug use in America contributed to an estimated $193 billion \nin crime, health, and lost productivity costs in 2007, the year for \nwhich the most recent estimate is available. In today's challenging \neconomic environment, we cannot afford such a drain on our economy and \npublic resources. While difficult budget decisions must be made at all \nlevels of government, we must ensure continued support for policies and \nprograms that reduce drug use and its enormous costs to American \nsociety. In doing so, we will not only strengthen our economy but also \nsustain the national character and spirit that has made the United \nStates a world leader.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with the Congress and Federal, \nstate, local, tribal, and territorial leaders, international partners, \nand the American people in this important endeavor.\n\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 19, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/19/senate-section/article/S2544-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:37 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2453.

A bill to help prevent the occurrence of cancer resulting \nfrom the use of ultraviolet tanning lamps by providing sufficient \ninformation to consumers regarding the health risks associated with the \nuse of such devices; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nIsakson in introducing the Tanning Transparency and Notification Act, \nor the TAN Act.\n  This legislation is a continuation of an initiative that we worked on \ntogether five years ago during the Food and Drug Administration \nAmendments Act, FDAAA, of 2007. That initiative required the Food and \nDrug Administration, FDA, to issue a report to Congress on whether the \nlabeling requirements for indoor tanning devices provide sufficient \ninformation to consumers regarding the risks that the use of such \ndevices pose for the development of irreversible damage to the eyes and \nskin, including skin cancer.\n  We called for this report in 2007 because the FDA had not updated its \nwarnings on tanning beds since 1979. The FDA still has not acted and we \nbelieve that users of indoor tanning beds deserve to be fully informed. \nWhile the American Academy of Dermatology, the FDA, the National \nInstitutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nand the World Health Organization, WHO, continue to discourage the use \nof indoor tanning beds, this message and up-to-date information about \nthe risks of indoor tanning are still not being adequately provided to \nconsumers.\n  Not surprisingly, the FDA found in its report to Congress that \nupdating current labeling requirements for tanning beds would better \nprotect consumers from irreversible skin damage. This is an excerpt \nfrom the FDA's own report:\n\n       Based on its analysis of the results of the consumer study \n     required by section 230 of FDAAA, FDA has determined that \n     there are warnings that are capable of adequately \n     communicating the risks of indoor tanning,\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\n     and that a modified warning statement label may more \n     effectively convey these risks than the current labeling \n     requirements. FDA has also determined that changes to the \n     positioning requirements for the warning statement label may \n     communicate such risks more effectively.\n\n  Unfortunately, the FDA has not heeded its own advice. Tanning bed \nlabels remain unchanged and skin cancer rates continue to rise. This \nyear, approximately 131,810 new cases of melanoma will be diagnosed in \nthe United States, and nearly 9,180 people will die from melanoma. Some \nof these cases result from the use of tanning beds.\n  Two million Americans, approximately 70 percent of whom are girls and \nwomen, visit a tanning salon each day. The WHO reports that the risk of \ncutaneous melanoma increases by 75 percent when use of tanning devices \nstarts before 30 years of age.\n  Better informing these individuals about the incidence of melanoma, \nand increasing transparency and improving notification about the risks \nof indoor tanning are all ways to reduce skin cancer rates. The Tanning \nTransparency and Notification Act would require the FDA to carry out \nthe recommendations in its report and update the labeling requirements \nfor tanning beds.\n  Initiatives like this can make a difference in the health of \nAmericans. Indeed, just last year, the FDA finalized critical \nregulations--at my and others' urging--that were 30 years in the making \nregarding sunscreen labeling. Providing consumers with critical \ninformation about the risks of indoor and outdoor tanning can help \nbetter protect them against skin cancer. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on improving the labeling of indoor tanning beds and \ncontinuing efforts to combat skin cancer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Kirk):\n  S. 2303. A bill to require rulemaking by the Administrator of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency to address considerations in \nevaluating the need for public and individual disaster assistance, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Fairness in \nFederal Disaster Declaration Act. I am introducing it on behalf of \nmyself and my colleague, Senator Mark Kirk. What we are trying to \nachieve is fairness in FEMA's consideration of whether a community will \nbe granted Federal assistance after a disaster. I think this \nlegislation is essential because of what just happened in my State.\n  From 2007 to 2011, Illinois was denied Federal assistance three \ntimes. Texas was denied nine times. The damage was caused by everything \nfrom wildfires to tropical storms. California was denied five times \nduring that 5-year period. Florida was denied four times, including for \ndamage from Hurricane Ike. And unfortunately, as I mentioned, in my \nhome State of Illinois, the communities of Harrisburg and Ridgway were \ndenied.\n  This is the damage I saw when I went down to Harrisburg, IL, after a \nrecent tornado. This was a shopping mall, but it was virtually \ncollapsed by winds of 175 miles-per-hour intensity. That is the second \nhighest intensity of recorded winds in a tornado. This property damage, \nof course, is just a minor part of what actually happened. The major \npart was the loss of life. Seven people were killed as a result of the \ntornado damage.\n  I grew up in the Midwest. I have seen tornadoes all my life. I lived \nwaiting to hear the air raid sirens and head toward the basement. But I \nnever saw anything quite as devastating as what I saw in Harrisburg. \nAnd then when I went over to Ridgway, IL, about 25 miles away, I saw \nthat the local Catholic church, which had been standing for I think a \ncentury, collapsed when the winds hit it.\n  It was clear to me and to the Governor and many others as we toured \nthe site that this was going to be a Federal disaster area.\n  That 175 mile-an-hour wind literally lifted homes off of their slab \nfoundations and tossed them on top of other homes. In one neighborhood \nin Harrisburg, I happened to see some people leaving in a truck, and I \nstopped them and they said that the lady in the front seat actually \nlived in one of the houses that had been destroyed. She pointed it out \nto me. She got up early enough so that she heard the air raid siren and \nhad the good sense to hit the floor in the bathroom right before the \ntornado hit her home. Of course, after it hit, and another home \ncollapsed on top of it, the ceiling of her bathroom collapsed on her, \nbut there was enough room for her to survive. They started hearing \nshortly thereafter the rescuers coming in. She made it with a few \nscratches and bruises. Just across the street, in one of the homes that \nwas tossed was a 22-year-old local nurse who died as a result.\n  There were great efforts by first responders, terrific humanitarian \ngestures. The local coal miners a few miles away, when they heard about \nthe disaster, in full gear, came out of the coal mines and rushed into \nHarrisburg to pull people out of their homes after they had collapsed.\n  We went ahead and made our application for Federal disaster aid in \nHarrisburg, IL, and we were denied. In the President's home State, we \nwere denied. We thought, something is wrong here. We thought, with all \nof this damage from a tornado of this intensity, it must be wrong. So \nGovernor Quinn sat down with local and State officials and redrafted \nour application for Federal assistance. It was sent to Washington, and \nit was denied a second time. I was stunned by it. I couldn't believe \nit, after having seen it, that this happened.\n  We went to FEMA and said, What did we miss here? People died, over \n100 homes were destroyed, and it ripped its way through Harrisburg and \ninto Ridgway, IL. What was missing here? Well, they said, we have to do \na calculation under the law, and one of the elements in the calculation \nis the population of your State. Well, this is how it turned out. The \ndamage that happened in southern Illinois, if it had happened across \nthe river in Indiana or in Kentucky or in Missouri, would have been a \nFederal disaster. But because we have about 12 million people, we \nweren't declared a Federal disaster. What is the thinking behind that? \nIf you are from a big State, you must have a lot of resources to take \ncare of your own problems. Not so. Unfortunately, the State budget of \nIllinois is virtually bankrupt.\n  So we decided it was time to put a bill in that took into \nconsideration a lot of factors and did not allow this disqualification \nfor a large State. The bill Senator Mark Kirk and I are introducing \ntoday assigns a value to each of the six factors that are to be \nconsidered in a disaster declaration analysis. When it comes to \nindividual assistance, help for people to rebuild their homes and pay \nfor temporary housing, we use the same consistent factors no matter \nwhere the disaster strikes. The population of the State is worth 5 \npercent of the consideration. The consideration of the concentration of \ndamages is worth 20 percent; the amount of trauma to the disaster area, \n20 percent; the number of special populations such as the elderly or \nunemployed, 20 percent of the analysis; the amount of voluntary \nassistance in the area, 10 percent; and the amount of insurance \ncoverage for the type of damage incurred, 20 percent.\n  Our bill also adds a seventh consideration to FEMA's metrics: the \neconomics of the area. It turns out that southern Illinois is hard-\npressed. There are a lot of unemployed people, a struggling economy. So \nwe take a look at the local tax base, the median income as it compares \nto that of the State, and the poverty rate in the area that has been \nhard hit. It is reasonable that FEMA should take into consideration the \nsize of a State; I don't argue with that, but it shouldn't loom large \nand disqualify situations which clearly deserve to be considered \nFederal disasters. Assigning values to the factors will ensure that \ndamage to a specific community weighs more than just the State's \npopulation.\n  After the tornadoes hit Harrisburg and Ridgway, the head of the \nIllinois Emergency Management Agency, Jonathon Monken, worked with \nlocals and people from the FEMA regional office to determine if the \nState could apply for public assistance--money to help local Mayor \nGregg in Harrisburg and others pay for overtime accrued by all the \npeople working around the clock to help the community dig out of the \ndestruction. What Director Monken and others discovered was that it \nwould have been a waste of the State's\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\ntime and resources to even consider applying for it. We didn't meet \nFEMA's threshold.\n  Currently, FEMA multiplies the number of people in a State by $1.35 \nto determine the threshold of the amount of damage a State would have \nto incur to qualify for public assistance. In Illinois, that figure is \n$17 million. Well, Harrisburg, Ridgway, and the surrounding communities \nhad about $5.5 million in public assistance damage. That is a lot of \nloss for rural areas and small towns, but not enough to qualify for \nFederal assistance.\n  So we put together in this bill a standard for public assistance--\nmoney that would go to local units of government. Per capita \nconsideration, 10 percent; localized impact of the disaster, 40 \npercent; the estimated cost of assistant needed, 10 percent; insurance \ncoverage, 10 percent; the number of recent multiple disasters, 10 \npercent; and an analysis of other Federal assistance in the area, 10 \npercent. The bill would also add a seventh consideration just as it did \nunder individual assistance, and that is the economic circumstances of \nthe affected area. I mentioned earlier the elements that were brought \ninto consideration there. I think this is a more honest and realistic \napproach.\n  Today, in order to introduce this bill, I am talking about a disaster \nwhich visited our State a few weeks ago. Tomorrow it could be the State \nof one of my colleagues. My colleagues could find out that a \ndevastating natural disaster does not qualify for Federal disaster \nassistance simply because of the population of their State. I don't \nthink that is a fair metric to use. I think our approach is fairer.\n  I commend this bill to my colleagues. As I say in closing, over this \nlast few months it was Illinois. Tomorrow, it may be a colleague's \nState. Please take the time and look at this approach. I think it is \nfair to taxpayers. It is certainly fair to families across America.\n  Those of us who have been in the Senate and the Congress for a while \nhave stepped up time and again when our colleagues were affected by a \nnatural disaster. I hope my colleagues will take the time to consider \nthis legislation from Senator Kirk and myself.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 2303\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct \nthe Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to \nmodernize the integrated public alert and warning system of the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Integrated \nPublic Alert and Warning System, IPAWS, Modernization Act of 2012. I am \npleased to be joined by Senators Lieberman, Scott Brown, Akaka, and \nCarper in introducing this bill. It will ensure that more people \nreceive life-saving information in more parts of America, more of the \ntime, through current and future technologies.\n  Effective communication with the public before, during, and after a \ndisaster is vitally important and can literally mean the difference \nbetween life and death. Since the 1950's, the U.S. Government has had a \nsystem in place to ensure that citizens can be warned in times of \ncrisis. This system can also be used for local authorities to warn \ncitizens of impending severe weather or other hazards to public safety.\n  Most people know the Emergency Alert System, EAS, as the crawling \ntext on their television screens, and although this system remains the \nbackbone of our national alerting capability, times have changed, and \nso must the way we communicate with the public during times of crisis.\n  This bill will strengthen the IPAWS system and ensure that as many \nAmericans as possible receive these alerts in a timely and useful \nmanner. The bill ensures that the integrated public alert and warning \nsystem incorporates multiple communications technologies, including new \ntechnologies such as smart phones and social networking sites;\n  The bill is designed to adapt to and incorporate future technologies;\n  The bill is designed to provide alerts to the largest portion of the \naffected population, including remote areas;\n  The bill promotes local and regional public and private partnerships; \nand\n  The bill provides redundant alert mechanisms in order to reach the \ngreatest number of people possible.\n  The bill also requires the FEMA Administrator to ensure the inclusion \nof those with disabilities in the alert and warning system; ensure that \nthe system is included in future exercises conducted through DHS's \nNational Exercise Program, including the annual National Level \nExercises; and requires FEMA to coordinate with DHS's National \nTerrorism Advisory System office. The bill provides for periodic \nnationwide tests of the system, and establishes a training program to \ninstruct federal, state, tribal and local government officials in \nsystem use.\n  The bill also establishes an IPAWS Advisory Committee composed of \nfederal, State and local representatives, as well as members who \nrepresent relevant industry groups and a consumer/privacy advocate. The \ncommittee would meet at least once a year and issue a yearly report on \nimprovements to IPAWS. The bill also states that the administrator may \nnot transmit a message from the President that does not relate to a \nnatural disaster, act of terrorism, other man-made disaster, or other \nhazard to public safety.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the National Emergency Management \nAssociation, NEMA, the National Association of Broadcasters, NAB, the \nNational Federation of the Blind, and the Hearing Loss Association of \nAmerica. Additionally, we have received a letter of support from the \nCEOs of all 50 State broadcast trade associations.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to pass this bill \nand have it signed into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                 Broadcasters,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan Collins, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ranking Member Collins: I write in support of your \n     bill, the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) \n     Modernization Act of 2012, which will modernize the public \n     alert and warning system of the United States to ensure that \n     the president, under all conditions, can effectively alert \n     and warn citizens during times of disaster. America's \n     broadcasters strongly support this legislation.\n       Broadcasters serve our local communities during emergencies \n     by providing life-saving information, important news and \n     weather reports. We have proudly worked with local and \n     federal governments for more than six decades, airing alerts \n     issued by the Emergency Alert System (EAS), and continue to \n     do so today. Working hand in hand with law enforcement, \n     broadcasters have helped to successfully recover more than \n     540 abducted children to date through the use of AMBER \n     Alerts.\n       The IPAWS Modernization Act of 2012 is an important step \n     towards expanding the nation's public warning system by \n     integrating multiple communications systems and future \n     technologies. This legislation promotes local and regional \n     public and private partnerships and provides redundant alert \n     mechanisms to reach the largest number of people during an \n     emergency.\n       Additionally, this legislation establishes a training \n     program to instruct federal, state, tribal and local \n     government officials in system use. Broadcasters are very \n     supportive of such a training program and view this as a \n     critical component to successful alerting. Strengthening \n     coordination among the different levels of government, the \n     legislation will set up an IPAWS Modernization Select \n     Advisory Committee composed of federal, state and local \n     representatives as well as members from various industry \n     groups. We look forward to participating in this Advisory \n     Committee and continuing our partnership with the federal \n     government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Gordon H.

Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The Hearing Loss Association of \n     America is pleased to endorse the Integrated Public Alert and \n     Warning System Modernization Act of 2012. We applaud your \n     efforts to update the integrated public alert and warning \n     system, and are particularly pleased to see that this \n     legislation would require specific steps to ensure \n     individuals with disabilities are not forgotten.\n       One of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) \n     core responsibilities is to keep Americans informed about \n     threats to public safety, and yet the current public alert \n     and warning system is not always accessible to people with \n     hearing loss. In fact, the November 9, 2011 testing of EAS \n     proved to be problematic: some cable stations did not provide \n     the needed text to properly inform people with hearing loss \n     that it was only a test; some did not provide the needed \n     audible alerts; others did not provide the emergency alert at \n     all.\n       The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System \n     Modernization Act of 2012 updates the system to incorporate \n     multiple communication technologies and adapt to emerging \n     technology, and it requires the system to reach people with \n     hearing loss and other disabled people. The bill also ensures \n     that organizations representing people with hearing loss will \n     sit on an advisory committee that will make recommendations \n     on modernization of the system, keeping people with hearing \n     loss engaged with Federal agencies during this process.\n       By requiring the system to incorporate new technologies but \n     still reaching people with hearing loss and other people with \n     disabilities, FEMA will be supporting technology that is \n     accessible to all. The modernization will also ensure that \n     people with hearing loss are provided with the same critical \n     information at the same time as the rest of the country, \n     allowing everyone to make independent, educated decisions \n     during emergencies. On behalf of Americans with hearing loss, \n     we thank you again for taking the initiative in this matter \n     and sponsoring this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Brenda Battat,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Emergency\n\n\n                                       Management Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Ranking Member, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Emergency \n     Management Association (NEMA) representing the emergency \n     management director of all 50 states, Territories, and the \n     District of Columbia, we are pleased to endorse The \n     Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act \n     of 2012.\n       The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) was \n     designed to bring together different and emerging \n     communication technologies into a fully coordinated network \n     so comprehensive communication may occur in the event of an \n     emergency or disaster. Created by a 2006 Executive order, \n     IPAWS represents a step forward from outdated systems which \n     relied on radio and television alone to reach the population \n     at-large when there is an incident.\n       Since the 2006 Executive Order, IPAWS has languished \n     without a true direction, appropriate authorization, or \n     codified organization. Your legislation brings about all \n     these needed aspects to the program that we have supported in \n     recent years. In 2008, NEMA unanimously approved a position \n     paper regarding IPAWS. One aspect of the program in which we \n     felt needed improvement was greater coordination with state \n     and local governments. Since last year, outreach to state \n     officials has certainly improved, but we believe your \n     recommendation of the IPAWS Advisory Committee will help \n     bring about even more coordination with the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency.\n       Alert systems represent critical components of local and \n     state emergency operations plans, so it remains essential the \n     IPAWS system is integrated, coordinated, and comprehensive. \n     We must remain careful, however, that these components to not \n     come at the expense of already stressed state budgets.\n       We greatly appreciate your leadership on this issue and \n     look forward to working together with you, Chairman \n     Lieberman, and the rest of the committee to ensure passage of \n     this bill. Please feel free to utilize our membership as a \n     resource as The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System \n     Modernization Act of 2012 moves through the legislative \n     process. You may also call upon our Director of Government \n     Relations, Matt Cowles any time.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim Mullen,\n       NEMA President, Director, Washington Military Department \n     Division of Emergency Management.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                                 of the Blind,\n\n                                    Baltimore, MD, April 18, 2012.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The National Federation of the Blind \n     (NFB), the nation's largest and oldest organization of blind \n     people, endorses the Integrated Public Alert and Warning \n     System Modernization Act of 2012. We thank you for sponsoring \n     a bill that updates the integrated public alert and warning \n     system to require inclusion of individuals with disabilities, \n     and we encourage the U.S. Senate to pass this legislation \n     promptly.\n       One of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) \n     core responsibilities is to keep Americans informed about \n     threats to public safety, and yet many aspects of the current \n     public alert and warning system are not accessible to blind \n     people. This inaccessibility is perpetuated by misconceptions \n     about blindness and the ever-growing popularity of \n     inaccessible digital technology. As a result, blind people \n     are regularly denied access to critical public information. \n     The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization \n     Act of 2012 updates the system to incorporate multiple \n     communication technologies and adapt to emerging technology, \n     and it requires the system to reach blind and other disabled \n     people. The bill also ensures that a representative from a \n     blindness advocacy group will sit on an advisory committee \n     that will make recommendations on the modernization, keeping \n     the blind engaged with Federal agencies during this process.\n       By requiring the system to incorporate new technologies but \n     still reach blind and other disabled people, FEMA will be \n     encouraging manufacturers and carriers to make their \n     communication technologies accessible by nonvisual means. The \n     modernization will also ensure that blind people are provided \n     with the same critical information at the same time as the \n     rest of the country, allowing blind people to make \n     independent, educated decisions during emergencies. On behalf \n     of blind Americans, we thank you again for taking the \n     initiative in this matter and sponsoring this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                John G.

and\n       Whereas, with the intent and knowledge of the highest level \n     of the Government of Syria, including commanding officers of \n     the Syria security forces and the President of the Syrian \n     Arab Republic, Bashir Assad, members of the Syria security \n     forces have reportedly committed a widespread and systematic \n     pattern of gross human rights violations, including use of \n     force against civilians, torture, extra judicial killings, \n     arbitrary executions, sexual violence, the execution of \n     defectors, and interference with medical treatment and other \n     humanitarian assistance: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the Government of Syria, Syria security \n     forces, and the President of the Syrian Arab Republic for \n     widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian \n     population of Syria;\n       (2) commends the President for the vote of the United \n     States at the United Nations Security Council to condemn the \n     continued widespread and gross violations of human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms by the authorities in Syria;\n       (3) urges the President to use his authority to collect \n     information on incidents in Syria that may constitute crimes \n     against humanity under section 2113 of the ADVANCE Democracy \n     Act of 2007 (title XXI of Public Law 110 53; 22 U.S.C. 8213) \n     and take action to ensure that the Government of Syria, its \n     leaders, and senior officials who are responsible for crimes \n     against humanity are brought to account for such crimes in an \n     appropriately constituted tribunal;\n       (4) urges the President to formally establish the \n     Atrocities Prevention Board established by Presidential Study \n     Directive 10 in August 2011, and for the Board to provide \n     recommendations to the President concerning the prevention of \n     mass atrocities in Syria;\n       (5) urges the international community, working with the \n     people of Syria to review legal processes available to hold \n     officials of the Government of Syria, Syria security forces, \n     and the President of the Syrian Arab Republic accountable for \n     crimes against humanity and gross violations of human rights; \n     and\n       (6) expresses solidarity and support for the people of \n     Syria as they seek to exercise universal rights and pursue \n     peaceful democratic change.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution \ncondemning the Government of Syria for crimes against humanity. I am \npleased to be joined by Senators Graham, Klobuchar, Kirk, Cardin, \nCoats, Collins, and McCain in submitting this resolution.\n  I am very proud we have strong bipartisan support and I thank, in \nparticular, Senator Graham for his leadership, along with Senator \nMcCain, who repeatedly and consistently in this area of human rights \nand liberties have stood for basic American principles of democracy and \nfreedom. I had the great opportunity to visit a number of the Middle \nEastern countries with them, and my strong support for this kind of \nresolution rises from the firsthand views we were able to have of the \nresults of freedom fighters in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt and the impact \non the future of their country and being on the right side of history, \nas the United States was there. Those people showed their gratitude and \nwelcomed us to their countries.\n  I am grateful to Senators McCain and Graham for giving me that \nopportunity, along with Senators Sessions and Hoeven, who accompanied \nus, for their leadership.\n  Syrian crimes against humanity include acts such as murder, torture \nand unlawful punishment and imprisonment when committed as part of a \nwidespread or systematic attack on civilian populations.\n  Since peaceful protests began last year, the Syrian regime has \nbrutalized and savaged its own people, leaving thousands dead as it \ncommits horrific crimes against humanity, including the abduction and \ntorture of children.\n  This resolution tells the Syrian people they are not alone, that the \nAmerican people are with them as they fight for freedom and basic \ndemocratic rights; the people of the world are watching.\n  On November 23, 2011, the U.N.-appointed Independent International \nCommission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic expressed grave \nconcern that ``crimes against humanity of murder, torture, rape or \nother forms of sexual violence . . . imprisonment or other severe \ndeprivation of liberty, enforced disappearances of persons and other \ninhumane acts . . . have occurred in different locations in Syria since \nMarch 2011.''\n  The Commission also found that ``the Syrian Arab Republic bears \nresponsibility for these crimes and violations.''\n  Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs Jeffrey Feltman \ntestified before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that \n``large numbers of Syrians are living every day under siege, deprived \nof basic necessities including food, clean water and medical supplies, \nand women and children are wounded and dying for lack of treatment.''\n  General Mattis, commander of the U.S. Central Command, for whom I \nhave the strongest and deepest respect, explained before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee ``the Syrian military continues to ruthlessly \nuse lethal force with impunity against the Syrian people.''\n  In this body, we have not remained silent in the face of this \nhumanitarian disaster, approving on February 17, 2012, S. Res. 379, \ncondemning violence by the Government of Syria against the Syrian \npeople. We have also approved S. Res. 391, which I cosponsored, \ncondemning violence by the Government of Syria against journalists and \nexpressing the sense of the Senate on freedom of the press in Syria.\n  The world should be inspired by the continuing courage and \ndetermination of Syrian protesters standing and speaking, despite the \nSyrian military gunning down and bombing their homes, businesses, and \nneighborhoods.\n  I know our Nation is at war and rightly wary of intervention abroad. \nBut military intervention is not our only option, not the only means to \nsummon support or step forward in solidarity with the freedom fighters \nin Syria, nor is military intervention alone sufficient to call forth \nthe world's conscience. Even without military action, we need not \nabdicate the democratic rights and principles that underlie and \nunderpin our own Nation's constitutional ethos.\n  One powerful and profound step this body can take is to bear witness \nto the atrocities occurring in Syria. More than 9,000 people have died \nin Syria since these protests began. As Elie Wiesel has said, ``For the \ndead and the living, we must bear witness.''\n  The Syrian thugs who detain and torture children must know the United \nStates bears witness to their crimes. We should say to President Assad \nthat the world is watching and witnessing as he uses snipers to target \ncivilians, indiscriminately shelling homes and businesses, and \ntorturing protesters who dare to speak of change.\n  This resolution calls on President Obama to bear witness by using his \nexisting authority. America can and\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\nmust bear witness by taking and preserving evidence of actions and \nincidents in Syria that constitute crimes against humanity. America \nmust bear witness by asking the President's newly created Atrocities \nPrevention Board to consider crimes against humanity occurring in \nSyria.\n  These atrocities epitomize the crimes this prevention board must \naddress. I commend President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton for \ntheir work at the U.N. and with our allies to assist the Syrian people. \nWe should make our own findings about what has occurred in Syria \nconcerning the crimes against humanity. We cannot avoid this obligation \nsimply because the result may present difficult choices.\n  As Martin Luther King would often remind us, ``The arc of the moral \nuniverse is long, but it bends toward justice.''\n  If we bear witness today, justice will come closer for the Syrian \npeople. President Assad and the Government of Syria, its leaders and \nsenior officials who are responsible for crimes against humanity, will \nbe brought to account and justice for their crimes.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/19/senate-section/article/S2553-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 429--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF WORLD MALARIA \n                                  DAY\n\n  Mr. WICKER (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Boozman, and Mr. Bingaman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 429\n\n       Whereas April 25th of each year is recognized \n     internationally as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being completely \n     preventable and treatable;\n       Whereas fighting malaria is in the national security \n     interest of the United States Government, as reducing the \n     risk of malaria protects members of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States serving overseas in malaria endemic regions, \n     and reducing malaria deaths helps to promote stability in \n     less developed countries;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 35 countries, the majority of which are in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, account for 98 percent of global malaria \n     deaths;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects child health, as children \n     under the age of 5 account for an estimated 85 percent of \n     malaria deaths each year;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal health, \n     causing complications during delivery, anemia, and low birth \n     weights, with estimates that malaria infection causes 400,000 \n     cases of severe maternal anemia and between 75,000 and \n     200,000 infant deaths annually in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria over recent years have \n     made measurable progress and helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2011 by the World Health \n     Organization states that in 2011, approximately 50 percent of \n     households in sub-Saharan Africa owned at least 1 \n     insecticide-treated mosquito net (referred to in this \n     preamble as an ``ITN''), and household surveys indicated that \n     96 percent of people with access to an ITN within a household \n     actually used the ITN;\n       Whereas, in 2010, a total of 185,000,000 people were \n     protected by indoor residual spraying (referred to in this \n     preamble as ``IRS'');\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2011 further states that \n     malaria mortality rates have fallen by more than 25 percent \n     globally, and 33 percent in Africa alone, since 2000;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2011 further states that \n     out of 99 countries with ongoing malaria transmissions, 43 \n     countries recorded decreases of more than 50 percent in the \n     number of malaria cases between 2000 and 2010, and 8 other \n     countries recorded decreases of more than 25 percent;\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including \n     prevention and treatment efforts and the development of a \n     vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, is \n     critical in order to continue to reduce malaria deaths, \n     prevent backsliding in areas where progress has been made, \n     and equip the United States and the global community with the \n     tools necessary to fight malaria and other global health \n     threats;\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a leading \n     role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global \n     burden of malaria, particularly through the President's \n     Malaria Initiative (referred to in this preamble as ``PMI'') \n     and the contribution of the United States to the Global Fund \n     to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through PMI, \n     the United States Agency for International Development, the \n     National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, the Department of Defense, and the \n     private sector focused on helping partner countries to \n     achieve major improvements in overall health outcomes through \n     advances in access to, and the quality of, healthcare \n     services in resource-poor settings; and\n       Whereas PMI, recognizing the burden of malaria on many \n     partner countries, has set a target of reducing the burden of \n     malaria by 50 percent for 450,000,000 people, representing 70 \n     percent of the at-risk population in Africa, by 2015: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day, \n     including the target of ending malaria deaths by 2015;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria \n     prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal \n     health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing \n     global malaria deaths and prevalence, particularly through \n     the efforts of the President's Malaria Initiative and the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       (4) strongly supports ongoing public-private partnerships \n     to research and develop more effective and affordable tools \n     for malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;\n       (5) recognizes the goals to combat malaria in the Tom \n     Lantos and Henry J.

All of these positions have \nalready expired, and without this legislation, upon retirement or \ndeparture of the judges in these positions, they could not be filled \nagain. Needlessly reducing the resources of our bankruptcy courts does \nnothing but put more pressure on Americans who are already navigating a \ndifficult economic environment. This legislation should help avoid that \nand provide some small degree of relief to overburdened bankruptcy \ncourts around the country. Quite frankly, I think we should be doing \nmore.\n  As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I will note one concern with \nthe legislation the Senate passes today. In order to secure passage of \nthis legislation, Senator Coburn insisted upon adding a section to the \nbill that purports to tell future Senate and House Judiciary Committees \nhow to conduct their business. Senator Coburn's amendment would dictate \nthat before any of these 30 judgeships could be reauthorized again, the \nSenate and House Judiciary Committee's would be required to take \ncertain steps and require a report from the Administrative Office of \nthe United States Courts (AO). As a member of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Coburn knows this is precisely what committees do in the \nordinary course of the consideration of legislation, and what was done \nduring the development of this legislation. Senator Coons worked with \nthe AO, which made recommendations, and with bankruptcy judges in a \nvariety of districts to determine where need was greatest. To codify an \nunenforceable mandate nominally imposed on future Congresses is \nunnecessary and unwise.\n  I thank and congratulate Senator Coons for his hard work and \nattention to this issue. This would not be passing without his \ndiligence, focus, and legislative skill. He has done what has seemed \nimpossible.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that a Coons amendment, which is at \nthe desk, be agreed to, the bill as amended be read a third time and \npassed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements related to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2084) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2084\n\n     (Purpose: To address bankruptcy filing fee increases, future \n               reauthorizations, and for other purposes)\n\n       Strike section 3 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3.
