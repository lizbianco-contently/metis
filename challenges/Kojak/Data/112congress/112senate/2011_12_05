Mr. President, last week, my friend the Republican leader \ntried to convince us that Republicans realize it would be disastrous to \nraise taxes on the middle class. Here on the Senate floor, he quoted \nhalf a dozen news reports as evidence that the Senate Republicans \nsupport an extension of payroll cuts for 160 million American workers. \nI said at that time I was skeptical the Republicans support this tax \ncut. It turns out I was right. Last Thursday the Republicans shot down \nthe Democrats' proposal to cut taxes for middle-class Americans, \nsupposedly on the grounds it raised taxes on the richest of the rich. \nBut a few minutes later the Republicans also shot down their own \nproposal--one they had placed on the Senate floor--to expand the \npayroll tax cuts even though it was paid for with their own hand-picked \nreductions in government spending. Well, they shot that down. They only \ngot 19 votes plus the vote of the cosponsor.\n  Whatever my friend Senator McConnell may say, it is obvious that the \nRepublicans are not interested in preventing a $1,000 tax increase on \nnearly every family in the Nation from taking effect on January 1. \nDemocrats will not relent on keeping taxes low for the middle class.\n  Today Senator Casey will unveil a modified version of the proposed \npayroll tax cut that he introduced last week. Like our previous \nproposal, it will cut back taxes for 160 million American workers. That \nis 160 million workers, including 1.2 million Nevadans. This proposal \nwill allow the average family to keep $1,500 to spend on necessities \nnext year. Like our previous proposal, it will be fully paid for with a \nmixture of spending cuts that Republicans have already agreed to and a \ntiny surtax on the top .2 percent of Americans. Every spending \nreduction was agreed to by a bicameral group of Republicans in the \nsupercommittee, so we know they support these cuts--or they should \nsupport these cuts. In an effort to make our proposal more palpable to \nRepublicans, we conceded significantly to cut the tax on income above \n$1 million and make it temporary.\n  Democrats know how important extending and expanding the payroll tax \ncut is to working families. It is also important to our economy. \nEconomists of every political persuasion agree that if Republicans \nblock this proposal--raising taxes on American families by\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\n$1,000 next month--it will have an immediate negative impact on our \neconomy. It will halt our still fragile recovery in its tracks and drag \nus back into a recession.\n  We all know Congress cannot afford to play chicken with the economy. \nThat is why Democrats are committed to passing the tax cut. Republicans \nneed to be prepared to meet us part way. We are offering a serious \nproposal with meaningful concessions, including spending cuts to which \nRepublicans have already agreed.\n  The scaled-back, temporary tax on the very richest Americans--a group \nwith an average income of $3 million a year--is also an attempt to get \nRepublicans onboard to pass what they say they want to do. We know a \nfew of them said publicly that they are open to asking millionaires and \nbillionaires to contribute to our economic recovery. I was happy to see \nthose press reports. I hope we have the courage to vote accordingly, as \none Republican did last Thursday. One Republican voted the right way.\n  I repeat, this is a serious proposal and the Republicans should take \nit seriously. Here is why: Americans, regardless of political \naffiliation, say they wholeheartedly support the Democrats' plan to cut \ntaxes for middle-class families. Fifty-eight percent of Republicans \nagree we should extend payroll tax cuts for 160 million American \nworkers. Further, Americans overwhelmingly support our proposal to have \nmillionaires and billionaires pay their fair share to help this \ncountry. Americans from every corner of the country agree. Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents agree. When asked if they support a plan \nthat would require people making more than $1 million to contribute a \nlittle more to ensure this country's economic success, the results were \ndecisive: 75 percent, or three-quarters of Americans, said yes. Wealthy \nAmericans agree. Two-thirds of people making more than $1 million said \nthey would gladly contribute more. A supermajority of Republicans \nagrees, with two-thirds supporting the idea. Even a majority of 52 \npercent of members of the tea party agree. It seems the only place in \nthe country they cannot find a majority of Republicans willing to speak \nup for sacrifice are Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Republicans across \nthe country support our plan and the way to pay for it. Republicans in \nCongress dismiss it at their peril. I repeat, Republicans dismiss this \nat their peril. The American people are watching what my Republican \ncolleagues will do.\n  Mr. President, will the Acting President pro tempore be so kind as to \nintroduce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/05/senate-section/article/S8162-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Last week, AOL Defense published an interview with VADM \nDavid J. Venlet, who heads up the Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter \nProgram for the Department of Defense. In this interview, Admiral \nVenlet candidly offered his concerns about where the Joint Strike \nFighter Program stands today. His professional judgment, while welcome \nin its forthrightness, is deeply troubling. His concerns, which I \nshare, are what bring me to the floor this afternoon.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of \nAdmiral Venlet's remarks as contained in the AOL Defense article \nentitled ``JSF's Build and Test Was `Miscalculation,' Adm. Venlet Says; \nProduction Must Slow.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From AOL Defense, Dec. 1, 2011]\n\nJSF's Build and Test Was `Miscalculation,' Adm. Venlet Says; Production \n                               Must Slow\n\n                          (By Richard Whittle)\n\n       Washington.--Fatigue testing and analysis are turning up so \n     many potential cracks and ``hot spots'' in the Joint Strike \n     Fighter's airframe that the production rate of the F-35 \n     should be slowed further over the next few years, the \n     program's head declared in an interview.\n       ``The analyzed hot spots that have arisen in the last 12 \n     months or so in the program have surprised us at the amount \n     of change and at the cost,'' Vice Adm. David Venlet said in \n     an interview at his office near the Pentagon. ``Most of them \n     are little ones, but when you bundle them all up and package \n     them and look at where they are in the airplane and how hard \n     they are to get at after you buy the jet, the cost burden of \n     that is what sucks the wind out of your lungs. I believe it's \n     wise to sort of temper production for a while here until we \n     get some of these heavy years of learning under our belt and \n     get that managed right. And then when we've got most of that \n     known and we've got the management of the change activity \n     better in hand, then we will be in a better position to ramp \n     up production.''\n       Venlet also took aim at a fundamental assumption of the JSF \n     business model: concurrency. The JSF program was originally \n     structured with a high rate of concurrency--building \n     production model aircraft while finishing ground and flight \n     testing--that assumed less change than is proving necessary.\n       ``Fundamentally, that was a miscalculation,'' Venlet said. \n     'You'd like to take the keys to your shiny new jet and give \n     it to the fleet with all the capability and all the service \n     life they want. What we're doing is, we're taking the keys to \n     the shiny new jet, giving it to the fleet and saying, `Give \n     me that jet back in the first year. I've got to go take it up \n     to this depot for a couple of months and tear into it and put \n     in some structural mods, because if I don't, we're not going \n     to be able to fly it more than a couple, three, four, five \n     years.' That's what concurrency is doing to us.'' But he \n     added: ``I have the duty to navigate this program through \n     concurrency. I don't have the luxury to stand on the pulpit \n     and criticize and say how much I dislike it and wish we \n     didn't have it. My duty is to help us navigate through it.''\n       Lockheed Martin, prime contractor on the Pentagon's biggest \n     program, has been pushing hard to increase the production \n     rate, arguing its production line is ready and it has reduced \n     problems on the line to speed things up. Speeding up \n     production, of course, would boost economies of scale and \n     help lower the politically sensitive price per plane.\n       But slowing production would help reduce the cost of \n     replacing parts in jets that are being built before testing \n     is complete, Venlet said. Although fatigue testing has barely \n     begun--along with ``refined analysis''--it's already turned \n     up enough parts that need to be redesigned and replaced in \n     jets already built that the changes may add $3 million to $5 \n     million to each plane's cost.\n       The price of the F-35, being built by Lockheed Martin Corp. \n     in three variants, has averaged roughly $111 million under \n     the most recent Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Lot 4 \n     contract.\n       The required changes to the aircraft aren't a matter of \n     safety or of the F-35's ability to perform its missions, \n     Venlet said. They're necessary, though, to make sure the \n     plane's structural parts last the 8,000 hours of service life \n     required. Nor are the weaknesses surprising in the world of \n     fighter jets, he added. The discoveries are ``not a quote \n     `problem with the airplane,' '' Venlet said. ``It's a fighter \n     made out of metal and composites. You always find some hot \n     spots and cracks and you have to go make fixes. That's \n     normal. This airplane was maybe thought to be a little bit \n     better, wouldn't have so much discovery. Well, no. It's more \n     like standard fighters.''\n       Venlet declined to say how much he thinks production should \n     be slowed. Earlier plans called for the Pentagon to order 42 \n     F-35s in fiscal 2011, but that was cut to 35 and more \n     recently it was dropped to 30. Previous plans, which Venlet's \n     comments and the unprecedented pressure to cut the defense \n     budget make clear will change, had been to ramp up orders to \n     32 in fiscal 2012, 42 in fiscal 2013, 62 in fiscal 2014, 81 \n     in fiscal 2015 and 108 in fiscal 2016 before jumping to more \n     than 200 a year after fundamental fatigue and flight testing \n     is done.\n       Officially the ``Lightning II,'' the F-35 is a stealthy \n     attack jet Lockheed is building with major subcontractors \n     Northrop Grumman Corp. and BAE Systems for the Air Force, \n     Navy, Marine Corps and II allied nations. There is a \n     conventional take off and landing (CTOL) version, an aircraft \n     carrier-suitable (CV) model and a short takeoff/vertical \n     landing (STOVL) jump jet that hovers and lands much like a \n     helicopter. The U.S. services alone are scheduled to buy \n     2,443 to replace a variety of older fighters, making the $379 \n     billion program the Pentagon's largest.\n       Venlet's comments address a key issue in negotiations \n     between the government and\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n     Lockheed for the next contract, LRIP 5. The government paid \n     for design changes and retrofits through the first four lots, \n     but Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall issued a memo in \n     August requiring Lockheed to bear a ``reasonable'' share of \n     such costs in LRIP 5. Lockheed complained last month that the \n     government was refusing to reimburse it for parts the company \n     was buying in advance for LRIP 5 aircraft as the price and \n     terms of that next production contract are negotiated.\n       ``We negotiated the LRIP 4 contract with a certain amount \n     of resources considered to pay for concurrent changes,'' \n     Venlet said. ``We were probably off on the low side by a \n     factor of four. Maybe five. And we've discovered that in this \n     calendar year, '11, and it's basically sucked the wind out of \n     our lungs with the burden, the financial burden.'' On top of \n     that, he added, the cost of concurrency changes figures to \n     grow as more testing is done--one reason it's important to \n     slow production rather than testing.\n       ``Slowing down the test program would be probably the most \n     damaging thing anybody could do to the program,'' Venlet \n     said. ``The test program must proceed as fast as possible.''\n       Flight testing of the F-35, though going extremely well \n     lately, is only 18 percent complete, Venlet said. As of Nov. \n     29, 1,364 test flights had been flown--896 of them in the \n     past 10 months, despite two stoppages of a couple of weeks \n     each to fix problems found by flying. Under a new program \n     baseline created after the JSF project breached cost limits \n     under the Nunn-McCurdy law, about 7,700 hours of flight tests \n     are planned. ``That's a lot,'' Venlet said, adding that \n     number will grow if more problems are found.\n       Fatigue testing has barely begun, Venlet said. The CTOL \n     variant's fatigue testing is about 20 percent complete; the \n     CV variant has not started yet. For the STOVL variant, \n     fatigue testing was halted at 6 percent last year and has not \n     resumed after a crack in a large bulkhead in the wing was \n     found, requiring a major redesign of that part.\n       That bulkhead crack was one of five discoveries in the F-\n     35B that required engineering changes, one reason former \n     Defense Secretary Robert Gates placed it on ``probation'' \n     last January and said the Marine's plane should be canceled \n     if the problems weren't solved within two years. Venlet \n     repeated earlier statements that he was sure the changes \n     needed to take care of the problems are now in place, though \n     he wants to await final testing of them this winter before \n     saying it's time for the jump jet to come off of probation.\n       After discovering the bulkhead crack in the B variant last \n     year, Venlet explained, ``We said, `Well, where else do we \n     need to look?' The fallout of that additional analysis has \n     revealed additional spots that (may fail in) less than 8,000 \n     hours of service life. We call them `analyzed low-life hot \n     spots.' '' In other words, he said, engineering analysis \n     indicates those spots ``are going to crack'' well before the \n     parts in question have flown 8,000 hours.\n       ``The question for me is not: `F-35 or not?' '' Venlet \n     said. ``The question is, how many and how fast? I'm not \n     questioning the ultimate inventory numbers, I'm questioning \n     the pace that we ramp up production for us and the partners, \n     and can we afford it?''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will briefly summarize the history of \nthe Joint Strike Fighter Program that has taken us where we are today.\n  In a nutshell, the Joint Strike Fighter Program has been both a \nscandal and a tragedy. The JSF Program has been in the development \nphase for 10 years. Over that time, it has been the beneficiary of an \nestimated $56 billion of taxpayer investment. Yet after so much time \nand so great an investment by the taxpayers, we still don't have an \naircraft that provides the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps with the \ncombat capability they need. In fact, flight testing sufficient to \ndemonstrate the full mission systems and weapons delivery capability of \nF-35 aircraft has not even started. At this point, this most advanced \nphase of flight testing won't begin any sooner than 2015.\n  Developing and buying these aircraft and building the facilities to \nsupport them was originally supposed to cost $233 billion. However, \naccording to the April 2011 Government Accountability Office report on \nthe Joint Strike Fighter, these costs are now estimated to be closer to \n$383 billion. Let me repeat that. The original cost was estimated to be \n$233 billion. Now it is estimated to be $383 billion. That is an \nincrease of some $150 billion of the taxpayers' money. This increase in \ntotal development and acquisition costs will only get worse when the \nDepartment announces a new baseline cost estimate, which resulted from \na second restructuring of the program over the last 2 years.\n  Overall, the schedule for the end of the development phase and start \nof full-rate production has slipped 5 years since the current baseline \nwas set in 2007, and it is now planned for 2018. I want to point out \nthat during this period of time, the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, has \ncontinued to make record profits. In fact, they just announced their \nthird-quarter profits to be $700 million. Here is the manufacturer that \nwas supposed to build an aircraft that was going to cost $233 billion, \nand now it is estimated at close to $383 billion--a $150 billion \nincrease--and it is well known now that there will be significant cost \nincreases to follow in light of the production manager, Admiral \nVenlet's remarks.\n  In 2001, 10 years ago, the Department of Defense told Congress that \nthe Joint Strike Fighter would cost about $69 million per aircraft. But \naccording to the GAO's report from April, the cost of each F-35 \naircraft has now risen to about $133 million per plane. Including the \ncost of research, development, and testing across the entire program, \nthe unit cost of each individual aircraft goes up to $156 million. In \ninflation-adjusted dollars, that is about double the original 2001 \nestimate. Unfortunately, we know that the estimate will go up \nsubstantially when the Pentagon releases its latest projections, with \nthe costs of restructuring the program factored in and a new cost \nbaseline is established for the program.\n  As if these costs of developing and buying the aircraft were not high \nenough, the Pentagon now estimates that operating and sustaining these \nnew aircraft may cost as much as $1 trillion over their planned service \nlife. Thankfully, I think we have reason to believe this jaw-dropping \nnumber may be artificially high and can be reduced. But keep in mind \nthat the rule of thumb is that the cost of developing and buying a \nmajor weapons system tends to be about one-third of its total cost; the \nother two-thirds is in operating and sustaining it. So with the \ndevelopment and procurement costs of the F-35 already approaching $400 \nbillion, it would not be unreasonable to expect sustainment costs of \nabout $800 billion over the F-35's lifespan. That amounts to about a \n$1.2 trillion investment of taxpayer resources, which makes the F-35 \nthe most expensive weapons program in history.\n  Over the nearly 10-year life, so far, of the F-35 program, Congress \nhas authorized and appropriated funds for 113 of these weapons systems, \nbut as of today the program has delivered just 18 aircraft, most of \nwhich are being used for flight testing. The first production aircraft \nintended for training just started to be delivered this summer--3 years \nlate.\n  In July, the numbers came in on how much these early production model \njets will cost compared to original estimates. That was a shocking $1 \nbillion over the original estimate of about $7 billion. Under the cost-\nplus contracts for these early production aircraft, taxpayers will be \non the hook for $771 million to cover their share of this cost overrun \nfor these first 28 aircraft. Let me repeat that taxpayers of America \nare now on the hook for $771 million in cost overruns to cover their \nshare for the first 28 aircraft, and Lockheed Martin will absorb the \ncost of $283 million. Maybe that helps you understand why Lockheed \nMartin, in the third quarter of this year, has been able to announce a \nprofit of some $700 million. The cost of the first 28 is a 15-percent \ncost overrun when you total everybody's share. So for about $8.1 \nbillion, we get 28 aircraft at a cost per aircraft of about $289 \nmillion.\n  Just last week, we learned that the costs associated with the fourth \nlot of these early production aircraft may be as high as 10 percent \nover that contract's $3.46 billion target cost. That is a $350 million \noverrun, with only about 40 percent of the work completed to date. That \ntells us that the costs of the program have still not been contained \ndespite 2 years of very concentrated effort by the Pentagon to bring \ncosts under control, knowing the future of the program hangs in the \nbalance.\n  This brings us to where we are today and the context of Admiral \nVenlet's remarks. The Pentagon has recently completed its analysis of \nhow much the next lot--the fifth lot--of early production aircraft \n``should cost'' and is negotiating with Lockheed Martin on who will \nbear the cost of changes to the design and manufacturing of the \naircraft that could result from thousands of hours of flight testing \nthat lie ahead.\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\n  It is at this exact moment that the excessive overlap between the \ndevelopment and production that was originally structured into the JSF \nProgram--called concurrency--is now coming home to roost. It means that \nyou deliver aircraft to the owners--in this case, the Air Force--and at \nthe same time continue testing. That is something we warned against \nover and over as not having worked, but it was done in order to make an \neffort to have some semblance of their schedule being adhered to of \ndelivery of aircraft. Lockheed Martin doesn't want to bear the risk of \nnew discoveries that may require retrofit or redesign of the aircraft.\n  Based on the in-depth studies the Department has conducted to date, \nAdmiral Venlet told the publication AOL Defense last week that the \nJoint Strike Fighter Program needs to slow down production and \ndeliveries of the aircraft. He explained that this was necessary to \nopen the aircraft and install fixes to numerous structural cracks and \n``hot spots'' the program has discovered in the plane in the last year \nor so. He estimated that the work needed to remedy these cracks could \nadd an additional $3 million to $5 million per aircraft.\n  Bear in mind that this revelation comes on top of the fact that the \nDepartment has just reduced the latest F-35 purchase--what will be lot \nfive--by five jets. Admiral Venlet concluded that even as the Pentagon \nnegotiates with Lockheed Martin on lot five of the aircraft under the \nterms of a fixed-price contract, there is much ``heavy learning'' that \nremains in the program.\n  Here is what Admiral Venlet said:\n\n       The analyzed hot spots that have arisen in the last 12 \n     months or so in the program have surprised us at the amount \n     of change and at the cost. Most of them are little ones, but \n     when you bundle them all up and package them and look at \n     where they are in the airplane and how hard they are to get \n     at after you buy the jet, the cost burden of that is what \n     sucks the wind out of your lungs. I believe it's wise to sort \n     of temper production for a while here until we get some of \n     these heavy years of learning under our belt and get that \n     managed right. And when we've got most of that known and \n     we've got the management of the change activity better in \n     hand, then we will be in a better position to ramp up \n     production.\n\n  Mr. President, 2001 was the year we decided to build this aircraft. \nSo here we are 11 years later, and the manager of the program says, \n``And when we've got most of that known and we've got the management of \nthe change activity better in hand, then we will be in a better \nposition to ramp up production.'' I am not making this up. Admiral \nVenlet, who overseas the JSF Program for the Pentagon, is basically \nsaying that even after the program was restructured 2 years ago by \nSecretary Gates to add $7.3 billion and 33 more months to development, \nthere is still too much concurrency baked into this program. In other \nwords, the overlap between development and production is still too \ngreat to assure taxpayers that they will not have to continue paying \nfor costly redesigns or retrofits due to discoveries made late in \nproduction. In that context, ramping up production--even under the \nprogram's revised schedule--would not be a move in the right direction. \nI absolutely agree.\n\n  When the head of the most expensive, highest profile weapons system \nprogram in U.S. history effectively says: Hold it, we need to slow down \nhow much we are buying, we should all pay close attention.\n  What does this mean in terms of the pending negotiations for the next \nproduction lot? As I said a few days ago during my opening remarks on \nSenate consideration of the fiscal year 2012 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, I strongly support the Department's position. I \nthink Admiral Venlet's concerns are completely consistent with the view \nreflected in the Senate Armed Services Committee's markup of the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  As we negotiate to buy more early production jets at a time when most \nof the developmental testing of the aircraft is yet to be done, \nLockheed Martin must be held increasingly accountable for cost overruns \nthat come as a result of wringing out necessary changes in the design \nand manufacturing process for this incredibly expensive weapons system. \nFor this reason, the Department must negotiate a fixed-price contract \nfor this next lot of aircraft that requires Lockheed Martin to assume \nfully any cost overruns. I expect that this contract negotiation will \nreflect unit costs that are lower than for the last lot purchased and \nthat the contract will ensure shared responsibility for reasonable \nconcurrency cost increases.\n  Put simply, the deal we negotiate on this next production lot must be \nat least as good, if not better, than the deal we negotiated under the \nprevious one; otherwise, I can only conclude that we are moving in the \nwrong direction, and it will only be a matter of time before the \nAmerican people and the Congress and our allies lose faith with the F-\n35 program, which is already the most expensive weapons program in \nhistory.\n  One thing is clear: The culprit is, among other things, excessive \nconcurrency, which is overlap of trying to develop an advance aircraft \nat the same time as we buy production model aircraft intended for \ntraining and operations. The danger of excessive concurrency is the \ngrand, enormously expensive lesson of the Joint Strike Fighter Program, \na lesson we continue to overlook at our peril: Trying to execute a \nstrategy for the acquisition of a major weapons system that has too \nmuch concurrency based into it under a cost-type contract is absolutely \na recipe for disaster.\n  In so many different aspects, the F-35 program truly represents a \ntragedy. The Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps desperately need a new \naircraft to take the place of the current strike and fighter jets that \nhave been at war for most of the last 10 years. These well-worn legacy \naircraft are coming to the end of their service lives, but we are \nsaddled with a program that has little to show for itself after 10 \nyears and $56 billion in taxpayer investment that has produced less \nthan 20 test and operational aircraft, a bill for $\\3/4\\ billion, and \nthe promise of considerable ``heavy learning'' yet to go.\n  Admiral Venlet's message last week clearly conveyed the path we are \non is neither affordable nor sustainable. On that fact he and I are in \ntotal agreement. But that agreement provides very little solace. If \nthings don't improve quickly, taxpayers and the warfighters will insist \nall options will be on the table, and they should be.\n  Mr. President, I came to the Senate floor today to talk specifically \nabout the F-35 aircraft. I will be coming to the floor again on the \nwhole issue of what is, unfortunately, a culture of corruption in the \nPentagon as far as weapon systems acquisition is concerned. Time after \ntime, with regard to the future combat system, the F-35, the \nshipbuilding, the littoral combat ship, there is story after story \nafter story of cost overruns, of cancellation, of delays, of incredible \ncost to the taxpayer. We never should have gotten into it. We simply \ncannot afford to do it now. We have to reform the culture of corruption \nthat pervades the Pentagon, and we must reform the way we acquire the \nweapons and the systems necessary to defend this Nation.\n  I am not saying there aren't success stories. Certainly, there are. \nMRAP is an example of a success story. But when we look at the tens of \nbillions and billions of dollars that have been wasted on research and \ndevelopment on weapons systems that never got off the ground, when we \nlook at what happened to the future combat systems, the littoral combat \nship, now the F-35, there must be reform or the taxpayers and citizens \nof America will lose faith in our ability to defend this Nation at a \ncost that is reasonable in these extremely difficult economic times for \nall Americans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the reason I wish to speak is because there \nis a lot\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\nof confusion around something called the payroll tax holiday. It is \nlegislation that is likely to be acted upon by the Congress and perhaps \na bill will be sent to the President before the end of this year. It is \nsomething the President is pushing very strongly to try to achieve. \nThere are a lot of different versions of it and a lot of confusing \nideas about what people support and what they do not. I wish to talk a \nlittle bit about that.\n  First of all, what is it? The payroll tax is the tax that funds \nSocial Security. It is a tax that is paid on the employee's wages. Half \nof that is paid by the employee, half of it is paid by the employer. \nFrom the employee's standpoint, the more they pay in, the more they get \nout when they retire; the less they pay in, the less they get out. That \nis what funds Social Security.\n  There is a question: Why would someone not support a reduction in the \npayroll tax--or as it is called right now a temporary payroll tax \nholiday because what is being proposed is that a portion of that tax \nwould not be paid. It represents one-third the amount of the tax an \nemployee would ordinarily be paying that is not being paid today. The \nPresident would actually like to cut that to the point that an employee \nwould only pay half the payroll tax liability. I understand he is going \nto revise his proposal and not ask there be any relief on the \nemployer's side. What the President, therefore, is asking is that half \nof what an employee pays--or 3.1 percent of payroll--not be paid for 1 \nmore year.\n  The first reason one should think carefully about extending this \nholiday is that, as I said, this is what funds Social Security. For an \nemployee, the less they pay in, the less they are going to get out. If \nyou are OK with that, then think about the program writ large. Social \nSecurity is in big financial trouble. We all know that. As a result, \nthe less we put into it, then the less money there is to pay benefits \nfor people who are on retirement.\n  What is happening with this particular shortfall is that we are \npaying for it out of general revenues. What is happening is, since we \nborrow 40 cents out of every $1 we spend in this country, we are going \nto go someplace, such as to the Chinese, for example, and we are going \nto borrow the money. Out of $1 that we want to spend, we are going to \nborrow 40 cents of that, and then we are going to put that money into \nthe Social Security trust fund that is immediately going to be paid to \nsomebody who is on Social Security.\n  What is the problem with that? Severalfold. First of all, as we said, \nthe amount of money we put through the payroll tax into Social Security \nis what we are going to get back. If we put less in, we are going to \nget less back.\n  Second, because Social Security is already broke, that means the \nUnited States has to borrow the money to put back into Social Security \nin order to keep it going. When we do that, then there is less money in \ngeneral revenues to pay for other things. So, yes, our general tax \nrevenues and borrowing can make up for that difference in the payroll \ntax that is not being paid in now, but that means there is that amount \nof money less available for education benefits or agriculture or the \nDefense Department or whatever else we might be wanting to spend the \nmoney on. The fact is, if we are going to spend the same amount of \nmoney as the Federal Government and now we are increasing the amount we \nhave to spend on Social Security, there is less to spend elsewhere.\n  I find it ironic that our Democratic friends in particular would \nthink this is a good idea. I ran across something from the AARP, back \nin 2010. I wish to quote from it. This is a press release dated just \nabout exactly 1 year ago, December 7, 2010, by Thomas Bethell. The \nsubject is ``What the Payroll Tax Cut Means for Social Security.'' He \nquotes Nancy Altman, who is codirector for Social Security Works, \nwhich, as he said, describes ``a worst-case scenario.''\n\n       She thinks the cut could well become permanent.\n       If that happens, Social Security's long-term shortfall \n     could double over 75 years, she says, and political pressure \n     to downsize the program could mount. That could lead to \n     converting Social Security from a universal insurance program \n     to a welfare program, with the numerous drawbacks of programs \n     for the poor, including low public support.\n       If this scenario unfolds, says Altman, ``it's good-bye, \n     Social Security.''\n\n  His conclusion is ``there is little doubt that reducing the payroll \ntax carries a risk.''\n  That is the first reason I think one should be very careful about \ndeciding that since tax cuts are usually appreciated by people, \ntherefore, this is one we should extend, even though it is just \ntemporary.\n  That brings up the second point. It can be argued this is very bad \neconomic policy. There is no evidence this temporary tax cut has \nactually produced any new jobs, which is the whole idea. In fact, our \neconomy has decelerated. In 2010, we had a 2.8-percent GDP growth. We \nare now down to just over 1 percent. Unemployment remains stubbornly \nhigh. In fact, I thought I would quote from a commentary of Ed \nGillespie on ``FOX News Sunday.'' Yesterday, he was asked a question by \nChris Wallace about the payroll tax.\n\n       First of all, 50,000 of those jobs--\n\n  Meaning the jobs that have been created now in the economy over the \nlast month--\n\n       50,000 of those jobs are retail jobs that likely could be \n     temporary for the holiday season. On top of that, for every \n     two people who found a new job, five people left the \n     workforce entirely, which is part of a continuing pattern.\n       In fact, if the labor force today were the same size it was \n     when President Obama took office, the unemployment rate would \n     be 11 percent. So, shrinking the labor force is not the right \n     way to bring down the unemployment rate. . . .\n\n  The point is, a lot of people have stopped looking for jobs. That is \none reason why the unemployment rate actually went down. There are \nplenty of economists who will tell us reducing the payroll tax is not a \ngood way to create jobs. I am going to quote from three or four.\n\n       As taxes go, the payroll tax is a big revenue raiser and \n     one of the least damaging to work incentives. So cutting it \n     is a poor choice if jobs are the objective.\n\n  Arthur Laffer, economist, in the National Review, the last day of \nOctober this year.\n  Troy Davig, an economist with Barclays Capital, Reuters:\n\n       Hiring is a long-term contract and this is a short-term \n     stimulus.\n\n  Meaning the temporary payroll tax holiday.\n  Neil Dutta, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says:\n\n       Nothing that's likely to get done--with regard to the \n     payroll tax--is going to have a meaningful impact in terms of \n     lowering the unemployment rate and creating jobs.\n\n  Bruce Bartlett, in the New York Times, is quoted in August of this \nyear:\n\n       There is no evidence that the lower payroll tax has done \n     much of anything to stimulate either spending or hiring.\n\n  In the New York Post, by Andrew Biggs, some time ago now:\n\n       The payroll-tax holiday is a dubious \n     idea. . . .\n\n  Finally, Charles Blahous, who is a real expert on Social Security and \nan economic research fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution, says:\n\n       Taking real tax revenue away from Social Security and \n     issuing debt in its place--the policy now in effect--is the \n     worst of all worlds, both for the program and for the budget.\n\n  It does not stimulate the economy, doesn't produce jobs, and it \ncreates a budgetary problem for Social Security itself.\n  I also believe, the third point is, it can be bad tax policy. I note \nfrom a Wall Street Journal editorial, dated December 2--here is the \nbeginning of it:\n\n       So here's the latest Democratic job growth plan: Pay for a \n     temporary tax cut that has already proven not to create jobs \n     with a permanent tax increase that almost certainly will cost \n     jobs.\n       That's the essence of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's \n     plan to finance a one-year payroll tax cut with a 3.25 \n     percent tax surcharge on upper-income Americans that would \n     last for at least 10 years. I understand now they are \n     thinking about revising that for this exact reason, but \n     that is the point. The surtax is, in reality, a new tax \n     that primarily hits small business owners. They are the \n     ones who create the jobs. Almost all of the new net jobs \n     created since the 1980s are in small businesses. They \n     create about 70 percent of the new jobs, most of them \n     coming out of the recessionary time we are in.\n\n  And what does Treasury say about the people who would be hit by this \nsurtax? Treasury estimates 392,000 returns have an income over $1 \nmillion,\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\nand of that 311,000 are classified as business owners. So about 80 \npercent of the people who would get hit by this surtax are the very job \ncreators we are hoping will invest their money into their businesses to \nhelp the economy and to create new jobs. How do you create new jobs by \ntaking more earnings away from the very employers who are creating the \njobs? So, third, it is bad tax policy.\n  Fourth, Democrats argue: Well, the wealthy are not paying their fair \nshare, and this too is something that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. \nThese are from the Internal Revenue Service. These are their tables. \nThe top earners pay the bulk of the taxes in this country. In fact, we \nhave the most progressive income tax system of all of the \nindustrialized countries--all of the countries in the OECD. The top 1 \npercent in our country earns 20 percent of all the income--that is \npretty good--but they pay 38 percent of all of the income taxes. The \ntop 2 percent earns about 28 percent of the total income. They pay over \n48 percent--almost 50 percent. They pay almost half of all of the \nincome taxes that are paid by the top 2 percent.\n  Some people say: Well, what about the payroll tax? That is exactly \nwhat we are cutting here. Remember? That is what they are getting a tax \nholiday from paying. So you have the top 2 percent of the people paying \n50 percent of the taxes.\n  What do the bottom half pay? It turns out the Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimates that 51 percent of all households had either zero or \nnegative income liability for the tax year 2009. So you have 2 percent \nof the people paying 50 percent and the bottom 50 percent paying none. \nIn fact, the top 5 percent pays a whole lot more than the bottom 95 \npercent combined. Think of that. In our country the top 5 percent of \nthe earners pay a lot more than the bottom 95 percent combined.\n  Then the question is: Is it fair to say about the United States \nprogressive income tax code that the wealthy don't pay their ``fair \nshare'' when the top 1 percent pays 38 percent, the top 2 percent pays \nalmost half of all the taxes? I think that is a canard. I am not trying \nto defend rich people here, but what I am saying is it is unfair to say \nthey are not paying their fair share.\n  Finally, my colleague Dick Durbin--who I believe is going to be here \nshortly, and I hope will respond to what I am saying here--was \ninterviewed on MSNBC on November 30. He said something that in \nretrospect I suspect he would say is inaccurate and would take back, \nbut I want to quote him. He is talking about the payroll tax holiday \nand he said:\n\n       Jon Kyl rejected it. He said, no. There's no way we're \n     going to impose any taxes on the wealthy people in this \n     country.\n\n  Well, of course, Senator Durbin knows that we impose a lot of taxes \non the wealthy people in this country. He simply misspoke. I understand \nhe simply misspoke, but it is a manifestation of the political dialogue \nhere of one side accusing the other of favoring the rich over the poor. \nCan't we ask them to contribute a little bit more? Well, if it is the \nIRS, we are not asking them, we are forcing them. When the top 2 \npercent of all of our citizens pays half of all of the taxes and the \nbottom half pays none, when the top 5 percent pays 95 percent of all of \nthe taxes and 95 percent pays the rest, it is hard to say the rich are \nnot paying taxes.\n  In any event, my colleague Senator Durbin, I am sure, would \nacknowledge that I have not said nor has anyone said, ``There is no way \nwe are going to impose any taxes on the wealthy people in this \ncountry.'' They are paying a lot of taxes.\n  Finally, we extended this tax cut holiday for 1 year a year ago in \nDecember. We did that as part of an overall budget deal. The Vice \nPresident of the United States, the leaders of the House and Senate \nnegotiated this and the President went along with it. It was part of an \noverall agreement in which we said we will extend all of the existing \ntax rates, the so-called Bush tax cuts, that is, the rates that have \nbeen in effect since 2001 and 2003. We said we would extend this \ntemporary tax holiday from the payroll tax cut. We would extend all of \nthose. I supported that.\n  Frankly, that was the right thing to do, to extend all of these \nexisting rates. The country at that point could not have stood an \nincrease in taxes of over $4 trillion, which is what it would have been \nnot to extend the so-called Bush tax cuts. If we can do that again, I \nam all for it. I will support the extension of the payroll tax holiday. \nI will support the extension of the payroll tax holiday with other \nthings being done as well. The point is there are times when it \nabsolutely does not make any sense and there are times when it could \nmake sense.\n  But because of the four other reasons I pointed out, this is what \npays for Social Security benefits, it is bad economic policy, it is bad \ntax policy, and certainly the surtax that would fund this is something \nthat would very much hurt small businesses and job creation. Those are \nreasons to be very skeptical about continuing this supposedly temporary \ntax holiday, and we should therefore only do it under circumstances \nthat, in effect, override these objections, one of which would be to \nextend all of the taxes that expire at the end of next year--at the end \nof 2012, and to include this in them. That would be a good idea. It is \nalso a good idea to ``pay for'' it; that is, to find an offset for the \nrevenue loss here because we cannot leave Social Security holding the \nbag. When we borrow 40 cents of every dollar in general revenue to pay \nfor this lost revenue, obviously, that is not a good idea. So if we can \nfind offsets for it, that is another factor in deciding whether to do \nit. I believe Republicans will work to find offsets if we, in fact, are \ngoing to extend this payroll tax holiday.\n  Clearly, you don't necessarily need to find offsets to pay for any \ntax or every tax reduction. We are keeping current rates where they \nare, for example, when they otherwise would expire at the end of next \nyear. Some people say: Well, that is the Bush tax cuts. That is right. \nDid revenues to the Treasury go down when the Bush tax rates were \nreduced in 2001 and 2003? No. Tax revenues--the amount of money coming \ninto the Treasury of the United States--actually increased after the \nso-called Bush tax cuts. So sometimes, for economic growth reasons, \nkeeping taxes where they are or even reducing them in some cases makes \na lot of sense. In this case, however, because you are having to take \nit out of the Social Security trust fund, you need to replenish that \nmoney, you need to pay for it, and that is why we need to have the \noffsets I spoke of.\n  The bottom line is the payroll tax cut holiday can be a little \nconfusing. There are some very important reasons not to do this again. \nIt doesn't produce a good result and it can produce some bad results. \nIf there are offsetting policies that more than overcome these bad \nfeatures, then it is something I think a lot of Republicans will look \nto. As I said a year ago, I was willing to support the extension of it \nbecause we extended the other tax rates as well. If we do that again, \nobviously, it is something I would be supportive of.\n  I hope this helps to clarify the debate when we deal with this \nsubject later on this week and perhaps even in the final week--that we \nat least hope is the final week we are here--before Christmas.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nominations of Edgardo Ramos, of Connecticut, \nto be United States District Judge for the Southern District of New \nYork; Andrew L. Carter, Jr., of New York, to be United States District \nJudge for the Southern District of New York; James Rodney Gilstrap, of \nTexas, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District of \nTexas; and Dana L. Christensen, of Montana, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Today the Senate will finally consider nominations to fill \nfour vacancies on Federal district courts, all of which were reported \nby the Judiciary Committee unanimously in September and early October. \nAll four nominees Edgardo Ramos and Andrew Carter, nominated to the \nSouthern District of New York, James Rodney Gilstrap, nominated to fill \na judicial emergency vacancy in the Eastern District of Texas, and Dana \nChristensen, nominated to the District of Montana are superbly \nqualified nominees with the strong support of their home state \nSenators. It should not have taken three months or more for the Senate \nto vote on their nominations.\n  I thank the Majority Leader for securing a vote on these nominations, \nbut I am disappointed that the Senate Republican leadership would not \nagree to a vote on the nomination of Jesse Furman to fill a third \nvacancy on the Southern District of New York. Like Edgardo Ramos, \nAndrew Carter and James Gilstrap, his nomination was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee on September 15 without opposition from a single \nmember of the Committee, Democratic or Republican. Mr. Furman, an \nexperienced Federal prosecutor who served as Counselor to Attorney \nGeneral Michael Mukasey for two years during the Bush Administration, \nis a nominee with an impressive background and bipartisan support. \nThere is no reason or explanation for why the Senate could not also \nconsider his nomination today.\n  There is also no reason or explanation why Republican leadership will \nnot consent to consider the other 20 judicial nominations waiting for \nfinal Senate action, all but four of which were reported by the \nCommittee without any opposition, all but two of them with significant \nbipartisan support. Senator Grassley and I have worked together to \nensure that each of the 25 nominations now on the Senate Calendar was \nfully considered by the Judiciary Committee after a thorough, fair \nprocess, including completing our extensive questionnaire and \nquestioning at a hearing. Before each of these nominees was selected by \nthe President, the White House worked with the nominees' home state \nSenators who support them, the FBI completed an extensive background \nreview, and each nominee was peer reviewed by the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. When the \nnominations have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee \nafter this extensive and thorough process, there is no reason for \nmonths and months of further delay before they can start serving the \nAmerican people.\n  It is now December 5, with only weeks left in the Senate's 2011 \nsession. I am concerned that we are not able to move more quickly at a \ntime when we continue to hear from chief judges around the country \nabout the overburdened courts in their districts and circuits. We need \nto consider at least eight judges every week in order to begin to catch \nup and erase the backlog that has developed from the delays in the \nconsideration of consensus nominees caused by the Senate Republican \nleadership.\n  We should not repeat the mistakes of last year, when the Senate \nRepublican leadership refused to consent to consider 19 judicial \nnominations reported by the Judiciary Committee, an exercise in \nunnecessary delay I believe to be without precedent with respect to \nsuch consensus nominees. It took us until June of this year, halfway \ninto 2011, to consider and confirm 17 of these nominations that could \nand should have been considered before the end of 2010. Before we \nadjourn this year, there is certainly no reason the Senate cannot at \nleast consider the 17 judicial nominations reported unanimously by the \nCommittee this session, who are by any measure consensus nominees.\n  I hope that we do not see a repeat of the damaging decision by Senate \nRepublican leadership at the end of last year to refuse to agree to \nvotes on those nominations. That decision stood in stark contrast to \nthe practice followed by the Democratic majority in the Senate during \nPresident Bush's first two years. Last year, Senate Republicans refused \nto use the same standards for considering President Obama's judicial \nnominees as we did when the Senate gave up or down votes to all 100 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominations reported by the Committee in his \nfirst two years. All 100 were confirmed before the end of the 107th \nCongress, including two controversial circuit court nominations \nreported and then confirmed during the lame duck session in 2002. The \nSenate last year should not have been forced to adjourn with 19 \njudicial nominations still on the Senate calendar.\n  With vacancies continuing at harmfully high levels, we cannot afford \nto repeat these unnecessary and damaging delays. There is no reason we \ncannot make significant progress this month and consider all of the \nconsensus nominations now pending on the Senate calendar. That is what \nwe did at the end of President Reagan's third year in office and \nPresident George H.W. Bush's third year in office, when no judicial \nnominations were left pending on the Senate Calendar. That is what we \ndid at the end of the 1995 session, President Clinton's third year in \noffice, when only a single nomination was left pending on the Senate \ncalendar. That is also what we did at the end of President George W. \nBush's third year, when seven of the nine judicial nominations left on \nthe calendar by the Senate's Republican majority were among President \nBush's most extreme ideological picks and had previously been debated \nextensively by the Senate. The standard has been that noncontroversial \njudicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee get Senate action \nbefore the end of the year. That is the standard we should follow this \nyear.\n  We remain well behind the pace set by the Senate during President \nBush's first term. By the end of his first term, the Senate had \nconfirmed 205 district and circuit nominees, and had already confirmed \n167 by this point in his third year. So far, the Senate has confirmed \nonly 119 of President Obama's district and circuit nominees. Senate \naction before adjournment on all 25 judicial nominations that are \nbefore the Senate today would go a long way to help resolve the \nlongstanding judicial vacancies that are delaying justice for so many \nAmericans in our Federal courts across the country.\n  The 100 circuit and district court nominations we confirmed in \nPresident Bush's first two years leading to a vacancy total of 60 at \nthe beginning of his third year is almost a complete reverse of the 60 \nthe Senate was allowed to confirm in President Obama's first two years, \nleading to nearly 100 vacancies at the start of 2011. Yet, even \nfollowing those years of real progress, in 2003 we\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\nproceeded to confirm more judicial nominations than there were \nvacancies at the start of that year, and reduced vacancies even \nfurther, down to 5 percent, half of where they stand today.\n\n  Chief Justice Roberts, the Attorney General and the White House \ncounsel have all spoken about the serious problems created by \npersistent judicial vacancies. More than half of all Americans over 167 \nmillion live in districts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that \ncould be filled today if Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on the \nnominations now pending on the Senate calendar. As many as 23 states \nare served by Federal courts with vacancies that would be filled by \nthese nominations. Millions of Americans across the country are harmed \nby delays in overburdened courts. The Republican leadership should \nconsent to vote on the qualified, consensus candidates nominated to \nfill these extended judicial vacancies before we adjourn for the year \nand not unnecessarily delay their consideration until next spring.\n  The four nominees we consider today will all be confirmed, I expect, \nwith significant bipartisan support. Edgardo Ramos is nominated to fill \na vacancy on the District Court for the Southern District of New York. \nSince 2002, Mr. Ramos has been in private practice after serving for \nten years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New \nYork, where he was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Narcotics Section. \nThe ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nhim ``well qualified'' to serve, its highest possible rating. The \nnomination of Mr. Ramos has the strong support of both his home state \nSenators, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand, and was reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee by voice vote with no dissent on September 15.\n  The nomination of Judge Andrew Carter to fill a vacancy on the \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York also has the \nstrong support of the New York Senators and was also reported \nunanimously by voice vote on September 15. Since 2009, Judge Carter has \nbeen a Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of New York. Prior to \njoining the bench, Judge Carter served for 13 years as a public \ndefender in New York state and Federal and spent two years at the Ford \nFoundation as a Program Assistant in its Rights and Social Justice \nProgram.\n  James Rodney Gilstrap is nominated to fill a vacancy on the District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas determined by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts to be a judicial emergency \nvacancy. His nomination has the support of both his Republican home \nstate Senators, Senator Cornyn and Senator Hutchison. For 27 years Mr. \nGilstrap has been a partner at the law firm of Smith & Gilstrap in \nMarshall, Texas. He has also served as a part-time County Judge for \nHarrison County, Texas. His nomination was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee by voice vote on September 15.\n  Dana Christensen is nominated to fill a vacancy on the District Court \nfor the District of Montana. Mr. Christensen has spent his 34-year \nlegal career in private practice and is currently the president of the \nlaw firm of Christensen, Moore, Cockrell, Cummings & Axelberg, P.C. in \nKalispell, Montana. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated Mr. Christensen ``well qualified'' to serve, its \nhighest possible rating. His nomination has the support of both his \nhome state Senators, Senator Baucus and Senator Tester, and was \nreported by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote with no dissent on \nOctober 6.\n  I hope the Senate can build on today's progress to fulfill its \nconstitutional duty and ensure the ability of our Federal courts to \nprovide justice to Americans around the country.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Caitlin Halligan\n\n  Tomorrow the Senate should be holding an up-or-down vote on the long-\ndelayed nomination of Caitlin Halligan to fill one of three vacancies \non the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Instead, for the seventh \ntime since President Obama took office 34 months ago, we are required \nto overcome a Republican filibuster for the Senate to consider one of \nPresident Obama's superbly qualified judicial nominees.\n  Ms. Halligan, President Obama's first nominee to the important D.C. \nCircuit, is the former Solicitor General for the State of New York. \nWith an impressive record in private practice and public service, she \nis widely respected for the quality of her work as an advocate. Indeed, \nMs. Halligan's nomination was greeted with bipartisan support and has \nsince garnered endorsements from law enforcement officials and \norganizations, women's organizations, law school deans and professors, \njudges and preeminent lawyers from across the political spectrum. The \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported Ms. Halligan's nomination nearly \nnine months ago.\n  By any traditional standard, she is the kind of superbly qualified \nnominee who should easily have been confirmed by the Senate months ago \nwith the support of both Republicans and Democrats. I am disappointed \nthat yet again instead of seeing bipartisan cooperation we are required \nto seek cloture.\n  From the beginning of the Obama administration, we have seen some \nSenate Republicans shift significantly away from the standards they \nused to apply to the judicial nominations of a Republican President. \nDuring the administration of the last President, a Republican, \nRepublican Senators insisted that filibusters of judicial nominees were \nunconstitutional. They threatened the ``nuclear option'' in 2005 to \nguarantee up-or-down votes for each of President Bush's judicial \nnominations. Senator McConnell, then the Republican whip, said: ``Any \nPresident's judicial nominees should receive careful consideration. But \nafter that debate, they deserve a simple up-or-down vote. . . . It's \ntime to move away from advise and obstruct and get back to advise and \nconsent. The stakes are high. . . . The Constitution of the United \nStates is at stake.''\n  Many Republican Senators declared that they would never support the \nfilibuster of a judicial nomination--never. Yet, only a few years \nlater, Senate Republicans reversed course and filibustered President \nObama's very first judicial nomination, that of Judge David Hamilton of \nIndiana.\n  David Hamilton was a widely respected 15-year veteran of the Federal \nbench. President Obama nominated Judge Hamilton in March 2009, after \nconsultation with the most senior and longest-serving Republican in the \nSenate, Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana, who strongly supported the \nnomination. Rather than welcome the nomination as an attempt by \nPresident Obama to step away from the ideological battles of the past, \nsome Senate Republicans ignored Senator Lugar's support, caricatured \nJudge Hamilton's record and filibustered his nomination. After the \nSenate rejected that filibuster, Judge Hamilton was confirmed.\n  The partisan delays and opposition to President Obama's judicial \nnominations have continued since. Senate Republicans have required \ncloture motions to be filed on judicial nominations that ultimately won \nunanimous support from the Senate. Earlier this year they filibustered \nthe nomination of Professor Goodwin Liu of California, who was \nsupported by both his home state Senators to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Ninth Circuit. That successful filibuster of a brilliant \nlawyer and a good man prevented the Senate from having an up-or-down \nvote on his nomination and prevented an outstanding nominee from \nserving the American people on the Federal bench. They attempted to \njustify that filibuster on ideological grounds. There is no such \njustification here, in connection with the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan who is a mainstream lawyer and public servant from New York. \nSenate Republican leadership took the virtually unprecedented step this \nyear of requiring cloture to be filed on a district court nomination. \nThat effort to ratchet up the judge wars was rejected when 11 \nRepublican Senators joined to ensure an up-or-down vote on \nthe nomination of Jack McConnell to the District of Rhode Island.\n\n  With their latest filibuster, the Senate Republican leadership seeks \nto set yet another new standard, one that threatens to make \nconfirmation of any nominee to the D.C. Circuit virtually impossible \nfor the future. Caitlin Halligan is well-qualified nominee with a \nmainstream record as a brilliant advocate on behalf of the State of New \nYork and in private practice. I have reviewed her record carefully in \nthe course the Judiciary Committee's thorough process, including her \nresponse to our extensive questionnaire and her answers to questions at \nher hearing and\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\nin writing following the hearing. In my view, there is no legitimate \nreason or justification for filibustering her nomination.\n  Caitlin Halligan is the kind of nominee who has demonstrated not only \nlegal talent but also a dedication to the rule of law throughout her \ncareer. We should encourage nominees with the qualities of Ms. Halligan \nto engage in public service and we should welcome them on the Federal \nbench, not denigrate them. Concocted controversies and a blatant \nmisreading of Ms. Halligan's record as an advocate are no reason to \nobstruct this outstanding nomination.\n  We must reject these misguided arguments. This filibuster against \nthis qualified woman will set a standard that could not be met by \njudicial nominees of Presidents of either party. I trust that, as with \nthe nomination of Jack McConnell, sensible Republican Senators will, \nagain, join in preventing such an outcome. It is time to edge away from \nthis dangerous precipice.\n  When Democratic Senators cooperated to confirm John Roberts to the \nD.C. Circuit in 2003, it broke the stalemate created by the Republicans \nrefusal for years to even consider President Clinton's nominees to that \nCourt. Like John Roberts, Caitlin Halligan is a highly regarded \nappellate advocate with the kind of impeccable credentials in both \npublic service and private practice that make her unquestionably \nqualified to serve on the D.C. Circuit. She should be confirmed, not \nunjustifiably filibustered.\n  Ms. Halligan served for nearly six years as Solicitor General of New \nYork and has been a leading appellate lawyer in private practice. She \nis currently General Counsel at the New York County District Attorney's \nOffice, an office that investigates and prosecutes 100,000 criminal \ncases annually in Manhattan. Ms. Halligan has served as counsel of \nrecord in nearly 50 matters before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing five \ncases before that court and many cases before Federal and state \nappellate courts. Just as John Roberts had served in government and \nclerked for the Supreme Court, she clerked for Supreme Court Justice \nStephen Breyer. She also clerked for Judge Patricia Wald on the D.C. \nCircuit, the court to which she has been nominated. The American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which \nRepublican Senators often cite, unanimously rated Ms. Halligan ``Well-\nQualified'' to serve on the D.C. Circuit. That is the highest rating \nthat can be received from its non-partisan peer review.\n  The letters of support we have received for Ms. Halligan's nomination \nfrom a broad range of people and organizations is a testament both to \nher exceptional qualifications to serve and to the fact that this \nshould be a consensus nomination, not a source of controversy and \ncontention.\n  Twenty-one prominent appellate advocates from across the political \nspectrum who have worked with Caitlin Halligan, including Miguel \nEstrada and Carter Phillips, endorsed her nomination, writing:\n\n       ``We believe that Caitlin is an outstanding selection for \n     the D.C. Circuit. She is a first-rate lawyer and advocate. \n     She is well respected and highly regarded as a leader of the \n     profession. Caitlin has an ideal judicial temperament. She \n     brings reason, insight and judgment to all matters. Even \n     those of us who have been on the opposite sides of Caitlin in \n     litigation have been greatly impressed with her ability and \n     character. We have no doubt she would serve with distinction \n     and fairness.''\n\n  When Ms. Halligan was nominated, Carter Philips, a preeminent Supreme \nCourt advocate who served as Assistant to the Solicitor General during \nthe Reagan administration, described her as ``one of those extremely \nsmart, thoughtful, measured and effective advocates'' and concluded \nthat she ``will be a first-rate judge.'' Judge Albert Rosenblatt, who \nwas appointed to serve on New York's highest court by former Republican \nGovernor George Pataki, wrote in praise of Ms. Halligan's work as New \nYork's Solicitor General, concluding that ``her sense of fairness and \nbalance is among the best--if not the best--that I have ever seen in my \n34 years as a judge and a prosecutor.'' This is not a nomination that \nshould be filibustered. To do so will set a destructive standard that \nno one will be able to meet. If someone of Caitlin Halligan's \noutstanding credentials, character and experience cannot be confirmed, \nno one can be.\n  The nomination of Ms. Halligan has likewise received significant \nsupport from law enforcement officials and organizations. The National \nDistrict Attorneys Association has called Caitlin Halligan's background \n``impressive,'' stating that she ``would be an outstanding addition'' \nto the D.C. Circuit. District Attorneys from the State of New York, \nincluding Republicans Derek Champagne, Daniel Donovan, Jr., William \nFitzpatrick, James Reams and Scott Burns, support her nomination, as do \nthe New York Association of Chiefs of Police and the New York State \nSheriff's Association. New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly \nhas said that Ms. Halligan has the ``three qualities important for a \nnominee: intelligence, a judicial temperament, and personal \nintegrity.'' Legendary New York County District Attorney Robert \nMorgenthau, endorsing her nomination in the ``strongest of terms,'' \ndescribed Ms. Halligan as ``qualified in terms of intellect, ability \nand temperament.'' This is not someone to be filibustered and blocked \nfrom serving as a Federal judge.\n  More than 20 former United States Supreme Court clerks, including \nclerks who worked for conservative Justices such as former Chief \nJustice Rehnquist, Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, wrote that they \n``retain a distinct appreciation of Caitlin's sharp intelligence and \nher ability to cooperate with others in resolving difficult legal \nproblems.'' They concluded their letter of support by praising her \n``reasonableness and collegiality,'' and calling her a ``fair-minded \ncolleague who was a pleasure to work with in a sophisticated and \ndemanding legal setting.'' This is not a closed minded ideologue. \nCaitlin Halligan is an outstanding lawyer who will be an outstanding \njudge.\n  Ms. Halligan's nomination has received support from numerous women's \nlaw enforcement, business, and legal organizations, including the New \nYork Women in Law Enforcement, the National Center for Women and \nPolicing, the National Conference of Women's Bar Associations, and the \nWomen's Bar Association of the District of Columbia. The U.S. Women's \nChamber of Commerce asked the Senate to confirm Ms. Halligan, \ndescribing her as ``exceptionally well-qualified'' with ``outstanding \nlegal credentials and legal experience that is both broad and deep.'' \nThe National Conference of Women's Bar Associations, which supports Ms. \nHalligan because her ``broad experience, public service and intellect \nmake her well suited to the federal appellate bench,'' also notes that \n``her appointment would add much needed diversity to the federal court, \nwhere only three women are among the active judges on the DC Circuit.'' \nMore than 100 women who are deans and professors at top law schools \nthroughout the country strongly support the nomination because ``Ms. \nHalligan has won accolades for her judgment, legal acumen, and \nexpertise in appellate litigation,'' and because her ``legal \ncredentials, experience and accomplishments make her exceptionally \nwell-qualified to serve'' on the D.C. Circuit. They also echo the need \nfor bringing gender diversity to this critical court, noting that, \n``women have been historically underrepresented on this court, as only \nfive of the fifty-seven judges to serve there have been women.'' This \noutstanding nominee is a leader and role model whose career should not \nbe short-circuited by petty partisanship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some of these letters of support be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    March 4, 2011.\n     Hon.

Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I am a retired \n     member of New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals, a \n     position to which I was appointed by Governor George Pataki. \n     Caitlin Halligan appeared frequently before me on behalf of \n     the State of New York in her capacity as Solicitor General. \n     The quality of her work was exemplary and serves as a model \n     of how to deal with important issues. Her sense of fairness \n     and balance is among the best--if not the best--that I have \n     ever seen in my 34 years as a judge and as a prosecutor \n     before that. In her appearances before our court, there is no \n     one who commanded more respect and who had greater \n     credibility. If I had to choose a candidate to serve on a \n     federal appeals court I can think of no one better. I \n     emphasize: No one. I urge the Senate to act expeditiously to \n     confirm her to this position.\n       Most respectfully I hope the Senate sees fit to act \n     expeditiously to confirm her for service on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       Please feel free to contact me, if you wish, by phone or \n     email. I recall fondly, Senator Leahy, that we met many years \n     ago at a convention when I was an assistant DA in New York \n     and you were a prosecutor in Vermont.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Albert M. Rosenblatt.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 National District\n\n\n                                        Attorneys Association,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, June 2, 2011.\n     Hon.

Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: On behalf \n     of the National District Attorneys Association, the oldest \n     and largest organization representing over 39,000 of \n     America's state and local prosecutors, we would like to offer \n     our full support for the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan \n     for the position of United States Circuit Judge for the \n     District of Columbia.\n       Ms. Halligan has an impressive background which developed \n     her into an extremely impressive and qualified candidate to \n     serve as an U.S. Circuit Judge. Ms. Halligan currently serves \n     as General Counsel of the New York County District Attorney's \n     Office, where she helps to supervise more than 500 lawyers \n     handling a wide range of criminal investigations and \n     prosecutions. Prior to joining the District Attorney's Office \n     in 2010, Ms. Halligan was a partner and head of the appellate \n     practice at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, LLP, a leading New York \n     law firm. From October 2001 until January 2007, Ms. Halligan \n     served as the Solicitor General of New York State, where she \n     represented the State in the federal and state appellate \n     courts and headed an office of 45 appellate attorneys.\n       The National District Attorneys Association believes that \n     Ms. Halligan would be an outstanding addition to the United \n     States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. We are \n     happy to offer our full support for Ms. Halligan's nomination \n     and encourage her swift confirmation by the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     James Reams,\n       President.\n     Scott Burns,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Police Commissioner,\n\n                                       New York, NY, May 26, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I am writing in \n     support of the nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. \n     I am familiar with the work of Ms. Halligan in her capacity \n     as Counsel to the New York County District Attorney.\n       Ms. Halligan possesses the three qualities most important \n     for a nominee: intelligence, a judicial temperament, and \n     personal integrity. Ms. Halligan is without question an \n     attorney with a keen legal intellect. Indeed, the rapid \n     successes of her career since graduating from law school in \n     1995 provide ample evidence of her intelligence and \n     abilities. With regard to her temperament, the interactions \n     between Ms. Halligan and my staff consistently demonstrate an \n     even-handed disposition in navigating potential conflicts \n     between police and prosecutors in New York City. Lastly, Ms. \n     Halligan's personal integrity is simply without question.\n       In sum, Ms. Halligan possesses all the qualities required \n     for a successful federal appellate judge, and I highly \n     recommend her for such a position.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Raymond W. Kelly,\n     Police Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz,\n\n                                     New York, NY, March 23, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley: I write this \n     letter in support of the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit. I have known Caitlin personally a short \n     time, but her reputation for even-handedness and excellence \n     as an attorney are well-known in New York's legal community.\n       I will not belabor her exemplary record as an attorney: \n     Georgeton Law Review, clerk to Justice Patricia Wald of the \n     D.C: Circuit, to Justice Stephen Breyer of the United States \n     :Supreme Court, adjunct faculty member of Columbia University \n     Law School and Georgetown University Law Center, Solicitor \n     General of the State of New York, Partner and Head of \n     Appellate Practice Group at the firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges \n     LLP, and most recently, General Counsel to the District \n     Attorney of New York County. Certainly this is a resume and \n     career that is grounded solidly in the law, and I submit that \n     her legal qualifications are beyond question.\n       More recently, I have worked with Caitlin in her capacity \n     as General Counsel to my former office. Ske is well-known and \n     well-regarded as a lawyer's lawyer. She follows the law and \n     holds herself to the highest ethical standards. She is as \n     intellectually honest as she is tough--she does not take \n     short cuts and she does not pull her punches; both necessary \n     attributes for her to be effective in her current position.\n       At the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, she handles \n     some of the toughest issues that a lawyer has to address; \n     issues that go to the core of law enforcement authority; \n     issues that involve claims of wrongful conviction and the use \n     of prosecutorial discretion. I can speak from experience to \n     tell you that these are weighty issues that can keep any \n     lawyer awake at night. A District Attorney needs counsel who \n     is tough but fair, and counsel who can advise the district \n     attorney on these weighty issues not from a gut feeling or \n     personal agenda, but based solely on the law and the facts. \n     She meets these high standards. I cannot stress enough the \n     difficulties of the issues that Ms. Halligan has to address \n     every day. And, based on both my personal observation and \n     accounts I hear from my former colleagues at the D.A.'s \n     Office--Caitlin handles these pressures with grace and poise, \n     and is a tough proponent of the core mission of the Manhattan \n     D.A.'s Office--to keep the citizenry safe, to enforce the law \n     without fear or favor, and to hold accountable those who \n     break the law. She brings solid law enforcement perspective \n     to her work, and upholds the highest standards of my former \n     office.\n       In sum, Caitlin Halligan is qualified in terms of \n     intellect, ability and temperament, and I endorse her in the \n     strongest of terms.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Robert M. Morgenthau.\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                February 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     as former clerkship colleagues of Caitlin Halligan in support \n     of her nomination for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \n     the District of Columbia Circuit. All of us worked alongside \n     Caitlin as law clerks at the U.S. Supreme Court during the \n     1997-98 Term. Our shared experience left us with an indelible \n     impression of Caitlin's brilliant legal mind, her \n     collegiality and fair-mindedness, and her abiding respect for \n     the rule of law. Even now, almost a decade and a half later, \n     as we have moved on to disparate careers in the government, \n     private sector, and the legal academy, we retain a distinct \n     appreciation of Caitlin's sharp intelligence and her ability \n     to cooperate with others in resolving difficult legal \n     problems.\n       As you well know, the work of the Supreme Court is intense \n     and eclectic, encompassing a vast array of intricate legal \n     matters, a host of overlapping deadlines, and a variety of \n     formal and informal procedures for internal deliberation and \n     discussion among the Justices and their clerks. Our work on \n     the difficult cases the Court decided during the 1997-98 Term \n     generated among our group an unending discussion of legal \n     issues, both in connection with our specific law clerk tasks \n     and in more freewheeling conversations in the clerks' dining \n     room and related settings. In this milieu Caitlin stood out \n     for her ability to meaningfully discuss and explicate tough \n     legal questions with an open mind and a willingness to \n     consider multiple perspectives on the law. Throughout the \n     year, Caitlin displayed a keen ability to listen to and \n     accommodate the views of others, all the while simultaneously \n     expressing and justifying her own view of the law. Although \n     the Court during the 1997 Term issued an unusually high \n     proportion of unanimous decisions, Caitlin's demeanor as a \n     law clerk exuded reasonableness and collegiality even in \n     those areas where we law clerks-- and the Justices for whom \n     we worked--disagreed.\n       In sum, we hold Caitlin Halligan in high regard as a \n     talented and fair-minded colleague who was a pleasure to work \n     with in a sophisticated and demanding legal setting. We have \n     no doubt that if she is confirmed by the Senate, her \n     colleagues on the federal bench will soon arrive at a similar \n     conclusion, and we appreciate your attention to her \n     nomination.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n         Samuel R.

Ms. Halligan is exceptionally \n     well-qualified, and would be an excellent addition to that \n     court. She would not only bring extraordinary legal talents \n     but also increase the gender diversity of that court, \n     increasing the representation of women on what has been \n     called the second-highest court in the land.\n       Her resume speaks for itself. Ms. Halligan has outstanding \n     legal credentials and legal experience that is both broad and \n     deep. Over the course of her career, she has developed \n     significant expertise in appellate litigation, including \n     before the U.S. Supreme Court. She has also generously \n     contributed of her own time to pro bono service.\n       We ask that the Senate vote to confirm Caitlin Halligan to \n     the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Margot Dorfman,\n     CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                     Women's Bar Associations,\n\n                                      Portland, OR, June 23, 2011.\n     Re Nomination of Caitlin J.

Ms. Halligan's legal credentials, experience, and \n     accomplishments make her exceptionally well-qualified to \n     serve on this court. We also note that women have been \n     historically underrepresented on this court, as only five of \n     the fifty-seven judges to serve there have been women, and \n     only three of the court's eight active judges are women.\n       Ms. Halligan graduated from Georgetown University Law \n     Center with honors, including Order of the Coif. She clerked \n     for Judge Patricia M. Wald on the D.C. Circuit Court, and for \n     Justice Stephen G. Breyer on the U.S. Supreme Court. Ms. \n     Halligan's career includes public service, private practice, \n     and legal education. She worked for the Attorney General of \n     the State of New York, including as Solicitor General of the \n     State of New York, and currently serves as General Counsel to \n     the New York County District Attorney's office. She was a \n     partner and head of the appellate practice at Weil, Gotshal \n     and Manges, LLP. In addition, she has taught as an adjunct \n     professor at Georgetown University Law Center and Columbia \n     Law School. In all of these capacities, Ms. Halligan has won \n     accolades for her judgment, legal acumen, and expertise in \n     appellate litigation, which includes five arguments before \n     the Supreme Court. Throughout her career, she has also \n     contributed significant pro bono services.\n       Ms. Halligan received a unanimous ``Well-Qualified'' rating \n     from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. She\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\n     has been endorsed by numerous organizations, including the \n     District Attorneys Association of the State of New York, the \n     National District Attorneys Association, the New York State \n     Association of Chiefs of Police, the New York State Sheriffs \n     Association, the New York Women in Law Enforcement, the \n     Women's Bar Association of the District of Columbia, the \n     National Conference of Women's Bar Associations, the U.S. \n     Women's Chamber of Commerce, and the National Center for \n     Women & Policing.\n       We likewise offer our strong support of Ms. Halligan, and \n     urge you to support her nomination to the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. If you have \n     questions or if we can be of assistance, please contact \n     Columbia Law School Professor Gillian Metzger at (212) 854-\n     2667 or at gillian.metzger@law.columbia.edu.\n           Sincerely,\n       (Signed by 107 women law professors).\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I fear that what is behind this misguided filibuster \nattempt is a continuation of a decades-long attempt by some Senate \nRepublicans to play politics with the Federal court and, in particular, \nto engage in a rear guard action to preserve the D.C. Circuit as a \nRepublican bastion, despite the fact that the American people elected a \nDemocratic President. A recent Washington Post editorial urging the \nSenate to confirm Ms. Halligan's confirmation, suggested as much, \nstating: ``GOP senators are grasping at straws to block Ms. Halligan's \nascension, perhaps in hopes of preserving the vacancy for a Republican \npresident to fill.'' Yet again, we see some Senate Republicans shifting \nthe standards they use and the arguments they make based on the party \nof the President making the nominations. They say one thing when \nPresident Clinton is in office, flip when the President is a \nRepublican, and flop when the American people elect President Obama.\n  When President Clinton nominated qualified moderates to vacancies on \nthe D.C. Circuit, Republicans refused to proceed. The last of three \nClinton nominees to the D.C. Circuit was confirmed in 1997, after being \nnominated in 1995 and stalled through the 1996 session when not a \nsingle circuit nominee was confirmed by the Senate Republican majority. \nWhen Senate Republicans stalled the nomination of Merrick Garland to \nthe D.C. Circuit beyond the 1996 election, even Senator Hatch became \nfrustrated, and in March 1997 he proclaimed that the way that \nRepublicans were opposing judicial nominees was ``playing politics with \njudges,'' was ``unfair'' and that he was ``sick of it.'' He was right. \nMerrick Garland, like Caitlin Halligan, was superbly qualified, and was \nonly being obstructed for partisan political gain.\n  But once the blockade against Judge Garland was broken by President \nClinton's reelection, Senate Republicans erected an impenetrable wall \naround the D.C. Circuit. Neither of President Clinton's two other \nnominees were allowed a Senate vote, or even Judiciary Committee \nconsideration. That escalation in the judge wars was untoward, it was \nwrong. It hurt the court and was unfair to both Allen Snyder and Elena \nKagan, President Clinton's outstanding nominees. Allen Snyder had \nserved as a clerk to Justice Rehnquist and was an experienced and \nrespected litigator. Elena Kagan went on to become Dean of the Harvard \nLaw School and win confirmation to the United States Supreme Court. \nThese were unquestionably qualified nominees. The fact is that for the \nrest of President Clinton's second term, virtually his entire second \nfour years, given that Judge Garland had actually first been nominated \nin his first term, Senate Republicans would not consider another \nnominee to the D.C. Circuit. They just blocked and pocket filibustered \noutstanding nominees because they could.\n  Republican Senators pretended to justify their refusal to proceed on \nPresident Clinton's D.C. Circuit nominees not by arguing against the \nnominees, but by arguing that the caseload of the D.C. Circuit did not \njustify the confirmation of any more judges. They were contending that \nthe 11th and 12th judgeships on the D.C. Circuit should not be filled. \nThey argued that 10 judges were enough.\n  But what happened when George W. Bush became President? Republican \nSenators set aside those arguments when considering the nominations of \na Republican President to the same court even as the caseload numbers \nwent down, Senate Republicans abandoned their hollow caseload arguments \nto press for confirmation of multiple Bush nominees to the D.C. \nCircuit. Their actions showed that they were not really concerned with \na caseload justification. Their reversal now to readopt a caseload \nargument is not consistency of principle, but relates to the principal \nwho is making the nomination and appears political.\n  Despite the unwillingness of Senate Republicans to act on President \nClinton's nominees to the D.C. Circuit for years, Senate Democrats did \nproceed to consider President Bush's nominations. The first \nconfirmation, for which I voted, was of now-Chief Justice John Roberts \nto be a judge on the D.C. Circuit. At the time, John Roberts had been \nAllen Snyder's junior and his partner at Hogan and Hartson. He was the \nfirst judge confirmed to the circuit in six years.\n  The Senate then confirmed a series of questionable nominees to the \nD.C. Circuit: Janice Rogers Brown, Thomas Griffith and Brett Kavanaugh. \nThe same Republican Senators who blocked President Clinton's \nnominations from even being considered by the Judiciary Committee \nsupported every nomination of President Bush's to the D.C. Circuit, as \nthey filled the ninth seat, twice filled the 10th seat on the court and \nwent on to fill the 11th seat that they had said was unnecessary when a \nDemocratic President was doing the nominating. With the change of \nadministration, Republican Senators have now dusted off an old \nobstructionist argument about the D.C. Circuit's caseload, something \nthey ignored for eight years as President Bush's nominees were \nconfirmed to fill the 10th seat twice and also the 11th judgeship. But \nthey have ratcheted up their partisan opposition and now oppose even \nfilling the ninth judgeship. With three vacancies on the D.C. Circuit, \nthat is the judgeship that Caitlin Halligan would be filling not the \n11th that Senate Republicans filled just recently, or the 10th that \nthey voted twice to fill, but the ninth. This is not a basis on which \nto oppose as qualified a nominee as Caitlin Halligan, who has \nwidespread support from law enforcement and the legal community.\n  The so-called ``caseload'' concern is no justification for \nfilibustering this nomination. The D.C. Circuit is now more than one-\nquarter vacant, with three judicial vacancies. In fact, the Senate has \nacted on the so-called caseload argument. We have already eliminated \neffective in 2008 the 12th judgeship on that court. In so doing, the \nSenate and the Congress reaffirmed the authorization of 11 judges \nneeded for the important D.C. Circuit. This court is often considered \nthe second most important court in the land because of the complex \ncases that it handles. The court reviews complicated decisions and \nrulemaking of many Federal agencies, and in recent years has handled \nsome of the most important terrorism and enemy combatant and detention \ncases since the attacks of September 11. As noted in the recent \nWashington Post editorial: ``[Caseload numbers do] not take into \naccount the complexity and scope of the cases that land at the court. \nThey include direct appeals involving federal regulatory decisions and \nnational security matters, including cases stemming from the detentions \nat the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.''\n  The D.C. Circuit's cases have only increased in importance and the \ncourt's caseload has not gone down since Republican Senators supported \nevery one of President Bush's nominations to that court. According to \nthe Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, the caseload per active judge \nhas increased by one third since 2005, when the Senate confirmed \nPresident Bush's nomination of Thomas Griffith to fill the 11th seat on \nthe D.C. Circuit. That is right--the D.C. Circuit's caseload has \nactually increased. Judge Griffith's confirmation resulted in there \nbeing approximately 121 pending cases per active D.C. Circuit judge. \nThere are currently 161 pending cases for each active judge on the D.C. \nCircuit, one-third higher. If Ms. Halligan were confirmed to the ninth \nseat, there would be approximately 143 pending cases for each active \nD.C. Circuit judge, still significantly higher than after the Senate \nconfirmed President Bush's nominee to the 11th seat in 2005. In \naddition, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, \nwritten decisions per active judge have risen 20 percent since 2007. By \nany objective measure the\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\nwork of the D.C. Circuit has grown and the multiple vacancies should be \nfilled, not preserved and extended for partisan purposes.\n  Of course, if Republican Senators seeking to use caseload figures to \njustify their opposition to this nomination were serious, they would \nnot be continuing their refusal to consent to the Senate considering \nthe nominations of Morgan Christen of Alaska to the Ninth Circuit, and \nJudge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Eleventh Circuit, the two \ncircuits with the highest number of cases per active judge. They would \nnot be doing everything they can to delay filling vacancies on the \nNinth Circuit, a court burdened by multiple vacancies and the largest \ncaseload in the Nation, and we would instead take up and confirm the \nnomination of Jacqueline H. Nguyen who is nominated to fill the \njudicial emergency vacancy that remains open after the Republican \nfilibuster of Goodwin Liu. I have repeatedly urged the Senate to take \nup and consider these nominations, which are supported by home state \nSenators, yet Republicans have refused to consider them for months. In \nfact, courts throughout the country are in need of more confirmed \njudges and more judgeships to handle high and increasingly complicated \ncaseloads, yet we currently have 25 judicial nominations favorably \nreported by the Judiciary Committee awaiting final action by the \nSenate. Republicans concerned about caseload should join with us to \nconsider these nominations.\n\n  The Senate should not filibuster but should be voting to confirm the \nnomination of Caitlin Halligan to fill a vacancy on a critical court \nthat is one quarter vacant with only eight active judges and higher \ncaseloads than when Republicans voted to confirm President Bush's \nnominees fill the ninth, 10th and 11th judgeships on this court just a \ncouple of years ago.\n  Some have sought to criticize Ms. Halligan for positions she \nadvocated on behalf of the State of New York while serving as its \nSolicitor General. At her confirmation hearing, Ms. Halligan made clear \nshe filed briefs under the direction of New York's Attorney General, \narguing on behalf of the State of New York, not based on her personal \nviews. Yet some outside groups and even some Senators ignore this and \nseek to use those advocacy positions as a basis to filibuster her \nnomination.\n  These arguments are particularly hard to accept for anybody who \nunderstands the role of advocates in our legal system. Our legal system \nis an adversary one, predicated upon legal advocacy for both sides. \nNominees such as Chief Justice John Roberts have said lawyers do not \nstand in the shoes of their clients. Since when do we impose a litmus \ntest for nominees that they can never have been legal advocates? If we \nwere to do that, we would have no judges. Almost every nominee who had \nbeen a practicing lawyer would be disqualified by one side or the \nother. This is especially hard to understand for any Senators who \nsupport the rights of states to defend their interests in courts, the \nduty Caitlin Halligan owed to New York as its Solicitor General.\n  Some have pointed to her role as New York's Solicitor General acting \nat the direction of New York's Attorney General in tort lawsuits \nagainst gun manufacturers as suggesting that she will not uphold the \nSecond Amendment if confirmed as a judge. As a strong supporter of the \nSecond Amendment, I asked her during her hearing whether as a judge she \nwould faithfully follow and apply the Supreme Court's precedent from \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, which held that \nthe Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms \nfor self defense. She testified that she would. When asked by Senator \nGrassley whether the rights conferred under the Second Amendment are \nfundamental, Ms. Halligan answered: ``That is clearly what the Supreme \nCourt held and I would follow that precedent, Senator.''\n  In her personal capacity, Ms. Halligan has never challenged or \notherwise criticized the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \n(PLCAA) or been critical of the Second Amendment. As New York State's \nSolicitor General, she prepared an amicus brief at the direction of the \nNew York Attorney General in a case where New York City challenged the \nPLCAA, seeking to safeguard New York's police powers. The arguments \nmade in the brief were made on behalf of New York State. In the amicus \nbrief, New York State argued that the PLCAA should be struck down as an \nunconstitutional exercise of Congress's legislative power that \ninfringed on states' rights to exercise the police power within their \nborders. The amicus brief did not make a single reference to the Second \nAmendment. Any criticism of the PLCAA in New York State's brief or in \nthe speech she gave as a surrogate for and on behalf of New York \nAttorney General Spitzer reflected New York State's federalism \nconcerns. It is hardly surprising that New York State--like many other \nstates--advocated for a position that supported state powers.\n  As Solicitor General for the State of New York, Caitlin Halligan \nvigorously advocated for New York's interests, in particular the right \nto govern in traditional state law areas. For example, in the Grutter \nv. Bollinger affirmative action case, New York joined 20 other states \nin arguing that they ``must have the freedom and flexibility'' to set \ntheir own education policy. I assume that position does not raise \nconcerns for those seeking a basis for opposing her nomination. Nor I \nassume did her defense as New York's Solicitor General of the \nconstitutionality of the death penalty.\n  Indeed, Ms. Halligan's time as Solicitor General shows all the \nhallmarks of serious advocacy consistent with the interests of her \n``client''. When New York municipal attorneys requested advice as to \nwhether clerks could issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Ms. \nHalligan carefully analyzed New York's statutory law and concluded that \nthe state legislature did not intend to authorize marriage licenses to \nbe given to same-sex couples, even though the statutory language is \ngender neutral. After observing that this interpretation raised \n``constitutional questions,'' she outlined the current case law and \nstated that it was for the courts to resolve the issue. This measured \nresponse is no basis on which to caricature her record.\n  Most disconcerting of all are the attacks from some on the outside \nsuggesting that Ms. Halligan lacked candor in the answers she provided \nto the Judiciary Committee. I hope that we do not see any Senators \nrepeating these baseless charges to create another false controversy. \nMs. Halligan has been honest and forthcoming throughout the \nconfirmation process, providing the Committee with her entire record \nand giving detailed, accurate, and clear answers to over 150 questions \nfrom Judiciary Committee members at her hearing and in written follow-\nup questions on a wide range of topics, such as judicial philosophy, \nconstitutional interpretation, the Tenth Amendment, the Second \nAmendment, the Commerce Clause, the Eighth Amendment and the death \npenalty, military commissions and indefinite detention, tort liability, \nFederal preemption, and standing. In my view, Ms. Halligan's answers to \nquestions from Committee members were detailed and substantive, and \nshow an impressive depth and breadth of knowledge on complex legal \nissues. There is no lack of record or failure to respond as there was, \nunfortunately, when the Bush administration would not make information \navailable to Senators in connection with the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada. There is no lack of forthrightness, as there was when Brett \nKavanaugh was manipulating the confirmation process as a political \ncrony and insider during the Bush administration.\n  Those concerned with a 2004 report that questioned the indefinite \ndetention of enemy combatants issued by the Association of the Bar of \nthe City of New York's Committee on Federal Courts at a time when she \nserved on the Committee continue to ignore Ms. Halligan's repeated \ntestimony that she had no role in preparing the report, that she was \nnot aware of the report until preparing for her nomination and that \nreport ``does not reflect [her] views.'' At no time during Ms. \nHalligan's hearing or in the Committee's consideration of her \nnomination did any Senator question Ms. Halligan's candor or \nthoroughness in answering questions. I hope that no Senator does so now \nto attempt to justify this unjustifiable filibuster.\n  Given Caitlin Halligan's impeccable credentials and widespread \nsupport,\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\nthis should be the kind of consensus nomination supported by Senators \nof both parties who seek to ensure that the Federal bench continues to \nattract the best and brightest. Certainly, her nomination should not be \nsubject to a filibuster. Regrettably, however, the Senate's Republican \nleadership seems intent on continuing with the practices they began \nwhen President Obama first took office, engaging in narrow, partisan \nattacks on his judicial nominations. They seem intent on setting a new \nstandard that could not be met by the judicial nominees of Presidents \nof either party.\n  Republican Senators who just a few years ago protested that the \nfilibuster of any judicial nomination was unconstitutional, Republican \nSenators who joined in a bipartisan memorandum of understanding to head \noff the ``nuclear option'' and agreed that nominees should only be \nfilibustered under ``extraordinary circumstances,'' abandoned all that \nthey said they stood for and joined together in an attempt to prevent \nan up-or-down vote on President Obama's very first judicial nominee, \nDavid Hamilton. There were certainly no ``extraordinary circumstances'' \nto justify the Republican filibuster of Judge Hamilton, and several \nRepublican Senators joined together with Democratic Senators in \nrejecting that filibuster. I trust that they will do so, again, and \nreject this unjustifiable filibuster of Caitlin Halligan.\n\n  By the standard utilized in 2005 to end filibusters and vote on \nPresident Bush's controversial nominees, this filibuster should be \nended and the Senate should vote on the nomination. Those Senators who \nclaim to subscribe to a standard that prohibits filibusters of judicial \nnominees except in ``extraordinary circumstances'' cannot support this \nfilibuster. There are no ``extraordinary circumstances'' here. The 14 \nSenators who signed the Memorandum of Understanding in 2005, the then \n``Gang of 14,'' wrote about their ``responsibilities under the Advice \nand Consent Clause of the United States Constitution'' and that \nfulfilling their constitutional responsibilities in good faith meant \nthat nominations `` should only be filibustered under extraordinary \ncircumstance.'' Here there are none.\n  In 2005, Senator Graham, a member of the ``Gang of 14'' described his \nview of what comprises the ``extraordinary circumstances'' justifying a \nfilibuster. He said: ``Ideological attacks are not an `extraordinary \ncircumstance.' To me, it would have to be a character problem, an \nethics problem, so allegations about the qualifications of a person, \nnot an ideological bent.'' Caitlin Halligan has no ``character \nproblem,'' no ``ethics problem,'' and there is no justification for \nthis filibuster. Caitlin Halligan is a superbly qualified nominee whose \npersonal integrity, temperament and abilities have been attested to by \nlawyers and judges from both sides of the aisle. The many leading \nlawyers who have worked with Ms. Halligan, law enforcement officials \nand organizations supporting her nomination have all attested to Ms. \nHalligan's ``temperament,'' ``fairness'' and ``balance'' in addition to \nher legal judgment and qualifications for the D.C. Circuit. Hollow \ncontentions about the caseload of the quarter-vacant D.C. Circuit fall \nwell short of any standard of ``extraordinary circumstances.''\n  The signers of that 2005 Memorandum of Understanding, and the Senate, \ndemonstrated what they thought that agreement entailed when they \nproceeded to invoke cloture on a number of controversial nominations. \nThe Senate invoked cloture on the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to \nthe D.C. Circuit, the circuit to which Caitlin Halligan has been \nnominated.\n  As a Justice on the California Supreme Court, Janice Rogers Brown was \na nominee with a consistent and extensive record, both on the bench and \noff, of using her position as a member of the court to put her views \nabove the law. This was not a question of one case or one issue on \nwhich Democrats differed with the nominee--I have voted for hundreds of \nnominees of Republican and Democratic Presidents which whom I differ on \nmany issues. But this was a nominee with views so extreme she was \nopposed not just by her home state Senators, but also by more than 200 \nlaw school professors from around the Nation who wrote to the Committee \nexpressing their opposition.\n  Her record in numerous decisions as a judge showed that she was \nwilling to put her personal views above the law on issue after issue, \nincluding a willingness to roll back the clock 100 years on workers' \nand consumers' rights, to undermine clean air and clean water \nprotections for Americans and their communities, laws providing \naffordable housing, zoning laws that protect homeowners, and \nprotections against sexual harassment, race discrimination, employment \ndiscrimination, and age discrimination. In fact, while serving on the \nCalifornia Supreme Court, Justice Brown had argued that Social Security \nis unconstitutional, a position clearly at odds with well established \nlaw. She went so far as to say ``today's senior citizens blithely \ncannibalize their grandchildren.''\n  Despite her ideological extremism and willingness to implement her \nradical personal views as a judge without regard to the existing law, \nshe was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit, her nomination judged not to \npresent ``extraordinary circumstances'' supporting a filibuster. There \nis no justification under the standard applied to the nomination of \nJanice Rogers Brown for a filibuster of the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan, a widely respected nominee with a clear devotion to the rule \nof law and no record of ideological extremism.\n  Under the Gang of 14's Memorandum of Understanding, the Senate also \nagreed to invoke cloture on the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the \nFifth Circuit, a nominee whose rulings on the Texas Supreme Court were \nso extreme they drew the condemnation of other conservative judges on \nthat court. Alberto Gonzales, President Bush's White House counsel and \nlater his Attorney General, went so far as to describe one of her \nopinions as advocating ``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' \nHer nomination was determined not to present ``extraordinary \ncircumstances.''\n  Neither was the nomination of Thomas Griffith to the D.C. Circuit, \ndespite his decision to practice law without a license for a good part \nof his career, which I felt should be disqualifying. Yet his nomination \nwas not judged to present ``extraordinary circumstances'' and he was \nconfirmed to fill the 11th seat on the D.C. Circuit. There is no \nquestion under the standard Republicans applied to the nomination of \nThomas Griffith, Caitlin Halligan should be confirmed to fill the ninth \njudgeship on that court.\n  I urge Republican and Democratic Senators to come together and end \nthis misguided filibuster of Caitlin Halligan's nomination to the D.C. \nCircuit. There is no basis under any standard for blocking her \nnomination from having an up-or-down vote. To the contrary, Caitlin \nHalligan's impeccable credentials and record as an accomplished \nadvocate make her nomination worthy of bipartisan support. I look \nforward to ending this filibuster and voting to confirm Caitlin \nHalligan to the D.C. Circuit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum but ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Henry Clay once said:\n\n       Of all the properties which belong to honorable men, not \n     one is so highly priced as that of character.\n\n  It is my distinct privilege to rise today to speak on a nominee that \npossesses such character, Dana Christensen. The Senate will soon take \nup Dana's nomination for U.S. district judge for the District of \nMontana. To ensure the most ethical and qualified attorney was \nappointed as district judge, I created an advisory selection panel made \nup of five Montana lawyers with diverse legal backgrounds from across \nour State and across party lines.\n  I said to them: You just get me the best, the four or five best \npeople I can choose from. I do not care if they are Republicans or \nDemocrats or liberals or conservatives, you just get me the very best \nqualified.\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\n  That is what they did. From them I chose Dana Christensen, and the \npanel unanimously and enthusiastically recommended the nomination of \nDana Christensen. I was proud to pass this recommendation on to the \nPresident.\n  Dana is a fourth generation Montanan, raised in Missoula, MT. He \ngraduated from Stanford University in 1973, received his law degree \nfrom the University of Montana Law School in 1976. Dana started his \nlegal career at the Billings, MT, law firm of Moulton, Belingham, Longo \n& Mather, and then moved to Kalispell in 1981 to join the law firm of \nMurphy, Robinson, Heckathorn & Phillips. In 1998, Dana and two of his \npartners formed a new firm in Kalispell, MT, which has become one of \nthe leading firms in Montana for civil defense, business law, real \nestate, and estate planning. Dana has tried more than 50 trials in \nState and Federal courts. He has an active mediation and arbitration \npractice. Outside of the office, Dana has been an active member of his \ncommunity: a member of the board of directors of his local chamber of \ncommerce, a member of the University of Montana School of Law board of \nvisitors, and a member of the faculty of the University of Montana \nAdvanced Trial Advocacy Program.\n  Over the past 35 years, Dana has commanded the respect of his \ncolleagues across the State of Montana and elsewhere. Dana has received \nthe highest rankings from peer review organizations, Chambers USA and \nSuper Lawyers. He is also a member of the selective American Board of \nTrial Advocates and the American College of Trial Lawyers.\n  Upon his nomination in May, Montana's legal community lent their \nstrong support for Dana's selection. U.S. District Judge Richard \nCebull, who was appointed by President George Bush in 2001, said:\n\n       I do not think there is a better prospect in the whole \n     State.\n\n  U.S. District Judge Sam Haddon, also appointed by President Bush, \nechoed his colleague. Judge Haddon said:\n\n       He's a good lawyer, a good man, and in my opinion, \n     ethically totally qualified. The district will be well served \n     by him.\n\n  I have gotten to know Dana over the past several decades. I could not \nagree more with Judge Sebold and Judge Haddon. Dana embodies those \nqualities that Montana and America need on the Federal bench: \nintellect, extensive experience in the courtroom, commitment to public \nservice, integrity, and respect for precedent and the rule of law.\n  I congratulate Dana, his wife Stephanie, and his wonderful children, \nCassidy and Ben, on this extraordinary achievement. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate is expected to confirm \nfour additional judicial nominees. With these votes, we will have \nconfirmed 61 article III nominees this Congress.\n  I want to note that in the first session of the 112th Congress we \nhave now confirmed more nominees than during the entire 111th Congress. \nSo I think we can declare real progress. Over 72 percent of President \nObama's judicial nominees have been confirmed.\n  Despite this record of confirmations, we continue to hear complaints \nabout the way this President's nominees are being treated. So I point \nout that in only six sessions of Congress in the last 30 years have \nmore nominees been confirmed in a single session. Furthermore, given \nthe cooperation we have shown, I am disappointed that the Senate \nmajority wants to turn to a controversial nomination next rather than \ncontinue on the path of cooperative confirmations.\n  The Senate majority leader has scheduled a cloture vote for tomorrow \non the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit. I will speak more about the merits of \nthat nomination Tuesday. But I wanted to put that vote in some context.\n  It seems to me that the scheduling of such a controversial vote in \nthe closing days of a session of Congress is designed to simply heat up \nthe partisanship of judicial nominations. Perhaps that is the \nobjective. The result may well be that such a divisive vote might have \na chilling effect on reaching agreement on additional \njudicial nomination votes. I hope that is not the case. But everyone \nknows the final weeks of a session are often filled with unpredictable \nactions and outcomes.\n\n  With regard to the vote tomorrow, there will be some who say this \nnomination has been vacant for too long and that this nominee is being \ntreated unfairly, needlessly waiting on the calendar for too many \nweeks. Well, such arguments fail to consider the history of this \nparticular seat of the DC Circuit and of the record established by my \ncolleagues on the other side regarding the consideration of nominations \nfor this very same DC Circuit.\n  This seat has been vacant for over 6 years. It became vacant upon the \nelevation of John Roberts as Chief Justice. That was back in September \n2005. Following Justice Robert's appointment, Peter Keisler was \nnominated to fill the vacancy in June 2006, with a hearing held August \n1, 2006.\n  With a Republican majority in the 109th Congress, one would wonder \nwhy he never made it out of committee. Well, it is not that he did not \nhave the votes in committee. The fact is, the Democratic minority would \nnot allow a vote. This was accomplished by holding him over at his \nfirst markup, which the rules permit and is a legitimate exercise of \nthe right of a minority and a right that this minority on our side \nexercised quite frequently this very year.\n  However, for the remaining executive sessions in September of that \nyear, prior to final adjournment they either made sure the committee \ndid not have a quorum so we could not vote or they took the \nextraordinary step of invoking the 2-hour rule so the committee could \nnot meet. I note that a quorum was present early in one meeting but \nevaporated when Mr. Keisler's nomination was the pending business. So \nbasically the opponents ran out the clock on this nomination. He did \nnot get a committee vote. He did not get the courtesy of floor \nconsideration, not even a cloture vote like the nominee tomorrow will \nhave.\n  Mr. Keisler was renominated in June 2007 when the Democrats assumed \ncontrol of the Senate. But his nomination sat in committee with no \naction until it was returned to the President in January 2009. He was \nthe recipient of a pocket filibuster. This was despite being rated \n``unanimously well qualified'' by the ABA Standing Committee of the \nFederal judiciary and possessing outstanding qualifications to fill \nthis position. So complaints about this seat being vacant for too long \njust ring hollow with this Senator.\n  Likewise, when one considers the treatment of previous nominees to \nthe DC Circuit, it is evident that the nomination of Ms. Halligan is \nnot being treated in an unfair manner. In fact, her nomination is \nproceeding far better than many nominated to this court. I would remind \nmy colleagues that previous nominees were subjected to delay or \nmultiple hearings, to extensive delays in committee, and to multiple \nfilibusters on the Senate floor.\n  These include the nomination of Estrada, a Hispanic immigrant with a \ncompelling personal story and outstanding judicial qualifications, who \nwas subject to seven cloture votes; Janice Brown, an African-American \nfemale who had two cloture votes; Brett Kavanaugh; and Thomas Griffin. \nWhile all of these individuals were eventually confirmed, the \nprocedural tactics used in their nominations made the confirmations \nvery difficult.\n  I am not suggesting this is a pattern to follow, but it is relevant \nto the arguments that Ms. Halligan is being treated quite differently \nor in an unfair manner than other nominees.\n  With regard to the nomination before us today, I will say a few words \nabout, first, Mr. Ramos, who is nominated to be U.S. District Judge for \nthe Eastern District of New York. Mr. Ramos earned a BA from Yale in \n1982; JD Harvard, 1987. Upon graduation from law school, Mr. Ramos \nworked as an associate at the law firm of Simpson, Thatcher & Bartlett \nin New York City.\n  In 1992, Mr. Ramos joined the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the \nEastern District of New York, where he prosecuted a variety of Federal \ncrimes, including white-collar crime, defense contractor fraud, money \nlaundering, narcotics trafficking, labor racketeering, and violation of \nthe Arms Export Control Act. In June 2000, he was\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\npromoted to Deputy Chief of the Narcotics Section, where he supervised \nassistant U.S. attorneys prosecuting international narcotics \ntrafficking and racketeering cases.\n  In 2002, the nominee joined the law firm of Day, Berry & Howard LLP, \npredecessor to the firm Day Pitney LLP, as a partner in the government \ninvestigations practice group. Currently, he represents corporations \nand individuals in connection with criminal and regulatory \ninvestigations involving antitrust, bank fraud, public corruption, \nsecurities fraud, and government program fraud.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Mr. Ramos with a unanimous ``well qualified'' \nrating.\n  We are also considering the nomination of Judge Andrew L. Carter to \nbe U.S. District judge, Southern District of New York. Judge Carter \nearned his B.A. from the University of Texas in 1991 and his J.D. from \nHarvard Law School in 1994.\n  Judge Carter's legal career began in 1996 as a staff attorney for the \ncriminal defense division, Legal Aid Society, in New York, NY. In 2000, \nhe became staff attorney for the Federal defenders division. The \nnominee became affiliated with the Federal Defenders of New York in \n2005, first as staff attorney and, 1 year later, as a supervising \nattorney. His Federal practice included drug cases, gun cases, and \nimmigration fraud.\n  In 2009, Judge Carter was appointed to his current position of U.S. \nmagistrate judge for the Eastern District of New York, where he is \nprimarily responsible for handling civil matters.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Judge Carter with a unanimous ``qualified'' rating.\n  The third nominee we are considering is James Rodney Gilstrap to be a \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Texas, a seat deemed to be a \njudicial emergency. Mr. Gilstrap received his B.A. from Baylor in 1978 \nand his J.D. from Baylor University School of Law 1981.\n  Mr. Gilstrap served as an associate attorney for Abney, Baldwin & \nSearcy from 1981 to 1984. In 1984, he left to begin his own legal \npractice, Smith & Gilstrap, where he currently practices representing \nindividuals, corporations, and local governments on civil matters.\n  From 1989 to 2002, Mr. Gilstrap served as a county judge for Harrison \nCounty, where he had both administrative and judicial responsibilities.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has rated Mr. \nGilstrap with a unanimous ``qualified'' rating.\n  Then we have the distinguished nominee from Montana, whom Senator \nBaucus just spoke about, Dana L. Christensen, to be U.S. District Judge \nfor the District of Montana.\n  Mr. Christensen earned his B.A. from Stanford University in 1973 and \nhis J.D. from the University of Montana School of Law in 1976.\n  Earlier in his legal career, Mr. Christensen practiced natural \nresources law, representing coal mining and oil and gas companies in \nlitigation in administrative matters. He went on to practice general \ninsurance defense litigation and medical malpractice cases.\n  In 1996, he founded his own firm and continues to represent these \nentities and practices in this area. He has also represented defendants \nin large class-action lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Montana.\n  In addition to his litigation practices, Mr. Christensen has also \nrepresented at least 15 physicians in confidential disciplinary matters \nbefore the Montana Board of Medical Examiners. He has also represented \nhealth care providers in more than 200 matters before the Montana \nMedical Legal Panel.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Mr. Christensen with a unanimous ``well qualified'' \nrating.\n  I intend to vote for all these candidates.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey pertaining to the introduction of S. 1944 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I am proud to support Caitlin \nHalligan's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n  Caitlin Halligan's impeccable career spans public and private \npractice, similar to that of John Roberts when he was confirmed \nunanimously to the DC Circuit. Ms. Halligan served as solicitor general \nof New York, a leading appellate lawyer at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, and \ncurrently as general counsel at the New York County district attorney's \noffice, which investigates and prosecutes 100,000 criminal cases \nannually.\n  She clerked for Supreme Court Justice Breyer and Judge Patricia Wald \non the DC Circuit. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated Ms. Halligan ``well qualified'' to serve on \nthe DC Circuit.\n  Ms. Halligan has support from across the political spectrum, \nincluding Miguel Estrada, Carter Phillips, and officials in Democratic \nand Republican administrations. Twenty-three former U.S. Supreme Court \nclerks, the National District Attorneys Association, the National \nConference of Women's Bar Associations, and the U.S. Women's Chamber of \nCommerce are supporting her nomination.\n  New York City police commissioner Ray Kelly has said Ms. Halligan has \nthree qualities that are important for a nominee--intelligence, \njudicial temperament, and personal integrity.\n  Unfortunately, it appears some of my colleagues are determined to \ncriticize Caitlin Halligan regardless of the facts.\n  One of the criticisms of Ms. Halligan is positions she advocated for \nwhile serving as solicitor general. She filed briefs at the direction \nof New York's attorney general and argued on behalf of the State. That \nwas her job. She was not promoting her personal views.\n  Ms. Halligan testified she would faithfully follow and apply the \nSupreme Court's precedent from Heller and McDonald. When asked whether \nthe rights conferred under the second amendment are fundamental, she \nanswered: ``That is clearly what the Supreme Court held, and I would \nfollow that precedent.''\n  Let me also address the workload concerns brought up by some of my \nfellow Senators. There are currently only eight active judges on the DC \nCircuit, making it one-quarter vacant. Miss Halligan has been nominated \nto fill the ninth seat--one of three current vacancies on the court. \nThe Senate confirmed four of President Bush's nominees for the DC \nCircuit; however, the court's caseload is higher now than it was when \nPresident Bush's nominees were confirmed. If Ms. Halligan was confirmed \ntoday, it would reduce the caseload from its current level of 161 cases \nto approximately 143 cases per judge.\n  Women have been woefully underrepresented by the DC Circuit, often \ncharacterized as the second most important court in our entire Nation. \nOnly 5 of the 57 judges serving throughout the history of the DC \nCircuit have been women. Ninety-one percent of the judges on this court \nthroughout its 41-year history have been men.\n  If we continue down this road of filibustering nominees simply \nbecause their nomination originates across the aisle, we will establish \nan impossible standard that no nominee could or would ever meet.\n  Caitlin deserves an up-or-down vote, just as the Republicans \nadvocated for\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\ntheir past judicial nominees. The bottom line is that there is no \ncredible opposition to her nomination or her confirmation. Caitlin \nHalligan has distinguished herself throughout her career. She has \nestablished a commitment to fairness, reasoned intellect, steadfast \nintegrity, and profound respect for the law.\n  I look forward to supporting Caitlin Halligan's confirmation to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and I urge my \nfellow colleagues to support her nomination.\n\n\n                  Nomination of James Rodney Gilstrap\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support \nthe nomination of Mr. James Rodney Gilstrap to serve as a Federal \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Texas in Marshall, TX.\n  Mr. Gilstrap attended Baylor University where he graduated magna cum \nlaude with a bachelor of arts degree in religion. Following his \ngraduation, Mr. Gilstrap continued his studies at Baylor University Law \nSchool, where he served as associate editor of the Baylor Law Review \nand received his juris doctor in 1981.\n  Mr. Gilstrap began his professional career in Marshall, TX, where he \nstill resides today. In August of 1989, Mr. Gilstrap was appointed \ncounty judge of Harrison County and was then elected to the same \nposition for the next three terms. In 2002, he retired as a county \njudge and returned to private practice at Smith & Gilstrap, where he \nstill practices today.\n  Mr. Gilstrap has earned the respect and esteem of the legal community \nhe has served and his professional credentials will continue the strong \nhistory of the Federal bench in Texas.\n  Mr. Gilstrap's impressive career is complemented by his dedication to \nhis community. In addition to serving for years as county judge, Mr. \nGilstrap has served on the board for the Harrison County Historical \nSociety, the United Way for Harrison County, and the Trinity Episcopal \nDay School. He also served for 16 years on the Courthouse Preservation \nCouncil to help with the renovation of the Marshall courthouse that was \ncompleted in 2009. Mr. Gilstrap's passion for his work and his \ncommunity will be a tremendous asset to the Marshall bench.\n  I join his family in congratulating him on all his outstanding \naccomplishments: his wife Sherry Sullivan Gilstrap, his daughter \nLauren, who is continuing her medical studies at Harvard Medical \nSchool, and his son Stephen, who graduated from Yale Law School this \nyear.\n  I am pleased to recommend his confirmation to my colleagues.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Caitlin Halligan\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nCaitlin Halligan to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  As the first woman to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee--a \ncommittee on which I have served for 18 years--it is my great pleasure \nto speak in support of Ms. Halligan, who has excelled at every turn \nduring her distinguished legal career.\n  She graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1988. She \nreceived her law degree, magna cum laude, from Georgetown University \nLaw Center, where she was managing editor of the Georgetown Law Journal \nand inducted into the Order of the Coif.\n  She began her legal career with a clerkship with Judge Patricia Wald \non the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit--the first woman to \nserve on that Court.\n  She then spent a year in private practice at the Washington, DC firm, \nWiley, Rein, and Fielding, followed by a clerkship with Supreme Court \nJustice Stephen Breyer.\n  After another year in private practice, Ms. Halligan began work in \nthe office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, first as \nChief of the Internet Bureau.\n  She rose to become Solicitor General of the State of New York, the \nState's top appellate lawyer. She served in that role from 2001 through \n2007.\n  During nearly all of Ms. Halligan's time as Solicitor General, George \nPataki--a Republican--was Governor. Her job was to represent the State \nof New York zealously, and by all accounts she did so with skill and \ndignity.\n  Judith Kaye, the former Chief Judge of New York's highest court, \nwrites on behalf of the Court's entire bench that ``it was invariably a \ntreat'' to have Ms. Halligan argue before the Court.\n  In fact, the National Association of Attorneys General awarded Ms. \nHalligan the ``Best Brief Award'' for five consecutive years, 2001, \n2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005.\n  Ms. Halligan left the Solicitor General post in 2007 to become the \nhead of the appellate practice at the prestigious New York law firm, \nWeil, Gotshal, and Manges.\n  She has now returned to public service as the General Counsel of the \nNew York County District Attorney's Office--one of the largest \nprosecutor's offices in the country.\n  Over the course of her distinguished career, Halligan has served as \ncounsel for a party or amicus in the Supreme Court more than 45 times.\n  She has argued in the Supreme Court herself in five cases, most \nrecently in March of this year. She also has argued or participated in \nnumerous other cases before State and Federal appellate courts, \nincluding the New York Court of Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit.\n  In short, Ms. Halligan is an accomplished woman whose sterling \nqualifications for the bench are unassailable.\n  Ms. Halligan was first nominated more than 14 months ago. She was \napproved by the Senate Judiciary Committee nearly 9 months ago. She has \nbeen waiting for an up-or-down vote on the floor ever since.\n  It is an unfortunate sign of the times that my colleagues on the \nother side have held up her confirmation.\n  I understand that the National Rifle Association is opposed to Ms. \nHalligan's confirmation.\n  Behind the NRA's opposition is the fact that, while she was New \nYork's Solicitor General, the State of New York pursued public nuisance \nlitigation against gun manufacturers.\n  Think about that--any time a person represents a State or local \ngovernment, or the Federal Government, and takes a controversial \nposition, that may jeopardize a later confirmation vote.\n  That is not fair. A government lawyer's job is to pursue the \ngovernment's interest vigorously and to do justice.\n  Ms. Halligan was appointed by the Attorney General to represent the \nState of New York, while the State had a Republican Governor, George \nPataki. Her job was to advance New York's interest, and she did so with \nvigor. She should not be penalized for it.\n  Senator Sessions made this point when the Senate was considering \nJudge Kavanaugh's nomination. He said that ``[s]uggesting that service \nin an elective branch of Government somehow tarnishes a lawyer's \nreputation would be a terrible message for this body to send to the \nlegal community and to all citizens.''\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  My Republican colleagues might also say that the D.C. Circuit's \ncaseload does not support another judge, but they have short memories.\n  There are now three vacancies on the D.C. Circuit. That means that \nMs. Halligan would only fill the ninth seat, out of 11 on the Court. \nTwo seats would remain vacant.\n  However, my colleagues were not so concerned about this issue when \nPresident Bush's appointees were before the Senate. In fact, my \nRepublican colleagues supported filling the 10th seat on the Court \ntwice, and the 11th seat once.\n  I will conclude by simply saying that Ms. Halligan is a woman with \nsterling credentials, an exemplary record, and a wealth of experience.\n  She is President Obama's first and only nominee to the D.C. Circuit. \nShe should be confirmed.\n\n\n          Nominations of Edgardo Ramos and Andrew Carter, SDNY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I rise to support two outstanding \nnominees to the federal bench in the Southern District of New York.\n  Over the years, I have had the great good fortune to support many \noutstanding candidates to the federal bench.\n  Rarely, however, have I come across two nominees who are as \nqualified, in every possible way, to be federal judges as Edgardo Ramos \nand Judge Andrew Carter.\n  Ramos is the quintessential example of the American dream--he was \nborn in\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\nPuerto Rico and was 1 of 7 children raised by a single mother in \nNewark, NJ. He excelled in school, earning his bachelor's degree from \nYale and his law degree from Harvard.\n  After graduating, he was an associate at the New York firm Simpson, \nThatcher & Bartlett, and then served for 10 years as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney in the Eastern District of New York, including as Deputy Chief \nof the Narcotics Section. Since 2002, he has been a partner in the New \nYork law firm Day Pitney. Ramos has earned an outstanding reputation \namong his fellow lawyers, prosecutors, and judges and in the Hispanic \ncommunity. I have complete confidence that he will make an excellent \njudge.\n  Magistrate Judge Andrew Carter was born in Albany, GA and he came to \nNew York after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin and \nHarvard Law School. After law school, he worked for two years at the \nFord Foundation and became a public defender in New York courts, both \nstate and federal. He spent nine years at the New York office of the \nLegal Aid Society, and then four years at the Federal Defenders of New \nYork.\n  Since 2009, he has served as a United States magistrate judge in the \nEastern District of New York, a position for which he was selected by a \nvote of the sitting district judges. And that is terrific training to \nbe a Federal judge. Judge Carter is widely respected as a fair and \nmild-mannered magistrate judge who understands the courtroom and the \nneeds of litigants.\n  Both Ramos and Judge Carter embody the three criteria that I look for \nin a federal judge--excellence, moderation, and diversity.\n  Both have consistently risen to the top, academically and \nprofessionally.\n  Both are entirely non-ideological--they are lawyers who are respected \nby all of their peers, and who have approached the law with respect and \nhumility.\n  And, both increase the diversity of a bench that serves one of the \nmost diverse populations in the country. I have always said that, all \nother things being equal, diversity of backgrounds, experience, and \nethnicity is an important consideration for federal judges. So, I am \npleased to have recommended two nominees to the federal bench who are \noutstanding in every way.\n  The bench of the Southern District of New York has been one of the \nhardest hit by judicial vacancies--currently, 21 percent of its seats \nare open. With the addition of Edgardo Ramos and Judge Andrew Carter, \nthis important court will be closer to firing on all cylinders.\n  I look forward, with all New Yorkers, to their joining the bench.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are soon going to a rollcall vote on \nEdgardo Ramos, of Connecticut, to be U.S. district judge for the \nSouthern District of New York. We also have three others on here: \nAndrew L. Carter, Jr., of New York, to be U.S. district judge for the \nSouthern District of New York; James Rodney Gilstrap, of Texas, to be \nU.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Texas; and Dana L. \nChristensen, of Montana, to be U.S. district judge for the District of \nMontana.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the rollcall vote for Edgardo \nRamos, Andrew L. Carter, Jr., James Rodney Gilstrap, and Dana L. \nChristensen be considered by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Ramos nomination.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Edgardo Ramos, of Connecticut, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Southern District of New York?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, Dr. Peggy A. Bulger will retire at the end \nof December after more than 12 years of service to the Library of \nCongress. As the Director of the Library's American Folklife Center, \nDr. Bulger has worked to preserve our Nation's history for future \ngenerations.\n  Dr. Bulger began her service as Director of the American Folklife \nCenter in 1999. She is the second person to hold the position since the \nFolklife\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\nCenter was established in 1976. The American Folklife Preservation Act \nstates ``that the diversity inherent in American folklife has \ncontributed greatly to the cultural richness of the Nation and has \nfostered a sense of individuality and identity among the American \npeople.'' I couldn't agree more. Dr. Bulger has worked to preserve the \nunique nature of American folklife for future generations.\n  During her tenure, the center's archive has tripled. With more than 5 \nmillion items, it is the largest ethnographic archive in the United \nStates and possibly the largest in the world. The collection is a \ntreasure trove of American creativity that is reflected through music, \nstories, crafts, dances, foodways, and other forms of traditional \nexpression.\n  I am particularly proud that under her leadership the Folklife Center \ndeveloped and expanded the Veterans History Project. The project \ncontains more than 78,000 pieces of war-time memories and experiences \nfrom Americans across our country. The Veterans History Project has \nbecome the largest oral history project in our Nation's history, and it \nwill all be preserved for generations at the Library of Congress.\n  The Folklife Center also uses the latest technology to share its \nholdings via online presentations, as well as through webcasts and \nsocial media. As a result, students in Nevada and other States can \naccess the Folklife Center's collections from their homes, classrooms, \nand others venues.\n  It is also important to note that Dr. Bulger and her colleagues have \nprovided advice and support to struggling cultural programs during \nthese difficult economic times. In my home State, for example, the \ncenter has served the Western Folklife Center in Elko as well as the \nNevada Humanities. The assistance to Nevada's arts and cultural \norganizations has been invaluable as my State has weathered the \neconomic recession.\n  I am proud to recognize Peggy Bulger, and I appreciate her important \ncontributions to the American Folklife Center. I know I speak for the \nSenate when we wish you the best in your future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/05/senate-section/article/S8179-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n\n                              Section 647\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I understand there has been some confusion \nabout the application of section 647 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which is codified in 10 U.S.C. \n12731(f). This law reduces the eligibility age for retired pay for non-\nregular service, to provide a benefit to Reserve component members \ncalled to Active Duty in support of a contingency operation. Mr. \nPresident, 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)(B) defines contingency operation to \ninclude section 688 relating to the ordering of retired members to \nActive Duty but does not include section 688a, added in response to 9/\n11 and relating to the ordering to Active Duty of retired members in \nhigh-demand, low-density assignments.\n  I filed an amendment to resolve this inconsistency by including \nmobilizations under section 688a to qualify for earlier receipt of \nReserve retired pay under 10 U.S.C. 12731(f). However, I would withdraw \nmy amendment if we can clarify that the provisions of 10 U.S.C. \n12731(f) should include mobilizations under 10 U.S.C. 688a.\n  I ask the chairman of the Armed Services Committee whether he \nunderstands that Reserve retirees recalled to Active Duty in support of \na contingency operation should qualify for earlier receipt of reserve \nretired pay under section 12731(f).\n  Mr. LEVIN. I agree that the authorities allowing for earlier receipt \nof Reserve retired pay should apply to members of the retired Reserve \ncalled to Active Duty in support of a contingency operation to the same \nextent it applies to other members of the reserves.\n  Mr. KOHL. I agree with the chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/05/senate-section/article/S8179-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8179-S8180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO FREDERICK M. KAISER\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Frederick M. \nKaiser, who retired from the Congressional Research Service, CRS, on \nNovember 3, 2011.\n  Mr. Kaiser, a former Specialist in American National Government at \nCRS, was an authority on congressional oversight issues of great \nimportance to the Congress.\n  Mr. Kaiser's career in service to Congress began in the summer of \n1974, when he worked as a special staff consultant to the House \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs, chaired by Representative Thomas E. \n``Doc'' Morgan of Pennsylvania. At the request of Chairman Morgan, Mr. \nKaiser conducted an evaluation of the committee's oversight activities, \nwhich was subsequently published by the committee. This early focus on \ncongressional oversight foretold key aspects of Mr. Kaiser's CRS \ncareer.\n  Mr. Kaiser began his employment with CRS on February 18, 1975, where \nhe was given responsibility for the subjects of general congressional \noversight, congressional oversight of foreign policy, and the authority \nand role of the General Accounting Office, which is now known as the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO. These are subjects on which Mr. \nKaiser has advised Congress throughout his career. As a result of his \nhigh-quality work in service to the Congress, Mr. Kaiser quickly earned \nthe title of Specialist in American National Government just 6 years \nafter joining CRS. Mr. Kaiser continued his high level of service \nthroughout his career, and his areas of expertise gradually expanded. \nHe was regularly recognized for his service to Congress through special \nachievement awards and other recognition.\n  Mr. Kaiser produced hundreds of CRS publications; testified before \ncongressional committees and commissions; and organized policy \ninstitutes, workshops, and other policy discussions for congressional \nstaff. Over the course of his career, Mr. Kaiser developed a reputation \namong colleagues for being supportive and generous in sharing his \nknowledge and insights.\n  Mr. Kaiser was regularly at the forefront of emerging legislative \nissues. As the possibility of organizing Federal homeland security \nfunctions into a new department began to develop, Mr. Kaiser undertook \nstudies of agencies that might be included in a new department. As \nCongress considered the Help America Vote Act, he contributed his \nexpertise on the organization of agencies that might be established to \ncarry out the purposes of the act. Mr. Kaiser's analysis and insights \nwere important to informing successful efforts to improve GAO's ability \nto support congressional oversight of the intelligence community. In \nFebruary 2008, Mr. Kaiser testified on congressional oversight of the \nintelligence community before the subcommittee I chair, the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce, and the District of Columbia, of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. In his testimony, as well as separate \nresearch conducted for the subcommittee, he examined the importance of \nintelligence community oversight, congressional structures for \nconducting such oversight, and options for enhancing oversight.\n  Other examples of Mr. Kaiser's writing and briefings in the area of \ncongressional oversight of the intelligence community include analyses \nof proposals for a joint intelligence committee, organizational reform \nof the House Intelligence Committee, intelligence community \nwhistleblower protection, unauthorized disclosure of classified \ninformation, and use of classified information by Members of Congress. \nMr. Kaiser also advised Congress on creation of the 9/11 Commission and \non implementation of its recommendations, particularly concerning the \nCommission's authority and recommendations related to the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Kaiser has been a leading authority on the management and \noversight of the executive branch. Mr. Kaiser analyzed the Government \nPerformance and Results Act, private citizens' complaint-handling \nmechanisms, postal reorganization, audit institutions in other nations, \nstatutory inspectors general, privatization of government background \ninvestigations, and security clearances. He also authored, with other \nselected CRS specialists, the Congressional Oversight Manual. The 1993 \nbipartisan House Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress noted \nthe value of this publication, stating:\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\n``As a way to further enhance the oversight work of Congress, the Joint \nCommittee would encourage the Congressional Research Service to conduct \non a regular basis, as it has done in the past, oversight seminars for \nMembers and congressional staff and to update on a regular basis its \nCongressional Oversight Manual.'' Mr. Kaiser contributed the chapter on \ncongressional-executive relations to the final report of the Joint \nCommittee on the Organization of Congress.\n  Mr. Kaiser sought to enhance public understanding of the Federal \nGovernment as well. He wrote the introductory-level CRS report \n``American National Government: An Overview,'' which explains the \nAmerican national government structure. He also served as project \ncoordinator for updates of Congress's booklet on the Federal Government \nfor the American people, ``Our American Government.''\n  Finally, Mr. Kaiser has been a respected member of the academic \ncommunity, and he has participated in numerous symposia; served as an \nadjunct professor at American University and the University of \nMaryland; and consulted with the Congress, the Department of State, and \nthe Agency for International Development on democratic institution \nbuilding in emerging democracies. Mr. Kaiser's work has also appeared \nin numerous journals, including the Administrative Law Review, Annals \nof the American Academy of Political and Social Science, and the \nInternational Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, and he \nhas contributed to the Encyclopedia of the American Presidency and the \nEncyclopedia of the U.S. Congress.\n  As chairman of the subcommittee, I thank Mr. Kaiser for his \ndedication, professionalism, and lifetime of service to the Congress \nand our Nation. I wish him the best in retirement with his wife Carol \nand their children and grandchildren, and I am confident Congress, CRS, \nand the academic and professional community will continue to benefit \nfrom Mr. Kaiser's research and analysis for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/05/senate-section/article/S8180-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8180-S8181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GENERAL PETER W. CHIARELLI\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my Army Caucus \ncochair, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Jim Inhofe, I rise to \ncongratulate GEN Peter W. Chiarelli, the 32nd Vice Chief of Staff of \nthe Army, on his monumental contributions to our national security over \nthe course of his distinguished 39-year career.\n  Throughout his career, General Chiarelli has been the consummate \nsoldier's soldier. His career is distinguished by excellence in command \nof troops from platoon to corps. General Chiarelli is known for his \nhaving an open mind and for his candor while addressing the issues \naffecting the Army today. He is a tremendous advocate for soldiers both \nwithin the Pentagon and here on Capitol Hill. His advice, counsel, and \nfriendship have been very valuable to us as Army Caucus cochairs, and \nhe will be sorely missed. Who he is today though began being shaped \nmany years ago.\n  After his graduation from Seattle University in 1972, Pete married \nhis sweetheart, Beth, went to the Basic Course, and reported to his \nfirst assignment in the 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, WA. After \nhis time there, the Army offered him a job teaching at West Point, \nwhere he taught cadets in the distinguished Social Science Department.\n  In 1985, he graduated from the Naval Command and Staff College and \nreturned to leading soldiers, this time in Germany with the 3rd Armored \nDivision--the same division in which his father, also Pete Chiarelli, \nearned the Silver Star for heroism and a battlefield commission in 1945 \nas a tanker in World War II. It seems that character runs in the \nChiarelli family. While in Germany, General Chiarelli showed his \nbattlefield prowess--under his guidance, the U.S. tank crews won NATO's \ndistinguished Canadian Army Trophy for the nation with the best \ntankers.\n  After his success in Germany, he moved back to Washington in 1990, \nwhere took command of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, in the \n9th Infantry Division. Following his time in command of the 2nd \nBattalion, he was sent to the prestigious National War College here in \nWashington, DC, and then to the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, TX, \nto serve as the operations officer. He continued to impress his peers \nand his superiors and was selected to return to his home State of \nWashington to command the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division at \nFort Lewis.\n  In 1998, following his successful brigade command, he was hand-\nselected to be the executive officer to the Supreme Allied Commander \nEurope in Belgium, where he served for 2 years before heading back to \nthe 1st Cavalry Division to be the assistant division commander in \n2000. When the Nation was attacked on September 11, 2001, then-\nBrigadier General Chiarelli was serving in the Pentagon on the Army \nstaff, where he played a key role in mobilizing Army forces for the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was promoted to major general in 2003 \nand assumed command of the 1st Cavalry Division.\n  Over the next several years, General Chiarelli would spend the \nmajority of his time deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He \nserved in Baghdad from 2003 to 2005 as the commander of Multi-National \nDivision--Baghdad. At this time, Baghdad served as the center of \ngravity for Operation Iraqi Freedom. General Chiarelli was given the \ndifficult task of maintaining order in this sprawling city of 7 million \npeople. During his command, General Chiarelli was instrumental in \ndeveloping several innovations that contributed to our success in Iraq. \nChief among these were job-creating civil service projects. His \ncommitment to using ``money as a weapons system'' brought stability and \nsaved the lives of Americans and Iraqis alike.\n  In 2006, General Chiarelli was given command of all troops in Iraq, \ntotaling 160,000 at that time. As the commander of the Multi-National \nCorps-Iraq, he continued to innovate, pushing his troops to adopt \npractices that protected the populace even as they destroyed the \ninsurgent networks. His time as the commander of day-to-day operations \nin Iraq was, perhaps, the most difficult period of our operations \nthere, but General Chiarelli's performance garnered the highest praise \nof then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.\n  After 5 years in Iraq, General Chiarelli earned his fourth star and \nwas selected as the 32nd Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, an honor that \nspeaks to the confidence that his superiors and peers had in his \nabilities. As the ``Vice,'' General Chiarelli is responsible for the \nday-to-day operations of the Army staff and its responsibility to man \nand equip the world's greatest Army.\n  In this capacity, he has excelled on many fronts. He has been the \nmilitary's principal advocate for caring for our veterans with \npsychological health issues such as post-traumatic stress and traumatic \nbrain injury. These ``invisible wounds'' affect thousands of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, who have deployed to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. His 2010 report entitled ``Health Promotion, Risk \nReduction, Suicide Prevention'' was an effective call to action for \nleaders at the tactical level within the Army. This transparent and \nforthright self-evaluation of the Army's small-unit leadership \ncontained 45 hard-hitting pages of conclusions and recommendations, and \nwe have been pleased with the general's progress at following up with \nthose.\n  As the Nation focuses on deficit reduction and budget cuts, General \nChiarelli has been an important voice urging leaders to carefully \nconsider the options. In testimony before both Chambers of Congress, he \nhas advocated measured, strategy-based decisions that would meet \nbudgetary needs, while maintaining a force that balances end-strength \nand capabilities.\n  Throughout all this important work, General Chiarelli is widely \nrecognized as one of the most genuine and personable senior leaders in \nthe military. One widely repeated anecdote is applicable here. While at \na dinner at the White House in February 2011, General Chiarelli was \npassing behind another distinguished guest who, having seen his uniform \npants and nothing more, asked him to refill her wine glass. The woman \nalmost immediately recognized her error and was understandably \nmortified. Rather than be angry or embarrassed, General Chiarelli, as \nthe second-ranking officer in the most powerful Army in the world, \ngraciously filled\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\nthe glass. That speaks a lot about the character of the officer about \nwhom we are speaking today.\n  Mr. President, we both extend our heartfelt thanks to GEN Pete \nChiarelli, to his wife Beth, and to his children and their families for \ntheir lifetime of service to the Nation. Words cannot characterize \nproperly the extraordinary character of General Chiarelli's \naccomplishments.\n  The Nation thanks him and wishes him success and happiness in all his \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/05/senate-section/article/S8181-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING REGINALD COOPER AUGUSTINE, JR.\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise in tribute to an American hero and \nIllinois resident who was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery \non December 2.\n  Reginald Cooper Augustine, Jr. was born on October 12, 1913 in \nDecatur, IL. His parents, Reginald and Pauline, were prominent members \nof the community, both serving at different times on the Decatur school \nboard.\n  Reginald was an all American kid growing up in Illinois during the \nGreat Depression. As a teenager in the 1920s, he spent his Saturdays at \nthe silent moving pictures. In junior high, he spent a year delivering \nthe Decatur Herald--getting up every morning at 3 a.m. and returning to \nbed by 5 a.m. During high school, he played football and participated \nin the school band, while also working at the Biflex Bumper Company.\n  After graduating from Decatur High School in 1931, Reginald attended \nNorthwestern University as a member of the third entering class of \nAustin Scholars. This program, launched in September 1929, provided \nfull room, board, and tuition for 4 undergraduate years, plus a year of \nall-expenses paid study and travel abroad. He received his bachelor's \ndegree from Northwestern in 1935, with a major in Latin and a minor in \nGerman. These language skills proved pivotal in the direction of the \nrest of his life.\n  After college, Reginald spent 16 months touring Europe and North \nAfrica on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle that he acquired in Rotterdam, \nperfecting his knowledge of German, French, Italian, Dutch, and \nSpanish. During an extended stay in Germany, he witnessed a Nazi party \nrally in Heidelberg that he later described as akin to a Fourth of July \ncelebration with scarlet swastika banners and leather-booted storm \ntroopers. He returned to the U.S. in late September 1937, never \nforgetting what he had witnessed.\n  The Selective Service Act of 1940 required all U.S. residents between \nthe ages of 21 and 35 to register, and in 1940, Mr. Augustine was 27. \nHe was to be drafted in February, 1942, but after the Japanese Empire \nbombed Pearl Harbor, he went straight to the enlistment center in \nPeoria to sign up and serve his country in the U.S. Army Air Corps.\n  During the Second World War, Mr. Augustine was selected to join an \nelite detachment of linguists, spies and scientists by COL Boris Pash, \nwho headed a mission code-named Alsos. This mission was led by LTG \nLeslie R. Groves under the Manhattan Project. Groves suspected German \nphysicists were engaging in a similar nuclear program and feared that \nthey would complete a bomb first. The Alsos mission was tasked with \ndetermining whether the Nazis had developed an atomic bomb. Mission \noperatives moved into newly liberated areas just behind advancing \nAllied lines to find Nazi scientists, capture and interrogate them, as \nwell as confiscate and secure stocks of refined uranium that were \nurgently needed by the Manhattan Project.\n  Reginald was selected as an ideal candidate and put in charge of \nfield operations for this elite detachment because of his knowledge of \nFrench and German, as well as his extensive experience in Europe. \nDuring one operation in search of uranium in September 1944, he and \nColonel Pash entered a plant located near Antwerp, Belgium where \nfighting was still going on between British and German forces. There, \nthey found approximately 70 tons of refined uranium.\n  Far more difficult was a mission to southern France, which at that \ntime was a dangerous no man's land, occupied by 2 competing resistance \nmovements--one Communist, the other non-Communist. According to \nReginald's memoirs, ``no British or American forces, and not even any \nunits of the regular French army'' were present in the area. As part of \na group of 6 Alsos officers, he conducted the negotiations with \npartisans and officials. At a French arsenal in Toulouse, armed with a \nGeiger counter, he discovered a major cache of uranium. Reginald, \nColonel Pash, and a well-armed U.S. military contingent later returned \nto remove the uranium by force. Reginald accompanied the shipment of \nuranium back to the U.S. on a U.S. Navy ship. This uranium was \neventually used in the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\n  Reginald went on many other critical missions, including one to \nrecover the international radium standards from a small eastern German \ntown only hours before it was handed over to Soviet forces. He oversaw \nthe safe transfer of Nazi scientists, as well as American scientists, \nfrom one place to another. On one occasion, he found himself face-to-\nface with a Nazi checkpoint, manned by an armed German crew, but \nescaped unharmed.\n  Another mission that Reginald described as ``a grand climax to all \nAlsos operations in the war,'' was the seizure of a strategic German \natomic research center near Stuttgart. Once the area had been secured, \nhe escorted several captured German scientists to American territory, \nincluding Otto Hahn, discoverer of the nuclear fission principle, \nNobelist Max von Laue, and physicists Karl Wirtz, Erich Bagge and Carl \nvon Weizsacker.\n  Robert Norris, author of the 2003 book Racing for the Bomb: General \nLeslie R. Groves, the Manhattan Project's Indispensable Man, noted that \n``Alsos was one of the most successful intelligence operations of the \nwar.''\n  Reginald was promoted to the rank of captain by the end of the war. \nHe was decorated for his service, including the Bronze Star and Order \nof the British Empire, which he received personally from King George \nVI.\n  After the war, he continued to serve his country for over two decades \nas a member of the Central Intelligence Agency. This included postings \nin Munich and Frankfurt during the 1950s and 60s, and to Saigon in \n1968.\n  Reginald Augustine passed away on June 30 at the age of 97 and will \nbe laid to rest today at Arlington Cemetery. He is an example of our \nnation's Greatest Generation of heroes that grew up during the \nDepression, responded to their country's call to arms during World War \nII, and continued to serve during the long Cold War against communism. \nAs President Franklin D. Roosevelt described, ``This generation of \nAmericans [had] a rendezvous with destiny.''\n  Mr. Augustine is survived by his wife of 61 years, two daughters, two \nsons-in-law, and two grandchildren. We owe him and his family, as well \nas his generation, a debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/05/senate-section/article/S8181-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8181-S8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING JOHN KATZ\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the distinguished \npublic service of a true statesman from my State of Alaska, John Katz. \nAt the new year, John will step down as director of the State of \nAlaska's national office here in Washington, DC, after nearly three \ndecades in that position. John Katz is an Alaska pioneer. He has been a \nkey player in virtually every major public policy decision in Alaska \nfor the past 40 years--and Alaska has only been a State for 52 years. \nJohn helped Alaska's transition to statehood in our formative years. He \nshaped and implemented key congressional laws, including the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act and the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act.\n  John laid the foundation for Alaska's robust resource-based economy, \nwhich at one point was providing this Nation a quarter of its domestic \noil. John has helped transform the Last Frontier into a modern society, \nbringing basic facilities like water, sewer, and phone service to a \nterritory one-fifth the size of the lower 48 States. Overall, John has \nhelped carefully manage Alaska's often strained relationship with the \nFederal Government. After working as a high school teacher and coach in \nBaltimore public schools, John began his long career of service to \nAlaska when he joined the staff of Alaska Congressman Howard Pollock. \nMy dad, Nick\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\nBegich, succeeded Representative Pollock as Alaska's lone Member of the \nU.S. House.\n  In 1971, John became a legislative assistant to then-Senator Ted \nStevens. His wise counsel to Senator Stevens would continue until \nSenator Stevens' tragic passing last year. John worked in Alaska on \nNative claims issues and as counsel to the Joint Federal-State Land Use \nPlanning Commission. The Commission didn't have a very sexy title, but \nit crafted important policy about the land management relations between \nthe State and Federal Governments. From 1981 to 1983, John served as \ncommissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, arguably \nthe most influential agency in Alaska State government. It oversees \nAlaska's 103 million acres of land and manages the resource base for \nour economy: oil and gas, mining, forestry, parks, and agriculture. In \n1983, John was asked by then-Governor Bill Sheffield to move to \nWashington to direct the State's office here. It was a position in \nwhich he would serve seven different Alaska Governors, as varied \npolitically as Alaska is richly diverse.\n  Democrats, Republicans, one Alaska Independent--all have relied \nheavily on John's encyclopedic knowledge of our State and his helping \nnavigating the often choppy waters of Washington. Too often John's \nmission has been fighting against Federal encroachment into the lives \nof Alaskans. It is a battle we fight here every day. I, too, have \nrelied on John's wisdom and insight, as mayor of our State's largest \ncity, and now as I serve Alaska in this Chamber. After a distinguished \ncareer, John has cited what he called ``the increased polarization and \ndeterioration of the public policy process at the Federal level.'' He \nsays it is the worst he has ever seen in nearly half a century of \nthankless public service. I am saddened by this turn of events and sad \nto agree with John about the state of our national discourse.\n  But I am heartened by John's dedication to the people of Alaska, to \ntirelessly working each and every day to educate non-Alaskans about the \nunique challenges and opportunities of our State. I also commend the \ncontributions of John's longtime partner and wife, Sherry, and thank \nher for her sacrifice on behalf of Alaskans. John will be sorely missed \nas director of State and Federal relations for the State of Alaska. I \nonly hope that he continues his distinguished service to Alaskans in \nthe next phase of his life--and I wish him all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/05/senate-section/article/S8182-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/05/senate-section/article/S8182-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/05/senate-section/article/S8182-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 527.

Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1942\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Transportation and \n     Mobility Improvement Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to projections from the 2010 decennial \n     census, the number of individuals in the United States who \n     are 65 years of age or older will increase from 40,000,000 in \n     2010 to 72,000,000 in 2030. Yet, a 2004 report by the Surface \n     Transportation Policy Project found that more than 1 in 5 (or \n     21 percent) of individuals who are 65 years of age or older \n     do not drive.\n       (2) According to a 2011 report by the National Association \n     of Area Agencies on Aging, inadequate transportation options \n     for older adults has emerged as the second greatest challenge \n     identified by communities during the 5-year period ending in \n     2011.\n       (3) According to a 2004 report by the Surface \n     Transportation Policy Project, more than \\1/2\\ of seniors who \n     are 65 years of age and older (numbering 3,600,000 \n     individuals) who no longer drive due to a decline in health, \n     stay at home on any given day partially because they lack \n     transportation options. Alternatives to driving are \n     particularly sparse in some regions and in rural and small \n     town communities.\n       (4) According to a 2004 report by the Surface \n     Transportation Policy Project, compared with older drivers, \n     older non-drivers in the United States make 15 percent fewer \n     trips to the doctor, 59 percent fewer shopping trips, and 65 \n     percent fewer trips for social, family, and religious \n     activities.\n       (5) In 2009, the program under section 5310 of title 49, \n     United States Code, provided more than 43,000,000 rides to \n     older adults and people with disabilities.\n       (6) Access to mobility management services help transit and \n     human services systems meet the needs of older adults and \n     people with disabilities. This person-centered strategy helps \n     individuals and families review available transportation \n     options and support their decisions regarding the \n     transportation options that are best suited to their \n     circumstances, preferences and mobility needs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to create jobs by providing payroll tax relief for \nmiddle class families and businesses, and for other purposes; read the \nfirst time.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am here to speak about legislation I am \nintroducing today that will prevent a huge tax hike from hitting \nworking families across America and in Pennsylvania.\n  As the clock continues to tick down, it is imperative we come \ntogether--Democrats and Republicans, Members of both parties, in both \nChambers--and pass legislation to provide more take-home pay by cutting \nthe payroll tax, as we did in 2010.\n  The legislation I am introducing is a compromise offer designed to \nbridge the gap and to get at least 60 votes in the Senate.\n  The legislation is fully paid for and includes measures that have \nreceived bipartisan support in the past. We can no longer afford to \njeopardize middle-income Americans in order to protect the wealthiest \nfew across our country.\n  This legislation will help working families by extending the current \npayroll tax cut and expanding that cut to a 3.1-percent level--a 3.1-\npercent reduction in the payroll tax. In essence, what we are talking \nabout is cutting the payroll tax in half as it relates to employees.\n  Small businesses will benefit from this legislation by benefiting \ndirectly from the additional money in the pockets of Americans across \nthe country.\n  Those with incomes above $1 million should help in carrying a portion \nof this burden, and that is why the surtax is still in this \nlegislation, but the surtax will now be only 1.9 percent, compared to \nthe 3.25-percent in an earlier version of my legislation.\n  In addition, I have offered a few more offsets that have received \nbipartisan support.\n  The bottom line is--just as the first bill was that I offered--this \nlegislation is indeed paid for.\n  The tax cut is key and an essential ingredient to job creation and \neconomic growth in 2012. Economists and forecasters--from Moody's \nAnalytics to RBC Capital Markets, to Barclay's Capital, to \nMacroeconomic Advisers--have all emphasized that the tax cut will \naccelerate growth in 2012. Without it, economic growth will slow and \njob creation will take a hit.\n  Mark Zandi, of Moody's Analytics, has said that without the payroll \ntax cut for 2012, ``we'll likely go into recession.''\n  Congress should act quickly to expand tax relief and remove the \nuncertainty for working families in this holiday season about whether \ntheir taxes\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\nwill go up in the new year. More take-home pay to keep the economy \ngrowing is what we need right now--and especially in the year ahead.\n  I encourage all our colleagues in the Senate, as well as those in the \nHouse, to pass this legislation to continue and to expand a cut in the \npayroll tax.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n        Cornyn, and Mr. Blumenthal):\n  S. 1945. A bill to permit the televising of Supreme Court \nproceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 1945\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO TITLE 28.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 45 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 678. Televising Supreme Court proceedings\n\n       ``The Supreme Court shall permit television coverage of all \n     open sessions of the Court unless the Court decides, by a \n     vote of the majority of justices, that allowing such coverage \n     in a particular case would constitute a violation of the due \n     process rights of 1 or more of the parties before the \n     Court.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The chapter analysis for chapter \n     45 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by inserting \n     at the end the following:\n\n``678. Televising Supreme Court proceedings.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Nelson, of Florida, Mr. \n        Bennet, Mrs. McCaskill, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1946. A bill to require foreign manufacturers of products imported \ninto the United States to establish registered agents in the United \nStates who are authorized to accept service of process against such \nmanufacturers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nForeign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act of 2011, which I am \nintroducing today with Senator Sessions, Senator Durbin, Senator \nGraham, Senator Leahy, Senator Feinstein, Senator Nelson of Florida, \nSenator Bennet, Senator McCaskill, and Senator Pryor.\n  This bipartisan bill is an important step in protecting American \nconsumers and businesses from injuries caused by defective products \nmanufactured outside the United States. Those products hurt American \nconsumers--they lead to serious injuries, and even death--and they hurt \nthe American businesses that must deal with angry customers, product \nrecalls, and unusable inventory.\n  The list of recent examples of Americans injured by defective foreign \nproducts is shocking. Sadly, the situation is no better than when we \nfirst introduced this legislation in 2009. A recent rash of cases \ninvolving children's toys is particularly chilling because children are \nso susceptible to the effects of defective products, and because there \nis no worse nightmare as a parent than seeing harm befall your child, \nparticularly when that harm is preventable.\n  The following are just a few of the many examples of defective and \ndangerous toys and children's products that are being sold to unknowing \nparents:\n  On October 27, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced a \nsettlement with a foreign toy maker because a line of its craft kits \ncontained beads that were, unbelievably, coated with the chemical GHB, \nalso known as ``the date-rape drug.'' Children who swallowed the beads \nbecame comatose, developed respiratory depression, or had seizures. \nOver 4.2 million of these toys were sold.\n  A week earlier, a line of wooden peg toys made by a foreign \nmanufacturer were recalled for having small parts that could choke \ntoddlers.\n  Earlier this year, there was a recall of jewelry marketed to children \n12 years old and under because it contained cadmium, which can cause \ncancer. The cadmium levels in these products were as high as 2,300 \ntimes the legal limit in California, where the jewelry was distributed.\n  Foreign toys have been found to contain dangerous levels of lead. In \n2007, a major toy company was forced to recall 18.6 million foreign-\nmade toys for containing lead or dangerous magnets. The same year, \nanother major company had to recall more than 1.6 million foreign-made \ntoys for containing lead. In 2006, a foreign-made, lead-tainted charm \nbracelet claimed the life of a 4-year-old. The autopsy demonstrated \nthat the charm was 99 percent lead, 1,650 times more than the 0.06 \npercent lead limit specified in enforcement guidelines for children's \njewelry.\n  However, it is not just toys and other children's products that pose \nrisks. In 2008, a contaminated blood thinner from a foreign \nmanufacturer caused severe medical reactions and contributed to \nnumerous deaths. Imported food products from seafood to honey have been \ncontaminated with unthinkable chemicals, including veterinary drugs \nbanned in domestic production, potentially harmful antibiotics, and \nunapproved food additives. Tens of millions of packages of pet food \ncontaminated with tainted wheat gluten have been recalled. Substandard \ntires have failed, leading to fatalities. Defective drywall imported \nfrom China has been found to contain excessively high levels of sulfur, \ncausing houses to smell like rotten eggs, corroding copper wiring, \nmaking expensive appliances fail, causing respiratory an other health \nproblems, and making homes unlivable. Thousands of homes have been \naffected. I am very pleased that tomorrow Senator Pryor will chair an \nimportant hearing of the Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Consumer \nProtection, Product Safety, and Insurance, focusing on this \ncontaminated drywall, and its awful consequences.\n  At a hearing that I chaired in 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts explored the \nlegal hurdles facing consumers who are injured by defective foreign \nproducts and by businesses that find that their foreign partners refuse \nto honor their contracts. These hurdles allow foreign manufacturers to \ninjure American businesses and consumers with impunity. They also put \nAmerican manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage since they allow \nforeign manufacturers to offer cheaper products that do not comply with \nAmerican safety requirements.\n  Two major hurdles to proper accountability are the inability to serve \nprocess on the foreign manufacturer and the ability of that foreign \nmanufacturer, even if served, to evade the jurisdiction of American \ncourts. Legislation to address these issues is both necessary and \nappropriate. The Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act \naddresses both concerns.\n  The first problem, the inability to serve process on a manufacturer, \nessentially means that it is difficult for an American to give a \nforeign manufacturer the legally required notice that it is the subject \nof a lawsuit. This sounds like a simple step, and it should be. \nUnfortunately, however, it is very hard to serve process on foreign \ncompanies abroad. Service abroad is complicated by the Hague Convention \non the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extra Judicial Documents in Civil \nand Commercial Matters, to which the United States is a signatory. \nUnder that convention, a complaint must be translated into the foreign \nlanguage, transmitted to the Central Authority in the foreign country, \nand then delivered according to the rules of service in the home \ncountry of the defendant. This can cause months and even years of \ndelay, not to mention great expense for Americans.\n  The Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act will allow \nAmericans to overcome that procedural hurdle by serving legal papers \ninside the United States on registered agents of foreign manufacturers. \nThe bill requires the heads of Federal Government agencies such as the \nFood and Drug Administration to pass regulations requiring that foreign \nmanufacturers of products regulated by their agencies register an agent \nwho will accept service of process. It allows regulators to exclude \nmanufacturers who only import a minimal amount of products into the \nUnited States. It imposes a minimal burden on foreign manufacturers, \nsince they would only have to appoint one agent to accept service of \nprocess for all State and Federal regulatory and civil actions anywhere \nin the United\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\nStates. The bill allows the manufacturer to choose any location for \nthat agent with a ``substantial connection to the importation, \ndistribution, or sale'' of their products. This clear and \nstraightforward system will allow Americans to commence their lawsuits \nfairly and promptly, and ensure that foreign manufacturers have proper \nand fair notice of the proceedings brought against them. It will not \nconflict with American obligations under the Hague convention, since \nthat convention applies to service of process on foreign manufacturers \nin their home countries, not in the United States.\n  The second hurdle, the inability to establish personal jurisdiction \nover foreign manufacturers, can end a lawsuit against a foreign \nmanufacturer before it even begins. Think about how unfair this is. A \nforeign manufacturer sells its defective products in the United States, \ninjures American consumers and businesses, and then argues that it is \nnot subject to the courts in the state where the American was injured--\nin legal parlance, that the courts do not have personal jurisdiction \nover it. Foreign manufacturers raise this technical legal defense to \navoid liability even when serious injuries or even death have been \ncaused by their products--their defective tires, fireworks, exercise \nequipment, bikes, and toys.\n  The Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act will enable \ninjured Americans to surmount this hurdle. It will make clear to \nforeign manufacturers that by importing their products into the United \nStates and by registering an agent in the United States, they are \nconsenting to the jurisdiction of the courts in the state where their \nagent is located. By consenting to jurisdiction, the manufacturers will \nbe unable to engage in unnecessary and expensive legislation about \ntechnical legal issues and allow courts to settle the merits of \ndisputes. This approach is fair to foreign manufacturers since all \nAmerican manufacturers are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of \nat least one state. This bill therefore complies with the trade \nprinciple that we should not subject foreign manufacturers to burdens \nnot already imposed on domestic manufacturers.\n  Indeed, the Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act is \nultimately about fairness. We all know American manufacturers comply \nwith regulations that ensure the safety of American consumers and \nbusinesses. When they fail to do so, they must answer to regulators and \nare held accountable through the American tort system. Unfortunately, \nforeign manufacturers are not being held to the same standards--\ninjuring American consumers and businesses, and putting American \nmanufacturers at a competitive disadvantage. We must level the playing \nfield for all manufacturers and provide justice for American consumers \nand businesses. The Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act will \nallow us to make a major step in that direction. It covers major \nproduct categories including consumer goods, drugs, cosmetics, and \nchemicals, and it requires relevant agencies to study workable \napproaches to ensure that foreign food producers also are brought \nwithin the ambit of the American legal system.\n  Because of its benefits to consumers, this legislation has the \nsupport of several leading consumer groups, including Consumers Union, \nConsumer Federation of America, U.S. PIRG, and the National Association \nof Consumer Advocates.\n  Protecting Americans and holding foreign manufacturers accountable \nwhen their products harm American consumers and businesses is a \nbipartisan issue. Everyone agrees that we should do what we can to keep \nAmericans safe from defective products. So too, I think, do we all \nagree that American companies should not be at a competitive \ndisadvantage to their foreign counterparts.

GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element of the \n     Ballistic Missile Defense System was deployed initially in \n     2004 as a contingency capability to provide initial \n     protection of the United States homeland against potential \n     limited long-range missile attacks by nations such as North \n     Korea and Iran.\n       (2) As the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation has \n     reported, prior to the decision in December 2002 to deploy \n     the system, an operationally representative variant of the \n     Ground-Based Interceptor had not been flight-tested.\n       (3) As the Department of Defense and the Government \n     Accountability Office have acknowledged, the Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense system experienced high levels of \n     concurrency in development and deployment, which led to a \n     number of problems. In April 2011, the Missile Defense Agency \n     acknowledged that the system ``is still evolving and has not \n     attained a stable configuration between missiles. It is still \n     an `operational prototype' system''.\n       (4) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation \n     reported in December 2010 that there have not been enough \n     flight tests of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system to \n     permit an objective assessment of its operational \n     effectiveness, suitability data remain insufficient, \n     evaluation of survivability remains limited, and a ``full \n     end-to end performance assessment is still a minimum of 6 \n     years away''.\n       (5) As is to be expected from a developmental system, the \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system has experienced a \n     number of technical problems in flight tests. Many of these \n     problems have been resolved with further development, as \n     demonstrated in successful flight tests. The system has been \n     under continuous improvement since it was first deployed, but \n     has not yet obtained desired levels of effectiveness, \n     suitability, or reliability.\n       (6) In 2009, the Secretary of Defense announced that the \n     Department of Defense would refocus efforts on improving the \n     operational capability, reliability, and availability of the \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system in order to maintain \n     its ability to stay ahead of projected threats from North \n     Korea and Iran for the foreseeable future.\n       (7) In February 2010 the Ballistic Missile Defense Review \n     stated the United States is currently protected against \n     limited intercontinental ballistic missile attacks as a \n     result of investments made over the past decade in the \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense system and reiterated the \n     commitment to improving the operational capability, \n     reliability, and availability of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense System.\n       (8) The two most recent flight tests of the Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense system, using the newest Capability \n     Enhancement-2 Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) design, each \n     failed to achieve the intended interception of a target.\n       (9) The two most recent flight tests are not indicative of \n     the functionality of the Capability Enhancement-1 Exo-\n     atmospheric Kill Vehicle design, which continues to provide \n     the United States protection against a limited \n     intercontinental ballistic missile attack.\n       (10) The Missile Defense Agency established a Failure \n     Review Board to determine the root cause of the December 2010 \n     flight-test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system. Its analysis will inform the proposed correction of \n     the problem causing the flight-test failure.\n       (11) The Missile Defense Agency plans to design a \n     correction of the problem causing the December 2010 flight-\n     test failure and to verify the correction through extensive \n     modeling and simulation, ground testing, and two flight \n     tests, the first of which will not be an interception test.\n       (12) Until completing the verification of its corrective \n     action, the Missile Defense Agency has suspended further \n     production of Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicles to ensure that \n     potential flaws are not incorporated into them, and to permit \n     any corrective action that may be needed to Exo-atmospheric \n     Kill Vehicles at minimal cost and schedule risk.\n       (13) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency has \n     testified that the Missile Defense Agency has sufficient \n     funding available and planned for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, \n     respectively, to implement the planned correction of the \n     problem causing the December 2010 flight-test failure.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is essential for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System to achieve \n     the levels of reliability, availability, sustainability, and \n     operational performance that will allow it to continue \n     providing protection of the United States homeland, \n     throughout its operational service life, against limited \n     future missile attacks from nations such as North Korea and \n     Iran;\n       (2) the Missile Defense Agency should, as its highest \n     priority, determine the root cause of the December 2010 \n     flight-test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n     system, design a correction of the problem causing the \n     flight-test failure, and verify through extensive testing \n     that such correction is effective and will allow the Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense system to reach levels described in \n     paragraph (1);\n       (3) before verifying the success of the correction of the \n     problem causing the December 2010 flight-test failure, the \n     Missile Defense Agency should suspend further production of \n     Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicles to ensure that they will not be \n     deployed with any component or design flaws that may have \n     caused the flight-test failure;\n       (4) after the Missile Defense Agency has verified the \n     correction of the problem causing the December 2010 flight-\n     test failure, including through the two previously unplanned \n     verification flight tests, the Agency should assess the need \n     for any additional Ground-Based Interceptors and any \n     additional steps needed for the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense testing and sustainment program; and\n       (5) the Department of Defense should plan for and budget \n     sufficient future funds for the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense program to ensure the ability to complete and verify \n     an effective correction of the problem causing the December \n     2010 flight-test failure, and to mitigate the effects of \n     corrective actions on previously planned program work that is \n     deferred as a result of such corrective actions.\n       (c) Reports.--\n       (1) Reports required.--Not later than 120 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and one year thereafter, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report describing the plan of the \n     Department of Defense to correct the problem causing the \n     December 2010 flight-test failure of the Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense system, and any progress toward the \n     achievement of that plan.\n       (2) Elements.--Each report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A detailed discussion of the plan to correct the \n     problem described in that paragraph, including plans for \n     diagnostic, design, testing, and manufacturing actions.\n       (B) A detailed discussion of any results obtained from the \n     plan described in subparagraph (A) as of the date of such \n     report, including diagnostic, design, testing, or \n     manufacturing results.\n       (C) A description of any cost or schedule impact of the \n     plan on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program, including \n     on testing, production, refurbishment, or deferred work.\n       (D) A description of any planned adjustments to the Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense program as a result of the \n     implementation of the plan, including future programmatic, \n     schedule, testing, or funding adjustments.\n       (E) A description of any enhancements to the capability of \n     the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system achieved or planned \n     since the submittal of the budget for fiscal year 2010 \n     pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code.\n       (3) Form.--Each report required by paragraph (1) shall be \n     in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For more than a decade, the United States and Russia \n     have discussed a variety of options for cooperation on shared \n     early warning and ballistic missile defense. For example, on \n     May 1,\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\n     2001, President George W. Bush spoke of a ``new cooperative \n     relationship'' with Russia and said it ``should be premised \n     on openness, mutual confidence and real opportunities for \n     cooperation, including the area of missile defense. It should \n     allow us to share information so that each nation can improve \n     its early warning capability, and its capability to defend \n     its people and territory. And perhaps one day, we can even \n     cooperate in a joint defense''.\n       (2) Section 1231 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law \n     by Public Law 106-398; 1654A-329) authorized the Department \n     of Defense to establish in Russia a ``joint center for the \n     exchange of data from systems to provide early warning of \n     launches of ballistic missiles and for notification of \n     launches of such missiles'', also known as the Joint Data \n     Exchange Center (JDEC).\n       (3) On March 31, 2008, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon \n     England stated that ``we have offered Russia a wide-ranging \n     proposal to cooperate on missile defense--everything from \n     modeling and simulation, to data sharing, to joint \n     development of a regional missile defense architecture--all \n     designed to defend the United States, Europe, and Russia from \n     the growing threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. An \n     extraordinary series of transparency measures have also been \n     offered to reassure Russia. Despite some Russian reluctance \n     to sign up to these cooperative missile defense activities, \n     we continue to work toward this goal''.\n       (4) On July 6, 2009, President Barack Obama and Russian \n     President Dmitry Medvedev issued a joint statement on missile \n     defense issues, which stated that ``Russia and the United \n     States plan to continue the discussion concerning the \n     establishment of cooperation in responding to the challenge \n     of ballistic missile proliferation. . . We have instructed \n     our experts to work together to analyze the ballistic missile \n     challenges of the 21st century and to prepare appropriate \n     recommendations''.\n       (5) The February 2010 report of the Ballistic Missile \n     Defense Review established as one of its central policy \n     pillars that increased international missile defense \n     cooperation is in the national security interest of the \n     United States and, with regard to cooperation with Russia, \n     the United States ``is pursuing a broad agenda focused on \n     shared early warning of missile launches, possible technical \n     cooperation, and even operational cooperation''.\n       (6) at the November 2010 Lisbon Summit, the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to develop a missile \n     defense system to ``protect NATO European populations, \n     territory and forces'' and also to seek cooperation with \n     Russia on missile defense. In its Lisbon Summit Declaration, \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization reaffirmed its \n     readiness to ``invite Russia to explore jointly the potential \n     for linking current and planned missile defence systems at an \n     appropriate time in mutually beneficial ways''. The new NATO \n     Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon Summit states that \n     ``we will actively seek cooperation on missile defence with \n     Russia'', that ``NATO-Russia cooperation is of strategic \n     importance'', and that ``the security of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization and Russia is intertwined''.\n       (7) In a December 18, 2010, letter to the leadership of the \n     Senate, President Obama wrote that the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization ``invited Russia to cooperate on missile \n     defense, which could lead to adding Russian capabilities to \n     those deployed by NATO to enhance our common security against \n     common threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the \n     Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving \n     NATO-Russian relations. This comes even as we have made clear \n     that the system we intend to pursue with Russia will not be a \n     joint system, and it will not in any way limit United States' \n     or NATO's missile defense capabilities. Effective cooperation \n     with Russia could enhance the overall efficiency of our \n     combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time \n     provide Russia with greater security''.\n       (8) Section 221(a)(3) of the Ike Skelton National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; \n     124 Stat. 4167) states that it is the sense of Congress ``to \n     support the efforts of the United States Government and the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization to pursue cooperation with \n     the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense relative \n     to Iranian missile threats''.\n       (9) In a speech in Russia on March 21, 2011, Secretary of \n     Defense Robert Gates cited ``the NATO-Russian decision to \n     cooperate on defense against ballistic missiles. We've \n     disagreed before, and Russia still has uncertainties about \n     the European Phased Adaptive Approach, a limited system that \n     poses no challenges to the large Russian nuclear arsenal. \n     However, we've mutually committed to resolving these \n     difficulties in order to develop a roadmap toward truly \n     effective anti-ballistic missile collaboration. This \n     collaboration may include exchanging launch information, \n     setting up a joint data fusion center, allowing greater \n     transparency with respect to our missile defense plans and \n     exercises, and conducting a joint analysis to determine areas \n     of future cooperation''.\n       (10) In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on April 13, 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy Bradley H. \n     Roberts stated that the United States has been pursuing a \n     Defense Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia since \n     2004, and that such an agreement is necessary ``for the \n     safeguarding of sensitive information in support of \n     cooperation'' on missile defense, and to ``provide the legal \n     framework for undertaking cooperative efforts.'' Further, Dr. \n     Roberts stated that the United States would not provide any \n     classified information to Russia without first conducting a \n     National Disclosure Policy review. He also stated that the \n     United States is not considering sharing ``hit-to-kill'' \n     technology with Russia.\n       (11) The United States and Russia already engage in \n     substantial cooperation on a number of international security \n     efforts, including nuclear nonproliferation, anti-piracy, \n     counter-narcotics, nuclear security, counter-terrorism, and \n     logistics resupply through Russia of coalition forces in \n     Afghanistan. These areas of cooperation require each side to \n     share and protect sensitive information, which they have both \n     done successfully.\n       (12) The United States currently has shared early warning \n     agreements and programs of cooperation with eight nations in \n     addition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The \n     United States has developed procedures and mechanisms for \n     sharing early warning information with partner nations while \n     ensuring the protection of sensitive United States \n     information.\n       (13) Russia and the United States each have missile launch \n     early warning and detection and tracking sensors that could \n     contribute to and enhance each others' ability to detect, \n     track, an defend against ballistic missile threats from Iran.\n       (14) The Obama Administration has provided regular \n     briefings to Congress on its discussions with Russia on \n     possible missile defense cooperation.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with \n     Russia that would enhance the security of the United States, \n     its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, and Russia, \n     particularly against missile threats from Iran;\n       (2) the United States should pursue ballistic missile \n     defense cooperation with Russia on both a bilateral basis and \n     a multilateral basis with its North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies, particularly through the NATO-Russia \n     Council;\n       (3) missile defense cooperation with Russia should not ``in \n     any way limit United States' or NATO's missile defense \n     capabilities'', as acknowledged in the December 18, 2010, \n     letter from President Obama to the leadership of the Senate, \n     and should be mutually beneficial and reciprocal in nature; \n     and\n       (4) the United States should pursue missile defense \n     cooperation with Russia in a manner that ensures that--\n       (A) United States classified information is appropriately \n     safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure;\n       (B) prior to sharing classified information with Russia, \n     the United States conducts a National Disclosure Policy \n     review and determines the types and levels of information \n     that may be shared and whether any additional procedures are \n     necessary to protect such information;\n       (C) prior to entering into missile defense technology \n     cooperation projects, the United States enters into a Defense \n     Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia that establishes \n     the legal framework for a broad spectrum of potential \n     cooperative defense projects; and\n       (D) such cooperation does not limit the missile defense \n     capabilities of the United States or its North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization allies.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit \n     to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the \n     status of efforts to reach agreement with Russia on missile \n     defense cooperation.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) \n     shall include the following:\n       (A) A summary of the status of discussions between the \n     United States and Russia, and between the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization and Russia, on efforts to agree on \n     missile defense cooperation.\n       (B) A description of any agreements reached pursuant to \n     such discussions, and any specific cooperative measures \n     agreed, implemented, or planned.\n       (C) A discussion of the manner in which such cooperative \n     measures would enhance the security of the United States, and \n     the manner in which such cooperative measures fit within the \n     larger context of United States-Russian cooperation on \n     international security.\n       (D) A description of the status of efforts to conclude a \n     bilateral Defense Technology Cooperation Agreement with \n     Russia.\n       (E) A description of the status of any National Disclosure \n     Policy Review relative to the possible sharing of classified \n     information with Russia concerning missile defense \n     cooperation.\n       (F) A discussion of the actions that are being taken or are \n     planned to be taken to safeguard United States classified \n     information in any agreement or discussions with Russia \n     concerning missile defense cooperation.\n       (3) Form of report.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a \n     classified annex.\n       (4) Appropriate committees of congress defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Relations, \n     and Appropriations of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committees on Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, and \n     Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 234.

A new approach is needed''.\n       (3) The National Security Strategy-May 2010 calls for such \n     a transformation of the United States national security \n     system through its identification of organizational changes \n     already underway, its recommendation of additional \n     organizational changes to be undertaken, and its commitment \n     to strengthening national capacity through a whole-of-\n     government approach.\n       (4) The realization of these organizational goals can best \n     be assured by the preparation of a report by the President on \n     progress being made on organizational changes already \n     underway and on an implementation plan for the organizational \n     changes newly recommended in the National Security Strategy.\n       (b) Plan To Implement Recommendations Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report setting forth a \n     plan to implement the organizational goals recommended in the \n     National Security Strategy-May 2010.\n       (2) Elements.--The report required under this subsection \n     shall include the following:\n       (A) A progress report identifying each organizational \n     change identified by the National Security Strategy as \n     already underway, including for each such change the \n     following:\n       (i) The goal such organizational change seeks to achieve.\n       (ii) The actions required of the Executive Branch to \n     achieve such goal.\n       (iii) The actions required of Congress to achieve such \n     goal.\n       (iv) The preferred sequencing of the executive and \n     legislative actions specified under clauses (ii) and (iii).\n       (v) The preferred timetable for such executive and \n     legislative actions and for achievement of such goal.\n       (vi) The progress that has already been achieved toward \n     such goal, and the obstacles that have been encountered.\n       (B) An implementation plan addressing each organizational \n     change newly recommended by the National Security Strategy, \n     including for each such change the following:\n       (i) The goal such organizational change seeks to achieve.\n       (ii) The actions required of the Executive Branch to \n     achieve such goal.\n       (iii) The actions required of Congress to achieve such \n     goal.\n       (iv) The preferred sequencing of the executive and \n     legislative actions specified under clauses (ii) and (iii).\n       (v) The preferred timetable for such executive and \n     legislative actions and for achievement of such goal.\n       (c) Annual Update.--Not later than December 1 in each year \n     following the year in which the report required by subsection \n     (b) is submitted, the President shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress an update of the report \n     setting forth a description of the following:\n       (1) The progress made in achieving each organizational goal \n     covered by the report required by subsection (b).\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\n       (2) The modifications necessary to the plan required by \n     subsection (b) in light of the experience of the Executive \n     Branch in implementing the plan.\n       (d) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services, Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, Committee on Homeland Security and Government \n     Affairs, Committee on the Budget, Committee on the Judiciary, \n     Committee on Appropriations, and Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Armed Services, Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs, Committee on Homeland Security, Committee on the \n     Budget, Committee on the Judiciary, Committee on Oversight \n     and Government Reform, Committee on Appropriations, and \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 1073.

Robert Kehler stated, ``The stockpile \n     under New START is appropriately sized to meet our deterrence \n     requirements and manage risk associated with our aging \n     systems and infrastructure. A recapitalized nuclear \n     infrastructure could also support potential reductions in the \n     future non-deployed stockpile.''.\n       (2) In response to an additional question for the record \n     from that hearing, General Kehler stated, ``Completion of \n     critical stockpile sustainment activities and restoration of \n     [the National Nuclear Security Administration's] production \n     infrastructure could enable future reductions in the quantity \n     of non-deployed warheads currently held to mitigate weapon \n     and infrastructure risk.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) sustained investments in the nuclear weapons stockpile \n     and the nuclear security complex are needed to ensure a \n     reliable nuclear deterrent; and\n       (2) such investments could enable additional future \n     reductions in the hedge stockpile.\n       (c) Report Required.--Not later than March 1, 2012, and \n     annually thereafter, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to \n     the congressional defense committees a report on the nuclear \n     weapons stockpile of the United States that includes the \n     following:\n       (1) An accounting of the weapons in the stockpile as of the \n     end of the fiscal year preceding the submission of the report \n     that includes deployed and non-deployed weapons, including \n     each category of non-deployed weapon.\n       (2) The planned force levels for each category of nuclear \n     weapon over the course of the future-years defense program \n     submitted to Congress under section 221 of title 10, United \n     States Code, for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in \n     which the report is submitted.\n\n     SEC. 1075. NUCLEAR EMPLOYMENT STRATEGY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     any future modification to the nuclear employment strategy of \n     the United States should maintain or enhance the ability of \n     the nuclear forces of the United States to support the goals \n     of the United States with respect to nuclear deterrence, \n     extended deterrence, and assurances for allies, and the \n     defense of the United States.\n       (b) Reports on Modification of Strategy.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 23 title 10, United States Code, \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 491.

IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE \n                   FINANCIAL SECTOR OF IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On November 21, 2011, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     issued a finding under section 5318A of title 31, United \n     States Code, that identified Iran as a jurisdiction of \n     primary money laundering concern.\n       (2) In that finding, the Financial Crimes Enforcement \n     Network of the Department of the Treasury wrote, ``The \n     Central Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, has \n     assisted designated Iranian banks by transferring billions of \n     dollars to these banks in 2011. In mid-2011, the CBI \n     transferred several billion dollars to designated banks, \n     including Saderat, Mellat, EDBI and Melli, through a variety \n     of payment schemes. In making these transfers, the CBI \n     attempted to evade sanctions by minimizing the direct \n     involvement of large international banks with both CBI and \n     designated Iranian banks.''.\n       (3) On November 22, 2011, the Under Secretary of the \n     Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, David \n     Cohen, wrote, ``Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian \n     banking sector, including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing \n     terrorist financing, proliferation financing, and money \n     laundering risks for the global financial system.''.\n       (b) Designation of Financial Sector of Iran as of Primary \n     Money Laundering Concern.--The financial sector of Iran, \n     including the Central Bank of Iran, is designated as of \n     primary money laundering concern for purposes of section \n     5318A of title 31, United States Code, because of the threat \n     to government and financial institutions resulting from the \n     illicit activities of the Government of Iran, including its \n     pursuit of nuclear weapons, support for international \n     terrorism, and efforts to deceive responsible financial \n     institutions and evade sanctions.\n       (c) Freezing of Assets of Iranian Financial Institutions.--\n     The President shall, pursuant to the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), block and \n     prohibit all transactions in all property and interests in \n     property of an Iranian financial institution if such property \n     and interests in property are in the United States, come \n     within the United States, or are or come within the \n     possession or control of a United States person.\n       (d) Imposition of Sanctions With Respect to the Central \n     Bank of Iran and Other Iranian Financial Institutions.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as specifically provided in this \n     subsection, beginning on the date that is 60 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the President--\n       (A) shall prohibit the opening or maintaining in the United \n     States of a correspondent account or a payable-through \n     account by a foreign financial institution that the President \n     determines has knowingly conducted or facilitated any \n     significant financial transaction with the Central Bank of \n     Iran or another Iranian financial institution designated by \n     the Secretary of the Treasury for the imposition of sanctions \n     pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n     (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.); and\n       (B) may impose sanctions pursuant to the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) with \n     respect to the Central Bank of Iran.\n       (2) Exception for sales of food, medicine, and medical \n     devices.--The President may not impose sanctions under \n     paragraph (1) with respect to any person for conducting or \n     facilitating a transaction for the sale of food, medicine, or \n     medical devices to Iran.\n       (3) Applicability of sanctions with respect to foreign \n     central banks.--Except as provided in paragraph (4), \n     sanctions imposed under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply with \n     respect to a foreign financial institution owned or \n     controlled by the government of a foreign country, including \n     a central bank of a foreign country, only insofar as it \n     engages in a financial transaction for the sale or purchase \n     of petroleum or petroleum products to or from Iran conducted \n     or facilitated on or after that date that is 180 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (4) Applicability of sanctions with respect to petroleum \n     transactions.--\n       (A) Report required.--Not later than 60 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and every 60 days thereafter, \n     the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, \n     in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall \n     submit to Congress a report on the availability and price of \n     petroleum and petroleum products produced in countries other \n     than Iran in the 60-day period preceding the submission of \n     the report.\n       (B) Determination required.--Not later than 90 days after \n     the date of the enactment of the Act, and every 180 days \n     thereafter, the President shall make a determination, based \n     on the reports required by subparagraph (A), of whether the \n     price and supply of petroleum and petroleum products produced \n     in countries other than Iran is sufficient to permit \n     purchasers of petroleum and petroleum products from Iran to \n     reduce significantly in volume their purchases from Iran.\n       (C) Application of sanctions.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (D), sanctions imposed under paragraph (1)(A) \n     shall apply with respect to a financial transaction conducted \n     or facilitated by a foreign financial institution on or after \n     the date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products \n     from Iran if the President determines pursuant to \n     subparagraph (B) that there is a sufficient supply of \n     petroleum and petroleum products from countries other\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\n     than Iran to permit a significant reduction in the volume of \n     petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or \n     through foreign financial institutions.\n       (D) Exception.--Sanctions imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) \n     shall not apply with respect to a foreign financial \n     institution if the President determines and reports to \n     Congress, not later than 90 days after the date on which the \n     President makes the determination required by subparagraph \n     (B), and every 180 days thereafter, that the country with \n     primary jurisdiction over the foreign financial institution \n     has significantly reduced its volume of crude oil purchases \n     from Iran during the period beginning on the date on which \n     the President submitted the last report with respect to the \n     country under this subparagraph.\n       (5) Waiver.--The President may waive the imposition of \n     sanctions under paragraph (1) for a period of not more than \n     120 days, and may renew that waiver for additional periods of \n     not more than 120 days, if the President--\n       (A) determines that such a waiver is vital to the national \n     security of the United States;

and\n       (ii) to prohibit purchases by Iran of--\n\n       (I) military or dual-use technology, including items--\n\n       (aa) in the Annex to the to the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime Guidelines;\n       (bb) in the Annex on Chemicals to the Convention on the \n     Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and \n     Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, done at \n     Paris January 13, 1993, and entered into force April 29, 1997 \n     (commonly known as the ``Chemical Weapons Convention'');\n       (cc) in Part 1 or 2 of the Nuclear Suppliers Group \n     Guidelines;
