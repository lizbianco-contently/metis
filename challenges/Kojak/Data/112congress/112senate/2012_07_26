Mr. President, I would now yield to the senior Senator from \nthe State of Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Pastor John Fuller\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is my privilege to introduce Pastor \nJohn Fuller to my fellow Senators, and I thank Pastor Fuller for \nopening the Senate with prayer. It is my privilege to highlight my home \npastor and church.\n  Pastor Fuller and his wife Kay are visiting the Nation's Capital this \nweek.\n  Since 1998 Pastor Fuller has been the senior pastor at Prairie Lakes \nChurch in Cedar Falls, IA. Pastor Fuller is a native of Iowa. He was \nborn in Onawa and grew up in Sloan. His family moved to Sheridan, WY, \nwhen he was in the eighth grade. He graduated from high school in \nSheridan. He played both high school and college football. He is to \nthis day obviously a die-hard Broncos fan. You won't know that, but I \nsure know it. He is a 1986 graduate of the University of Sioux Falls \nand a 1990 graduate of Denver Seminary with a master's of divinity \ndegree.\n  He was an associate and preaching pastor at First Baptist Church in \nForest City, IA, before coming to Cedar Falls in 1998, to Prairie Lakes \nChurch, and has been senior pastor. I have been worshipping at Prairie \nLakes Church for 58 years come this August 29. The church has changed \nits name and increased its congregation over the years, but its heart \nhas remained the same and very constant.\n  In 1855 a small group known as the Baptist Society started this \nchurch. In 1862 it became the First Baptist Church. The first 45 years \nthat I worshipped at First Baptist Church, at various times the \ncongregation numbered 200 to 300 people. Under Pastor Fuller's \nleadership, the number of worshipers has grown to about 2,000, with \nworship centers in Osage, Waterloo, and soon in Grennell, IA, besides \nthe main campus in Cedar Falls, IA. In 2005 a new building was \nconstructed, and the name of the congregation then became Prairie Lakes \nChurch.\n\n  The worship service is very informal. That has changed in the 58 \nyears I have attended there, but the service has always been Christ-\ncentered, and that has not changed. Prairie Lakes Church\n\n[[Page S5420]]\n\nis multigenerational, with an extraordinary vision for the future. \nWorship services are heartfelt, creative, practical, Bible-based, and \nhere to serve Christ and here to serve all--those who just stepped over \nthe faith line as well as those who have been longtime followers of \nJesus Christ.\n  Prairie Lakes Church is affiliated with the Baptist General \nConference. Prairie Lakes Church is all about loving God, loving \npeople, and influencing the world. Everyone is invited to worship with \nus--including anybody here in Washington, DC--through streaming online \nat prairielakeschurch.org.\n  In closing, I would remind all, according to the Scriptures, in \nCorinthians, we are all called to be ambassadors of Christ, and that is \nhow I see Pastor Fuller.\n  I am also grateful to Pastor Fuller for his leadership and \nfaithfulness to this congregation. After 58 years, in my looking back, \nI know God's word has been preached faithfully at this congregation. \nPastor Fuller has contributed significantly during his tenure and \ncontinues to do so.\n  This is what Pastor Fuller had to say about our church:\n\n       There are a lot of good churches around the valley. We're \n     lucky to have that. I think people get attracted here because \n     we just stick with the Bible. We're authentic. We're \n     invitational, and we try to keep things simple.\n\n  These attributes have attracted many, and I believe they will \ncontinue to attract many more and the church will continue to grow.\n  Lastly, I pray that God will continue to shine His light through \nPastor Fuller, his family, and the Prairie Lakes congregation. It is my \nprivilege once again to introduce Pastor Fuller to this Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend's remarks about his \npastor. They were very well thought out, and I appreciate them very \nmuch.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the first hour here today will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. The \nmajority will control the first half and the Republicans the final \nhalf.\n  I filed cloture last night on a motion to proceed to the \ncybersecurity bill. I hope we can reach an agreement to have that \ncloture vote sometime today. If not, we will have it tomorrow.\n  When a major storm ripped through the Mid-Atlantic region last month, \nit left millions of people without power--I repeat, millions of people. \nI was at my home here in Washington, which is different from my home in \nSearchlight, NV. In Searchlight, the wind blows a lot, so you can hear \nthe wind. It is kind of pleasant for me. But the wind we heard at our \nhome in Washington was not pleasant. At 9:30 or 10:00 at night, it was \nloud and it was abusive and it was, quite frankly, a little scary.\n  Our power was not affected, but that wasn't the case for millions of \nother people. Residents of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, and \nthe District of Columbia soon realized how quickly a major power outage \ncan alter life as we know it. I talked to Senator Manchin of West \nVirginia, and a week later power was still out in large parts of West \nVirginia. He said it was the worst storm they have ever known in West \nVirginia.\n  This power outage altered life as people knew it here in the entire \neastern part of the United States. The blackout was devastating to many \nfamilies and many businesses. But it was also minor compared to the \ndevastation that malicious cyber terrorists could wreak with a single \nkeystroke. I repeat, as damaging and frightening as this storm was, we \ncould have a malicious cyber attack by terrorists that would be far \nmore devastating than this violent storm. Cyber attackers could all too \neasily shut down the electric grid for the entire east coast, the west \ncoast, and the middle part of our country. Any one attack could leave \ndozens of major cities and tens of millions of Americans without power. \nWe know, because we were shown in a room here in the Capitol, how an \nattack could take place and what damage it would do, so we know this is \nnot just make-believe.\n  Without ATMs or debit card readers, commerce would immediately grind \nto a halt. My daughter, who lives here in the DC area, lost power when \nthe storm hit. They waited for a number of hours, and then they took \nall the food out of their freezer, they gave away what they could, and \nthey threw the rest away. And that was the way it was all over. Their \npower was out for about a week, and it made it very difficult. They are \nfortunate enough to have a basement, and the heat wasn't oppressive \ndown there.\n  Without refrigeration, food would rot on the shelves, the freezers \nwould have to be emptied, and people could actually go hungry. Without \ngas pumps, transportation arteries would clog with abandoned vehicles. \nWithout cell phones or computers, whole regions of the country would be \ncut off from communication and families would be unable to reach each \nother. Without air-conditioning and without lifesaving technology and \nthe service of hospitals and nursing homes, the elderly and sick would \nbecome much sicker and die. Most major hospitals have backup power, but \nit is only for a limited amount of time. It depends on how much fuel \nthey can store, and that is very limited.\n  The devastation is really unimaginable, but we have heard these \nominous scenarios before. What many Americans haven't considered is \nthat the same power grids that supply cities and towns, stores and gas \nstations, cell towers and heart monitors also power every military base \nin our country. About 99 percent of electricity used to power military \ninstallations comes from outside the bases. Nellis Air Force Base, one \nof the largest in the world of its type, has some solar energy there \nthat they have developed, but over 90 percent of their power, in spite \nof that, comes from outside the base, and more than 85 percent of that \npower is provided by the same electric utilities that power homes and \nbusinesses and schools in the civilian world. So a cyber attack that \ntook out a civilian power grid would also soon cripple our Nation's \nmilitary--very soon.\n  Although bases would be prepared to weather a short power outage with \nbackup diesel generators, within hours, not days, fuel supplies would \nrun out. Command and control centers would go dark. Radar systems that \ndetect air threats to our country would shut down. Communication \nbetween commanders and their troops would go silent. And many weapons \nsystems would be left without either fuel or electric power.\n  Much of what we do militarily is now done by computers and done very \nremotely. It is no secret that the drones that operate for our country \nall over the world are not operated from Pakistan, Afghanistan, or \nSomalia, they are operated from a base 35 miles outside Las Vegas. That \nis all done with electricity. So in a few short hours or days, the \nmightiest military in the world would be left scrambling to maintain \nbase functions.\n  That is why our top national security officials--including the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of the National Security \nAgency, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director--have said that \nthe kind of malicious cyber attack I have just described is among the \nmost urgent threats to our country. In fact, they have said that unless \nwe do something and do it soon, it is not a question of if, it is only \na question of when.\n  There have already been cyber attacks on our nuclear infrastructure, \nour Defense Department's most advanced weapons, the NASDAQ stock \nexchange, and most major corporations. These are just a few of the \nthings that have already been attacked by cyber.\n  Senator McConnell and I recently received a letter from a bipartisan \ngroup of former national security officials, including six former Bush \nand Obama administration officials, that presented the danger in stark \nterms:\n\n       We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have been \n     averted with the intelligence that existed at the time. We do \n     not want to be in the same position again when ``cyber 9/11'' \n     hits--it is not a question of whether this will happen; it is \n     only a question of ``when.''\n\n  That is what they said, not me. The group said the threat of cyber \nattack ``represents the most serious challenge to our national security \nsince the onset of the nuclear age sixty years ago.''\n  The bill before this body, proposed by a coalition of Democrats and \nRepublicans--including Chairman Lieberman\n\n[[Page S5421]]\n\nand ranking member Collins--is an excellent piece of legislation \nendorsed by many members of the national security community.\n  In my view, it is not strong enough, but it is a tremendous step \nforward, and I admire the work they have done. I know some of my \ncolleagues have suggestions on how to improve this legislation. I have \na few of my own. There is plenty of room for good ideas. Some of them \nare already on the table. It is my intention for Senators to have an \nopportunity to have a robust debate on these proposals. Let's stick \nwith what this bill is all about and let's have as many amendments as \npeople feel is appropriate.\n  The national security experts agree we can't afford to waste more \ntime. The question is not whether we should act but whether we will act \nin time.\n  As I mentioned at the start, we are scheduled to have this vote an \nhour after we come in tomorrow. I am working with Senator McConnell now \nto try to arrange a time, perhaps even today. My goal is to get on the \nbill. I hope we can get on the bill. It would be terrible for our \ncountry if we are not on the bill. I would like to get on the bill and \nhave Senators Lieberman, Collins, Rockefeller, Feinstein, and the other \ncommittees that are involved come up with a list of amendments as we \nhave done so well on a number of the bills we have worked through. When \nwe come back next week, let's start doing some legislating and have \nsome robust debate, get some of these amendments disposed of, and pass \nthis bill on to the House.\n  The House has done their bill. We can go to conference and get \nsomething done. It would be very important for our country.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday our Democratic friends took a \nvote that says a lot about the way they view the world. After nearly 4 \nyears of spending and debt, millions of Americans are still struggling \namidst the slowest recovery in modern times, and the economy is flat on \nits back. Our friends on the other side think a great way to go forward \nis to raise taxes. Under the guise of pretending to care about the \ndeficit, Democrats are pushing an ideological goal of a symbolic tax \nincrease that would not even fund the government for 1 week. The vote \nwe had yesterday--with all but two of the Democrats on board--allegedly \ndoing something about the deficit wouldn't fund government for 1 week.\n  They are not even pretending to care about the economy. They have \nsort of given up on the argument that this is about the economy. We \nknow that because 2 years ago the Democrats agreed the higher taxes \nthey are now fighting for would hurt the economy.\n  Let's look at the economy then and the economy now. At a time when \neconomic growth was 3\\1/2\\ percent, back in December of 2010, 40 \nDemocrats voted to keep rates where they were on the grounds that it \nwas the best thing to do for jobs. In December 2010, 40 Democrats voted \nto keep the tax rates where they were because it was the best thing for \njobs. Yet now when the growth rate is 2 percent--it was 3\\1/2\\ percent \nthen, it is 2 percent now--and 13 million Americans are still out of \nwork, they are voting to slam nearly 1 million businesses with a tax \nincrease. Maybe they are expecting the GDP numbers tomorrow to be 3\\1/\n2\\ percent. We will see.\n  That is one of two things, either our Democratic friends don't even \ncare about the economy and jobs anymore and are just embracing Thelma-\nand-Louise economics--let's take everybody off the cliff and hope \npeople support them for some other reason--or their economic world view \nis so far outside the mainstream of everyone else who has looked at the \nsituation that they think 2 percent growth and 13 million Americans \nunemployed is good enough. Maybe they think that is as good as we can \ndo. That is where this ideological crusade of theirs is taking them, \nright in that direction. I just hope for the sake of a struggling \nAmerican economy that some of them soon see how misguided an approach \nthis is.\n  Let me repeat, 2 years ago in December of 2010, when the economy was \ngrowing at a rate of 3\\1/2\\ percent, 40 of our Democratic colleagues, \nthe President, the Vice President, me, and the Speaker agreed to extend \nthe current tax rates for 2 years because it would be good for jobs.\n  Just yesterday, with two exceptions, every Democrat voted to raise \ntaxes on 1 million businesses when the growth rate--the GDP increased \nrate--is 2 percent and 13 million Americans are looking for work. That \nis not a prescription for the economy; that is an ideological crusade. \nThat is not about America's jobs; that is about the election 4 months \nfrom now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the following hour will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half and the Republicans controlling the \nfinal half.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the floor of \nthe Senate again this morning to urge my colleagues to vote to extend \nthe production tax credit for wind energy. It is also known as the \nproduction tax credit. I know the Presiding Officer's home State of \nWest Virginia has a robust wind energy sector as well. I look forward \nto coming to the floor and talking about the Presiding Officer's State \nin the future.\n  The reason I am talking about the production tax credit is it is set \nto expire at the end of this year, and it will cost citizens in my \nState and the rest of the Nation their jobs. We cannot let this happen. \nTens of thousands of vital jobs are dependent on the wind industry all \nacross our great country.\n  As I have mentioned, I come to the Senate floor on a daily basis and \nI highlight a State and talk about what the production tax credit has \ndone to encourage economic growth in that State. Today, I wish to talk \nabout the great State of Illinois, the land of Lincoln, where the wind \nindustry is thriving. Illinois is an impressive example of how wind \nresources can be harnessed and put to good use creating jobs and \nsupporting local communities.\n  Overall, Illinois has the fourth largest installed wind capacity in \nthe United States, with over 600,000 homes powered by the wind. If \nfully utilized, the wind energy resource in Illinois could provide 525 \npercent of the State's current electricity needs. That is truly a \nstaggering amount of electricity for the fifth largest State in the \nNation.\n  In 2011, Illinois was second only to California in the number of new \nwind energy projects completed, and they installed more wind turbines \nthere than any other State in the country. Clearly, Illinois recognizes \nthe economic potential wind energy holds for the future, as many other \nStates have.\n  Just last week in Illinois, Invenergy announced it completed \nconstruction of the Bishop Hill wind energy facility in Henry County. \nThat is up in the northwestern part of Illinois, near Davenport, IA. \nThe project covers 22,000 acres of farmland and includes over 100 wind \nturbines and can power 60,000 homes. The Bishop Hill project is clearly \na huge investment in Illinois and our Nation's clean energy future. But \nthe economic power of wind energy has been equally impressive. The wind \nenergy there supports 7,000 jobs, it contributes close to $19 million \nevery year in property taxes to local communities, and Illinois led our \nNation in 2011 with over 400 new wind turbines installed.\n  Just this month, Illinois State University released a report that \nestimates that the 23 largest wind farms in Illinois will contribute \nroughly $5.8 billion to the local economies over the lifetime of these \nprojects. The construction of these wind farms generated over 19,000 \njobs that cut paychecks totaling over $1 billion for workers. These are \ngood-paying, high-skill jobs that we are proud to have in our country \nand that American workers are proud to have and it is one part of the \noverall wind energy story.\n  For example, the Odell Grade School, in Odell, IL, has a much needed \nproject underway that will expand the school and make it more energy \nefficient. While this project is expensive, it will be paid for, in \npart, by payments from local wind farms. Wind energy is supporting a \nbetter education for Odell's youth without increasing taxes to the \nlocal residents.\n\n[[Page S5422]]\n\n  This is not unique to Illinois. It is happening all across our \ncountry. I have no doubt the people of Odell would agree with me that \nextending the PTC is a commonsense proposal. However, without Congress \nextending the production tax credit, our country and the wind industry \nliterally face impending disaster. In fact, many wind energy \nmanufacturers and producers have already been preparing for the end of \nthe PTC by backing off their investments in many of these communities \nsuch as Odell and by announcing future layoffs of thousands of workers. \nIt is just flatout unacceptable that we in the Congress would let this \nhappen.\n  I think everyone understands where I am heading. This is a serious \nissue that needs attention now--not next month, not in the fall, not in \nthe lameduck session but now. The wind industry will not wait for us to \nextend the PTC at some date in the future. They have already begun to \nscale back their operations and move overseas. Further inaction is \nunacceptable. China is stepping into the breach and literally taking \nour jobs overseas. Other countries are prepared to do the same. For us \nin Congress to miss this opportunity to not only preserve jobs but put \nin place policy that would create thousands of good-paying jobs because \nof election-year gridlock is flatout unacceptable. If we don't act, our \npeople in our States will suffer.\n  I come to the floor every day to implore my colleagues to extend the \nwind production tax credit as soon as possible. The PTC equals jobs. We \nought to pass it as soon as possible. I will be back next week to \ncontinue discussing the wind Production Tax Credit and urge us to be \nbold, take up this issue and extend the wind production tax credit. It \nis about American jobs. It is about maintaining our leading position in \nthe world when it comes to clean energy development.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator could abstain from the quorum, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today in order \nto continue the efforts started right here earlier this week, efforts \nby the women of the Senate and the men who support the Violence Against \nWomen Act to bring a simple, straightforward message to our friends in \nthe House of Representatives: Stop the games and pass the inclusive, \nbipartisan Senate VAWA bill without delay.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is a bill that has successfully helped \nprovide lifesaving assistance to hundreds of thousands of women and \nfamilies. It is a bill that passed the Senate 3 months ago today by a \nvote of 68 to 31. It is a bill that has consistently included \nbipartisan provisions to address those who are not being protected by \nit each and every time it has been reauthorized. But here we are, back \non the Senate floor, urging support for a bill that should not be \ncontroversial.\n\n  Just as we did on Tuesday, just as we are doing today, and just as we \nare going to continue to do in the coming weeks, we will be making sure \nthis message resonates loudly and clearly both in Washington, DC, and \nback in our home States because we are not going to back down--not \nwhile there are thousands of women across our country who are excluded \nfrom the current law. In fact, for Native and immigrant women and LGBT \nindividuals, every moment our inclusive legislation to reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act is delayed is another moment they are left \nwithout the resources and protection they deserve in this country.\n  The numbers are staggering: 1 in 3 Native American women will be \nraped in their lifetimes--1 in 3. And 2 in 5 of them are victims of \ndomestic violence, and they are killed at 10 times the rate of the \nnational average. These shocking statistics are not isolated to one \ngroup of women; 25 to 35 percent of women in the LGBT community \nexperience domestic violence in their relationships, and 3 in 4 abused \nimmigrant women never enter the process to obtain legal status, even \nthough they were eligible, because their abuser husbands never filed \ntheir paperwork.\n  This should make it perfectly clear to our colleagues in the other \nChamber that their current inaction has a real impact on the lives of \nwomen across America affected by violence, women such as Deborah \nParker. Deborah is the vice chairman of the Tulalip Tribe in my home \nState of Washington.\n  Deborah was repeatedly abused starting at a very young age by a \nnontribal man who lived on a reservation. Not until after the abuse \nstopped--sometime around when she was in the fourth grade--did Deborah \nrealize she was not the only child suffering at the hands of that same \nassailant. At least a dozen other young girls had fallen victim to that \nman--a man who was never arrested for his crimes, never brought to \njustice, and still walks free today, all because he committed these \nheinous acts on the reservation. As someone who is not a member of a \ntribe, it is an unfortunate reality that he is unlikely to ever be held \nliable for his crimes.\n  Reauthorizing an inclusive VAWA is a matter of fairness. Deborah's \nexperience and the experience of other victims of that man do not \nrepresent an isolated incident. For the narrow set of domestic violence \ncrimes laid out in VAWA, tribal governments should be able to hold \naccountable defendants who have a strong tie to the tribal community.\n  I was very glad to see Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert and \nseveral of her Republican colleagues echo those sentiments last week. \nThey sent a letter to Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor. These \nRepublican Members explicitly called on their party leadership to end \nthis gridlock and accept the ``Senate-endorsed provisions that would \nprotect all victims of domestic violence, including college students, \nLGBT individuals, Native Americans and immigrants.''\n  So today I am here to urge Speaker Boehner to listen to the members \nof his own caucus and join us in taking a major step to uphold our \ngovernment's promise to protect its people, people such as Maribel and \nMaria, two more constituents who come from my home State of Washington.\n  As a transgender woman, Maribel has been subject to random acts of \nviolence by family and boyfriends and strangers. She has been mugged \nand attacked on the street. She has suffered broken bones and cuts and \nbruises. She has been raped, and she was left for dead. What Maribel \nsaid to me was deeply concerning. She said:\n\n       Not once have the police ever conducted an investigation, \n     much less shown any concern for me. Rather my experience with \n     law enforcement is one of harassment and abuse. I have been \n     ostracized by family and friends . . . in fact it is most of \n     my first memories.\n\n  She experiences hate daily from those who think she has no place in \nour society.\n  Then there is Maria. Shortly after their wedding, Maria's husband \nbecame a different man, she said. His abuse ranged from emotional to \nphysical, and on two separate occasions he held a knife to Maria's \nthroat threatening to kill her. He constantly threatened Maria with \ndeportation back to Jamaica. Eventually, he refused to attend the \ninterview with immigration authorities necessary for her to obtain a \ngreen card. Her application was denied for lack of attendance. She was \nangry and scared, but she found the courage to ask her husband for a \ndivorce. In response, he raped her. Maria moved out of the house though \nher husband repeatedly tracked her down and assaulted her. To save her \nown life, Maria fled to Seattle with her two young children.\n  It does not have to be this way. I was so proud to have been serving \nin the Senate in 1994 when we first passed the Violence Against Women \nAct. Since we took that historic step, VAWA has been a great success in \ncoordinating victims' advocates and social service providers, and law \nenforcement professionals to meet the immediate challenges of combating \ndomestic violence. Along with its bipartisan support, it has received \npraise from law enforcement officers and prosecutors, judges, victim \nservice providers, faith leaders, health care professionals, advocates, \nand survivors.\n  The Violence Against Women Act has broad support for one reason: It \nworks. Where a person lives, their immigration status, who they love \nshould not determine whether perpetrators of domestic violence are \nbrought to justice. These women cannot afford any further delay--not on \nthis bill.\n\n[[Page S5423]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think the Senator from Washington has made an \nextraordinary presentation in terms of outlining the facts of the abuse \nwomen face. Having done a series of forums around my home State--as my \ncolleague knows, in our part of the country in Washington and in Oregon \nwhere there are many small communities of 10,000, 15,000 people, it is \nmy experience--and I would be interested in getting the assessment of \nour colleague since she has been a leader on this--that without the \nViolence Against Women Act, it is my understanding that women in rural \nareas who face the kind of brutal treatment my colleague described \nwould literally have nowhere to turn, so that the Violence Against \nWomen Act for women in rural areas in particular is sort of the last \nline of defense for them.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Oregon is absolutely correct. If a \nwoman has been beaten and abused and believes she is a victim of \nviolence with nowhere to turn, especially in a rural community where \neveryone knows everyone and a person doesn't know who to turn to, there \nis no place to go. The Violence Against Women Act provides the support \nof law enforcement officers and advocates so a person can get out of a \nvery abusive situation.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am going to listen to the rest of my colleague's \nremarks, and I will have my own. But I just want to thank the Senator \nfrom Washington for her leadership. This is such an important issue. It \nis not about dollars and cents, and it is not about politics. It is \nabout doing what is right for combating violence, and I commend my \ncolleague.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Oregon. I know he is going to \nspeak in just a few minutes, but I know he has spent a great deal of \ntime traveling around his State and listening to these women and he \nknows personally from their stories how important it is that we cannot \ncontinue to delay this bill over something called a blue slip. It is \nnot about a blue slip. It is about doing what is right.\n  We have overcome the blue slip issue time and time again for issues \nsuch as FAA and Transportation bills and many other pieces of \nlegislation because it is the will of the body to do so. So to tell a \nwoman in Oregon or Washington State that this bill can't happen because \nof a blue slip is ridiculous. They have been told they can't get help \nfor a lot tougher reasons. Let's not let a blue slip be what comes \nbetween them and the support they need.\n  In fact, I say to my colleague from Oregon and all of my colleagues \nthat on Tuesday the New York Times ran an editorial that gets to the \nheart of it. They said:\n\n       House Republicans have to decide which is more important: \n     Protecting victims of domestic violence or advancing the \n     harsh antigay and anti-immigrant sentiments of some on their \n     party's far right. At the moment, harshness is winning.\n\n  The editorial also echoed our sentiments that it does not have to be \nthis way. It pointed out:\n\n       In May, 15 Senate Republicans joined with the chamber's \n     Democratic majority to approve a strong reauthorization bill.\n\n  It ends with what we all know it will take to move this legislation \nforward: leadership from Congressman Boehner. So today we are on the \nSenate floor to make this effort and to call for the same thing: \nleadership.\n  It is time for Speaker Boehner to look past ideology and partisan \npolitics. It is time for him to hear the stories of women across \nAmerica who have not had the protection of this bill and to make a \nmajor step forward which will assure that a woman, no matter where she \nlives or who she is, will have the protections this great country can \noffer.\n  So I thank my colleague from Oregon for his real passion and \nunderstanding on this issue and for taking the time to hear from women \nand men who have been impacted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to follow on the very important \nremarks made by our colleague, Senator Murray. As a result of the \ndebate we have had in Washington, DC, I knew there was a significant \nproblem, but until we held these forums across our State--we \nessentially went into every corner of Oregon--it really didn't come \nhome to me how serious a problem this is.\n  I wish to highlight for a moment or two this point I got into with \nSenator Murray with respect to rural areas, some of the stories. For \nexample, I was told about a woman in central Oregon who essentially, \nfaced with a very abusive relationship, spent the evening trying to \nhide out in ditches in the community. She would just run from ditch to \nditch. Of course, a person gets pretty banged up and bruised when they \ndo something like that, but she hid out in ditches through the night in \norder to avoid her abuser.\n  But then it came to morning time and she wanted to get out. She \nwanted to get to the Safety Net program, which is a wonderful shelter \nin her area. But the fact was the only way to get out was to ask for a \nride from the one person who had a vehicle in the community, and that \nwas the person who abused her in the first place. So, literally, in a \nrural community--and I heard this account just recently--she had \nnowhere to turn. That is why I characterize the Violence Against Women \nAct as--especially for rural women--the last line of defense between \nthem and the abuser.\n  In another community--I know my colleague, the Presiding Officer, \nwill identify with this, and I enjoyed going to West Virginia and the \nlike--in a rural community in the eastern part of our State, it was \ndescribed to me that there was no transportation out of the community. \nThere was no transportation at all. The woman involved was going to \nliterally have to stay there and face continual abuse. The one vehicle \nin the community was a fishing shuttle.\n  I am sure the Senator from West Virginia identifies with that. It is \nsomething we have in our rural communities--a vehicle that takes folks \nfishing.\n  The owner of the fishing shuttle said: I am going to be the one to \ntake this woman to safety. I don't need to be reimbursed. I don't need \nto have some kind of government program or something. I am going to do \nit because it is right.\n  That is how that woman in a rural community escaped her abuser. She \ngot out. She got free. She was able to shake out of the clutches of the \nabuser because the fellow who owned the fishing shuttle stuck up for \nher.\n  But I think this is Senator Murray's point: I do not think we can \naccept that all across the country we are going to have fishing \nshuttles available in order to rescue women who are subject to this \nkind of abuse. I think that is pretty farfetched, and the good hearts \nof Oregonians came through in that particular situation, but we have to \nreenact this program.\n  The fact is, Mr. President and colleagues, this has been the law of \nthe land for more than a decade. There has not been a shred of \npartisanship in it. It is not about ideology. It is about protecting \nwomen from brutality. I had thought, frankly, we had gotten over some \nof the arguments against this legislation that had been trotted out in \nthe past.\n  For example, it was often said in the past: Well, maybe these abuse \ncases are not abuse. Maybe they are just kind of family matters. They \nare going to get settled when the family kind of calms down. Maybe \nsomebody got upset about something, and then in a day or so everything \nis going to go back to normal.\n  That is not the case. This is about repeated instances of violence, \nrepeated instances of violence you cannot slough off as a family \ndifference of opinion. It is a crime. It is brutal violence. That is \nwhy we need this legislation, and we need it reauthorized.\n  I think it is also especially important, given some of the budget \ncuts we have seen that are particularly hitting small communities like \na wrecking ball. For example, in Josephine County--a rural part of our \nState--they are in the position where, when a subpoena goes out, they \nessentially do not have the resources to follow it up. In other words, \nthe subpoena is used to, in effect, set in motion the law enforcement \nprocess to bring the abuser to justice, and I was told by the key law \nenforcement officials in Josephine County--in a community forum I held \nin Medford, OR, for folks from the southwestern\n\n[[Page S5424]]\n\npart of the State--that they literally do not have the resources to \nfollow up on how to ensure that abuser is brought to justice.\n  I would make a couple of additional points. I see colleagues on the \nfloor waiting to speak.\n  I also want to talk about the costs that are associated with this. \nYou have two kinds of costs. First, you have direct health care costs \nthat stem from the violence you see perpetrated against women, and then \nalso you have costs in terms of lost productivity. At a time when we \nare getting hit very hard by unemployment--and we know we are in a \nproductivity race with Asia and India and China and other countries--we \ncannot afford the costs, the health care costs of the violence against \nwomen that ends up having women land in hospital emergency rooms and \nthe like, nor can we allow this lost productivity at a time when we are \npushing so hard to create more good-paying jobs.\n  The protection that is offered through the Violence Against Women Act \nsaves my home State of Oregon now millions of dollars through its key \nprovisions. Safety from domestic violence would save Oregon more than \n$35 million per year in direct health care costs. Our State loses \napproximately $9.3 million per year in lost productivity from paid work \nas a result of domestic violence. The fact is, the preventive services \noffered by the Violence Against Women Act saves money, as does the very \nimportant work that is done by victim services.\n  The study of 278 victims in my home town of Portland who received \ndomestic violence and housing assistance found that those services \nresulted in more than $610,000 in savings during the first 6 months. So \nthere are savings in terms of assistance, whether it is housing or \ncounseling. Emergency medical care utilization is reduced as a result \nof emergency services, safety net services being available. Whether it \nis one measure or another, from a financial standpoint, reauthorizing \nthe violence against women legislation makes sense.\n  But at the end of the day, while the financial savings are \nsubstantial, it seems to me the Violence Against Women Act is about \nrestoring dignity to women who have been abused in our country. No \nwoman in the United States should be subject to the kind of physical \nabuse I have documented in cases coming from Oregon and that Senator \nMurray has described this morning. They strip our people--women in this \ncountry--of their dignity and their confidence and their ability, after \nthey shake free from their abuser, to get on and have the kind of \nproductive life they want for themselves and their family.\n  Ultimately, this is about dignity. It is about doing what is right. \nThis legislation has been on the books for more than a decade. There is \nno reason--none whatever--that this legislation is not passed \noverwhelmingly on a bipartisan, bicameral basis. I am going to do \neverything I can here on the floor of the Senate talking with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure this legislation is \nreauthorized. Because what I saw during these community forums in my \nhome State, from small towns across Oregon, should not happen in my \nState, it should not happen anywhere, because it is not right, and the \nSenate can take action to stop it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                      Passing Appropriations Bills\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about the \ndangers of raising taxes during a recession. President Obama famously \nsaid in 2009: ``You don't raise taxes in a recession.'' Our economy is \ncertainly worse now than it was then. But that did not stop the Senate \nmajority from pushing through a tax increase on our small business \nowners yesterday.\n  We need to get our fiscal house in order, and that starts with \nbudgeting in a responsible manner. Washington's primary problem is not \na revenue problem. Washington's primary problem is a spending problem, \nand the Senate majority's actions have exacerbated that problem.\n  The Senate has failed to pass a budget for the past 3 years. \nMeanwhile, our country is facing record deficits and an ever-increasing \ndebt. This is the fifth straight year that Washington's excessive \nspending has led to a trillion-dollar deficit. It now sits at a jaw-\ndropping $15.9 trillion. The Senate majority's only answer to this \ncrisis is to raise taxes on our job creators during a time while our \ncountry has an unemployment rate of over 8 percent.\n  Along with failing to produce a budget, the Senate majority leader is \nnow backtracking on a pledge to enact every individual appropriations \nbill this year. Needless to say, I am disappointed. In fact, I think it \nis safe to say our entire caucus is disappointed.\n  It was not too long ago that I was down here on the floor praising \nthe majority leader in his efforts and those who would have us go \nforward and enact our individual appropriations bills. We believed we \nhad a good-faith agreement to move these bills, to make the effort to \nfunction the way this body was established to work, to do our job and \npass all of the appropriations bills so that the government operates on \na budget the way every Arkansan does.\n\n  Now the majority is telling us this is not going to happen. \nDetermining how we spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars is a basic \nresponsibility of Congress. We know tough choices have to be made in \nthese appropriations bills, but moving forward is the right direction. \nThe trend of continuing resolutions and giant omnibus appropriations \nbills has to stop.\n  Enacting all appropriations bills in regular order would be an \nimportant step to reducing government spending. It would help balance \nour budget while investing in programs Americans have come to rely on.\n  Moving forward on these bills would return the Senate to its proper \nfunction and provide a framework of spending so the American people can \nsee and understand where their hard-earned money is going. Most \nimportantly, it would help us back away from the fiscal cliff we are \nhanging on to.\n  Here is the reality: We borrow around 40 cents of every $1 we spend. \nWe are running record-breaking deficits every year. The average \nAmerican family does not have the luxury to live by this sort of \nbudgeting. If you tried to run your household, your business this way, \nthe bank would cut you off. It is time we apply that lesson to \nWashington.\n  We are at a crossroads in our country. If we continue down the path \nwe are going, we risk going in the direction of Greece, Ireland, \nPortugal, and now Spain--each facing economic crises that have pushed \nthem to the brink of default.\n  If Congress continues the reckless spending, rather than crafting an \nimmediate solution to this crisis, our actions will inevitably lead to \nan economic collapse. We cannot keep kicking the can down the road, \nwhich is exactly what we are doing by passing continuing resolutions \nand omnibuses after continuing resolutions and omnibuses. It goes on \nand on.\n  Each one of us in this Chamber owes it to the American people to work \ntogether to help our country today and build a path of success for the \nfuture. Our Founding Fathers laid the foundation that allows the Senate \nto function effectively and efficiently, but it does require us working \ntogether.\n  The American people are tired of the finger pointing that has stalled \nmuch of the work they have sent us here to do. That starts with trying \nto enact all of the appropriations bills through a regular process each \nyear. I sincerely hope the Senate majority leader reconsiders the \ndecision to cancel consideration of the appropriations bills, again, so \nwe can get back to a normal budgeting process, get back to a normal \nmethod, an efficient method, a very transparent method, so the American \npeople can see where their taxpayer dollars are going.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I assume we are out of morning business.\n\n[[Page S5425]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the motion to proceed to S. \n3414.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3326\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 3326; that the Coburn amendment at the desk be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that \nwhen the Senate receives the House companion bill to S. 3326, as \ndetermined by the majority and the Republican leaders, the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration; that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken, and the text of S. 3326, as passed by the Senate, \nbe inserted in lieu thereof; that the bill be read a third time and \npassed; that a statutory pay-go statement be read, if needed, and \npassed with no amendments in order prior to passage, the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements related to the bill be \nprinted in the Record at the appropriate place, as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object and would \nlike to make a statement.\n  I am basically opposed to the Senator's request, and let me explain \nwhy. The Finance Committee considered this bill last week, and we \npassed it out of committee by a voice vote without a single amendment \nbeing offered. Nobody on the committee offered an amendment. I think we \ncannot and should not delay the passage now. It passed unanimously, no \namendments offered, and now is not the time to delay.\n  This bill is fully offset. How? By extending customs user fees and \ncorporate timing shift. This is not the first time we have used the \ncorporate timing shift as an offset. I have a list--a very long list--\nof the many times when this body has used this very same provision and \nvery same offset. In fact, it has been used multiple times since 2005 \nin trade bills and lots of other bills, so there is much precedent.\n  I, nonetheless, understand Senator Coburn now has concerns about the \noffset, and I am willing to work with him to find alternate offsets in \nfuture trade measures. We need to move forward on this bill in its \nentirety as soon as possible. We can't pick and choose to move forward \non component parts while leaving others to linger. There are real \nconsequences for delay.\n  This bill extends provisions of the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct--otherwise known as AGOA--trade preference program that would \notherwise expire in September. Without swift passage of this bill, U.S. \nretailers do not have the certainty they need to place orders with \nAfrican apparel manufacturers. Not only are these U.S. companies \nstruggling to make the best decisions for their companies, but a \nsubstantial drop in orders has caused devastating job losses in Africa. \nThe job losses are occurring why? Because of the uncertainty as to \nwhether this provision will be extended. Right now the Senator from \nOklahoma suggests we don't proceed.\n  Another provision of this bill closes a loophole in the Dominican \nRepublic-Central American-United States Free Trade Agreement that will \nsave almost 2,000 yarn-spinning jobs in North Carolina and in South \nCarolina. And the Burma sanctions provision expires today. These \nprovisions are all necessary parts of the delicate compromise we \nnegotiated in advance with the House and that the Senate Finance \nCommittee approved. Ways and Means Chairman Camp in the House and \nRanking Member Levin in the House have made it equally clear they will \nnot pass this bill in the House without the AGOA provisions included. \nSo the House will not pass these provisions if the Senator is \nsuccessful.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to pass S. 3326 as it passed from \nthe Finance Committee, quickly and without amendment. For those \nreasons, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, short memories are just that. In my \nopening statement in the Finance Committee on this bill, I made it very \nclear I opposed the pay-for in this bill. I had two amendments to \noffer. They were not offered because the chairman had assured me \nbeforehand that he would object and rule them nongermane, even though \nthey were not nongermane. As a matter of fact, we had offered what the \nObama administration had already offered in terms of trade \nduplication--a $200 million pay-for that the administration supports.\n  So let's talk about what is really going on here. We are a country \nthat is $15.8 trillion in debt. We have a process that is not open, \nreally, to the consideration of addressing real pay-fors for a real \nbill that I agree needs to pass. I have no objection to the underlying \npolicies in any of the three components in this bill, but there is a \nprocess we continue to practice which has our country bankrupt. That \nprocess is the following: We are going to spend $200 million over the \nnext 3 years, and then we are going to take 10 years to pay for it.\n  We have $350 billion in waste, fraud, and duplication in the Federal \nGovernment that we have done nothing about as a Senate. Not one thing \nhave we done to address the issues that are wasting the hard-earned \nmoney of the taxpayers of this country. So when we have a small bill \nand administration concurrence on something that should be eliminated, \nand yet we would rather not do that but just kick the can down the \nroad, we are failing the American people.\n  I have a great deal of respect for the chairman of our committee, but \nit seems to me that my conversations with the Speaker and Mr. Cantor \nand Mr. Camp in the House are much different than his. As a matter of \nfact, if we were to divide this, they would divide theirs and pass them \nboth back over here, and we could do the same. What I have offered is \nto separate out these two from the AGOA package. I am for that. I just \nthink we ought to pay for it.\n  What I have offered, and I offer to do now if the chairman splits it, \nis to have 30 minutes on the floor to explain why I want to pay for the \nAGOA, then have a vote, and let it go. But we will not even do that. So \nnot only do we not want to address the problems, we don't even want to \nhave a debate and an opportunity to stand up and say whether we are for \ncutting wasteful spending, which even the administration is for. That \nis what is offered.\n\n  So now we stand here, with Burma sanctions going to expire. I am \ngoing to tell you, I am not moving. I will object to any unanimous \nconsent request that doesn't have a real pay-for for the $200 million \nfor this bill out of real spending in the next 1 or 2 or 3 years, which \nis exactly what we offered to put forward in committee and what we have \noffered to negotiate. I am not going to be a part of kicking the can \ndown the road again. I am not going to be a part of playing gimmicks \nwhere we ask corporations to overpay their taxes so we can get around \nthe 1974 Budget Act and pay-go and essentially be dishonest with the \nAmerican people about what we are doing.\n  I understand I am not the chairman of the Finance Committee, but I am \na member. And I am a Member of this body. Since I had no right in \ncommittee to offer an offset because they were ruled--they were going \nto be ruled nongermane, which they weren't, and now, consequently, we \nwant to ram this through on a timed basis, I am not going to agree to \nthat happening.\n  So we need to start acting like grownups in terms of our debt and not \nkick the can down the road 10 years, and that is what we are doing. We \nare going to use 10 years to pay for something we are going to spend \nover 3, just like we did on the highway bill, just like we violated \npay-go, just like we violated the budget agreement we just agreed to \nlast August. Now we are going to continue to do the same thing.\n  I have the greatest respect for my chairman. He has been here a long \ntime. He knows a lot about these issues. I agree they need to happen, \nbut they do not need to happen on the backs of taxpayers 10 years from \nnow. We need to pay for what we are doing now.\n  That is the whole point of this exercise. I want us to be able to \nhave certainty. I want us to have the Burma sanctions continued. I want \nus to do the right thing. But I want us to do it in the right way, and \nwe are not. So that is where I stand.\n\n[[Page S5426]]\n\n  I would defer to the chairman for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much understand the frustration of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, and I understand his reasons for objecting. \nIn a perfect world, I might be sympathetic with his reasons, but this \nis not the perfect world. This is a world where we try to do our best \nto do our work and get legislation passed.\n  I personally don't have a problem with the Senator's suggestion that \nwe could set 30 minutes aside and vote on his amendment as an alternate \nway to pay. I think the Senator understands this bill is fully paid for \nalready. It is just the Senator would like it paid for in a different \nway.\n  The problem I have in trying to arrange all this and put it together \nis I can't control other Senators. Other Senators may object to the \nSenator's provision. They may have their own bills. In fact, I can \nthink of two or three right now who would very much take advantage of a \nprocess where the Senator from Oklahoma strips out the bill and offers \nhis own pay-for because they would say: Oh gosh, this is now an \nopportunity for me to offer mine. That is what they will say to \nthemselves, and then we are really stuck because the Burma provisions \nexpire, as the Senator knows, today. We can't dally. We can't wait. The \nAGOA provision expires at the end of September.\n  Now, one could say: Well, wait until the end of September. \nUnfortunately, a lot of American companies are uncertain whether we are \ngoing to extend past the September 30 date, and they are laying off \npeople. Lots of job losses are already occurring as a consequence of \nthe uncertainty. So my job, in putting together these several bills--\nincluding PNTR for Russia--in the committee was to talk to Senators and \ntry to find an accommodation where we could get it passed.\n  I totally agree with the Senator on his main point; namely, how much \nfraud and waste there is and that it should be addressed and how \nimportant it is to get the debt down. As the Senator knows, yesterday, \nin committee, we talked about ways to address the so-called fiscal \ncliff, the very beginnings of the Finance Committee's finding solutions \nto the debt and some kind of grand bargain in the form of tax reform.\n  The Senator is correct. He did file amendments with alternative \noffsets, and I did state the amendments would be ruled nongermane. That \nis true. In my judgment, they were not germane. And he did suggest at \nthat time that he wanted to offer an amendment on the Senate floor. As \nI said, I am not personally opposed to having a vote on the Senator's \namendment as long as there is a limited time of debate. But I do think \nand believe others will object, and they will want to have their \nprovisions passed. I just believe at this point it makes sense to \nproceed with AGOA, the DR-CAFTA bill, and the Burma bill, and deal with \nhow we do offsets at a future date, not right now because it just gums \nup too much else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what the chairman said is this bill is \npaid for. I would put forward to the American public that if they went \nto Wendy's this afternoon and said: Give me a double cheeseburger; and, \noh, by the way, over the next 10 years I am going to pay for it, most \nAmericans would not say it is paid for.\n  What we are doing with this bill is taking custom user fees in the \nyears 2021, 2020, 2019, and all the way down to pay for this bill. That \nis the problem. We will never solve our other problems until we get out \nof the mindset of saying because of the rules, we can stretch out the \npayment and call it paid for.\n  This bill isn't paid for. It is going to be paid for by the people \nwho import things 10 years from now, not now. That is the whole point. \nThat is why we have a $1.3 trillion deficit this year. That is why we \nhave at least 2 to 3 million people unemployed in this country--because \nof our debt. So the question is, Is there a point in time when we are \ngoing to stop paying for things in the future and pay for them now? \nThat is my objection.\n  I am fully open to passing this bill if somebody will just pay for it \nthis year. If we are not going to pay for it this year, then we are not \ngoing to pass a bill by unanimous consent.\n  I will tell you, nobody else operates this way. Nobody rationalizes \nthat you can pay--and the other thing, this is just $200 million. To \neverybody outside of Washington that is one ton of money. Here it is \npeanuts. To say we can't pay for something worth $200 million in a bill \nto do this, right now, to start the self-discipline of paying for it, \nit just says we are not worthy of being here if we would not do that.\n  So I would love to work out a solution, but there is a time and place \nwhere we have to change the direction of how we operate. For me, this \nis the bill that now says to me we are going to start paying for \nthings. And if we can't pay for a $200 million pay-for in the same \nyear, or at least the same 3 years we are going to actually spend it, \nthen we are just not going to pass bills with my help.\n  I am not speaking for just Tom Coburn. The vast majority of Americans \nwant us to pay for things by cutting wasteful spending. The fact that \nwe are going to take custom user fees over 10 years to pay for this is \nludicrous. Nobody in the rest of the economy can go out and say: Oh, by \nthe way, I want to consume it now, but I will pay for it 10 years from \nnow--interest free. It doesn't work that way, and we ought not to be \ndoing it.\n  The chairman has my utmost respect. He has a tough job, I know that, \nof trying to do that. I will continue to try to work on solutions for \nthis problem, but I am not moving from a position that we are going to \npay for the things in the year in which we count them.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, may I ask what the pending business is \nnow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed on S. 3414.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the motion to \nproceed to S. 3414, which is the Cybersecurity Act of 2012.\n  This cloture motion has been filed that will ripen sometime tomorrow, \nbut I think it is the hope of Members on both sides of the aisle that \nwe can proceed to vote on the motion to proceed today. I am hopeful \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote to proceed, because \nalthough there continues to be some disagreement about the content of \nthis bill and different approaches taken, I don't think there is any \nMember of the Senate who doesn't appreciate the fact that our country \nis currently under cyber attack every day, our businesses are victims \nof cyber theft every day, with the consequential loss of billions of \ndollars' worth of investments and, I would say, tens of thousands of \njobs going elsewhere.\n  So this bill is not a solution in search of a problem; it is an \nattempt to solve a problem. Although there may be differences still on \ndifferent components of the bill, I hope everybody will join together \nin at least saying: Let's proceed to the debate, and let's see if we \ncan reach a conclusion before we leave for the August break next week.\n  I will report in this regard that this morning there was a second \nmeeting held of those who have been most active in supporting different \nlegislation that deals with the cyber threat to America. Senator \nCollins and I, Senator Feinstein, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Carper--\nwho introduced the pending matter, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012--\nSenators Hutchison and Chambliss were there today, Senator Coats--who \nintroduced the so-called SECURE IT Act--and then a group of \npeacemakers-bridge builders, Senators Kyl and Whitehouse, Senator \nGraham, Senator Coons, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Coats, again, \nwho sits in two of the three groups, which makes him a superbridge \nbuilder.\n  It was a very good, substantive discussion, in which we were all \nfleshing out the details of the various proposals. We are seeing some \nareas where\n\n[[Page S5427]]\n\nI think we feel we have a real opportunity to agree and some areas \nwhere it may be more difficult, but we haven't given up. But overall, I \nwould say this process has been very encouraging. Basically, all the \nleading parties in the Senate and all the Senators are around the same \ntable talking, which is very constructive to have happen. I appreciate \nthat. To me, it is more reason to vote to proceed.\n  I wish to begin by thanking the aforementioned Senators Collins, \nRockefeller, Feinstein, and Carper, who joined me in sponsoring S. \n3414, which I wish to talk about a bit now in this opening statement.\n  I also wish to thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, for seeing \nthe cyber threat to America in all its urgency and reality last year, \nurging Senator Collins and me to go forward and work on legislation, to \nwork across party lines to get a bill out and now to thank Senator Reid \nfor keeping his commitment to bring this bill to the floor, even \nthough, as always, there are clearly other important issues vying for \nthis body's attention. But, to me, there is none more important to \nAmerica's security and prosperity than this topic, which is \ncybersecurity and the cybersecurity bill that is now pending.\n  I would like to make three points in my remarks to my colleagues.\n  First is that the danger of cyber attacks against the United States \nis clear, present, and growing, with enemies ranging from rival nations \nto cyber terrorists, to organized crime gangs, to rogue hackers sitting \nat computers almost anywhere around the world. The pending matter, S. \n3414, Cybersecurity Act of 2012, responds directly and effectively to \nthis danger.\n  Second, this bill has been a long time in coming. In this regard, I \nnote a letter sent out by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce overnight that, \nI must say, I found very disappointing overall because, if I may state \nit affirmatively, it doesn't embrace the same spirit I see Members of \nthe Senate embracing; that although we have different positions, we \ncan't afford to be inflexible. We can't be closed to compromise because \nof the urgency of the threat to our country and because of the general \nprinciple that has not been as evident in the Senate and Congress \ngenerally as it should be in recent years; that we never get anything \ndone unless there is some compromise. I am not talking about compromise \nof principle. But if we go into every negotiation saying, I will only \naccept 100 percent of what I want, ultimately we are not going to get \nanything, if we can get 80 percent, 75 percent, 60 percent--\nparticularly when we are dealing with a threat to the security of the \nUnited States and our prosperity as real as the cyber threat.\n  I hope our friends at the Chamber will reconsider the tone of their \nopposition and come to the table to talk with us about their concerns \nand see if we can't reach common ground because there is a larger \nnational interest at stake than represented by any particular group or \nany individual Senator or their point of view.\n\n  In their letter of July 25, 2012, signed by R. Bruce Josten, \nexecutive VP for government affairs of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nthe Chamber says that:\n\n       . . . S. 3414, the ``Cybersecurity Act of 2012,'' which has \n     been rushed to the floor without a legislative hearing or \n     markup. The bill was introduced just last week and remains a \n     moving target; new and modified provisions of the bill are \n     expected to be released in the coming days.\n\n  If they are, it is going to be a result of the give-and-take \ncompromise that leads to legislation that is going on now. But I wish \nto respond to the idea that this came out of nowhere.\n  This bill has been a long time in coming. As a matter of fact, I went \nback and looked at the records. I attended my first hearing on \ncybersecurity as a member of the former Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee--the predecessor to the current Homeland Security \nGovernmental Affairs Committee--under the leadership of then-Chairman \nFred Thompson. That was back in 1998, 14 years ago. I have been \nconcerned ever since about the growing threat of cyber attack.\n  Along with my dear friend and colleague on the committee, Senator \nCollins, our committee has held multiple hearings on cybersecurity; \nthat is, the new Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nand we weren't alone. There have been numerous hearings over the past \nseveral years and markups by multiple committees in both the Senate--\nmany held by our colleagues Senator Rockefeller and Senator Feinstein \nin the Commerce and Senate Intel Committees--as well as in the House. \nThose deliberations and discussions were informed by numerous \ngovernment and private sector studies on the dangers that lurk in \ncyberspace.\n  So this bill didn't come out of nowhere. We reported a bill out of \nour committee, with a lot of hearings and an open markup. We began, at \nthe majority leader's direction, to negotiate with the other \ncommittees, particularly Commerce and Intel. We reached agreement, \nwhich is essentially what this bill is.\n  Incidentally, we then altered this bill--Senators Collins, Feinstein, \nRockefeller, and I, in response to the bipartisan Kyl-Whitehouse group \nrecommendations--to make it nonmandatory but still significant. So this \nbill has been aired and worked on and is ready for action.\n  But more to the point, the Senate needs to act. That is why it is so \nimportant we adopt the motion to proceed, because this threat is real, \ndangerous, and growing every day.\n  Third, this bill, S. 3414, is the result of bipartisan compromise. It \nis both bipartisan and it is the result of compromise. We cosponsors, \nas I mentioned, gave up some elements we thought were important that we \nhad in our original bill. Given the cyber threat, we actually thought \nit was more important to move forward with a bill that will \nsignificantly strengthen our cybersecurity, even though it doesn't do \neverything we want it to do and thought should be done.\n  We didn't want to lose the chance to pass cyber legislation this year \nthat could prevent a cyber 9/11 attack against the United States before \nit happens, instead of rushing in the midst of mayhem back to the \nSenate and House to adopt cybersecurity legislation after we suffer a \nmajor attack.\n  As I said, we have incorporated ideas from Senators Whitehouse, Kyl, \nand the other Members whom we were working with quite diligently to \nhelp us find common ground. I wish to explicitly and enthusiastically \nthank them for their efforts.\n  We have heard and responded to Senators Durbin, Franken, Wyden, and \nothers, and advocacy groups across the political spectrum from left to \nright, who have pressed for greater protections for privacy, personal \nprivacy in this bill. We have made substantial changes designed to \naddress concerns from stakeholders and colleagues.\n  I am confident we can work through more issues as we debate the bill \non the floor. But the main point here, if I may use quite a familiar \nexpression around here with a slightly unique follow-on phrase, I hope: \nIf in our quest for cybersecurity legislation we allow the perfect to \nbe the enemy of the good, we are going to end up allowing our enemies \nto destroy a lot that is good in the United States of America. We have \nto act together for the good of the Nation, get the debate started and \nbring amendments to the floor for an up-or-down vote.\n  Let me stress at this point that Senator Reid, the majority leader, \nhas been quite clear that his desire, his intention is to have the \nprocess be an open amendment process so long as the amendments are \ngermane and relevant to the topic of the bill, cybersecurity, not just \nopen to any amendment about any subject.\n  I want to go back over these three points and talk about them in a \nbit more detail. Let me start with the reality of the threat. I want to \nread from a letter sent to us recently by some of our Nation's most \nexperienced security leaders from both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. Here is a letter to the majority and minority leader, \nsigned by former Bush administration Secretary of Homeland Security \nMichael Chertoff; former Bush administration Director of National \nIntelligence ADM Mike McConnell; former Bush Deputy Defense Secretary \nPaul Wolfowitz; former NSA and CIA Director General Michael Hayden; \nformer vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine Gen. Jim \nCartwright; and former Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn. I quote \nfrom the letter. It\n\n[[Page S5428]]\n\nis quite an impressive group, clearly bipartisan--nonpartisan.\n\n       We write to urge you to bring cybersecurity legislation to \n     the floor as soon as possible. Given the time left in this \n     legislative session and the upcoming election this fall, we \n     are concerned that the window of opportunity to pass \n     legislation that is in our view critically necessary to \n     protect our national and economic security is quickly \n     disappearing.\n\n  These security leaders went on to say:\n\n       Infrastructure that controls our electricity, water and \n     sewer, nuclear plants, communications backbone, energy \n     pipelines and financial networks must be required to meet \n     appropriate cybersecurity standards. We carry the burden of \n     knowing--\n\n  It is really chilling.\n\n       We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have been \n     averted with the intelligence that existed at the time. We do \n     not want to be in the same position again when ``cyber 9/11'' \n     hits--it is not a question of whether it will happen--but \n     when.\n\n  That is not a statement from a Member of the Senate or an advocate on \none side or the other. These are proven national security leaders who \nhave worked in administrations of both political parties. ``It is not a \nquestion of whether a cyberattack will happen,'' they say, ``but \nwhen.''\n  Many others have issued similar warnings. Secretary of Defense \nPanetta has said the next Pearl Harbor-like attack against America will \nbe launched from cyberspace.\n  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey has warned: \n``A cyberattack could stop our society in its tracks.''\n  Just this month, National Security Agency Cybercommand Chief Gen. \nKeith Alexander blamed cyber attacks for: ``The greatest transfer of \nwealth in history.''\n  General Alexander estimated that American companies lose about $250 \nbillion a year through intellectual property theft through cyberspace; \n$114 billion to theft through cyber crime; and another $224 billion in \ndowntime the thefts caused.\n  We talk a lot here in the Senate these days, as we must, about how we \nprotect American jobs. It turns out that in creating more cybersecurity \nin our country we are also going to protect tens of thousands of jobs \nwhich otherwise are going to end up elsewhere in the world because they \nwill have stolen the industrial secrets that lead to the new industries \nthat create those jobs.\n  General Alexander concluded this part of the statement he made by \nsaying: `` . . . this is our future disappearing before us.''\n  Cyber attack.\n  These fears are not speculative. Let me go through a recent op-ed in \nthe Wall Street Journal that President Obama wrote.\n\n       In a future conflict, an adversary unable to match our \n     military supremacy on the battlefield might seek to exploit \n     our computer vulnerabilities here at home. Taking down vital \n     banking systems could trigger a financial crisis. The lack of \n     clean water or functioning hospitals could spark a public \n     health emergency. And as we have seen in past blackouts--\n\n  Which were caused by natural disasters, for instance--\n\n     the loss of electricity can bring businesses, cities and \n     entire regions to a standstill.\n\n  These fears are not speculative. They are not theoretical. They are \nbased on existing facts and existing vulnerabilities. Consider, if you \nwill, this recent story in the Washington Post that detailed how a \nyoung man living an ocean away used his computer to hack into the \ncontrol panel of a small town water utility in Texas. It took him just \n10 minutes and required no special tools or training. The utility had \nno idea of what had happened until the hacker posted screen shots of \nhis exploit online as a warning of how vulnerable all of us are. \nImagine if terrorists decided to target a string of small utilities \nacross the United States and either cut off fresh water or dumped raw \nsewage into our lakes, rivers, and streams. We would have an \nenvironmental and economic disaster on our hands. But this is a real \npossibility.\n  This brings me to my second point. We need to act and act now. The \nchallenge of cybersecurity has been studied for a long time and there \nis no need for more studies or hearings or delay, as the Chamber letter \nrequests. I went back to the Congressional Research Service. According \nto a report that they issued, in the 112th Congress alone there have \nbeen 38 hearings and 4 markups in the House and 33 hearings in the \nSenate on cybersecurity.\n  In the 112th Congress, the Judiciary Committee also held a markup on \nthe Personal Data and Privacy Security Act and in previous Congresses \nthe Senate has held markups on cybersecurity legislation in five \nseparate committees under regular order, all of which is included in \nthe bill that is pending before us today.\n\n  Since 2005, the Senate Homeland Security Committee alone has held 10 \nhearings with 48 witnesses testifying and took questions over a total \nof 18 hours. Look at the bill's cosponsors. S. 3414: Senators Collins \nand I, along with Senators Feinstein and Rockefeller, have held \nnumerous hearings, forums, and cybersecurity demonstrations for Members \nand staff. All these hearings and briefings were further informed by, \naccording to the CRS, a total of 60 governmental reports totaling 2,624 \npages produced by the GAO, the Department of Defense, the OMB, the \nDepartment of Energy, and other Federal agencies. This doesn't count \nthe many more reports from the private sector--computer security firms \nsuch as SEMANTEC and think tanks and academic institutions such as MIT \nand the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n  This matter is ready for action. I go back to a 1936 book Winston \nChurchill wrote, ``When England Slept.'' Not ``Why England Slept'' but \n``When England Slept'' . He asked his colleagues in the Parliament who \nwere refusing at that time to act decisively to counter the rise of \nGerman military power despite its clear threat to Europe--Churchill \nsaid: ``What will you know in a few weeks about this matter that you do \nnot know now . . . and have been not been told any time in the last six \nmonths?''\n  I think the same can be said now. That is why I think it is so \nimportant to adopt the motion to proceed and get something done before \nwe leave Washington for the August break.\n  Finally, in the interest of moving forward, my cosponsors and I, as I \nindicated earlier, have made a major compromise in the bill we are \nbringing to the floor in terms of how we deal with critical cyber \ninfrastructure. Here again, we are talking not about small businesses \naround America, we are talking about powerplants, energy pipelines, \nwater systems, financial systems that we all depend on for our banking, \nwater--sewer systems, for instance--that if sabotaged or commandeered \nin a cyber attack could lead to catastrophic deaths and economic and \nenvironmental losses.\n  In our original bill, Senators Collins, Feinstein, Rockefeller, and I \ncalled for mandatory cyber safety standards for all critical \ninfrastructure after those standards were developed in consultation \nwith the private sector. We did not think this was a unique or onerous \nrequirement but our responsibility in carrying out our constitutional \noath to provide for the common defense. Since antiquity, as a matter of \nfact long before the American Constitution, societies have chosen to \nadopt safety standards to protect their citizens, particularly safety \nstandards for physical structures starting with the homes we live in, \nbut also our offices, factories, and critical infrastructure such as \npowerplants and dams. Today we call these building codes. Can you \nimagine if there were no building codes, the danger that people would \ntake when they walked in our office buildings or factories or apartment \nhouses or residences?\n  I cannot resist saying these building codes in some sense are as old \nas the Bible. Here I go to Deuteronomy 22:8 which says:\n\n       When you build a new house, you shall build a parapet for \n     your roof, so you shall not bring the guilt of blood upon \n     your house if anyone should fall from it.\n\n  There is direct relevance in a very different context from the \nBiblical context to what we are trying to do here, which is to build a \nkind of parapet around our cyber systems so we do not bring the guilt \nof blood on us because somebody has attacked through those cyber \nsystems.\n  The reason we have done this over antiquity in the physical world is \nobvious. If one of our homes catches fire because of the wiring not up \nto code or it happens in an apartment building or an\n\n[[Page S5429]]\n\noffice building, the people in it are endangered, obviously, but also \nthe lives and homes of our neighbors, the community are in danger as \nwell. Numerous bipartisan national security experts have been in total \nagreement that mandatory requirements are needed to protect our \nnational and economic security from the ever-rising risk of cyber \nattacks.\n  But it was this provision, seen in the context of regulation of \nbusiness while we were seeing it as homeland security, protecting \nhomeland security, that was the most controversial in our compromise \nbill and drew the most criticism. To be more specific about it, it \nthreatened to prevent passage of any cybersecurity legislation this \nyear which, for the sponsors of this bill, was simply an unacceptable \nresult.\n  Following the rule that no matter how deeply one believes in the \nrightness of a provision in a bill, we agreed to change it because \nthere is so much else that is critically important in our bill that \nwill protect America's cybersecurity. So we withdrew the mandatory \nprovision and created all the standards for performance of how the most \ncritical infrastructure, cyber structure, would protect itself. But \nthen we left it voluntary; however, we did create some incentives. Let \nme be clear that the decision is to be what we all want it to be, which \nis as a result of a collaborative, cooperative effort that businesses \nthat operate the most critical cyber structure, such as, electrical \nsystems, water systems, transportation, finance, communications, will \nwant to comply.\n\n  Under our revised bill, private industry, which incidentally owns as \nmuch as 85 percent of the Nation's critical infrastructure--that is the \nAmerican way, and that is great. But when that 80 to 85 percent of our \ncritical infrastructure can well and probably will be the target of not \njust theft but attacks by enemies of the United States, we have to work \ntogether to prevent that.\n  In our bill we give the private sector the opportunity to develop a \nset of cybersecurity practices which will then be reviewed by the new \nNational Cybersecurity Council that our bill creates. It will be \nchaired by the Secretary of Homeland Security and made up of \nrepresentatives of the Department of Defense, Commerce, Justice, and \nthe intelligence community, and presumably the Director of National \nIntelligence. This National Cybersecurity Council will review the \nstandards agreed upon by the private sector and decide whether they are \nadequate to provide the necessary level of cybersecurity for the \nAmerican people.\n  Owners of critical infrastructure will then have a decision to make. \nDo they want to essentially opt into the system or do they want to not \ndo so? That is up to them under the bill as is put before them because \nit is voluntary. If they opt in--and this is what we hope will be an \nincentive--they will be entitled to receive some benefits, the most \nsignificant of which will be immunity from certain forms of liability \nin case of a cyber attack. We also offer expedited security clearances \nand prioritize technical assistance from our government on cyber \nquestions from those critical covered cyber-infrastructure companies \nthat opt into the system.\n  I think our colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, has a \nvery good metaphor for what we are trying to do. As he said, we are \ntrying to build Fort Cybersecurity where we essentially become part of \na system that provides greatly enhanced protection from cyber attack \nand cyber theft, but we are not compelling anybody to come into Fort \nCybersecurity. We are encouraging them to do so, and we are giving them \nsome incentives to do so. Of course, we hope that sound and wise \nadministrators of those companies and forces of the marketplace will \nencourage them to make a decision to come into Fort Cybersecurity.\n  Finally, our bill contains information-sharing provisions, which I \nthink most people who have looked at the threat of cyber attack and \ncyber theft think are very important. These provisions will allow the \nprivate sector and government to share threat information between each \nother and among themselves. In other words, one private company can \nshare information about an attack with another private company to see \nif the attack is part of a broader pattern.\n  For instance, they can talk about where it may be coming from to \nraise their cyber defenses against it, and to do so without fear of--\nwell, for instance, any trust action by the State or Federal \nGovernment. Also, very often companies that believe they have been a \nvictim of cyber attack will go to the Federal Government, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, or the National Security \nAdministration for help; however, a lot of them don't. Part of the \nreason for that is they fear, among other things, they may compromise \nthe privacy of their records. Others, quite frankly, don't want to \nadmit they have been attacked. This is a real problem. I will come back \nto that in just a moment.\n  We give protection from liability for companies that share their \ninformation with the government. Yet there were many individual \nSenators and many people from outside groups who are focused on privacy \nwho were concerned that in doing this we were opening up a method by \nwhich parts of our Federal Government could basically violate privacy \nrestrictions, take personal information off of the information shared \nby a private company with the government, and they be the victim of \nsome kind of public intrusion or even law enforcement.\n  So I think we negotiated a good series of agreements on this which, \none, will ensure that companies who share cybersecurity information \nwith the government give it directly to civilian agencies and not to \nmilitary agencies. That was a concern people had.\n  Second, we ensure that information shared under the program be \nreasonably necessary and described as a cybersecurity threat. In other \nwords, not just wantonly share it because some of this is private \ninformation.\n  Third, we restrict the government's use of information it receives \nunder the cyber information-sharing authority so that it can be used \nonly for actual cybersecurity purposes and to prosecute cyber crimes \nwith two exceptions broadly agreed on: One is that the information can \nbe used to protect people from imminent threat of death or physical \nharm; and, two, to protect children from serious threats of one sort or \nanother.\n  Next, we would require annual reports from the Justice Department, \nHomeland Security, the defense and intelligence community, and \ninspectors general to describe what information has been received in \nthe previous year, such as, who got it and what was done with it. \nFinally, we allow individuals to sue our government if the government \nintentionally or willfully violates the law; that is to say, the law \nrelating to these privacy protections.\n  I am very pleased by these changes we made. I want to say this loudly \nand clearly: This bill is about cybersecurity. But in trying to elevate \nour cybersecurity, we didn't want to compromise people's privacy or \ntheir freedom. So what I have just read was intended to assure that \nthis bill, as best we could, would not compromise privacy or freedom \nrights.\n  Then I took this set of compromises to the most important people in \nour government who are focused on cybersecurity--the Department of \nHomeland Security, the National Security Agency, the FBI--and they all \nsaid, I am pleased to say, these privacy protections will not inhibit \ntheir ability to protect America's cybersecurity. They can live with \nthese without the slightest diminishing of their focus, which \nunderstandably is not privacy but it is cybersecurity. They said these \namendments to our original bill don't inhibit what they are doing.\n  I conclude by, again, urging my colleagues to vote, presumably today, \nyes on the motion to proceed so we can get the debate started, so we \ncan continue to work to achieve common ground and a meeting of the \nminds and enact this piece of crucial national and economic and \nsecurity legislation in this session of Congress.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have listened to the distinguished \nSenator and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and the \npresentation of the bill that I assume will be voted on today. I \nappreciate very much that we have had the meetings. There are really \ntwo bills that have been introduced: the Lieberman-Collins, bill with \ntheir cosponsors, and then I have introduced legislation called the \nSECURE\n\n[[Page S5430]]\n\nIT Act along with Senators McCain, Chambliss, Grassley, Murkowski, \nCoats, Johnson, and Burr. These are eight ranking members of committees \nand subcommittees who have jurisdiction over cybersecurity, and we \ndiffer in a major way from the bill that is before us that is \ncosponsored by the Chair and ranking member of the Homeland Security \nCommittee. All the other ranking members of the committees that have \njurisdiction, are in disagreement with their approach.\n  Now, the good news is we have been meeting to try to begin to work \nout the differences and see if we can move forward. Our bill, the \nSECURE IT bill, will be introduced as an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute if, in fact, we take up the bill today.\n  I would agree with what Senator Lieberman said right off the bat in \nthat I believe, as long as we have an open amendment process, we will \nvote to move to the bill. I don't think anyone in our group or anyone \nwith whom I have talked wants to hold up dealing with cybersecurity. We \nknow America's systems could be under threat, and some have been hacked \ninto already. There are terrorists who seek to sabotage networks. There \nare people who want access to proprietary information and intellectual \nproperty. We need to protect our systems and our country against those \nattacks, which is why as long as we have an amendment process and we \nare not shut out from discussing this, we will vote to move forward to \nthe bill.\n  This bill was not marked up in committee. It did have a lot of \nhearings in committee. Since it wasn't marked up, amendments were not \nable to be introduced and discussed and voted on, which makes it \nharder, as we all know, when we come to the floor with a bill where \nthere are major disagreements. We have not had the capability for the \ncommittee to take up the amendments and vote on them. That is why I \nthink we need to have the open amendment process and why we do want to \nmove forward on the good faith that it will be open.\n  Now, our bill, the SECURE IT Act, is centered on consensus items. It \nsets aside the controversial provisions that are of questionable need, \nand it is also one that we believe we can work with the House on to \npass and send to the President. The bill we have would greatly improve \ninformation sharing to and from and with the government with other \nprivate sector industries in the same field, and we think that is the \nmost important step we could all take on a fairly quick basis to start \nthe process of getting more security throughout our systems.\n  We must also ensure that the entities and government and industry \nshare information back and forth. It has to be a two-way street. \nObviously, if an industry is going to share information about potential \nthreats, if they see risks or they see problems in a system, it must \nget information from the government agencies that are doing the \nintelligence gathering on a quick basis.\n  Our bill also dramatically improves cybersecurity for Federal \nagencies themselves. It does update the rules that govern \ncybersecurity, and it requires any government contractor to inform \ntheir agency clients if their clients' systems are under a significant \nrisk or attack. We think that is reasonable as a part of a government \ncontracting requirement.\n  Today antitrust laws and liability concerns inhibit private companies \nfrom exchanging the information that is necessary to defend against and \nrespond to cyber threats. If a company is going to be encouraged to \nshare information with a competitor about cyber threats, they have to \nknow they are not going to be then hit with an antitrust lawsuit. I \nthink that is pretty clear. So our bill does address that. We make it \nvery clear there are antitrust immunities as well as most certainly \nimmunity from a lawsuit if they provide information on a voluntary \nbasis. If they are sued, and they have acted in accordance with our \nbill, then they would have protection from liability for a lawsuit on \ncyber attack. So those are the things we do that I think will open up \nthe information sharing, which is the way we believe it is important as \nthe next step.\n\n  It is also very important that we have the safeguards for privacy. I \ndo believe the underlying bill certainly protects privacy, and so does \nour substitute. We have safeguards that protect the privacy and civil \nliberties of all Americans while we preserve the right to ensure that \nwe try to protect America in general from attack from the outside.\n  We also in our bill improve the security of Federal information \nsystems and facilitate the prosecution of cyber crime. We want to beef \nup protections against criminals who are hacking in, as well as \npotential terrorists who might, in order to be able to prosecute \nagainst cyber crime as a disincentive to break the law.\n  Finally, our legislation has broad industry support. The businesses \nin the private sector that know their systems best and that fight every \nday to protect their systems and networks believe SECURE IT is the best \nway to go. We believe that with the cooperation of the business \ncommunity, without having a big regulatory morass, is the way we are \ngoing to get the most cooperation from the people who are running the \nnetworks and systems.\n  I have letters of endorsement from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the American Fuel and \nPetrochemical Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, U.S. \nTelecom, National Retail Federation, the Internet Security Alliance, \nand I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2012.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n        Dear Senators McCain and Hutchison: The U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, supports S. 3342, the ``SECURE IT Act of 2012.'' This \n     bill would dramatically help the United States improve its \n     cybersecurity posture and serve as a catalyst for greater \n     sharing of targeted cyber threat information between the \n     government and the private sector.\n       The Chamber agrees that the right path forward is for the \n     public and private sectors to work together in solving mutual \n     challenges, increasing real-time cyber threat information \n     sharing between and among the public and private sectors, and \n     fostering the development and deployment of innovative \n     cybersecurity technologies. This path provides the best \n     opportunity of staying ahead of fast-paced cyber threats.\n       The Chamber also agrees that Congress should not layer \n     additional cybersecurity regulations on the business \n     community. New compliance mandates would automatically drive \n     up costs and misallocate business resources in a tough \n     economy without necessarily increasing security. Critical \n     infrastructure owners and operators already devote \n     significant resources toward protecting and making their \n     information systems more resilient because it is in their \n     overwhelming interest to do so and good for the country.\n       Another positive aspect of S. 3342 is that it would \n     leverage existing information-sharing and analysis \n     organizations and incorporate lessons learned from pilot \n     programs undertaken by critical infrastructure sectors. Both \n     offer complementary, demonstrated models to enable the \n     government to share cyber threat information with the private \n     sector in a trusted, constructive, and actionable manner \n     without creating burdensome regulatory mandates or new \n     bureaucracies.\n       S. 3342 would also provide businesses the much-needed \n     certainty that threat and vulnerability information shared \n     with the government would be provided safe harbor and not \n     lead to frivolous lawsuits, would be exempt from public \n     disclosure, and would not be used by officials to regulate \n     other activities. The Chamber welcomes your efforts to make \n     certain that the information-sharing processes in your bill \n     include necessary privacy and civil liberties protections, \n     such as tightening the definition of cyber threat \n     information.\n       The Chamber appreciates your efforts to address an array of \n     industry concerns. As the SECURE IT Act progresses, we look \n     forward to working with you to tailor the scope of \n     information that certain entities in the private sector could \n     be required to provide a government agency or department \n     under statute.\n       Equally, we want to ensure that government entities \n     continue to acquire the most innovative and secure technology \n     products and services under provisions of S. 3342 related to \n     reforming the Federal Information Security Management Act. \n     Federal officials who manage agencies' information security \n     programs should leverage industry-led, globally accepted \n     standards for security assurance during the acquisition \n     process. Added language stipulating that the bill would not \n     convey any new regulatory authority to agencies or \n     departments is a step in the right direction.\n\n[[Page S5431]]\n\n       The Chamber believes that your bill highlights the notion \n     that Congress should focus on enacting legislation that would \n     truly improve the sharing of actionable and targeted \n     information between public and private entities in order to \n     defeat our mutual adversaries--not layering additional \n     regulations on the business community. We appreciate your \n     commitment to a nonregulatory approach to bolstering \n     collective security; it is one that the Chamber strongly \n     supports.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2012.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the \n     12,000 members of the National Association of Manufacturers \n     (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in the United \n     States representing manufacturers in every industrial sector \n     and in all 50 states, I am writing to express the NAM's \n     support for S. 2151, the Strengthening and Enhancing \n     Cybersecurity by Using Research, Education, Information, and \n     Technology Act or ``SECURE IT'' Act.\n       Manufacturers through their comprehensive and connected \n     relationships with customers, vendors, suppliers, and \n     governments are entrusted with vast amounts of data. They \n     hold the responsibility of securing this data, the networks \n     on which it runs, and the facilities and machinery they \n     control at the highest priority level. Manufacturers know the \n     economic security of the United States is directly related to \n     our cybersecurity.\n       The NAM supports the government sharing timely and \n     actionable threat and vulnerability information with the \n     private sector. We also support the creation of a voluntary \n     framework that allows companies to share information with the \n     government and with each other without creating new \n     liabilities.\n       NAM member companies also support allowing the private \n     sector to continue developing appropriate general and \n     industry-specific best practices in collaboration with the \n     Federal government for improved security. Encouraging \n     manufacturers to adopt industry-standard best practices \n     through incentives is the best way to ensure innovation while \n     addressing the evolving threats to our nation's security. In \n     contrast, mandates on the use of specific technologies or \n     standards and imposing a prescriptive regulatory framework \n     would unduly inhibit innovation.\n       The SECURE IT Act addresses these issues important to \n     manufacturers. The bill would allow for voluntary information \n     sharing across the cyber community and protect information \n     owners from liability stemming from those actions. It would \n     also help secure government networks, increase the penalties \n     for cybercrime, and prioritize cybersecurity research using \n     existing government dollars. The SECURE IT Act does this \n     without creating a new and unnecessary regulatory burden on \n     manufacturers.\n       The NAM and all manufacturers remain intensely committed to \n     working with Congress to secure our cyberinfrastructure from \n     harm. We look forward to thoughtful discussions and \n     examination by all the Committees with jurisdiction on this \n     issue to ensure that any legislation that moves forward \n     mitigates the cyber threat facing our nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Brian J. Raymond,\n     Director, Technology Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     American Fuel & Petrochemical\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2012.\n     Re AFPM supports the Strengthening and Enhancing \n         Cybersecurity by Using Research, Education, Information, \n         and Technology (SECURE IT) Act.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: AFPM, the American Fuel \n     and Petrochemical Manufacturers (formerly National \n     Petrochemical & Refiners Association), writes today to \n     express its support for S. 2151, the ``Strengthening and \n     Enhancing Cybersecurity by Using Research, Education, \n     Information, and Technology (SECURE IT) Act of 2012 '' \n     introduced by Senators McCain, Hutchison, Grassley, \n     Chambliss, Murkowski, and Coats. This important legislation \n     breaks down current barriers to information sharing to ensure \n     greater security without interfering in the ability of \n     private-sector businesses to protect their own IT systems.\n       AFPM is a trade association representing high-tech American \n     manufacturers of virtually the entire U.S. supply of \n     gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, other fuels and home heating oil, \n     as well as the petrochemicals used as building blocks for \n     thousands of products vital to everyday life. Protection of \n     our members' Information Technology (IT) and Industrial \n     Control Systems (ICS) are critical to the fuel and \n     petrochemical manufacturing process.\n       The SECURE IT Act opens avenues to foster greater \n     information sharing between the private sector, non-federal \n     government agencies, and Federal cybersecurity centers, \n     allowing private companies to voluntarily share information \n     without concern of antitrust and liability violations. \n     Instead of creating a massive regulatory regime under the \n     Department of Homeland Security, this legislation recognizes \n     the proactive role the refining and petrochemical industries \n     have taken to protect our facilities. The sharing of \n     information among companies, as well as with the federal \n     government, will improve our preparedness for an attack and \n     better educate our companies' employees on the various \n     threats facing all critical infrastructures.\n       AFPM's members remain concerned over alternative approaches \n     to cybersecurity that would create an environment focused \n     simply of compliance with bureaucratic government regulation, \n     rather than on actual security. Because cyber threats and \n     crimes are always changing, establishing a one size fits all \n     regulatory framework for our facilities could create more \n     vulnerabilities and has the potential to make existing \n     cybersecurity protections significantly less effective.\n       Cybersecurity is critical to protecting refineries and \n     petrochemical facilities. Breaking down the barriers to \n     information sharing will ensure our security and provide our \n     facilities with timely information to better protect our \n     systems against attack. AFPM believes that the SECURE IT Act \n     will make America and its IT and ICS systems more secure and \n     urges your support for this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles T. Drevna,\n     President, AFPM.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          API,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Republican Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We are writing to express \n     our support for S. 2151 ``SECURE IT Act of 2012'', which was \n     recently introduced by Senators McCain, Hutchison, Chambliss, \n     Grassley, Murkowski, Coats, Burr and Ron Johnson. The \n     American Petroleum Institute is the national trade \n     organization representing nearly 500 companies involved in \n     all aspects of the domestic oil and natural gas industry.\n       We appreciate the balanced and carefully crafted approach \n     taken in S 2151, using and improving upon sector-based \n     cybersecurity processes and partnerships already in progress, \n     and working toward increased collaboration between government \n     and industry rather than imposing additional and unworkable \n     regulations. For example, the sharing of timely and \n     actionable information on cyber threats, vulnerabilities and \n     mitigation procedures will help companies improve their \n     detection, prevention, mitigation and response capabilities. \n     Continuing to improve valuable information sharing, both \n     between a company and the government and among companies \n     within industry sectors, is an effective tool in advancing \n     our nation's cybersecurity.\n       We remain concerned that alternative legislative approaches \n     under consideration could have unintended consequences on \n     business and industry, including the diversion of resources \n     away from activities that will reduce or mitigate risks \n     associated with daily cyber threats in order to comply with \n     mandates that would soon be outdated.\n       Cyber threats change rapidly. API believes the proposed \n     path to improved information sharing will encourage the \n     public and private sectors to work together to reduce risk \n     and promote investment in new technologies to keep industry \n     cyber systems secure. Legislation must enhance, rather than \n     impede, innovative processes and encourage advancements in \n     new cyber risk assessment and mitigation measures.\n       API recognizes the leadership of the ``SECURE IT Act'' \n     sponsors in addressing our nation's cyber security \n     challenges. We appreciate the continued commitment to offer \n     valuable solutions on this complex issue and look forward to \n     working together in the days and weeks ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marty Durbin,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   National Retail Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2012.\n     Hon. John S. McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Retail Federation \n     strongly supports your efforts to craft effective \n     cybersecurity legislation to protect our nation's critical \n     infrastructure from cyber-attacks and we appreciate and \n     applaud your introduction today, June 27, of S. 3342, the \n     Strengthening and Enhancing Cybersecurity by Using Research, \n     Education, Information, and Technology Act of 2012 (the \n     ``SECURE IT Act''). In your efforts to develop a bipartisan \n     bill for Senate floor consideration, we urge you and your \n     cosponsors to ensure that all provisions of the bill support \n     the overall purpose of protecting our critical infrastructure \n     and are not expanded to include unrelated or unvetted \n     amendments, such as data breach and commercial privacy \n     legislation.\n\n[[Page S5432]]\n\n       As the world's largest retail trade association and the \n     voice of retail worldwide, NRF represents retailers of all \n     types and sizes, including chain restaurants and industry \n     partners, from the United States and more than 45 countries \n     abroad. Retailers operate more than 3.6 million U.S. \n     establishments that support one in four U.S. jobs--42 million \n     working Americans. Contributing $2.5 trillion to annual GDP, \n     retail is a daily barometer for the nation's economy. NRF's \n     Retail Means Jobs campaign emphasizes the economic importance \n     of retail and encourages policymakers to support a Jobs, \n     Innovation and Consumer Value Agenda aimed at boosting \n     economic growth and job creation.\n       The SECURE IT Act advances the important goal of \n     facilitating cooperative information sharing about cyber \n     threats between the government and private sector, a key \n     component of cybersecurity legislation we support. The goals \n     underlying cybersecurity legislation and provisions in data \n     breach notification legislation are fundamentally \n     contradictory. The cybersecurity proposals encourage \n     information sharing by limiting companies' liability for that \n     sharing. On the other hand, some proposed breach notification \n     bills either penalize companies for sharing news of a breach, \n     by imposing onerous credit monitoring obligations, or impose \n     lesser civil penalties for failing to disclose a breach in \n     the first instance. Juxtaposing these contrasting proposals \n     would place businesses in a precarious position when their \n     systems are attacked by cyber criminals. Thoughtful \n     examination and comparison of the SECURE IT Act with proposed \n     data breach legislation reveal that they are not properly \n     aligned.\n       A similar case exists with respect to commercial privacy \n     legislation called for by the Obama Administration in its \n     Privacy and Innovation Blueprint and by the Federal Trade \n     Commission in its final privacy report. Comprehensive \n     consumer privacy legislation, which has not been vetted by \n     any committees of jurisdiction in the Senate, attached to the \n     SECURE IT Act, flies in the face of the deliberative process \n     that this sensitive topic deserves.\n       Congress must strike the careful balance between consumers' \n     privacy interests and the provision of goods and services \n     over the Internet that the average American consumer expects \n     in this e-commerce economy. That type of careful \n     deliberation, we fear, may not take place on the Senate floor \n     at this time. Furthermore, these commercial privacy \n     provisions are unrelated to the core purposes of \n     cybersecurity legislation, and Congress has ample time to \n     fully consider the positions and concerns of all stakeholders \n     in a separate and unrushed legislative process.\n       NRF is supportive of your efforts to create a cybersecurity \n     bill that is based on fully vetted concepts that will aid in \n     protecting our nation's most critical infrastructure but that \n     is not encumbered with conflicting amendments addressing data \n     breach notification or insufficiently examined new privacy \n     regimes. NRF looks forward to working with you on this \n     legislation moving forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     David French,\n                      Senior Vice President, Government Relations.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, our bill also allows for a true \ncollaborative effort.\n  The reason we are not supporting the bill that is on the floor today \nis because we believe it does not do the priorities that we can pass, \nand it does increase the mandates and the regulatory overkill, in our \nopinion, that will keep our companies from being able to move forward \non an expedited basis to start protecting our systems.\n  A priority of mine throughout this process has been that we help the \nprivate sector combat cyber attacks by breaking down the barriers to \nsharing information. If we could take that one step, we would be a long \nway toward ensuring that we are increasing the security of all \nAmericans. The bill before us will actually undermine current \ninformation sharing between the government and the private sector. That \nbill's information-sharing title is a step backward because it slows \nthe transfer of critical information to our intelligence agencies, and \nthere is not sufficient protection from antitrust. In addition, there \nis no consensus in the Senate to grant the Department of Homeland \nSecurity broad new authority to impose burdensome regulations on the \nprivate sector.\n  While I am pleased our colleagues who are cosponsoring the bill that \nis before us have made an effort to move away from direct regulation of \nour Nation's systems, it has a long way to go. While their bill allows \nthe private sector to propose standards that are described as \nvoluntary, the bill actually empowers Federal agencies to make these \nvoluntary standards mandatory. If an agency does not make the standards \nmandatory, it would have to report to Congress why it had failed to do \nso. That is a pretty big incentive for mandates to start being put on \nwith regulations that will be required.\n  I believe there is a way forward. If the Senate takes the well-\nreasoned and broadly supported provisions of the SECURE IT bill and \nputs them with a voluntary and industry-driven critical infrastructure \nprotection title, we could pass a Senate bill with overwhelming \nsupport.\n  The key to reaching consensus has five parts:\n  The cybersecurity standards must be developed by the private sector \nand must be truly voluntary. The relationship between government and \nthe private sector in this area must be cooperative, not adversarial \nand not regulatory.\n  The National Institute for Standards and Technology should be the \nconvening authority for the private sector standard-setting process. \nThe government can have a role in ensuring the standards are \nsufficient, and it should, but it can't establish a regulatory regime \nthat will lengthen and hamper the efforts to open information sharing.\n  Companies--and here is the incentive for the companies to do exactly \nwhat we are asking them to do--companies that adopt the voluntary \nstandards must receive robust and straightforward protections from \nliability as well as necessary antitrust and Freedom of Information Act \nexemptions. If a company is going to turn over its proprietary \ninformation to the government, it must be protected from freedom of \ninformation requests from the government that then would take its \nprivate proprietary information public.\n  As in the SECURE IT Act, the information-sharing title must be strong \nand encourage the private sector to share information, and it must \nencourage the government to share with the private sector. It cannot \ncut out those with the most expertise in the area, meaning the national \nsecurity agencies should not have to be subservient to the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  In addition, a 5-year sunset would allow Congress to revisit the act \nand make needed changes. FISA has certainly shown that with a sunset, \nit allows the flexibility to adapt to new issues that arise and stay \ncurrent in its processes to deal with cybersecurity. We believe a 5-\nyear sunset would be the right amount of time to get this going, set \nthings in place, see what works, and see what needs to be adjusted.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues and I can come to a compromise on this \ncritical issue. We want a strong cybersecurity bill. We want one that \ncan pass both Houses. The five points I have laid out could get us to a \nbill that will significantly take the steps to improve our Nation's \ncybersecurity.\n  I wish to read a couple of excerpts from the Heritage Foundation's \nviews of the bill that is before us today:\n\n       Cybersecurity legislation will likely be taken up by the \n     Senate tomorrow.\n\n  This was written yesterday.\n\n       Regrettably, the idea that we just need to do something \n     about cybersecurity seems to be trumping the view that we \n     need to do it right.\n       The Cybersecurity Act of 2012, authored by Senators \n     Lieberman and Collins, seeks to solve our cybersecurity ills \n     but only threatens to make the situation worse.\n       The ``voluntary'' nature of the CSA's standards is also \n     questionable. Any voluntary standard is one step away from \n     mandatory, and Senator Lieberman has already indicated that \n     if the standards aren't voluntarily used, he would push to \n     make them mandatory.\n       Even more concerning, section 103(g) of the CSA gives \n     current regulators the power to make these ``voluntary'' \n     standards mandatory.\n\n  It specifically authorizes that action.\n\n       If a regulator doesn't mandate the standards, the \n     regulatory agency will have to report to Congress why it \n     didn't do so.\n\n  Again, there is strong encouragement to just make the standards \nmandatory and avoid a congressional inquisition.\n  Finally, the Heritage Foundation goes on to say:\n\n       Finally, the sharing and analysis of cybersecurity threat \n     information was weakened by confining cybersecurity \n     information exchanges to civilian organizations. Though in an \n     ideal world the Department of Homeland Security would have \n     the capability to lead our cybersecurity efforts, it \n     currently lacks those capabilities and needs to lean on more \n     capable organizations such as the National Security Agency. \n     The recent changes, however, give DHS more responsibility \n     than it is likely able to handle.\n\n  So we will certainly move forward with the understanding that we will\n\n[[Page S5433]]\n\nhave the ability to offer amendments and try to make this a workable \nbill. It is certain that because the committee was not able to mark up \nthe bill, we have to have the amendments to try to perfect it.\n  I would very much like to take the first step forward in \ncybersecurity, which is why, assuming we have the right to amend, I \nwill support going to the legislation so that we can start the \namendment process next week. I think the people who are cosponsors of \nmy legislation, along with Senator McCain, Senator Chambliss, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Burr, Senator Murkowski, Senator Coats, and Senator \nJohnson, want to make sure we do this right. As the Heritage Foundation \nhas so aptly said, we don't want a big, new regulatory scheme that is \nnot going to be successful in our efforts to improve the cybersecurity \nsafeguards in our system.\n  We are the ranking members of all but one of the relevant committees. \nWe know this area. We deal with the agencies that deal with \ncybersecurity and all of the national security in our country. We know \nwhat can work, we know what we have a chance to pass, and we know how \nto take the first step forward without another big regulatory \noverreach, as we have seen happen in the last 3\\1/2\\ years in this \nadministration. We hope to work with the majority, with the Lieberman-\nCollins bill, and come up with something that everyone will feel is the \nright step forward. We would like to have a bill that will get a large \nnumber of votes rather than a very lopsided vote against it.\n  I appreciate very much that we are now beginning to discuss this. I \nam appreciative that we have had several meetings with all of the sides \nthat have been put forward as having concerns with the bill that is on \nthe floor as well as its sponsors. I hope we can keep working toward a \nsolution that will protect America and do it in the right way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent to take 5 \nminutes in morning business and then speak on the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Ambassador Ryan Crocker\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would note that I saw my friend Senator \nLieberman on the floor a second ago, and I know he joins with me in \nthis statement.\n  I wish to take a few minutes to pay tribute to Ambassador Ryan \nCrocker, who ended his tour this week as the U.S. Chief of Mission in \nKabul, Afghanistan.\n  As some of my colleagues may know, Ambassador Crocker's health has \nunfortunately been poor, so he is returning to receive some much needed \ncare. But what my colleagues may not know is that Ambassador Crocker's \nhealth has been poor for some time and the people who care about him \nmost--his family, his friends and colleagues in the Foreign Service, \nand our Secretary of State herself--told Ambassador Crocker long ago \nthat he needed to leave his post and that he needed to get away from \nthe long days and long nights of too much stress and not enough sleep. \nThey told him to come home for his own sake.\n  Eventually, Ambassador Crocker relented, but still he was only going \nto leave on his own terms. He said that America asks the best of our \ncountry--our men and women in uniform and their many civilian partners \nwho work and sacrifice shoulder to shoulder with our troops in the \nfield--to serve in Afghanistan for 1 year. Ambassador Crocker said he \nwould expect no less of himself, and do no less, whatever the cost. So \nfor the past few months, Ambassador Crocker has fought through \npersistent pain and discomfort to finish out his 1-year in Kabul, doing \neverything that is asked of him--and more. On Tuesday, that year came \nto an end, and Ambassador Crocker came home to receive the care he \ndesperately needs.\n\n  This is a remarkable story, but it is only surprising to those who do \nnot know Ryan Crocker. For those of us who have had the pleasure and \nthe honor of coming to know Ryan well, this latest story is not at all \nsurprising. It is actually quite in keeping with the character and the \nactions of this superb, decent, and selfless man--a man whom I would \ncall, without question or hesitation, the most excellent Foreign \nService officer and one of the finest public servants I have ever \nknown.\n  For the past 41 years, ever since he was a junior diplomat serving in \nprerevolution Iran, Ryan Crocker has consistently answered the call to \nserve in the most challenging, the most difficult, but also the most \nimportant posts in the world. They were the places, as it turned out, \nwhere America needed Ryan Crocker the most, and he has always served \nwith distinction.\n  He was a young officer in Lebanon when our Embassy was bombed, and \nRyan Crocker helped to pull his colleagues from the rubble and then got \nback to work. He was one of the first civilians into Afghanistan and \nIraq after the recent wars, helping to reestablish our diplomatic \npresence in both countries after decades. He returned to Iraq during \nthe surge and, as General Petraeus tells everyone, was absolutely \nindispensable in turning around our war effort, even as his life was \nconstantly in danger from the rockets that smashed into his office in \nBaghdad and, perhaps more threatening, his own relentless work ethic, \nwhich literally almost killed him.\n  Many Presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, have had the wisdom \nto appoint Ryan Crocker as their Ambassador to six different \ncountries--Lebanon, Kuwait, Syria, Pakistan, Iraq, and finally \nAfghanistan.\n  Ambassador Crocker has been just as indispensable in Kabul as he has \neverywhere else in his career, from enhancing our relationship with \nPresident Karzai and the people of Afghanistan, to negotiating and \nconcluding the Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan, to \nbeing the dedicated partner every hour of every day of GEN John Allen \nand all of our men and women serving in harm's way.\n  In my many years and my many travels, I have had the pleasure and \nhonor of meeting and getting to know many of our career diplomats, and \nI am continually impressed by their high quality and tough-mindedness, \ntheir patriotism and love of their country, their constant willingness \nto serve and the many quiet sacrifices they make. But of all of these \nremarkable men and women, never have I met a Foreign Service officer \nmore outstanding or more committed to our country than Ryan Crocker.\n  The one comfort I take in Ryan's departure from Afghanistan is that \nhe remains an abiding inspiration to his fellow diplomats, who revere \nhim and hold him in the highest regard and wish to model themselves and \ntheir careers after his life and service. America will be a better and \nsafer place because of this, thanks to Ryan Crocker.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 \nbecause it would do very little to improve our country's national \nsecurity. In fact, in its present form, I believe the bill before us \nwould do more harm to our country's economy and expand the size and \ninfluence of the Federal Government--specifically, the Department of \nHomeland Security--than anything else.\n  But before I begin my critique of the Cybersecurity Act, I would like \nto reaffirm my sincere respect for the lead sponsor of this bill--both \nsponsors, actually, both Senators Lieberman and Collins. Although I \ndisagree, whatever criticisms I may have with the legislation should \nnot be interpreted as an attack on the sponsors of the bill but, \nrather, on the process by which the bill being debated today arrived \nbefore us and its public policy implications.\n  Consider this for a moment: If we pass this bill in its present form, \nwhich I hope we will not, we will have handed over one of the most \ntechnologically complex aspects of our national security to an agency \nwith an abysmal track record, the Department of Homeland Security. The \nproblems at DHS are too numerous to list here today, but I think I \nspeak for many when I question the logic of putting this agency in \ncharge of sensitive national security matters. They cannot even screen \nairline passengers without constant controversy. And do not forget that \nthis is the same outfit in charge of the Chemical Facility Anti-\nTerrorism Standards Program, or CFATS, which was described in a recent \nreport as ``at\n\n[[Page S5434]]\n\nmeasurable risk,'' beset by deep-seated problems such as wasteful \nspending and a largely unqualified workforce that lacks \n``professionalism.'' I for one am not willing to take such a broad leap \nof faith and entrust this complex area of our national security and so \nmany vibrant parts of our economy to this ineffective, bloated \ngovernment agency.\n  The poor quality of the bill before us is a direct reflection of the \nlack of a thorough and transparent committee process. Had this bill \nbeen subjected to the proper process, my colleagues and I and the \nAmerican public would have a much better understanding of the real \nimplications of this undertaking. Unfortunately, this bill has not been \nthe subject of one hearing, a single markup, or a whiff of regular \nlegislative procedure.\n  Our Nation's cybersecurity is critical, and the issue is deserving of \nthe regular order and the full attention and input of every Member of \nthis body. I urge the majority leader to allow a full, fair, and open \namendment process if cloture is invoked on the motion to proceed.\n  All of us should recognize the importance of cybersecurity. Time and \nagain we have heard from experts about the importance of maximizing our \nNation's ability to effectively prevent and respond to cyber threats. \nWe have all listened to accounts of cyber espionage originating from \ncountries such as China, organized criminals in Russia, and the depth \nof the threat from Iran in the aftermath of the Stuxnet leaks \noriginating from the current administration. Unfortunately, this bill \nwould do little to minimize those threats or generally improve our \ncurrent cybersecurity posture.\n  The reason for this bill's general inadequacy is that rather than \nusing a liability protection framework to enter into cooperative \nrelationships with the private sector, which happens to own 80 to 90 \npercent of the critical cyber infrastructure in this country, this bill \nchooses to take an adversarial approach, with government mandates and \ninadequate liability protections.\n\n  Further, this bill includes unnecessary items that our government \ncannot afford and makes no mention of what the additional programs will \ncost. For instance, I am sure some of us have fond childhood memories \nof going to or taking part in a talent show, but to include talent show \nprovisions in this bill is ridiculous. Title IV of this bill authorizes \n9th to 12th grade cyber talent shows and cyber summer programs for \nkindergartners to seniors in high school--again, ridiculous, especially \nconsidering that the majority leader deemed this bill more important \nthan the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  While I have criticisms with every title of this bill, I will limit \nmy comments today to title I, which regulates critical infrastructure, \nand title VII, which concerns information sharing among the government \nand the private sector. In my view, these titles, along with weighing \nhow much this bill, which lacks a CBO score--we do not even know how \nmuch it is going to cost--will ultimately cost and how it will \ndramatically increase the size of the Federal Government, are the most \nimportant aspects we can discuss.\n  With respect to the first title, title I, the proponents of the \nCybersecurity Act would have you believe this bill authorizes the \nprivate sector to generate their own standards, that those standards \nare voluntary, and that the bill establishes a ``public-private \npartnership.'' Unfortunately, I disagree with each of those \ncharacterizations. As the bill is currently written, the government and \nnot the private sector would have the final say on what standards look \nlike and the private sector would be forced to comply. While my \ncolleagues might suggest that section 103 states that the private \nsector proposes ``voluntary'' cybersecurity practices to the \ngovernment, I call your attention to the following provision in section \n103, which states the government would then decide whether and how to \n``amend'' or ``add'' to those cybersecurity practices. Additionally, \nthere is no recourse for the private sector to challenge the \ngovernment's actions.\n  Soon after the government's takeover of the development of \ncybersecurity standards, any notion of the standards being \n``voluntary'' evaporates. Section 103 clearly states: ``A Federal \nagency with responsibilities for regulating the security of critical \ninfrastructure may adopt the cybersecurity practices as mandatory \nrequirements.'' That is the language of the bill. What is being \nportrayed as ``voluntary'' proposals would soon become mandatory \nrequirements.\n  Unfortunately, the conversion from voluntary to mandatory does not \nstop there. Shockingly, under this bill, if an agency does not adopt \nmandatory cybersecurity practices, it must explain why it chose not to \ndo so. That is right. Under this bill, if a regulatory agency chooses \nnot to mandate the ``voluntary'' practices, it must explain itself--as \nif it must be doing something contrary to the final objective. If this \nprovision does not reveal the true regulatory intent of the proponents \nof this bill, nothing does.\n  Section 105 brings home this point by stating: ``Nothing in this \ntitle shall be construed to limit the ability of a Federal agency with \nresponsibilities for regulating the security of critical infrastructure \nfrom requiring that the cybersecurity practices developed under section \n103 be met.'' I would very much commend my colleagues to read that \nprovision of the bill. All you have to do is read it. The regulatory \nresult of these standards could not be clearer.\n  Moving on to title VII, which deals with the flow of information \nbetween the government and the private sector, the current bill is a \nstep in the wrong direction. Specifically, the bill would make us less \nsafe by failing to place the agencies with the most expertise and that \nare the most capable of protecting us on the same footing as other \nentities within the Federal Government. It strikes me as \ncounterintuitive to prevent the institutions most capable of protecting \nthe United States from a cyber attack and leave us reliant on agencies \nwith far less capabilities.\n  Because this bill fails to equitably incentivize the voluntary \nsharing of information with all of the Federal Government's cyber \ndefense assets, it does a great disservice to our national security. In \ncyber war, where speed and reaction times are essential to success, \nreal-time responses are essential. The bill language states that \ninformation should be shared in ``as close to real time as possible.'' \nThat may sound nice, but it will not get the job done.\n  We all agree that the threat we face in the cyber domain is among the \nmost significant challenges of the 21st century. It is reckless and \nirresponsible to rebuild the very stovepipes and information-sharing \nbarriers that the 9/11 Commission attributed as responsible for one of \nour greatest intelligence failures.\n  Because of my opposition to this bill and the lack of a regular \nlegislative process, I have joined with Senators Chambliss, Hutchison, \nGrassley, Murkowski, Burr, Johnson of Wisconsin, and Coats in offering \nan alternative cybersecurity bill. The fundamental difference in our \nalternative approach is that we aim to enter into a truly cooperative \nrelationship with the entire private sector through voluntary \ninformation sharing rather than an adversarial one with the threat of \nmandates. Our bill, which also addresses reforming how the government \nprotects its own assets, sets penalties for cyber crimes, refocuses \ngovernment research toward cybersecurity, and provides a commonsense \npath forward to improve our Nation's cybersecurity defenses with no new \nspending. We believe that by improving information sharing among the \nprivate sector and the government, updating our Criminal Code to \nreflect the threat cyber criminals pose, reforming the Federal \nInformation Security Management Act, and focusing Federal investments \nin cybersecurity, our Nation will be better able to defend itself \nagainst cyber attacks.\n  Even though we do not offer talent shows or summer camps in our bill, \nit has the support of the industries that themselves are under attack. \nBefore I close, I would like to leave with you a final point which gets \nto the heart of why we are having this debate. In our country, unlike \nother countries around the globe, the private sector owns 80 to 90 \npercent of the critical cyber infrastructure.\n  This is a fact in which we should all take great pride. After all, it \nspeaks to the essence of American entrepreneuralism and our spirit of \nindividualism. The companies that own these systems are large and \nsmall, they\n\n[[Page S5435]]\n\nemploy men and women everywhere, and their influence reaches every \nState, every congressional district, and about every corner of our \ncountry. While we all agree we are involved in a serious national \nsecurity discussion, we must not forget to weigh the economic realities \nof this debate too.\n  I caution all my colleagues to tread very carefully because I am \ndeeply concerned we are on the cusp of granting the Federal Government \nbroad authorities and influence over one of the most vibrant and \ninnovative sectors of our economy. The technology sector and the use of \nthe Internet by American companies to innovate and improve the customer \nexperience are deeply threatened by the heavy and too often clumsy hand \nof government.\n  As we confront the security challenges of an innovative economy, we \nmust be careful not to undermine the economy itself. It is well known \nthat we continue to have discussions amongst various parties: Senator \nKyl, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins. Sometimes \nthe crowd is large, sometimes it is not so large. I think we have made \nsome progress. I think there is a better understanding of both of the \ndifferent proposals that are before us. I do believe it is important, I \ndo believe it is very important that businesses large and small in the \nUnited States of America, whether they be the utility companies or \nwhether they be the most high-tech sectors, be represented in these \ndiscussions. We have tried to do that.\n  I believe we can make progress. I believe we can reach an agreement. \nI also know we have had several meetings and have not had extremely \nmeasurable progress. But I am committed to doing everything I can to \nsee we reach that agreement before we conclude the consideration of \nthis legislation.\n  I would also like to point out to my colleagues that I have had \nnumerous conversations with my friends on the other side of the \nCapitol. They find this legislation in its present form unacceptable. I \nwould hope we would also consider the fact that we need to get a final \nbill, not just one passed by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, consider these ominous words:\n\n       To the loved ones of the victims who are here in this room \n     . . . to those who are watching on television, your \n     government failed you. Those who you entrusted with \n     protecting you failed you. And I failed you. We tried hard, \n     but that doesn't matter, because we failed.\n\n  Those are not my words. They contain a sentiment I hope none of us \never has to convey to the American people. Those are the words of \nRichard Clarke, the senior White House official who was in charge of \ncounterterrorism efforts in the previous administration when the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks occurred.\n  Mr. Clarke's testimony before the \n9/11 Commission was apologetic, remorseful and tragic because he knew, \nhe knew like no one else, our government had failed, failed to act on \nrepeated warnings. This failure led to 9/11 and the largest loss of \nlife on American soil at the hands of a foreign enemy since December 7, \n1941, at Pearl Harbor.\n  Today, the national alarm security bells are ringing once again. This \ntime, however, the enemy is not in a terrorist training camp learning \nhow to make an explosive device or commandeer an aircraft. The enemy is \nnot trying to sneak its way into the United States. The enemy we face \ndoes not need to hijack an airplane in order to wreck the American \neconomy and to cause widespread loss of life. The only tool this enemy \nneeds is a computer and access to the Internet.\n  The threat our Nation faces from a cyber attack will soon equal or \nsurpass the threat from any terrorism that has consumed our attention \nso much since September 11. That is not my assessment. That is the \nassessment of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nRobert Mueller. In fact, he is not alone. There is an overwhelming \nbipartisan consensus among officials in the intelligence, defense, and \nnational security community that America is incredibly vulnerable to a \ncyber attack that can be launched at any moment from anywhere in the \nworld.\n  Michael Hayden, the former Director of the National Security Agency, \nMichael Chertoff, the former Secretary of Homeland Security who served \nunder President George W. Bush, agreed. They and many other officials \nhave joined the current Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet \nNapolitano, the current Director of the National Security Agency, GEN \nKeith Alexander, and others in warnings as follows: The cyber threat is \nimminent to America. It poses as serious a challenge to our national \nsecurity as the introduction of nuclear weapons in the global debate 60 \nyears ago.\n  The experts are sounding the alarm, telling us to take action now to \nprevent a catastrophic cyber attack that could cripple our Nation's \neconomy, cause widespread loss of life, sadly send our economy into \nfree fall. When the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 comes up for a vote, the \nSenate will have an opportunity to take action on this critical bill \nthat will enhance our national security. In light of these warnings \nfrom the experts, the least we can do in the Senate is to vote to open \nthe debate on this critically important bill.\n  I wish to thank its sponsors: Senator Lieberman, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Collins, the ranking member, Senator Feinstein of \nthe Intelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller on the Commerce \nCommittee. They have put a lot of time and effort into this important \npiece of legislation. They have worked together on a bipartisan basis. \nThey have listened to a wide range of comments, including a few I have \noffered, and I am pleased the revised Cybersecurity Act of 2012 \nincorporates many suggestions.\n\n  It will help make America safe by enhancing our Nation's ability to \nprevent, mitigate, and rapidly respond to cyber attacks. The bill \ncontains important provisions for securing our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure. Every day, without thinking about it, we rely on \npowerplants, pipelines, electric power grids, water treatment \nfacilities, transportation systems, and financial networks to work, to \nlive, to travel, to do so many things we take for granted.\n  All those critical systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber \nattack from our enemies. Last year, there was a 400-percent increase in \ncyber attacks reported by the owners of critical infrastructure, \naccording to the Department of Homeland Security. That increase does \nnot even account for the many attacks that went unreported.\n  We do not think twice about it, but this infrastructure is the \nbackbone of America's economy and our way of life. This bill has \nprovisions that will help minimize our vulnerability and shore up our \ndefenses. The bill also includes a new framework for voluntary \ninformation sharing so government agencies and private companies can \nimprove their mutual understanding of cyber threats and vulnerabilities \nand develop good practices to keep us safe.\n  I thought it was worth doing a few months ago to call together a \ndozen major corporations in Chicago and across Illinois that I thought, \nwith the advice of some people who were experts, might be vulnerable to \ncyber attack. I asked those experts in a closed setting, outside the \npress, what Congress could do to help them secure their infrastructure \nat their business and networks from cyber attacks.\n  The answer from each and every one of them was the same: We need to \nbe able to share information on cyber threats with the government and \nother private entities. We need to receive information from them in \norder to know what they have done to effectively prevent and mitigate \nattacks.\n  Estimates are that 85 percent of America's critical infrastructure is \nowned by the private sector. Since we depend so much on the private \nsector for our critical infrastructure, the lines of communication \nbetween government and the private sector must be open. If we share \nbest practices, the result could be to make us a secure nation.\n  Let me say as well, I have the highest regard for my friend and \ncolleague Senator John McCain of Arizona. Senator McCain's life story \nis a story of patriotism and commitment to America. He understands the \nmilitary far better than I ever will, having served and spent so many \nyears working on the House Armed Services Committee. But I take \nexception to one of his statements earlier, at least what I consider to \nbe the message of that statement, about how we have to be extremely \ncareful in how we engage the\n\n[[Page S5436]]\n\nprivate sector in keeping America safe from cyber attack.\n  I believe we should be open, transparent, and we should be respectful \nof the important resources and capacity of the private sector. But I \nthink back 70 years now to what happened in London, when there was a \nblitzkrieg, and the decision was made by the British Government to \nappeal to every business, every home, every family, every individual to \nturn out the lights, because if the lights were on, those bombers from \nGermany knew where the targets could be found. It was a national effort \nto protect a nation. Should it have been a voluntary effort? Should we \nhave had a big town meeting and said: Some of you can leave your lights \non if you like, if you think it might be an inconvenience.\n  There comes a moment when it comes to national defense when we need \nto appeal to a higher level in protecting America. My experience has \nbeen that the private sector is right there. They are as anxious to \nprotect this country as anyone. They are as anxious to protect \nindividuals, families, even their own businesses. So this notion that \nsomehow we are adversarial in protecting America with the private \nsector I do not think is the case.\n  In fact, Senator Collins is here representing the other side of the \naisle. I know it is not the case. She and I have worked together. I \nhave been very respectful of the efforts she and Senator Lieberman put \ninto rewriting the rules for our intelligence community. They did it in \na thoughtful and balanced way. This bill does too.\n  Are there amendments we might take? Of course. This is not perfect. \nNo product of legislation is. But I have to say I believe the private \nsector will be our ally, our friend, our partner in making America \nsafe. This should not be a fight to the finish as to whether it is \ngovernment or the private sector which will prevail. Ultimately, \nAmerica has to prevail.\n  Let me say a word about one part of this bill that I played a small \nrole in addressing. Even through the threat in cyberspace is new and \nemerging, it calls to the forefront a familiar attention which we \nwitnessed in Washington; on the one hand a mutually shared goal of \nprotecting our country, on the other hand an important obligation to \nsafeguard constitutionally protected rights to privacy and civil \nliberties.\n  It is this tension that led us to a conversation about some \nprovisions and trying to find the right balance. The Cybersecurity Act \nof 2012 is not perfect, but it effectively strikes that balance between \nnational security and individual liberty. The bill will enhance our \nnational security and still do it in a way that is far superior to some \nof the alternatives that will be offered on the floor.\n  CISPA, the cybersecurity act that was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, and SECURE IT, the alternative approach that has been \nintroduced in the Senate, do not meet this standard, by my estimation. \nI wish to thank Senator Collins, Senator Lieberman, and all those \nengaged in this conversation but special thanks to my colleague Senator \nFranken because he is chair of the Privacy Subcommittee of our Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  We joined together with some colleagues: Senators Coons, Blumenthal, \nSanders, and Akaka. We asked the sponsors of the legislation to work \nwith us and they did. The revised bill now requires that the government \ncybersecurity exchange, to which private companies can send threat \nindicators, must be operated by civilian agencies. I think that is \nsmart.\n  The cybersecurity threat indicator could be a sensitive, personal \ncommunication, such as an e-mail from a spouse or private message on a \nsocial media site. As a result of our efforts, no longer can personal \ncommunications be indiscriminately sent directly to the NSA or CIA. The \npeople who work at these agencies are fine, dedicated public servants, \nbut these agencies are often shrouded in secrecy. I learned that as a \nmember of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  To have the appropriate oversight, we ask that the first line of \nreview be with a civilian agency subject to congressional oversight. \nThis does not mean our intelligence and defense agencies will never be \nable to apply their experience and expertise to analyze and mitigate \ncyber threats. They should not be the first recipients, but the bill \nrequires--and I think it is entirely appropriate--relevant cyber threat \ninformation can be shared by these agencies in real time. Waste no time \ndoing it. Send it to the agencies if there is any perceived threat to \nAmerica's security.\n\n  The revised bill no longer provides immunity for companies that \nviolate the privacy rights of Americans in a knowing, intentional, or \ngrossly negligent way--not simple negligence but things that go over \nthat line dramatically.\n  I can support providing immunity for companies to share cybersecurity \nthreats with the government, as long as they take adequate precautions \nand follow commonsense rules established in the bill.\n  The revised bill enables law enforcement entities to receive \ninformation about cyber crimes from cybersecurity exchanges without \nfirst going to court to obtain a warrant. To ensure these exchanges are \nnot used to circumvent the Constitution and they do not create a \nperpetual warrantless wiretap, the bill requires law enforcement to \nonly use information from the exchanges to stop cyber crimes, prevent \nimminent death or bodily harm to adults or prevent exploitation of \nminors.\n  The revised bill now requires that the rules for how the government \nwill use and protect the private information it receives must be in \nplace before companies begin sending information to the new \ncybersecurity exchanges. That makes sense. To be sure that government \nagencies follow the rules for using and protecting private information, \nthe revised bill gives individuals the authority to hold the government \naccountable for privacy violations.\n  To ensure transparency and accountability, the revised bill requires \nrecurring, independent oversight by the inspector general and the \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\n  These are commonsense reforms. Senator Lieberman spoke to the \nDemocratic Senate caucus luncheon the other day and addressed these \ndirectly. He said he took these changes to those who were in charge of \nour cybersecurity and said to them: Give me an honest, candid \nassessment. If you think this ties our hands in protecting America, \ntell me right now. They reviewed them carefully, debated them, and came \nback and said: No, these are things we can live with and work with. \nThat is the kind of approval we are looking for from those who have \nthis awesome responsibility.\n  So as a result, this bill will have my support, because I think it \nkeeps America safe from a threat which many Americans don't even know \nabout but could literally take or change our lives in a heartbeat. It \nalso has the support of many progressive groups from the left and \ncenter and right. It is an indication to me we have struck the right \nbalance.\n  I thank those who helped us reach this point. As with any piece of \nsubstantial legislation, there is going to be disagreement. Senator \nMcCain expressed some areas of concern. That is what debate and \namendments are all about. Let's move this bill forward this afternoon. \nLet's entertain relevant, germane amendments. Let's take this as \nseriously as the threat is serious to the United States. That, to me, \nis the right way to go.\n  Again, I thank Senator Collins personally and all the others who made \nthis bill a reality in bringing it to the floor for our consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I want to rise very briefly--I know \nthere are a number of Members who are seeking recognition--to thank my \nfriend and colleague from Illinois for his statement today. He has \nworked very hard on this bill. I know it is an issue he cares deeply \nabout, and I very much appreciate his taking the time to come to the \nfloor and to urge Members to vote for the motion to proceed to the \ndebate on this absolutely vital piece of legislation.\n  I must say I was disappointed to hear some of the comments made on \nthe Senate floor today in opposition to this bill. The fact is both \nRepublican and Democratic officials have, with very\n\n[[Page S5437]]\n\nfew exceptions, endorsed the framework of this bill and urged us to \nmove forward. In fact, they have warned us repeatedly in saying the \nonly question is when a major cyber attack will occur. Not whether it \nwill occur, but when it will occur. We have letter after letter, \nstatement after statement from national and homeland security experts, \nrepresenting both President Bush's administration and the current \nadministration, urging us to act.\n  Indeed, yesterday the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group put out \na statement, stating the following:\n\n       The Aspen Homeland Security Group strongly urges the U.S. \n     Senate to vote this week to take up S. 3414, the cyber-\n     security bill, for debate on the Floor.\n\n  The statement goes on to say:\n\n       We urge the Senate to adopt a program of voluntary cyber-\n     security standards and strong positive incentives for \n     critical infrastructure operators to implement those \n     standards. The country is already being hurt by foreign \n     cyber-intrusions, and the possibility of a devastating cyber-\n     attack is real. Congress must act now.\n\n  This letter is signed by officials from the previous administration, \nsuch as Charles Allen, Stewart Baker, Michael Leiter, and Michael \nChertoff. There are numerous representatives of past administrations \nand individuals who are renowned for their expertise. How can we ignore \ntheir warning that we must act, that it is urgent, and that we must \nhave voluntary standards for critical infrastructure--infrastructure \nthat, if it were attacked, would result in mass casualties, mass \nevacuations, a severe blow to our economy, or a serious degradation of \nour national security?\n  That is the definition of the core critical infrastructure we want to \ncover and to help make more secure through a partnership with the \nprivate sector. And it has to be a partnership because 85 percent of \ncritical infrastructure is owned by the private sector. We have worked \nhard to alter our bill to take suggestions from the private sector, \nfrom our colleagues, from the administration, and from experts across \nthe philosophical range to improve our bill.\n  I heard a Member saying this morning that somehow we are going to be \nhurting the high-tech sector of our society. Well, that is not what \nCisco and Oracle think--certainly two of the leading businesses in the \nhigh-tech sector. This morning they wrote to us, the chief sponsors of \nthe bill--Chairman Lieberman, Chairman Rockefeller, Chairman Feinstein, \nmyself, and Senator Carper--and I want to read a brief excerpt from \ntheir letter. They said:\n\n       . . . we appreciate your efforts to craft legislation that \n     addresses the important issue of cybersecurity by supporting \n     American industry in its efforts to continue to be the \n     world's leading innovators.\n\n  The fact is, it is American businesses that are being robbed of \nbillions of dollars every year due to cyber intrusions from foreign \ngovernments, from transnational criminals, and from hackers. This is a \nthreat not only to our national security but to our economic \nprosperity.\n  That is why the letter from Cisco and Oracle goes on to say:\n\n       We praise your continued recognition of the importance of \n     these objectives through the provisions of S. 3414.\n\n  They say they support those provisions. Continuing to read from the \nletter:\n\n       We also commend your commitment to ensuring that the IT \n     industry maintains the ability to drive innovation and \n     security into technologies and the network.\n\n  So the idea we heard this morning on the Senate floor that somehow we \nare going to bring innovation in America to a standstill or hurt this \nimportant sector of our economy is not supported by a reading of our \nbill, and it is certainly contradicted by the letter we received from \nCisco and Oracle, leading companies in the high-tech sector.\n  Finally, I would point out they thank us for our outreach, our \nwillingness to engage in an exhaustive process around this issue set, \nand to consider and to respond to the views of America's technology \nsector. That is what we have done. That is what we are continuing to do \nwith our colleagues on both sides of the aisle who bring varying views \nto this issue. But what we cannot do is to fail to act when the \nwarnings are so constant and alarming about the threats to our Nation, \nto our economy, and to our way of life.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the statement from the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Group \nas well as the July 26 letter from Cisco and Oracle.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 24, 2012.\n\n             Statement of the Aspen Homeland Security Group\n\n       The Aspen Homeland Security Group strongly urges the U.S. \n     Senate to vote this week to take up S. 3414, the cyber-\n     security bill, for debate on the floor. We urge the Senate to \n     adopt a program of voluntary cyber-security standards and \n     strong positive incentives for critical infrastructure \n     operators to implement those standards. The country is \n     already being hurt by foreign cyber-intrusions, and the \n     possibility of a devastating cyber-attack is real. Congress \n     must act now.\n         Charles E.

Carper,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lieberman, Collins, Rockefeller, Feinstein \n     and Carper: As two of the industry-leading companies \n     providing information technology across the nation and the \n     world, we appreciate your efforts to craft legislation that \n     addresses the important issue of cybersecurity by supporting \n     American industry in its efforts to continue to be the \n     world's leading innovators. This matter deserves the \n     continuing attention of industry, the Congress and the \n     Administration, and we commend you for having constructively \n     engaged stakeholders throughout this process.\n       As you know, effective cybersecurity must be driven by an \n     IT industry that is free to drive innovation and security and \n     maintain world leadership in the creation of secure systems. \n     Effective cybersecurity depends on our having the ability to \n     drive innovation globally--it is our core value. We have long \n     advocated a cybersecurity approach based on the importance of \n     real information sharing that can help protect important \n     assets. We thank you for your leadership in recognizing that \n     any cybersecurity legislation must incorporate iron-clad \n     protections to ensure American industry remains the world's \n     leader in the creation and production of information \n     technology, and to make certain that legislation maintains \n     and protects industry's ability and opportunity to drive \n     innovation and security in technologies across global \n     networks.\n       We praise your continued recognition of the importance of \n     these objectives through the provisions of S. 3414, the \n     Cybersecurity Act of 2012. The provisions regarding the \n     designation of critical cyber infrastructure, the specifics \n     of cybersecurity practices, and the treatment of the security \n     of the supply chain demonstrate your continued recognition of \n     these core principles, and we support them. Wherever the \n     important cyber debate takes this legislation, these core \n     principles should be promoted and preserved. We believe these \n     provisions as written capture that principle and believe it \n     is in the interest of cybersecurity and critical \n     infrastructure that they remain explicit. We also commend \n     your commitment to ensuring that the IT industry maintains \n     the ability to drive innovation and security into \n     technologies and the network. Further, we appreciate the \n     recognition that more needs to be done in advancing \n     innovation through increased research and development, and in \n     raising awareness and education, and importantly on \n     increasing global law enforcement.\n       By explicitly maintaining these principles and provisions, \n     your legislation proposes a number of tools that will enhance \n     the nation's cybersecurity, without interfering with the \n     innovation and development processes of the American IT \n     industry. Ultimately, the ability of the tech industry to \n     continue to innovate will provide the best defense against \n     cyber attacks and data breaches.\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\n       We also note the shift toward a voluntary framework for \n     critical cyber infrastructure in the new bill, and commend \n     and support the great strides you have made toward that goal. \n     We look forward to continuing to work with you on this issue.\n       We thank you for your outreach, willingness to engage in an \n     exhaustive process around this issue set, and to consider and \n     respond to the views of America's technology sector. We look \n     forward to working with you and others in the Congress to \n     continue the public-private collaboration and to make sure \n     that what results continues to meet our common goals.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Blair Christie,\n\n     Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Government \n                                                          Affairs,\n                                               Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\n                                               Kenneth Glueck,\n\n                          Senior Vice President, Office of the CEO\n                                               Oracle Corporation.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about our Nation's \ndefenses against cyber attacks, and I wish to commend the Senator from \nMaine for her leadership. She is the ranking member, of course, on the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. I wish also to \ncommend all three chairs, Senators Lieberman, Feinstein, and \nRockefeller, for their work.\n  As I said, I rise today to talk about our Nation's defense against \ncyber attacks and how our Nation needs to respond to those threats \nwhich affect our national security, our economic security, and our \nprivacy.\n  News reports and experts confirm our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure, such as our water systems, our power grid and so forth, \nare vulnerable to attacks from hackers and foreign governments. Every \nfew weeks we hear about yet another breach--Yahoo and Gmail, Citibank, \nBank of America, Sony PlayStation. Millions of people have had their \nnames, passwords, credit card information or health information \ncompromised.\n  It isn't just our national security or economic well-being that is \nbeing threatened by these attacks, it is the Internet itself. If you \nwant to use Facebook or a cloud-based e-mail provider to communicate \nwith your friends and loved ones, you need to know that your private \ncommunications won't be exposed by hackers. If you want to use the \nInternet to spread new ideas or fight for democracy, you need to know \nyour work won't be disrupted by hackers or repressive regimes.\n  Unfortunately, it is hard to write a good cybersecurity bill, because \nwhen you try to make it easier for the government or Internet companies \nto detect and stop the work of hackers or other bad actors, you often \nend up making it easier--or very easy--for those same entities to snoop \nin on the lives of innocent Americans.\n  Until recently, every major cybersecurity bill on the table would \nhave done too much to immunize and expand the authority of the \ngovernment and industry and far too little to protect our privacy and \ncivil liberties. These bills would make it too easy for companies to \nhand over your e-mails and other private information to the \ngovernment--even to the military. Setting aside the fourth amendment, \nthese bills would allow almost all of that information to go to law \nenforcement. And these bills do far too little to hold these companies \nand the government accountable for their mistakes.\n  A few months ago, I teamed up with Senators Durbin, Wyden, Sanders, \nCoons, Blumenthal, and Akaka to try to address this situation. We \nworked with privacy and civil liberties groups on the left, the right, \nand the center to come up with a package of proposals. We worked with \nthe ACLU, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the Center for \nDemocracy and Technology, which are traditionally associated with \nprogressives; we worked with the Constitution Project, which is a \nbipartisan centrist think tank; and we worked with TechFreedom and the \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, which are conservative libertarian \norganizations.\n  Together, we approached Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, \nChairman Rockefeller, and Chairman Feinstein, and proposed a package of \namendments to the information-sharing title of the Cybersecurity Act of \n2012.\n  The information-sharing title is the part of the bill that will make \nit easier for companies to share critical information about cyber \nattacks with each other and with the government. These Senators engaged \nwith us earnestly and in good faith. After a lot of hard work and a lot \nof conversations, the sponsors made a series of changes to the bill \nthat are major, unequivocal victories for privacy and civil liberties.\n  The bill is still not perfect, from my point of view, but I can say \nwith confidence that when it comes to protecting both our cybersecurity \nand our civil liberties, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 is the only game \nin town.\n  I want to take a moment to explain the changes made to the \ninformation-sharing title, and compare how the Cybersecurity Act now \nstacks up with its rival bills, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and \nProtection Act, or CISPA, which recently passed the House, and the \nSECURE IT Act, which has been introduced here in the Senate.\n  First of all, I agree we need to make it easier for companies to \nshare time-sensitive information with experts in the government. But \nthe cyber threat information that companies are sharing often comes \nfrom private, sensitive communications, like our e-mails. And so the \ngatekeeper of any information shared under these proposals should never \nbe the military. It should never be the NSA. The men and women of the \nNSA are patriots and they are undoubtedly skilled and knowledgeable. \nBut as Senator Durbin said, that institution is too shrouded in \nsecrecy. And--he didn't say but as I will say--it has too dark a \nhistory of spying on innocent Americans to be trusted with this \nresponsibility under any administration.\n  Under the new, revised Cybersecurity Act of 2012, the one that will \nsoon be before us on the floor, companies can use the authorities in \nthe bill to give cyber threat information only to civilian agencies. \nThat is a critical protection for civil liberties, and it is a \nprotection that CISPA and the SECURE IT Act do not have. I want to be \nvery clear. An America with CISPA and an America with the SECURE IT Act \nis an America where your e-mails can be shared directly, immediately, \nand with impunity, with the NSA.\n  Second, any cybersecurity bill should focus on just that--\ncybersecurity. It should not be a back door for warrantless wiretaps or \ninformation entirely unrelated to cyber attacks. In other words, once a \ncompany gives the government cyber threat information, the government \nshouldn't be able to say, Hey, this e-mail doesn't have a virus, but it \ndoes say that Michael is late on his taxes; I am going to send that to \nthe IRS.\n  Under the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, once a cyber exchange gets \ninformation, it can give that information to law enforcement only to \nprosecute or stop a cyber crime or to stop serious imminent harm to \nadults or serious harm to minors. CISPA actually has similar \nprotections, but SECURE IT allows a far broader range of disclosures to \nlaw enforcement. Here in the Senate, the Cybersecurity Act is the \nproposal that does the most to respect the spirit and letter of the \nfourth amendment.\n  Third, a cybersecurity bill should make it easier for a company to \nshare information with experts in the government. But it has to hold \ncompanies that abuse that authority accountable for their actions. Both \nCISPA and the SECURE IT Act give companies immunity for knowing \nviolations of your privacy. Under CISPA and the SECURE IT Act, if a \ncompany's CEO knows for a fact that his engineers are sending every one \nof your e-mails to the NSA, there is nothing you can do about it. That \nis not an exaggeration. Thanks to the changes I have pushed for--along \nwith Senators Durbin, Wyden, Coons, Sanders, Blumenthal, and Akaka--the \nCybersecurity Act does not protect companies that violate your privacy \nintentionally, knowingly, or with gross negligence.\n  Fourth, and finally, a cybersecurity bill should also hold the \ngovernment accountable for its actions. Under both CISPA and the SECURE \nIT Act, companies can start giving the Federal Government your private \ninformation well before the government actually has privacy rules in \nplace for how to handle that information.\n  Under the SECURE IT Act, the government has total immunity from \nlawsuits arising out of its cybersecurity\n\n[[Page S5439]]\n\noperations--total immunity for the government. The SECURE IT Act also \nlacks any regular independent oversight of the Federal Government's \nactions under these new authorities. The Cybersecurity Act of 2012 now \nhas all three of these protections. Under this bill, privacy rules have \nto be in place on the first day companies start giving the government \ninformation. People can sue the government when it abuses its \nauthority. And there will be recurrent, independent oversight by both \nthe Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and inspectors general.\n  These are just the four main categories of changes that the sponsors \nof the Cybersecurity Act have adopted. There are other changes, too, \nthat I won't go into now.\n  Before I close, I want to elaborate on one way I do think we need to \nimprove the Cybersecurity Act to better protect privacy. The sponsors \nof the bill have rightly adopted several critical protections. I hope \nthey will accept at least one more amendment that I think is very \nimportant. I will talk about my amendment more on another occasion, but \nfor now I want to flag it for my colleagues.\n  For decades, Federal law has given Internet service providers and \nother companies the right to monitor their systems to protect \nthemselves and their customers from cybersecurity threats. They also \nhave the right to deploy what are called countermeasures to protect \ntheir systems against those threats. So these companies have the right \nto monitor and protect themselves; but at the same time, Federal law \nprevents them from abusing those rights. If an ISP starts randomly \npicking customers and reading their e-mails, their customers--and the \ngovernment--can take them to court, and the ISP can't throw its hands \nup and plead cybersecurity.\n\n  This is why, when the President of the United States brought together \nall of the Federal agencies to craft a bill that would comprehensively \nprotect our cybersecurity, that proposal included a new authority for \ncompanies to disclose information to the government but contained no \nnew authority for companies to monitor e-mail or deploy \ncountermeasures. When the administration's lawyers were asked why that \nwas, they said that doing so would have been duplicative--duplicative--\nbecause the companies already have those rights.\n  Right now, the Cybersecurity Act and the President's proposal are not \nin line with each other, because unlike the President's proposal, the \nCybersecurity Act does give ISPs and other companies a brandnew right \nto monitor communications and to deploy countermeasures. That right is \nvery broad--so broad that if a company uses that power negligently to \nsnoop in on your e-mail or damage your computer, they will be immune \nfrom any lawsuit. I plan to offer an amendment to delete these new \nmonitoring and countermeasures authorities and bring this bill in line \nwith the President's proposal. I hope my colleagues here in the Senate \nwill join me in passing this amendment. Seven of my colleagues have \nalready indicated they will cosponsor this amendment.\n  But I want to end on a high note. I don't want my amendment to cloud \nmy central message here, so I will repeat what I said earlier. The \nCybersecurity Act is not perfect, but when it comes to striking a \nbalance between cybersecurity and privacy and civil liberties, it is \nthe only game in town. It is far more protective of our rights than \neither CISPA or the SECURE IT Act. I thank the sponsors of the \nCybersecurity Act for taking this high road, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote to proceed to the bill so we can have a good, full debate on \nit.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I am honored to be able to join the \nSenator from Minnesota in speaking today in support of all the Members \nof this body voting to proceed to the consideration of the important \ncybersecurity bill to which he and Senator Durbin have spoken.\n  Today we have an opportunity to celebrate progress--very real, very \nconcrete, and very important progress--in the legislative efforts to \nmake America both more secure and yet retain our core constitutional \nfreedoms: the protections of privacy that Americans have held dear from \nthe very beginning of this Republic.\n  As I have said before on this floor, taking action to protect our \nNation from the very real and urgent threat of cyber attack is of \nparamount importance, something so urgent that it deserves our \nundivided attention. But so is protecting the privacy rights of law-\nabiding American citizens.\n  As we work together toward this commonsense, compromise piece of \nlegislation the Senate should consider in coming days, I fought hard, \nalong with several colleagues, to ensure we maintain the right balance \nbetween privacy and security. That balance is essential. Compromising \nour liberty would be as dangerous as compromising our safety. But \nthanks to the hard work of so many of my colleagues--in particular \nSenator Durbin, Senator Franken, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Merkley, \nSenator Sanders, and others--we found that appropriate balance in this \nlegislation that is before us.\n  The changes we have made to the original text and to the House-passed \nversion have significantly strengthened privacy rights. That is why I \nsay we can celebrate real progress here today.\n  I long thought it was the privacy issues that would be the rock on \nwhich this ship would founder, that the critical and unaddressed \nprivacy issues in CISPA and SECURE IT, spoken to by Senator Franken, \nwould be issues that would prevent me from supporting cybersecurity \nlegislation in this session of Congress. But we have made remarkable \nprogress. Let me briefly review a few of the areas where that progress \nhas been made.\n  We made sure companies cannot pry into the private online activities \nof everyday Americans in the name of national security. I want to \nmention one more improvement.\n  In addition to those mentioned by Senator Franken just before me \nconcerning legal immunities contained in this bill, this bill \nappropriately gives companies the authority to share cyber threat-\nrelated information with each other and the government, without which \nwe can't know what the rapidly emerging significant national cyber \nthreats are. It also gives them immunity from suit if they do so. So if \ncompanies share with each other real-time cyber threat information, \nthey cannot be sued. But prior versions of this bill might have \nprovided bad actors with immunity against all privacy laws. So instead, \nwe added tough provisions to ensure if a company acts recklessly or \nwillfully to violate the law and the online privacy of its customers, \nthey will be held accountable. This legislation now, in my view, \nstrikes an appropriate balance between empowering companies and \nproviding them certainty, as well as maintaining the privacy rights of \nAmericans and their customers.\n  In this new, better, stronger legislation, it is no longer the case \nthat companies can share your data and violate your privacy because you \ninteract with them online. If that had remained in this bill, I would \nhave expected millions of Americans to mobilize to stop this \nlegislation. But we are here today as a group of Senators to announce \nthat real progress has been made, and we are comfortable with and \nsupport this legislation from a privacy perspective.\n  I urge my colleagues, when we take up this vote later this afternoon, \nto vote to proceed to the bill and to allow us a full and robust debate \non this cybersecurity legislation.\n  Getting to this new and improved legislation was a team effort, and \nspecial credit is due to Senators Lieberman and Collins for leading the \nway, for being willing to find common ground on challenging issues. \nThere was also a great deal of work done by my senior Senator Tom \nCarper and by Senators Feinstein and Rockefeller who chair committees \nand were also essential to making such great progress.\n  One of the aspects of cybersecurity and the threat to our country \nthat keeps me up at night is that it is constantly evolving. Our \nenemies are smart, they are capable, and they are fast. That means our \ncyber defenses have to be flexible, adaptable, and regularly evaluated \nin order to keep up.\n  One good thing about the House version of this legislation is that it \nincludes a sunset provision requiring that in 5 years, this body once \nagain\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nmust take a hard and serious look at cybersecurity threats, and update \nor change our defense as needed, and ensure that privacy protections \nhave been fully observed.\n  That is not just good strategy, it is good sense. Think about the \ncapabilities of your computer, your cell phone 5 years ago compared to \ntoday. The pace of change is faster online than ever before, and we \nneed the kind of legislative process that allows us to review our work \nand ensure not only that we stay ahead of the curve in defending our \ncountry but we continue to strike the right balance between privacy and \nsecurity.\n  That is why, similar to Senator Franken before me, I intend to \nintroduce an amendment on the floor--which I hope will earn \nconsideration by this body and the support of my colleagues--to take \nthe sunset provision of our House counterparts and match that in the \nSenate in this bill. It is the right thing to do to help keep us safe \nand to help our military leaders and cybersecurity experts stay one \nstep ahead of those who would wish us harm.\n  In closing, I thank Senator Whitehouse, who has been an important \npart of two different teams working on this bill. Senators Kyl and \nWhitehouse led a team that worked hard on critical infrastructure. I \nwish to thank Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut, who participated in \nthe privacy side work and in the critical infrastructure work. Now we \nare speaking to title VII, to the information-sharing provision of the \nbill and the dramatic and real progress that has been made in \naddressing the balance between security and privacy.\n  There has also been great progress made, in my view, in addressing \nthe issues of critical infrastructure, and I invite Senator Blumenthal \nof Connecticut, who has contributed so well to both these efforts, to \naddress the Chamber at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank my very distinguished and \neffective colleague from Delaware for his great work as part of a team \nthat has sought to enhance the protections of privacy in this bill. His \nperspective as a local official, as a constitutional expert, as someone \nwho cares deeply about privacy and civil liberties, has been invaluable \nto this effort. He too has participated in the critical infrastructure \nteam which both of us have been privileged to join with Senators \nWhitehouse and Kyl, who have been so enormously helpful in this effort. \nI join him as well in thanking our colleagues Senators Akaka, Durbin, \nFranken, Sanders, and Wyden for their very important efforts to protect \nprivacy and civil liberties in the information-sharing title of the \ncybersecurity act.\n  We have truly worked as a team and, in many ways, a bipartisan team \nin forging this legislation. Of course, we have followed the lead of \nSenators Lieberman and Collins who have been at the forefront of this \neffort, as well as Senators Rockefeller, Feinstein, and Carper, who \ndeserve our appreciation for drafting the bill, shepherding it through \ncommittee, and bringing a modified version to the floor where now we \nhave the historic opportunity to move forward. I am here to urge my \ncolleagues, in fact, to move forward and vote to proceed to the bill \nlater today.\n  We have made good progress on this legislation. I am optimistic that \nwe will pass a cybersecurity bill in the very near future--as we must \nfor all the reasons that have been articulated by myself and others. \nThis Nation is under attack. It is under cyber attack. Literally, every \nday our defense industrial base, our military systems, and our private \nindustry are under attack by nations and by hackers, both sophisticated \nand unsophisticated, abroad and at home. We must make sure we provide \nthe tools and the resources, legal resources and authority to stop that \nattack, to deter it, to defeat it, to make sure our country is defended \nagainst it effectively and comprehensively.\n  The nature of defending against cyber attack involves information \nsharing. There is no way around that basic fact that information about \nthe attacks--the sources, the objects and targets, the times--all the \ndetails are, in essence, the power to defend. Information is power when \nit comes to defending against cyber attack. Yet we also know that \ninformation, when shared, can also be abused. Some of the most tragic \nchapters of our Nation's history have involved snooping, spying, \nsurveilling, and then sharing of information that is inappropriate and \nunnecessary and sometimes illegal.\n  We know also that one of our core constitutional protections is, in \nfact, the right to privacy. It is enshrined in our Constitution. It \ndates from our founding. It is integral to the fabric of the rule of \nlaw. We resisted and rejected the rule of the British, in part, because \nthey had no respect for the privacy of the colonials. That basic value \nhas inspired the rule of law since.\n  There is a saying--I believe it is a Latin saying--that in war, law \nis the first casualty. We are in a cyber war, but our constitutional \nlaw cannot be a casualty. Our right to privacy and civil liberties must \nbe protected.\n  Information sharing must involve the right information shared with \nthe right people and officials for the right purposes. There must be \nred lines and red lights. There must be consequences if those red lines \nor red lights are disregarded or dismissed.\n  This bill meets those basic requirements. It is enforceable and it \nmust be enforced. In fact, I will offer an amendment to increase the \nenforceability and enforcement of these basic protections by increasing \nthe penalties for violating these basic protections. The trust and \nconfidence of our Nation in the rule of law depends on our getting it \nright: information sharing with the right information to the right \npeople and for the right purposes.\n  The kinds of modifications contained in this bill are critically \nimportant. They are in sharp contrast to the House-approved version of \nCISPA, which utterly fails to protect civil liberties and privacy \nrights in sufficient degree. Unlike past versions, this measure \nestablishes unequivocal civilian control of cybersecurity information \nexchanges. Unlike past versions, this bill bars companies from using \ncybersecurity as a pretext for violating FCC net neutrality rules. \nUnlike other versions, this bill bars companies from using \ncybersecurity as a pretext for violating other guarantees, and it \nallows citizens to hold companies accountable and take them to court \nfor knowingly or grossly negligent violations of the information-\nsharing provisions of this bill.\n  Equally important, it enables them to hold the U.S. Government and \nother public officials responsible and take them to court if they \nviolate the privacy guarantees in this bill.\n  A private company receiving someone's private information while \nmonitoring for cyber threat should protect that information. It is a \npublic trust and a public responsibility. This act protects Americans' \nprivacy by requiring companies that obtain that kind of information--\nsome of it medical or financial of the most confidential and private \nnature--through monitoring, to protect that information.\n  This measure also imposes restrictions on the use of shared \ninformation for law enforcement purposes. The government can only \nprovide information to law enforcement if it relates to a cyber crime \nor a serious threat to public safety; that is, physical safety--bodily \nharm. Law enforcement can only use information to prosecute or stop \ncyber attacks to prevent that kind of imminent and immediate harm to a \nperson or a child.\n  There are other protections--some of them have been mentioned by \nSenators Franken and Coons before me--that I will support. For example, \nSenator Franken mentioned that his amendment would eliminate new \nauthorities in the bill to monitor communications or operate \ncountermeasures. Senator Coons mentioned a 5-year sunset on the use of \ninformation sharing under this measure to help guard against unforeseen \nconsequences of the legislation and ensure that congressional oversight \noccurs on a regular and foreseeable basis. Other measures which I \nconsider important would require Federal agencies that suffer a data \nbreach to notify affected individuals and allow those individuals to \nrecover damages and require the creation of a new office in the Office \nof Management and Budget, that of Chief Privacy Officer.\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\n  I support these amendments and I support also increasing the \npenalties in the event that government or companies violate the \nprotections in this statute.\n  We have indeed made progress. There is more to do. I hope more \nprogress will be made. I foresee passage of a cybersecurity measure \nthat is desperately and direly needed in this country--not at some \npoint in the future but now. As others before me have said on this \nfloor and as I have said before, cybersecurity is national security and \nwe must protect our national security while at the same time retaining \nthe reason, our fundamental rights and civil liberties, that we want to \nprotect our Nation and its constitutional values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madame President, I ask that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded and that I may speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator may speak as in morning business.\n\n\n                            Meatless Monday\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, yesterday I was on the Senate floor, and \nI had the opportunity to highlight a development at the Department of \nAgriculture. We learned yesterday afternoon that the Department of \nAgriculture, in an employee newsletter, was promoting something called \nMeatless Mondays. The Department of Agriculture newsletter offered \nencouragement for its employees and I assume others who might see the \nnewsletter--even tourists who visit Washington, DC, and eat at the \nDepartment of Agriculture cafeteria--to participate in Meatless Monday. \nIt indicates the desirability of reducing the consumption of meat and \ndairy products. I found that very startling and surprising. Never in my \nlife would I expect the Department of Agriculture, which I always \npresumed is the farmers' and ranchers' friend, to be promoting the idea \nthat it is a bad idea to eat the products of farms and ranches across \nKansas and our Nation. Yet that is what we saw and read yesterday.\n  The Department of Agriculture newsletter said that ``beef production \nrequires a lot of water, fertilizer, fossil fuels, and pesticides. In \naddition, there are many health concerns related to excessive \nconsumption of meat.'' Those are the words of the Department of \nAgriculture newsletter. I am pleased to report that in asking Secretary \nVilsack to reconsider what the Department had said and was promoting, \nthey have done that and they have apparently removed the promotion from \ntheir newsletter and from their Web site. That is a positive \ndevelopment, and so I appreciate that happening.\n  It is amazing to me, unfortunately, that this is just one of many \ncircumstances in which we see administration agencies and departments \non the side of something that those of us who believe strongly in \ntraditional family agriculture across the country believe is very \nimportant. One would expect in this case that the Department of \nAgriculture would promote the consumption of meat. In fact, within the \nDepartment of Agriculture, we have the Secretary saying in his mission \nstatement that he is about increasing and expanding domestic and \nforeign markets for beef and meat products. We have the U.S. beef \nboard, organized and monitored by the Department of Agriculture, whose \njob it is to promote agricultural products. Many of us in Congress try \nto encourage the sale of agricultural products, particularly meat and \nbeef products, to South Korea and China. We have debated on the Senate \nfloor the value of trade agreements, most recently with Colombia, South \nKorea, and Panama, because we believe in the opportunity for American \nproducers to sell their products around the globe. Yet we saw at least \nsome at USDA who have the view that we need to discourage the \nconsumption of meat for environmental and health reasons.\n  Particularly troublesome is the fact that the Department of \nAgriculture was citing the United Nations as a reason that we ought to \ndiscourage the consumption of beef for environmental reasons. Our \nDepartment of Agriculture positions ought to be based upon sound \nscience, not some U.N. study.\n  Beef is an important and vital component of the Kansas economy. We \nare the second largest beef-producing State in the country. The \neconomic impact to our country is around $44 billion. Beef exports in \n2011 were over $4.08 billion. This matters to us greatly.\n  This is happening at a time in which to the cattle producers across \nthe Midwest, including in the State of the President today, the drought \nis so damaging.\n  It is also happening at a time in which we have been having the \ndebate about the farm bill. My farmers in Kansas will often say: I know \nwe need to do something about reducing spending. We have to get the \ndeficit under control.\n  In fact, the farm bill we passed in the Senate has a reduction in the \nfarm bill spending of $23 billion. No one likes to see something that \nis important to them go away, but if this farm bill becomes legislation \nand direct payments leave, the safety net for producers across our \ncountry will be less. Yet farmers and ranchers say: We have a \nresponsibility as American citizens to give these things up, to reduce \nthe spending that comes our way, but please don't do anything that is \ndamaging to us as far as our ability to earn a living in the free \nmarket, in the real world.\n  So when we see something like this from the Department of Agriculture \ndiscouraging the use of meat products--and, again, at a time in which \nthe temperatures across my State have been over 100 degrees for more \nthan a month. We had a record high of 118 degrees. Perhaps that is a \nrecord high on the globe. It certainly is in the United States. In \nNorton, KS, it was 118 degrees. Rain is so scarce, we spend a lot of \ntime in our State down on our knees praying for moisture and we spend a \nlot of time looking up to the skies hoping for moisture. We need to \nmake sure that what we do in this Congress and what the Obama \nadministration does is not something that diminishes the chances for \nthe survival of family farms in the United States, certainly at home in \nKansas and around rural America.\n  If this was just an isolated instance, perhaps the point has been \nmade and the words have been withdrawn, but I remember we started a \nyear ago with a Department of Labor that concluded that we need to \nregulate the use of 14- and 15-year-olds on family farms. That was a \nreal misunderstanding of how production agriculture and family farms \nwork. Agriculture is a family operation, and yet we had the Department \nof Labor suggesting that someone 15 years old should perhaps not be \nable to work on their own family's farm. I remember just 6 months or so \nago, I was on the Senate floor worried about a Department of \nAgriculture forum on animal safety that was being organized by the \nHumane Society. Again, my farmers and ranchers would say--particularly \nin a time of drought and where the safety net provided by the farm bill \nis going to become less--please don't do anything that is harmful to \nus, that reduces the chance for us to succeed.\n  In this regulatory environment in which we find ourselves, we need to \ntake the steps that promote agriculture, not do things that diminish \nthe opportunity for a farmer or rancher to earn a living in the free \nmarket.\n  Yesterday we had a debate about estate taxes and the consequences to \nfamily agriculture across the country, and again, at a time in which \nthe drought is so prevalent, circumstances so difficult, the Tax Code \nmatters greatly and the ability to pass a family farm from one \ngeneration to the next is critical. It is so much about agriculture in \nStates such as mine that when our farmers and ranchers don't succeed, \nthe success of the communities in which they live and raise their kids \ngreatly diminishes. This is a way of life for us, and we need to make \ncertain we have a Department of Agriculture that is promoting our \nfarmers and ranchers and their success.\n  I was on the Senate floor yesterday with the Senator from Wyoming. We \nhad a conversation about the drought, the estate taxes, and the farm \nbill. I am interested if the Senator from Wyoming has any further \nthoughts. I know he is a leader in the Western Caucus. As Members of \nthe Senate, we are in\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\nthe process of writing Secretary Vilsack in regard to the promotion of \nMeatless Monday. There are those who have a different view about what \ntheir menus should be and what they want to see on the menu, and that \nis fine with me. That is a personal decision. But the Department of \nAgriculture ought to be supportive of the people who produce the food, \nfiber, and energy for our country each and every day. They get up at \nsunrise and go to bed after sunset because they are out there trying to \nmake a living on family farms across the country.\n  I yield for the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, never in my life would I expect to see \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture come out against farming, ranching, \nagriculture, and its products.\n  I was talking to a radio station this morning in Afton, WY. They were \nastonished. They had not heard the news of this yet, and they are now \nfully aware of it. They are grateful to the Senator from Kansas because \none of those involved actually had heard the Senator on the floor last \nnight talking about Meatless Mondays and then the USDA linking ranching \nand farming to climate change. It is not just cattle or beef \nproducers--and beef is clearly the No. 1 cash crop for Wyoming--but the \nUSDA has gone after dairy products, such as milk and cheese, as part of \na climate change issue.\n  So this does seem to be an assault against a way of life, a \nsignificant part of our country's heritage, as well as our economic \nfuture. We see this assault on our products through the Department of \nAgriculture. We see it as an assault on family values of young families \nworking together, as we have seen with the Department of Labor. And now \nyesterday, with a vote on this Senate floor, there was an attack by a \nreinstitution of the death tax. People are trying to keep a family \noperation within the family, a ranch or a farm, all across rural \nAmerica. These small businesses in communities all across the country \nare finding that it is going to be much more difficult, under what the \nDemocrats voted for yesterday, to keep their ranches and farms in the \nfamily.\n  I know farmers and ranchers in Wyoming where a member of the family \nworks in town just to make the money to pay the expenses of keeping the \noperation of the farm or the ranch going. They know full well that \nunder the Democratic proposal, if someone were to die, once that \nbecomes the case, their chances of being able to hold on to that \noperation are reduced to almost nothing. Bringing back the costs of the \ndeath tax to the levels of the Clinton administration, anything over $1 \nmillion in assessed value would be taxed at 55 percent. The only \nsolution for many is to sell.\n  There are three specific attacks: the death tax attack, the Meatless \nMonday attack, and the attack on children helping out on the family or \nneighbor farm or ranch. There are values that they learn through the \nFFA. All of those things make me wonder in what direction the country \nis heading. I guess that is no surprise when only one in three \nAmericans all across the country think the country is heading in the \nright direction.\n  I am happy to join my colleague from Kansas who came to the Senate \nfloor yesterday to bring this to the attention of the Senate. He and I \nare working together to now address the Secretary of Agriculture to \nmake sure that something like this doesn't happen again and to make \nsure that the Secretary does insist that farmers and ranchers across \nthis country--and the products that they make and should be promoted by \nthe Department of Agriculture--receive the proper honor that is \ndeserved by them for what they do to continue to put food on the table \nand continue to bring forth the values from those who built this great \ncountry.\n  I thank my friend and colleague, the Senator from Kansas, for \nbringing this to the attention of the Nation.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, just to conclude my remarks, I would \nindicate that my family and I will be eating more beef, not less. I \nwould urge Americans to respond in that way. It is an opportunity for \nus to support the cattlemen and the livestock producers of our country \nat a time when they are selling their herds because the drought is so \nsevere that there is no grass and no feed to feed the cattle. As a \nresult, the market is depressed and prices are lower because there are \nso many sales occurring. We can help our livestock producers, our farm \nand ranch families in the country, by having a hamburger or steak. \nLet's go back to that traditional American meal of ``let's eat beef.'' \nThe front of my truck at home says ``Eat Beef,'' and I would encourage \nKansans and Americans to do so at this time when our livestock \nproducers, due to the drought, are struggling so greatly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today, as I do \nweek after week since the health care law was passed, to give a \ndoctor's second opinion about the health care law that I believe is bad \nfor patients, bad for the providers, the nurses and the doctors who \ntake care of those patients, and terrible for the American taxpayers.\n  I come to the floor today reminding myself and the Senate of some \npromises the President made during the health care debate. The \nPresident had a couple of key promises. The first was he stated that \nhealth insurance premiums would go down. The second promise he made was \nthat if a person likes their insurance plan, they can keep it.\n  The President actually reiterated the second point after the Supreme \nCourt issued its decision regarding the health care law a few weeks \nago. From the East Room of the White House, the President proclaimed:\n\n       If you're one of the 250 million Americans who already have \n     health insurance, you will keep your health insurance.\n\n  Perhaps the President does not know that his health care law has \nalready forced many colleges and universities to stop offering their \nstudent health plans or perhaps the President is unaware that one can \nno longer purchase a child-only health insurance policy in many States, \nincluding my home State of Wyoming.\n  Apparently, the President has not spoken to businesses across the \ncountry that must actually deal with the ramifications of his health \ncare law. I speak with business owners around Wyoming every weekend as \nI travel around the State, and the people with whom I speak believe the \nlaw will increase the cost of their insurance, increase the cost of \ntheir care, and make it more difficult for them to provide insurance \nfor their employees.\n  Now we have a new study--a report that has come out from the Deloitte \nconsulting firm--and it has spoken to businesses all across the country \nabout the law. The results were compiled in their 2012 survey of \nemployers. In this report, the company did random surveys of 560 \ncompanies with 50 or more employees. These results are only from \ncompanies that currently offer health insurance to their employees.\n  So what are the results? Well, the results are not encouraging. They \nfound that approximately 1 in 10 employers is considering dropping the \nhealth coverage they currently supply to their employees over the next \nfew years. Specifically, they found that 9 percent of companies expect \nto drop their insurance coverage, while another 10 percent of \nrespondents said they weren't sure about how they would proceed. The \nsurvey revealed that small businesses--those with between 50 and 100 \nworkers--are going to be hit especially hard by this new health care \nlaw.\n  Thirteen percent of the businesses in this category stated they would \ndrop their insurance coverage in the next 1 to 3 years. Thirteen \npercent of all of those small businesses with between 50 and 100 \nemployees plan to drop their insurance within 1 to 3 years.\n  Keep in mind that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office did \nsome evaluations and thought that only 7 percent of workers would lose \ntheir employer-provided health insurance starting in 2014 because the \nPresident, looking straight into the camera straight from the White \nHouse, said, ``If you like what you have, you can keep it.''\n  Companies also made it clear that how implementation of the health \ncare law moves forward would impact their\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\ndecisions. How so? Here is an example: Approximately one-third of the \ncompanies stated they might decide to stop offering health insurance if \nthey find that the law passed by the Democrats in this Senate, along \npartisan lines--if these companies find that the health insurance under \nthe law and required by the law requires them to offer more generous \nbenefits than they currently provide, they are likely--one-third--to \ndiscontinue providing health insurance.\n  Why is that? Well, it is because the President's health care law \nactually mandates what kind of insurance companies must give to their \nemployees. This is what is called the essential health benefits package \nor, as most Americans refer to it, government-approved insurance. It \nmay not be the insurance you want or the insurance you like; it may not \nbe the insurance you need or it may not be the insurance you can \nafford. No matter how we look at it, the President and those who \nsupported this law say they know better than American consumers, \nAmerican workers, and people in need of insurance.\n  So instead of allowing businesses and workers to decide what kind of \ninsurance they need, the health care law empowers Federal bureaucrats \nto make this decision.\n  In an article that recently appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the \nchief financial officer of McDonald's stated that he thought \nimplementing the health care law could cost his company more than $400 \nmillion a year. So businesses that decide they can't afford to offer \nthis government-approved insurance are going to be forced to pay a \npenalty.\n  How big is the penalty? That is a legitimate question. The Supreme \nCourt says it is a tax--a tax. So they are going to have to pay a tax. \nSo for companies with over 50 employees, they will have to pay, \nstarting at $2,000 per worker. That sounds like a lot of money, but \nkeep this in mind: In 2011 the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the \naverage cost of employer-provided health insurance for families was \nover $15,000. So they can decide: Do they pay the government $2,000, \nthat tax, or do they pay $15,000 for the insurance? This means many \ncompanies would have a sizable financial incentive to simply drop the \ninsurance.\n  So then what happens? What happens to these folks who previously had \nthe insurance the President said they could keep? Of course, we all \nknow they can't because, once again, the President misled the American \npeople--I believe intentionally. Well, then these employees who were \ndropped would have to enroll in a government-run exchange. So what \nhappens in the exchange? Well, many of these individuals would qualify \nfor subsidies from the Federal Government to help them purchase \ninsurance--subsidies from the Federal Government to help them pay for \ninsurance that they were previously getting at work, but now because of \nthe health care law they can't get it anymore.\n  So who is going to end up subsidizing this? The American taxpayers \nare now going to be paying for the health insurance instead of the \nemployer. This is not only going to cause many Americans to lose their \nhealth insurance, but it will also make the $1 trillion health care law \neven more expensive than the Congressional Budget Office said this past \nweek.\n\n  Many businesses surveyed stated they do not intend on dumping the \nhealth insurance plans, but they said something else. They said they \nare not going to stop providing it. Instead, employers are saying to \nworkers: If you want to keep this, you are going to have to pick up the \nadditional cost of your insurance coverage, and you are going to have \nto do it by helping to pay higher copays, higher deductibles, or \nparticipating and contributing to the higher premiums we are going to \nhave to pay.\n  So for those Americans lucky enough to keep their employer-provided \ncoverage, they will now be paying more money for that privilege. This \nmeans employees have essentially two alternatives under this health \ncare law. Either they will lose their employer-provided coverage or \nthey will be facing higher insurance premiums.\n  For over 150 million Americans who receive their insurance through \ntheir employer, neither of these choices is a good one. It didn't have \nto be this way. That is why I remain committed to repealing the \nPresident's health care law and replacing it with patient-centered \nreforms that will allow patients to get the care they need from a \ndoctor they choose at lower cost.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I am here to talk about two very different subjects, \ntwo very different bills. One is the farm bill, and one is the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. Both bills are stuck over in the House of \nRepresentatives, and both bills should pass. Both bills received \nsignificant bipartisan support in the Senate. I am simply asking my \ncolleagues in the other body to get their job done and to get these \nbills passed.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  I will start with the farm bill. Minnesota is fifth in the country \nfor agriculture. It means a lot to our State, it means a lot to the \nrural areas, but it is also tied to our metropolitan area with our farm \nbusinesses, with our food producers, and it is clearly tied in with the \nrest of the country. This spring's talk of a bin-busting crop has \nburned away under the extreme summer heat. Farmers and ranchers across \nthe country are experiencing what the U.S. Department of Agriculture is \ncalling the most widespread drought we have seen in decades.\n  With nearly 90 percent of the corn and soybean crops being grown in \nareas impacted by the drought, the crop losses are being felt not just \nby our grain farmers but also are driving up feed prices for our \nlivestock, poultry, and dairy producers. As we well know, dairy \nproducers have already come off some very difficult years.\n  Higher feed costs for cattle, pork, poultry and dairy impact all \nAmericans at the grocery store. Yesterday the USDA estimated that \nconsumers could expect to pay 3 to 4 percent more for groceries next \nyear at this point.\n  While some people might think that food magically appears on their \ntables or in their grocery stores, in Minnesota we know food is \nproduced every day by our farmers. Farmers stand behind each General \nMills box of Cheerios or every Jennie-O turkey on the dinner table. \nThat is why when I travel our State I am always reminded of the \ncritical role farming plays in our State's economy and in our country's \neconomy. It has, in fact, been one of the brightest spots. Minnesotans \nin rural communities and larger cities all benefit from a strong farm \neconomy that provides jobs at farms, mills, processing plants, and \nequipment manufacturers.\n  While Congress can't do anything about the lack of rain, we shouldn't \nmake this disaster worse by delaying the passage of the farm bill, \nwhich gives farmers and ranchers the assistance they need to help \nweather this disaster and the certainty they need to make plans for \nnext year and the year after and the year after that. The fact that the \n2008 farm bill was a 5-year time period was key to the stability in the \nrural areas. It was key so farmers could plan ahead. It made a \ndifference during the downturn. We need to do that same thing again.\n  I think it is a mistake for the House leadership to delay further \naction on the farm bill. These bills are never easy, but in the Senate \nwe were able to work through 70 amendments before passing the \nbipartisan farm bill with a strong 64-to-35 vote. Maybe they should do \nthe same.\n  As part of our responsibility to do more with fewer resources, this \nbill includes over $23 billion in cuts over the 2008 farm bill. We \neliminated direct payments, further focused farm payments on our family \nfarmers, and worked to eliminate fraud and waste through the farm bill \nto ensure these programs are efficient and targeted.\n  President Eisenhower was famously quoted as saying this:\n\n       Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and \n     you're a thousand miles from the corn field.\n\n  I fear that some in Washington have taken that same position and are \ncontent with kicking the can down the road and leaving rural America in \nthe lurch. Well, those of us in the Senate\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\nwho supported this bill--Democrats and Republicans--were not content \nwith putting our heads in the sand. We weren't content with just \nletting the crops burn out in the fields. We wanted to get something \ndone.\n  There are those in the House, such as Representative Collin Peterson \nof Minnesota, who are trying valiantly to get this farm bill through \nthe House. We must let them do this.\n  The Senate passed the 5-year farm bill because it is important. It is \nimportant because it strengthens the crop insurance program, it funds \nlivestock disaster programs for this year, and continues the program \nthrough the end of the farm bill. It ensures that the programs farmers \nuse to get help through tough times, such as the emergency financing \ncredit program or disaster grazing authorities, will be continued with \nunbroken service.\n  The farm bill also includes two of my amendments that will help \nfarmers get through these tough times. The first amendment reduces the \ncost of accessing crop insurance by 10 percent for beginning farmers. \nThis is critical because beginning farmers are less able to afford crop \ninsurance protection and are under greater financial stress because of \nthe drought.\n  The second amendment eliminates the penalty for beginning farmers \nthat graze livestock on CRP land. This will help beginning ranchers \nstruggling with high feed prices and will also benefit all livestock \nproducers by freeing up the corn to be fed to other animals.\n  Secretary Vilsack is working at the USDA to help producers with this \ndrought. Under his leadership, the USDA has streamlined the disaster \ndeclaration process, reducing the time it takes to start getting help \nfor impacted counties by 40 percent. They reduced the interest rate for \nemergency loans, as well as reduced the penalty for producers grazing \nlivestock on conservation reserve program acres from 25 down to 10 \npercent.\n  While these are important steps, they in no way replace the help \nfarmers in this country will get from this farm bill. We all know it is \nnot just a farm bill, it is a food bill. Only 14 percent of this that \nwe look at is farm programs. The rest are conservation programs. The \nrest are important school lunch programs. This is a farm bill for the \ncountry not just the rural areas. But we can see--anyone who drives \nthrough Wisconsin, anyone who drives through Indiana or Missouri or \nIowa can see--firsthand why we need this safety net for our farmers, \nwhy we need this safety net for our country.\n\n  We plead with the House to get this done, to follow the leadership of \nCollin Peterson and those of us in the Senate who, on a bipartisan \nbasis, got this farm bill done. They need to take it to the floor.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Madam President, as I mentioned, there is a second bill that has also \nbeen hung up, a bipartisan bill that received significant support in \nthe Senate--in fact, it got the support of every single woman Senator \nin this body, Democrat and Republican--and that is the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  Here in the Senate we passed that reauthorization bill in April on a \nbipartisan 68-to-31 vote. Getting to that point was a tough road. It \nwas not always clear we were going to pass the bill. Just like the two \nreauthorizations from 2000 and 2006, our bill strengthens current law \nand provides solutions to problems we have learned more about since the \nViolence Against Women Act was first passed in 1994. Ever since then, \nthis bill has been able to get through both Houses on a bipartisan \nbasis without significant controversy.\n  We do not want to go back in time. We do not want to go back to a \ntime when we treated women who were victims of domestic violence like \nthey were not really victims, like it was something they should just \nexpect to happen. We do not want to turn back on the great strides we \nhave made.\n  One of the improvements in this current bill focuses on a \nparticularly underserved community: women living in tribal areas. We \nhave a number of reservations in Minnesota, and it is a heartbreaking \nreality that Native American women experience rates of domestic \nviolence and sexual assault that are much higher than the national \naverage.\n  Our committee, the Judiciary Committee on which I serve, worked \nclosely with the Indian Affairs Committee to come up with some \ncommonsense solutions to the horrific levels of domestic violence and \nsexual assault in tribal areas.\n  One of the problems on tribal lands is that currently tribal courts \ndo not have jurisdiction over non-Indian defendants who abuse their \nIndian spouses on Indian lands, even though more than 50 percent of \nNative women are married to non-Indians.\n  The bipartisan Senate bill addresses this problem by allowing tribal \ncourts to prosecute non-Indians in a narrow set of cases that meet \nthree specific criteria: the crime must have occurred in Indian \nCountry; the crime must be a domestic violence offence, and the non-\nIndian defendant must live or work in Indian Country.\n  That is the way we get these cases prosecuted. I do not think we \nbelieve the Federal courts are going to come in and handle all these \ndomestic violence cases. This is the pragmatic solution that protects \nthese Native American women.\n  As we were considering the Violence Against Women Act on the Senate \nfloor, many of us had to work very hard to get the message out there \nthat VAWA was and always has been a bipartisan bill--one that law \nenforcement and State and local governments strongly support.\n  Throughout this entire process, under the leadership of Senator Leahy \nand Republican Senator Crapo, who did this bill together from the \nbeginning, I have found it very helpful that whenever I needed to tell \npeople why we needed to pass a reauthorization bill, I could point to \nthe great work that my State is doing to combat domestic violence.\n  There is the legacy of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, who were there at \nthe beginning ushering this bill through in 1994.\n  Minnesota is the home to many nationally recognized programs.\n  The Hennepin County Domestic Abuse Service Center that I was honored \nto be in charge of during my 8 years as county attorney in Hennepin \nCounty is a nationally recognized center. We opened one of the first \nshelters in the country in 1974, and the city of Duluth was the first \ncity to require its police officers to make arrests in domestic \nviolence cases.\n  I have learned about a unique domestic violence court that Stearns \nCounty--that is the area around St. Cloud--has implemented using money \nfrom VAWA grants. The partnership, which involves trained people from \nall levels of the criminal justice system, has allowed 58 percent of \nthe victim participants to separate from their abusers.\n  Washington County relies on cutting-edge research to provide \ndirection for officers to take appropriate action when responding to \ndomestic violence calls. It is the only program of its kind in the \nentire country.\n  These are the kinds of innovative initiatives from law enforcement \nthat are especially critical to combating violence and are directly a \nresult of the Domestic Violence Against Women Act that we have worked \nso hard to pass in past years in this Congress.\n  I want to stress just how crucial it is that we get this bill signed \ninto law. We have made a lot of progress over the years, and we have \nbeen able to work together across the aisle to build on VAWA's \nsuccesses. But we should not just send any bill to the President. As \nyou know, the House has passed its own reauthorization of VAWA, which, \nunfortunately, does not include many of the improvements the Senate \nbill includes, including the one I mentioned on tribal courts. It also \nrolls back some of the important improvements that have been made to \nVAWA in the past.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to iron out these differences as we move \nforward, but I strongly believe the improvements that were included in \nthe Senate bill should remain a part of the bill that gets sent to the \nPresident. I hope our colleagues in the House will follow suit with the \nSenate on this domestic violence bill, pass a bipartisan bill, get this \ndone, and get it done soon. It simply is not that hard. Just look into \nthe eyes of a domestic violence victim, look into the eyes of the \nchildren, and you know it is not that hard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I just want to make a very brief comment\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\nprimarily for the benefit of our Republican colleagues who have been \ninquiring about whether we would have, and when we would have, a vote \nto invoke cloture to proceed to the cybersecurity legislation.\n  I am hopeful we can do that very soon. From my perspective, it would \nbe wise for us to move forward, to go to the bill, and see if we can \nwork things out. There have been discussions between various groups who \nare interested in the subject. They are now all talking to each other, \nwhich is a very good sign because it is amazing how, when Senators get \ntogether and talk to each other, sometimes we can actually accomplish \nthings in a bipartisan way.\n  So my hope is that we can do that. If it turns out it does not work \nout, we can always vote no at the end of the day. But I believe we \nshould go forward, that we should get on the bill, and, therefore, I \nintend to support cloture on the motion to proceed to the cybersecurity \nlegislation.\n  I thank my colleagues for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I appreciate the courtesy of my \ncolleague from Maryland, and I promise I am going to be just no more \nthan 10 minutes.\n\n\n                      Tax Hikes and Small Business\n\n  Two years ago, Members of both parties in this Chamber recognized \nthat America's economic recovery was fragile, too fragile to absorb a \ntax increase. Since then, obviously, my colleagues across the aisle \nhave changed their minds and experienced a change of heart.\n  Yesterday the Senate voted to raise taxes. I have been amused by some \nof the headlines I have read that say the Senate voted to cut taxes, \nwhich is false. The Senate did not vote to cut taxes; the Senate voted \nto maintain the tax rates that have been in existence for 12 years for \na certain class of taxpayers, while raising taxes on everyone else.\n  I cannot explain the logic behind this vote. I can only assume it is \nsome election-year calculus designed to galvanize the political base of \nour friends across the aisle. It most definitely is not good economics, \nand it is not good for job creation.\n  For 3 years, it is no secret America has been living through the \nweakest economic recovery since the Great Depression. We know from \nhistory, from economics, and from common sense that the last thing you \nwant to do amid persistently slow economic growth is to dramatically \nraise taxes on income and investment. If you want more economic \nactivity, if you want growth, then you do not burden it further. You \nrelieve those burdens, which allows it to flourish and grow, which \ncreates prosperity and jobs. Yet our friends across the aisle just \nvoted to raise taxes on nearly 1 million American businesses.\n  Many American businesses do not operate as a corporation. They \noperate as a sole proprietorship, a partnership--in other words, a mom-\nand-pop operation--or even as a subchapter S or some other legal \nentity, which causes business income to be paid on individual tax \nreturns not on a separate corporate tax return.\n  The bottom line is, when we raise taxes on people in the top tax \nbrackets, we inevitably are going to capture, in this instance, 1 \nmillion different individuals paying business income on an individual \ntax return, which is bad for the economy, bad for jobs.\n  We should make no mistake about it: Given our anemic growth rates, \ngiven the ongoing debt crisis in Europe, and given the economic \nslowdown in China and other emerging market countries, raising taxes on \nso many job creators could easily tip the U.S. economy back into \nrecession. If we take yesterday's vote to increase taxes on so many \nsmall businesses together with the unwillingness to deal with the \nsingle largest tax increase in American history--which will occur on \nDecember 31, 2012, and is something that has been called taxmageddon, \nwhen virtually all the tax provisions in the code will expire, the ones \npassed 12 years ago--if we combine that huge tax increase with the \nsequestration, $1.2 trillion, which comes disproportionately out of \ndefense spending, without exception the economists I have talked to say \nwe will be in a recession.\n  Why is it that our colleagues across the aisle are willing to risk \nputting America back into recession just to raise taxes? I cannot \nunderstand that, unless they have taken some kind of poll, done some \nsort of focus group that has laid out some strategy which is not \nreadily apparent to most people.\n  So the idea that this tax increase would solve our fiscal problem is \nlaughable. As my good friend, the Republican leader, said yesterday, \nthe additional revenue generated by the taxes that our Democratic \nfriends voted for yesterday ``[wouldn't] even fund the government for a \nweek.'' A week--and that is before we consider the harmful impact on \nthe economy and jobs.\n  Whenever I talk to business owners back home in Texas, they express \nutter bewilderment as to why Members of Congress would want to raise \ntaxes during the current economic environment. Don't our friends across \nthe aisle realize how many small businesses are struggling to stay \nafloat? Don't they realize that our Byzantine Tax Code and misguided \nregulations are already strangling job creation? Don't they realize our \nnational unemployment rate has been stuck at more than 8 percent for 41 \nconsecutive months?\n  No one here wants to see another recession, but apparently some are \nwilling to risk a recession by putting ideology ahead of sound economic \npolicy. After last night's vote, I thought of all the Texas \nentrepreneurs--more than 400 of them--who have contacted my office, \nsending their personal, inspiring American success stories. These \nstories remind us that the American dream is still alive, and it is \ninextricably intertwined with our free enterprise system. It is not a \ngift from government. It is what people earn as a result of hard work \nand the opportunities given to them in this great country.\n  These stories remind us the American dream is not dependent upon \ngovernment assistance. It is not about taxing certain people to pay for \nideologically driven government projects like Solyndra. It is about \noffering all Americans the opportunity to earn their success and \nachieve their dreams.\n  My office has received literally hundreds of entrepreneurial success \nstories from Texas, stories such as that of Gary Murray, a Vietnam \nveteran who came home from the war after three tours as a marine in \nVietnam, who spent two decades working at IBM and then launched his own \nfencing club--a fencing club. For more than a quarter century, Gary's \nRound Rock Fencing Club has been training young Texans and producing \nworld-class talent, including two Olympians, one world champion, and \neight national champions. It is a remarkable story about someone \ndeciding this is what they wanted to do, this is where their passion \nlies, making the most of it, and creating opportunities for other \npeople.\n  Gary started the Round Rock Fencing Club with his own money, without \nany financial support from the government. What he achieved, he \nachieved on his own. His story is a testament to hard work and human \ncreativity. As Gary puts it: ``The only support I ever got was from my \nwife and family.''\n  There are many other business owners like Gary Murray all across \nTexas and all across this great country.\n  Before my colleagues advocate higher taxes on these businesses, \nperhaps they should spend some time talking to the job creators and \nsmall business people and the entrepreneurs about the myriad challenges \nand obstacles government places in their way because of high taxes and \noverregulation. I suspect my colleagues might learn something.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I have taken the floor before to talk \nabout the health care reform bill, to comment on the Supreme Court \ndecision, which I believe history will show was clearly the right \ndecision. It was the right decision on the law giving the Congress the \npower to legislate in an area where there is a national need, as the \nlegislature did in the 1930s with Social Security and in the 1960s with \nMedicare.\n  The health reform proposals that were adopted by Congress are within \nthe purview of the legislative branch of government. The Supreme Court \nupheld that right in that decision. I also said it was the right \ndecision because it allows us to move forward on\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\na path toward universal coverage, where all Americans are guaranteed \naccess to affordable health care. America will now join all of the \nother industrial nations of the world to say health care is a right, \nnot a privilege.\n  The legislation that was passed, the health reform bill, has already \nhelped American families. Let me talk about an area--I could talk about \nmany--about what it has done in protecting our consumers against the \npractices, the arbitrary practices of health insurance companies. We \nalready are seeing that it is in effect where families are being able \nto take advantage of the fact there are no longer any lifetime caps on \nhealth insurance policies. By 2014, we will eliminate annual caps on \nbenefits on health insurance plans. We already have seen for our \nchildren the elimination of preexisting conditions, so our children can \nget policies without having restrictions on what is covered and what is \nnot covered. By 2014 we will see that the preexisting conditions for \neveryone will no longer be an obstacle to full insurance coverage. That \nis particularly important for women, where we know at times they have \nbeen held to a preexisting condition because of a pregnancy or being \nthe victim of domestic violence.\n  We have seen discrimination in premiums against women. That no longer \nwill be the case. I could talk about many Marylanders who are happy \ntoday because they can stay on their parents' insurance policies--the \nfact that they are over the age of 21. They can now stay on that policy \nuntil age 26.\n  I want to talk about one other aspect of this law that may not be \nquite as familiar to our constituents. This provision will take effect \non August 1, but we already are seeing the benefits. What I am talking \nabout is the 80-20 rule, where health insurance companies must give \nvalue for the premium dollar to the beneficiary. At least 80 percent of \nthe dollars we pay for premiums must go for benefits.\n  Let me share with you a letter I received from one of my \nconstituents. She wrote:\n\n       I recently had a pleasant surprise. . . . two checks from \n     my health care [insurer] that were rebates on premiums paid. \n     I am someone who has to buy individual health coverage and \n     have been doing so for the last 8 years. The premiums are \n     high and the deductible is high--so I am essentially paying a \n     high price for catastrophic coverage while still paying for \n     individual doctor visits, prescriptions, etc. It is \n     frustrating, but the choices are limited and expensive for \n     individual coverage, and you don't really know how good your \n     coverage is because you don't use it unless you have a major \n     medical event. My premiums go up every year despite the fact \n     that I don't file claims. This month I received a check in \n     the amount of $139 from my current [insurer] and over $300 \n     from a previous [insurer]. Both checks were rebates as a \n     result of the new health care act.\n       I did not realize it, but the act requires insurance \n     companies to use 80% of the premiums they collect on health \n     care costs. . . . and neither of them hit that percentage and \n     were thus required to provide a refund. Wonderful! The bill \n     is so complicated that I do not understand a great deal of \n     it--but am very pleased with this aspect which seems to go a \n     long way in helping keep health care costs reasonable and \n     prevent consumers from being gouged . . . So thanks to the \n     Senator and all who helped with this health care act.\n\n  I bring this to my colleagues' attention, because there are going to \nbe millions of American who are going to be getting rebate checks, and \nsome are going to start scratching their heads, wondering where it is \ncoming from. They are going to be saying: Gee, I guess I made a mistake \nin the premiums I paid. They are returning them. They are getting those \nchecks because of the passage of the health reform bill, and the \nprovision in the health reform bill that requires insurance companies \nto give value for the premium dollars we pay.\n  That protection is now the law of the land. Thanks to the acts of \nCongress and President Obama, and the Supreme Court upholding the law, \nthose rebates are going to be received. The number of people in the \ncountry is 12.8 million Americans who are going to get rebate checks \nworth about $1.1 billion. Average rebate: $151. That is real money for \npeople who are struggling with their health care needs.\n  I am proud that in the State of Maryland, there is going to be $27 \nmillion made available to 141,000 Marylanders, with an average rebate \nof $340 for those who get rebates in my State. Let me break this down a \nlittle bit further. In the individual market, like the person I \nreceived the letter from, the rebates for the people in Maryland will \nactually average a higher amount. They will average $496. I think that \nspeaks to the fact that insurance companies have hedged their bets in \nthe individual market. They tell us that, you know, we have got to \ncharge a lot more because we do not know what we are getting, when in \nreality they are making a lot more money in the individual market.\n  So for the people of Maryland, 38,000 of them are going to get, on \naverage, close to $500 in rebates thanks to the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act, thanks to the passage of health reform, and thanks \nto the Supreme Court upholding our right to do it.\n  The same thing is true in the small group markets where we find that \nthere will be 3.3 million Americans getting rebate checks who are in \nthe small group markets. These are the markets, of course, in which \nagain the options were not as great, more difficult, because of \ninsurance carriers not being as anxious to insure people in small group \nmarkets as they are in the larger markets.\n  The average rebate per family will be $174. In Maryland that number \nagain is higher, $310 for the 13,000 people in Maryland. It also \napplies to those in the large group markets. These are the large plans. \nThey also are going to see rebates because the insurance carriers \ncharged excessive fees. And they are going to get premium dollar \nrebates. Some 5.3 million Americans in these large plans will see \nrebates that average $135. In my State of Maryland, it will be 89,000 \npeople, with rebates averaging $268 a family. These are 1-year numbers. \nThese continue every year. So let me tell the people of Maryland and \nthe people of this country what you can expect. You might get a check \nthat will be delivered to you in the mail. It will be a rebate check. \nThat is as a result of the passage of the health reform bill. You might \nalso see a deposit into the account that automatically pays for your \nhealth premiums, because the insurance carrier can make a direct \ndeposit into the accounts which are paying for these premiums.\n\n  It is possible you might find a reduction in future premiums. They \ncan use it to reduce your future premiums, but they have to let you \nknow that, so you realize you are getting the rebate, but it is being \napplied against future premiums. Or if the employer is paying the \npremiums, the rebates will go to the employer, but the employer must \nuse it to benefit your plan. They cannot use it for themselves. It is \nused to help again the beneficiary. You will get notice of that.\n  My purpose again is to make it clear that you would not have gotten \nthese rebates but for the protections that are in the Affordable Care \nAct. I know my colleague from Vermont and I have been on the floor many \ntimes pointing out that all Americans, not just those who do not have \ninsurance today, not just those who might have been discriminated \nagainst because of preexisting conditions, not only that 24-year-old \nwho is now on her parent's policy, but all Americans have benefited \nfrom the Affordable Care Act, the protections that are in it.\n  Now millions who thought they were being treated unfairly by their \ninsurance companies are going to be able to get rebates because of \nexcessive premiums. The rule works in combination with another \nprovision of the law that requires rate review to ensure premium \nincreases are reasonable. In other words, we have put into the law \nprotections against unreasonable increases in your premiums. Insurance \ncompanies are now required to justify any premium increases of 10 \npercent or higher. Most States now have the authority to determine \nwhether these increases are excessive, while HHS reviews rates in \nStates that do not operate under effective rate review programs.\n  That is how federalism should work. States have an opportunity to \nact. If they do not have adequate review, we have national backup and \nprotection to make sure the rate reviews are being handled in the \nappropriate way. So as our constituents start to get the benefits--\nanother benefit of the health reform bill, and there are many more that \nare starting to take effect, and we will hear about some more of those \nnext week, on August 1--I wanted my constituents of Maryland and my\n\n[[Page S5447]]\n\nfriends around the Nation to know we have provided that you get value \nfor the premium dollar you pay for your health insurance.\n  We back that up with enforcement, so if there are excessive premiums \nbeing charged, the insurance carriers must rebate those premiums to \nyou. Millions of Americans will get the benefit, starting now. We are \npleased that this type of protection is in the Affordable Care Act.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative proceeded to call the roll.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to update \nfolks about what is happening as it relates to the very important \neffort to pass a 5-year farm bill for our country--for our ranchers, \nfor our farmers, for those who care deeply about nutrition and \nconservation policy for the country.\n  We have somewhere between 16 and 20 million people who work in this \ncountry because of agriculture--the farm bill and food policy--and I am \nvery proud of all the work we did together to pass a bipartisan farm \nbill. In doing that, we sent a very strong message on a number of \nfronts that we were committed to economic certainty for our growers. We \nsaid we understand the need to have long-term policies in place, and we \nalso sent a message about disaster assistance.\n  I have spoken on the floor before, as my colleagues have, about the \nvery serious situation happening all across our country as it relates \nto livestock and the broad question now of drought in every region of \nthe country. We also have had areas, in addition to drought in Michigan \nand other places, where food growers have been hit with an early \nwarming and then a freeze again. So we have had multiple reasons to \ncare about short-term disaster assistance, and I am very proud the bill \nwe passed includes a very good livestock disaster assistance program \navailable for this year which will be very helpful for our livestock \nproducers.\n  We also added provisions for fruit growers that will help those who \ndon't have access to any crop insurance. That will not only include \nthis year, but we looked to the future by putting in new options on \ncrop insurance, new tools for the risk management agency to develop \nwith growers, with commodity groups across the country crop insurance \nfor the future. So as we see these kinds of weather disasters, they \nwill have more certainty because there will be better coverage and \nbroader kinds of coverage for crop insurance for all commodities, which \nwe don't have today.\n  We definitely need to pass a farm bill. We need the House to pass a \nfarm bill both for long-term policy but also for disaster assistance \nright now, and we know this is an opportunity to achieve deficit \nreduction. The only bipartisan effort we have had on deficit reduction \non the Senate floor--and I would argue probably bipartisanship on the \nHouse floor as well--has been through the farm bill, with $23 billion \nin deficit reduction, with major reforms, changes in policy, and \neliminating four different subsidies that are there when growers don't \nneed them or for things they don't plant anymore and replacing that \nwith a risk-based, market-based system for when farmers truly do need \nus, as they do now.\n  So there is a whole range of things we have done--reforms and \nstrengthening conservation efforts in our country, focusing on the \nright policies around nutrition, around local food systems and so on--\nand all that is in jeopardy at the moment because the House, rather \nthan bringing to the floor the bill passed out of the House committee, \nwhich, even though it is different and I would argue doesn't have all \nthe reforms we have and takes a little different approach on \ncommodities and so on, it is a bill we can work with to come to final \nagreement on between the House and the Senate. But instead of bringing \nthat to the floor, getting it done, we are now hearing discussions \nabout just passing some kind of a disaster assistance program.\n  Certainly, we need to do that. We have already passed it and we can \nstrengthen it as we move forward to a conference committee and I would \nsupport doing that as well. But instead of having a full 5-year farm \nbill policy, they are talking about kicking the can down the road one \nmore time. That seems to be a very popular strategy around here. It is \nnot one the public wants us to use. They want to extend the farm bill \nfor another year, with no deficit reduction, no reform, no certainty \nfor farmers, and with policies extended another year that don't work \nfor a lot of industries and then just do some disaster assistance. I \nthink that would be a disaster.\n  I know we have colleagues on both sides of the aisle--and I am \ngrateful for the leadership of the chairman and ranking member in the \nHouse for their advocacy and leadership--who want to get this done, but \nwe need to know the House leadership will allow that to happen so we \ncan get real reform, deficit reduction, and the kinds of policies we \nneed in place that will solve problems and provide the safety net all \nour farmers need. If we end up in a situation with just an extension, \nwhat happens? As our distinguished Presiding Officer knows, it would \nkeep in place for another year a dairy policy that doesn't work.\n  I remember, in 2009, sitting around the table and talking about what \nwas happening to dairy farmers--folks going out of business, losing \ntheir farms because of policies that didn't work. Now the House is \ntalking about extending those policies for another year rather than \nadopting the changes and the reforms we have put in place that would \nhelp dairy farmers all across the country. They are talking about an \nextension that would eliminate about half the support for fruit and \nvegetable growers that we put in place. In the last farm bill, I was \nproud to offer that, and we strengthened that in this farm bill. It is \none of the largest areas of commodities, groups of commodities, in the \ncountry. So that would not be continued.\n  There are a number of things that, frankly, would not be continued or \navailable, and there are a number of things that would continue that \nare bad policy. So if we have a 1-year extension, we are continuing \nsomething we rejected and that everybody on both sides of the aisle in \nthe House and Senate said they didn't want to do, which is direct \npayments going to farmers, government payments, regardless of whether \nthe prices are high or low, in good times or bad times, and continuing \neven on things that aren't grown anymore. We all said that makes no \nsense.\n  We all said, instead, that we wanted to move to a risk-based system \nand have a strong safety net there when farmers and ranchers need us, \nto strengthen crop insurance and make sure farmers have skin in the \ngame; that they are sharing in the cost on crop insurance.\n  But none of that happens with a simple 1-year extension. We continue \nthings we have all said are not good policy, that cost taxpayers money, \nand that we shouldn't be spending our money on at a time of huge \ndeficits; that we should not have those kinds of subsidies in place. We \neliminated four of those, with $15 billion in savings alone in the \ncommodity title. All that would go away under what the House is talking \nabout. We would be continuing things people have said were bad policy. \nEveryone talks about reforms and changes, but this would continue the \nold ways.\n\n  We eliminated about 100 different programs, duplication, and things \nthat do not work anymore--redundancy, whatever it is. About 100 \ndifferent programs we eliminated in what we passed. They would all \ncontinue--every single one of them--for another year if we just do a 1-\nyear extension.\n  Let me just say in conclusion that I encourage House colleagues to \njoin with us. We can have differences in what our commodity title looks \nlike, and I respect those differences. We can work those out if we have \nthe opportunity to negotiate in good faith and get things done. We will \ndo that. We can have differences in what should happen in the nutrition \ntitle, but we should not be saying to farmers and growers that we are \ngoing to walk away from them and put in place another kick-the-can-\ndown-the-road\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\nstrategy that keeps bad policy or no policy going, no deficit \nreduction, and puts us in a situation where, frankly, 1 year from now \nit is tougher and it is a bigger mess than ever, with our growers \ntrying to go to the bank, trying to figure out what they are going to \ndo when planting season comes and making decisions, all the while \nlooking at us and asking: What happened here? Why did you do this?\n  We did our job in the Senate on a strong bipartisan basis. It was a \nlot of hard work. We spent a lot of time here. We need to complete the \njob. If our House colleagues will come together with us; if the \nSpeaker, the leadership in the House, will decide to give us a vehicle \nwith which to do that, I am very confident we can get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, I \nknow the Senate majority leader is in discussions with the Republican \nleader, and I know the hope is we can soon have the vote on a motion to \nproceed to S. 3414. But as yet I have not been informed there has been \nthe necessary meeting of minds. I hope it will be soon, and I hope \neveryone will support it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hoeven pertaining to the introduction of S. 3445 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the call \nof the quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, there has been a lot of talk about one \nof the major issues we as a nation are going to have to deal with, and \ncertainly the Presidential candidates will be talking about it during \nthe next few months, and that is that we have a $16 trillion national \ndebt and we have a $1 trillion deficit. I think all Americans \nunderstand this is a very important issue, and it is something we as a \nnation are going to have to grapple with.\n  How we deal with the deficit and the national debt is certainly one \nof the most important and interesting issues we are going to have to \naddress.\n  What I find interesting is that when we talk about the deficit and \nthe national debt, there seems to be, among some of my colleagues, \ncollective amnesia. It is as if this debt and deficit popped up \nyesterday and we have no understanding of how we got to where we are \ntoday.\n  I would like to take a moment to remind some of my friends that back \nin January of 2001--not so many years ago--when President Bill Clinton \nleft office, this country was not running a deficit, it was running a \nvery significant surplus of some $236 billion. That is a very \nsignificant surplus. As a matter of fact, in 2001 the Congressional \nBudget Office projected that we would have Federal budget surpluses \ntotaling $5.6 trillion from 2002 to 2011. In other words, when Clinton \nleft office there was a very significant surplus, and the projection \nwas that surplus was going to go up and up. What happened? Well, that \nis a question we need a little bit of time to discuss.\n  I find it interesting that there is no context for deficit reduction. \nLet me suggest that, in fact, some of the people who come down to this \nfloor and talk the loudest about the deficit and the national debt are \nprecisely those same people who caused the national debt of $16 \ntrillion and a deficit of over $1 trillion.\n  How did we get to where we are today from the time when Clinton left \noffice and we had a significant surplus? No. 1, many of our deficit \nhawks who are coming down to the Senate floor telling us about all the \nprograms we have to cut for the middle class, working families, our \nchildren, and the elderly, are real deficit hawks. My goodness. When it \ncame to the war in Iraq, many of us voted against it since it didn't \nmake a whole lot of sense. We also noted that our deficit hawk friends \nwent to war--I believe for the first time in the history of America--\nand forgot they would have to pay for that war. I think some of us \nmight hold a little bit of doubt in some of the comments of our friends \nabout their real sincerity and concern about deficit reduction when \nthey went to a war in Iraq which will end up--after we take care of the \nlast veteran wounded in that war 80 years from now or whenever--costing \nprobably $3 trillion.\n  Well, if you spend $3 trillion to go to war, forget to pay for it, \nand then come to the Senate floor and tell us how concerned you are \nabout the deficit and the national debt, some of us are saying: Well, \nmaybe that is not the case. Where were their concerns about the deficit \nwhen they went to war when we had a deficit hawk President named George \nW. Bush? So that is one of the major reasons we are running a $1 \ntrillion deficit right now.\n  The second reason is--and you don't have to have a Ph.D. in economics \nto understand it--that if in the middle of a war they decide to give \nhuge tax breaks, including $1 trillion over a 10-year period to the top \n2 percent, the billionaires and millionaires, so $1 trillion is not \ncoming into the Federal Government, that adds to the deficit. I ask my \nRepublican friends where was their concern about the deficit and the \nnational debt when they gave $1 trillion in tax breaks to millionaires \nand billionaires?\n  The third point I wish to make is that we are in the middle of a \nhorrendous recession. Unemployment is sky high and underemployment is \nsky high. People have lost homes and their life savings. People are \nhurting. This recession was caused by the efforts--and I must confess, \nnot just a Republican effort but also a Democratic effort--and the \nbipartisan desire to deregulate Wall Street because people believed \nthat if we deregulate Wall Street and allow insurance companies to \nmerge with commercial banks and investor banks and we do away with \nGlass-Steagall, my goodness, those folks on Wall Street--honest people \nwith great integrity--would just create wealth for all Americans. That \nis what Alan Greenspan, Robert Rubin, and all these guys were telling \nus. I was a member of the Financial Services Committee in the House and \nnever believed that for one moment. It never made an iota of sense to \nme. Anyway, these guys fought for deregulation. We had deregulation, \nand as a result of the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior on \nWall Street, we were plunged into the terrible recession we are in now.\n  One of the points that are very rarely made on the Senate floor is \nthat today, at 15.2 percent as a percentage of GDP, revenue is the \nlowest in more than 60 years. So it is easy for people to come to the \nSenate floor and say we have to cut, cut, cut. They forget to tell us \nthat as a result of the Wall Street-caused recession, at 15.2 percent, \nrevenue is the lowest as a percentage of GDP in more than 60 years. \nThat is an issue we have to deal with.\n  You know what, we don't increase our revenue when we give more tax \nbreaks to billionaires. We don't increase our revenue when we say that \nat a time when we have tripled military spending since 1997, maybe we \nneed even more for the military. That is not a way to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  Now, what do my Republican friends and some Democrats say? Well, they \ncome to the Senate floor and suddenly--after going to war without \npaying for it, after giving huge tax breaks to the rich, after \nderegulating Wall Street--realize we have a deficit problem, and they \nare very concerned about this deficit problem. They come to the Senate \nfloor and say: The only way we can go forward is to cut Social \nSecurity. Social Security is funded independently. It hasn't added one \nnickel to the deficit, but we are going to cut Social Security anyway. \nWe are going to cut Medicare, we are going to cut Medicaid, we are \ngoing to cut Pell grants, we are going to cut education,\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\nand we are going to cut environmental protection. That is deficit \nreduction.\n  Are we going to ask millionaires and billionaires, who are doing \nphenomenally well, whose effective tax rate is the lowest in decades, \nto pay one nickel more in taxes? No, we can't do that, but we can cut \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, and every program that \nthe children, seniors, and working families of this country depend \nupon.\n  Now, to add insult to injury in terms of this movement supported by \nbig-money interests that have so much influence over what goes on here \nin Congress, it is important to look at the playing field of the \nAmerican economy today to understand what is going on. Are the people \non top really hurting and suffering? Are large corporations today \nreally struggling under onerous corporate taxes? The answer is, \nobviously not.\n  We don't talk about it enough, and too few people even mention it, \nbut I do, and I will continue. It is important today to understand that \nthe United States has the most unequal distribution of wealth and \nincome since the 1920s and the most unequal distribution of wealth and \nincome of any major country on Earth. Why is that important? It is \nimportant to know that. Before we cut Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, education, and the ability of working-class kids to go to \ncollege, we have to know the condition of how people are doing today. \nThe middle class today is shrinking and poverty is increasing. When we \ncut food stamps and Medicaid, we are going to hurt a whole lot of \npeople, and in some cases very tragically.\n  Just last week a member of my staff went to southwest Virginia, and \nshe spent the day at a program in which thousands of people in that \narea were lining up to get dental and health care because they didn't \nhave any health insurance. There are 45,000 Americans who will die this \nyear because they don't have health insurance and can't get to a doctor \nin time. There are people who say: Let's cut Medicaid. There are people \nall over this country who can't find a dentist. There are children who \nare suffering from dental decay. Let's cut Medicaid. Well, I don't \nthink so.\n  If we look at the country, the middle class is shrinking, people are \nhurting, but people on top are doing phenomenally well. Very few people \ntalk about it. I am going to talk about it. In the last study we have \nseen in terms of income distribution in this country--and that is what \nhappened between 2009 between and 2010--93 percent of all new income \ncreated over that year went to the top 1 percent. I will say it again. \nNinety-three percent of all new income in that year went to the top 1 \npercent. The bottom 99 percent had the privilege of sharing the \nremaining 7 percent. Yet, when we ask the people on top to maybe pay a \nlittle bit more in taxes, oh my goodness, there are lobbyists all over \nCapitol Hill saying: We can't afford to. We are down to our last $50 \nbillion. We just can't afford another nickel in taxes. We need that \nmoney now. Thanks to Citizens United, we can pump that money into \npolitical campaigns.\n  One family who is worth $50 billion is going to put $400 million into \nthe campaign. Another guy who is worth $20 billion can't pay more in \ntaxes, but he does have hundreds of millions to pour into political \ncampaigns.\n  In terms of distribution of wealth, which is a different category of \ncosts than distribution of income, we have an incredible situation. I \nhope people understand what is going on in this country, where one \nfamily--one family, the Walton family, of Wal-Mart--now owns more \nwealth at $89 billion than the bottom 40 percent of the American \npeople. One family owns more wealth than the bottom 40 percent. Do we \nknow what some folks want to do here? They want to repeal the entire \nestate tax and give that family a very substantial tax break, because \nowning $89 billion is obviously not enough. They are struggling. We \nhave to give them a tax break while we cut Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid. If that makes any sense to the American people, I would \nbe very surprised, and it does not make sense to the American people.\n\n  According to a February 2011 Washington Post poll, while more than 70 \npercent of Americans oppose cutting Social Security and Medicare, 81 \npercent supported a surtax on millionaires to reduce the deficit. My \nguess is if we go to New Hampshire, Maine, or any other State in \nAmerica and we say to people, we have a deficit problem and the choice \nis between cutting Social Security or asking millionaires and \nbillionaires to pay more in taxes, there is, in my view, no State in \nAmerica--no State in this country, no matter how red it may be--where \npeople will say: Cut Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, but \ndon't raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires. I don't believe \nthat is true anyplace in America.\n  Today, the top 1 percent owns 40 percent of the wealth of our Nation \nwhile the bottom 60 percent owns less than 2 percent. The top 1 percent \nowns 40 percent; the bottom 60 percent owns less than 2 percent, and \nthere are Members of this Senate coming to the floor and saying we are \ngoing to punish the bottom 60 percent and we are going to give more to \nthe people on top.\n  There was a study that recently came out that talks about the ability \nof billionaires and corporations to use tax havens. What we know--and I \nam a member of the Budget Committee--is that millionaires and \nbillionaires and corporations in this country are avoiding paying about \n$100 billion every single year by using tax havens in the Cayman \nIslands, in Bermuda, Panama, and other countries. Maybe, just maybe, \nbefore we cut Social Security and Medicare, we might want to pass \nlegislation to make those people start paying their fair share in taxes \nand do away with those tax havens.\n  Let me conclude by saying we are in a pivotal moment in American \nhistory. If we as a Nation do not get our act together, in my view, we \nwill move even more rapidly in the direction of an oligarchy, where we \nwill have a few people on the top with incredible wealth controlling \nnot only our economy but also, through Citizens United, the political \nlife of this country. We are seeing that playing out right here on the \nfloor of the Senate, with people who are turning their backs on working \nfamilies and the middle class, and at a time when the wealthiest people \nare doing phenomenally well, fighting for more tax breaks for people \nwho absolutely don't need them.\n  I hope the American people pay rapt attention to this debate, and I \nhope the American people get involved in this debate, because if they \ndo not, mark my words, within 4 months, a handful of people, supported \nby corporate America and the big money interests, are going to bring \ndown to this floor a deficit reduction proposal which will cut Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, and give more tax breaks to the \nwealthiest people in this country. It will have virtually all \nRepublican support. It will have some Democratic support. If we don't \naggressively oppose this approach, that is exactly what will happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will yield to the leader. I thank him, too, for that \nresounding vote, which seems to me not that the debate is over but the \ndebate is going to begin, and an overwhelming majority of the Members \nof the Senate want to adopt cybersecurity legislation.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express \nmy concerns about S.3414, the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. Like many of \nmy colleagues, I voted today to allow the Senate to fully debate and \nconsider amendments to this bill, but I want to make it clear that I \nhave some significant concerns about this legislation and unless \nimprovements are made, I cannot support the legislation in its current \nform.\n  At the outset, let me just say, I do firmly believe that the Congress \nshould take action to address our Nation's vulnerability to cyber \nthreats. A cyber attack on our critical infrastructure, whether it be \nour energy grid, a regional water supply, or our financial markets, \ncould significantly harm our economy, our national security, and our \nway of life. However, the legislation before us today still needs \nsignificant improvement before it can become the law of the land.\n  I have heard from many in Missouri, including many companies \noperating or associated with the types of critical infrastructure that \nwill be subject to the provisions of this legislation. They have raised \nconcerns that, as currently structured, S. 3414 would create redundant \noversight structures and add additional standards. Moreover, the bill \nmay have the effect of creating a new Federal system that these \nentities will have to comply with even though many already work within \nwell-established systems related to developing security standards and \nresponding to cyber threats. I cannot support legislation that creates \nnew and duplicative systems that will impact Missouri businesses in a \nnegative way. While addressing the critical national security aspects \nof improving our Nation's defenses against and ability to respond to \ncyber attacks, cybersecurity legislation must improve the regulatory \nscheme and streamline processes for businesses, not the opposite.\n  Additionally, the carrot-and-stick approach that is created by the \ncurrent bill would limit the sharing of cyber threat information, in a \nprotected fashion, to those private entities which are participating in \nthe voluntary cybersecurity program the bill would create. Those in the \nprogram would have to adopt specific standards and in return would \nreceive relevant real-time cyber threat information. Those not \naccepting those standards and entering the program would not receive \nthe protections of the program and would be limited in the cyber threat \ninformation they receive. Given that sharing such information could \npotentially thwart a cyber attack, it seems absurd that such \ninformation would go unshared because a particular entity was not a \nparticipant in the voluntary system. Such a provision inhibits the very \ntype of information sharing we are trying to promote in order to \nenhance cyber security. In this respect, the carrot-and-stick approach \nsimply does not make sense.\n  I also remain concerned with the scope of responsibility this \nlegislation provides to the Department of Homeland Security. As we have \nfound throughout the history of DHS, it has\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\nrelied heavily upon a contract workforce in order to satisfy its \nmission. At this time, the Department does not have the necessary \nexpertise it will need to guide a multi-agency, multi-sector council in \nevaluating whether or not proposed cybersecurity standards are \nsufficient to address the evolving nature of cyber threats. The \ndecision to place DHS in such a critical role leadership role in \nregards to many aspects of the cybersecurity scheme proposed by this \nlegislation needs to be revisited.\n  I have other concerns with this legislation, but these are my chief \nconcerns. I am pleased that both of the Senate's leaders have indicated \nthat this legislation will be subject to a robust amendment process. I \nlook forward to evaluating the amendments brought forward to this \nlegislation, and I am hopeful that the amendments will improve the bill \nenough so that I can support it. If not, I will oppose the legislation \nand send it back to the committee process, where more work can be \nundertaken to generate an acceptable piece of cybersecurity \nlegislation. Whether now or in the future, the Senate does need to pass \nlegislation. But it must be legislation that is well crafted, balanced, \nand workable for the businesses that will operate under its scheme.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 9\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, shortly I am going to be asking \nunanimous consent to pass the annual Burma sanctions bill that we have \nrenewed about this time every year for the last decade. The bill was \nreported out of the Finance Committee on a voice vote last week along \nwith a package of other unrelated measures as part of S. 3326.\n  Some of my colleagues have some concerns about those other sections. \nThis is unrelated to the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. As I \nindicated, on behalf of my colleagues I have offered--in fact, what I \nhave done in discussions off the floor is offer to find a time to set \nup a vote on S. 3326 on behalf of my colleagues.\n  I believe a vote is the best way to resolve the impasse surrounding \nthis bill. However, our friends on the other side have as yet not \nagreed to that. So in the absence of a vote on the larger bill, I think \nthe best way to proceed is for the Senate to go ahead and pass this \nimportant and noncontroversial foreign policy measure today.\n  This is a very timely issue. These sanctions actually expire today. \nIf we do not act now to extend them, I do not know when the Senate will \nhave a chance to address this important issue. Consideration of this \nyear's Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act comes amidst historic changes \nthat are occurring on the ground in Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi, long a \npolitical prisoner of the country, is now actually a member of the \nParliament.\n  The National League for Democracy, once a completely banned \norganization, now actively participates in political life in Burma. For \nthese reasons and others, the administration, which I support, has \ntaken a number of actions to acknowledge the impressive reforms that \nPresident Thein Sein and his government have instituted thus far. The \nUnited States has responded by sending an ambassador to Burma. That is \nthe first time we have had an ambassador there in two decades.\n  The administration also largely waived the investment ban and \nfinancial restrictions permitting U.S. businesses to begin investing in \nthat country. However, significant challenges in Burma still lie ahead. \nOngoing violence in the Kachin State and the sectarian tensions in the \nArakan State reflect a long-term challenge confronting the country \nrelated to national reconciliation.\n  Hundreds of political prisoners remain behind bars. The constitution \nstill has a number of totally undemocratic elements. And the regime's \nrelationship with North Korea, especially when it comes to arms sales \nwith Pyongyang, remains an issue of grave concern to us.\n  Sanctions with respect to Burma should be renewed in order to provide \nthe administration with the flexibility it needs to encourage continued \nreforms in that country, to encourage the government to tackle these \nremaining tough issues. Failure to renew the sanctions could undermine \nthe administration's diplomatic efforts in Burma, which I support, and \ncould send the wrong signal to the Burmese Government that they have \ndone all they need to do. But where are we?\n  Therefore, the only way I see getting this resolved in time to keep \nthe sanctions from expiring today is for the Senate to go ahead and \npass this, and ask the House to pick it up and pass it as soon as they \nreturn next week. Hopefully, we can resolve this extremely important \nissue that other Members have with other sections of S. 3326, \ncompletely unrelated to the effort to renew Burma sanctions, and pass \nthose other important trade priorities next week.\n  In the meantime, this is a terrible message for us to be sending. \nThis is an extremely big issue. It may sound like a small issue; it is \na big issue in Burma. Secretary Clinton has been there, I have been \nthere, Senator McCain has been there, and Senator Collins. Senator \nFeinstein has been active on this issue. This is no small matter in a \ncountry that we have been hoping would move in the direction of reform, \nand finally is.\n  I know there is always a debate about whether sanctions have made a \ndifference. When I was in Burma in January, in addition to meeting with \nSuu Kyi I was also meeting with government officials. Every single one \nof the government officials brought up the sanctions. It convinced me \nthat they must have made a difference. Now, because of the changes that \nhave occurred, the administration and I, who have been involved in this \nissue for two decades, are in total agreement about the way to handle \nit, which is to renew the sanctions after which the administration will \nwaive a substantial number of them as a further indication that the \nsanctions remain there, although not currently operative, because of \nthe changes that have occurred in the country. So I think it is a big \nmistake to have this important foreign policy matter attached to and \nstymied by, apparently, differences over other unrelated parts of the \nmeasure.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 9; provided further that \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of section 3 of H.R. 3326 be \ninserted in lieu thereof.\n  For the information of Senators, as I indicated, the Burma sanctions \nlanguage expires today. This would avoid that.\n\n  So I finally ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third \ntime, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I very much \nappreciate and admire the efforts of the Senator from Kentucky to keep \nproposing sanctions on Burma. In fact, the Senator will remember that 3 \nor 4 months ago I went out of my way to praise the Senator when he \nstood up for Burma. In fact, he may remember his press office called my \noffice to say thank you. Gosh, Senator Baucus thanked the leader, and I \nmeant it. I very much admire the effort and the way the Senator has \nundertaken to maintain these sanctions.\n  We are all very proud of Aung San Suu Kyi for winning the Nobel \nPrize, in London, when she visited Europe not long ago. I remember \nwatching her on television. She has done so much for her country and \nstood so much for the people of Burma. It is astounding. I have not had \nthe privilege of meeting her personally, but I have watched her from \nafar and with great admiration and not only would thank her but again \nthank the Senator for his efforts.\n  One can say the other matters are unrelated, but one could also say \nthe Burma issue is riding along with the AGOA bill. There are thousands \nof African women who have lost their jobs because we have not acted on \nthe AGOA bill, and they tend to be single moms--thousands--because they \ncan't get orders to sell in the United States. Consequently, jobs in \nthe United States now are in jeopardy because the AGOA bill has not \nbeen extended.\n  It is true the AGOA bill does not expire until the end of September. \nThat\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\nis true. However, as a practical matter, these women have lost their \njobs already because American companies are not taking orders from \nAfrican countries that are providing the apparel that are otherwise \nprovided for under the AGOA bill. It is a huge issue for those African \nwomen who have lost their jobs as well as a lot of American companies \nthat are in jeopardy because they can't receive the apparel from the \nAfrican companies if this is not extended.\n  I might say, too, the DR-CAFTA bill is similar. That puts in jeopardy \na lot of jobs in South Carolina and North Carolina. So in a certain \nsense it is a jobs bill. Both these bills are important. They are very \nimportant. This package was put together and agreed to by Senators on \nthe committee, Republicans and Democrats both. It was agreed to by \nleadership offices, both sides. We worked hard, as the leader often \ndoes, to get consensus around here. So this was the thought, to put the \nbills together, and all Republicans agreed.\n  There was one Senator who said he had a problem with one of the pay-\nfors, and, frankly, it is a pay-for this body has adopted many times. \nThat Senator himself has voted for this pay-for many times. It just \nseems to me, if we break up the package, then the package is broken and \nit puts in jeopardy those other provisions because Senators will want \nto offer amendments. The Senator from Kentucky well knows, once we \nstart going down that road, things get hung up around here; the main \npoint being these are both very important bills, and the other main \npoint being it was agreed to. This package was agreed to all the way \naround, and I think at this point it does not make sense to break it \nup.\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may, I believe the Burma sanctions \nbill has been renewed without additional matters attached to it for \nsome 10 years now on an annual basis. I am perplexed as to why this \nyear it was turned into a package.\n  I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee that \nit was agreed to. But there is a dispute between the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and another member of the Finance Committee who is on \nthe floor, and Senator Coburn can speak for himself. I might say, I \ndon't have a dog in that fight. As far as I am concerned, that is \nanother matter. No matter how important that may be, I doubt a failure \nto pass the other measure, which doesn't expire until September, \ncreates a major potential foreign policy problem which could well be \ncreated by the Burma sanctions bill expiring later today.\n  I will not argue the rest of the bill is important or unimportant. I \nfrankly don't know much about the rest of the bill. I do know something \nabout the Burma sanctions bill, having offered the original bill 10 \nyears ago and having been on the floor as we renewed it annually during \nthat period, and I am pretty confident this will be perceived in Burma \nas a problem. It seems to me it is a completely avoidable problem.\n  As to the rest of it, the Senator from Oklahoma is here and he can \nspeak for himself, so I defer to him and to the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee to discuss the balance of the bill. But it would have been my \nhope, had the chairman of the Finance Committee not objected, since it \nwas cleared on my side--and it was cleared on my side, regardless of \nprevious understandings about putting the package together, by the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch, and by Senator \nCoburn--to split the Burma sanctions bill off and pass it freestanding \ntoday on a voice vote.\n  So with respect to the consent agreement I offered, which was \nobjected to, I want to make sure everybody understands there were no \nobjections to it on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the request of the \nRepublican leader.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not want to belabor the point. The \nObama administration is opposed to splitting the package apart. They \nare in favor of keeping the package as it is, and I think for good \nreason because the administration favors both Burma as well as AGOA and \nDR-CAFTA. That is the reason. They are both very important. It is for \nthat reason I think it makes sense.\n  The Senator is correct. It is very easy to resolve this thing by \nproceeding with Burma and AGOA. But if the leader wants to keep \ntalking, I am more than willing, over the next week, to see if there is \nanother resolution to work this out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would just ask a question of the \nSenator. What I hear is that the Democratic administration and \nDemocratic Senators are opposed to passing the Burma sanctions bill \ntoday freestanding? Is that what I hear the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee saying?\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is not what the Senator heard me say.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then why did the Senator object to the request?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Because the administration and I want them both.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But the Senator can't get them both unless he can work \nthis out with my good friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, who is on the \nfloor and who may want to address this matter.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am more than willing to sit down and try to work this \nout, but at this point I think any attempt to split them out is to \njeopardize the AGOA bill, and as I mentioned earlier, there are already \nthousands of women who have lost their jobs in Africa because of our \ndelay in passing AGOA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me make sure I understand where we are. The \nconsent agreement to pass the Burma sanctions bill today, before it \nexpires, is clear on this side of the aisle--clear. The chairman of the \nFinance Committee has announced, to my surprise, that the \nadministration does not favor allowing Burma sanctions to pass today \nbecause it is attached to something related to other matters.\n  So make no mistake about it, we have, for the first time in the \nhistory of this issue, turned it into a partisan matter. We have spoken \nwith one voice in America relating to Burma, under administrations of \nboth parties and Senates of both parties. Yet today, for the first \ntime, we have a partisan split over an issue about which America ought \nto be speaking with one voice.\n  I basically have said all I have to say. I do want to hear from \nSenator Coburn. I know he has strong feelings about the other part of \nthe measure about which I am basically not familiar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to say I \nsupport all three of these measures, in terms of their passing. What I \ndon't support is continuing the habit that has put this country $16 \ntrillion in debt.\n  To clarify, as a member of the Finance Committee, if one reads my \nopening statement at that hearing, in that markup, I objected to this \nbill on the basis of pay-fors. I offered two separate amendments that, \non the floor, everybody would agree are germane because the money to \npay for the $200 million comes out of trade areas. Yet they were \nrejected as nongermane by the chairman. So they weren't offered because \nhe said he would reject them. So to create the impression there was no \nobjection to the pay-for in this bill and that everybody agreed is \ninaccurate, to say the least.\n  I called Senator Coons of Delaware, who is interested in this, and I \ncalled Senator Baucus when this came up, and I told him I have a plan \nso we can get this all done this week. I was willing to lose a vote on \nthe amendment to have an opportunity to offer the amendment and give my \nside of the story by splitting these two so the House could pass it. \nThe House has now gone home. Burma sanctions are no longer available to \nbe passed, except if we were to do something extraordinary with the \nHouse, which I understand from the Speaker can happen. So Burma \nsanctions could happen this week.\n  But I wish to go back to the more important point. Regardless of \nwhether I voted for something in the past, using the type of pay-for \nthat is in this bill is what I call the Wimpy mechanism: Wimpy drives \nup to Wendy's and orders\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\na hamburger, and when he gets around to the window he says: Don't worry \nabout it, I will be back in 10 days to pay for it. What we have done is \nuse custom user fees over 10 years to collect enough money to pay for \n$200 million.\n  With the waste that is in this government, for us to use a 10-year \npay-for on something that will be expended over 3 years means we are \nnot capable of addressing the much bigger issues in front of our \ncountry. If we can't find $200 million in a $3.6 trillion budget, we \nare unqualified to be here.\n  What I would say to my friends and my colleague on the Senate Finance \nCommittee is that somebody has to start saying no. I would remind \neveryone of a lecture I got from Senator Pete Domenici on a land bill \nabout 2 years ago. He said: We have always done it that way. I said: \nYou know what, you are right, and that is why we are in trouble. So the \nfinancing mechanism on this bill denies the situation we are in and \ncharges out over 10 years custom user fees to pay for it.\n  No other American business, no other company, no other family gets \nthat kind of luxury, especially when they are in debt at 105 percent of \ntheir GDP. If we look at where we are, the average American, what we \ncan say is that we are taking in $53,000, we are spending $73,000, and \nwhat we actually owe is $380,000. We can't keep doing that. That is how \nit would relate to the individual family in this country.\n  The objection was not on the bills. There was no lack of effort on my \npart to reach out and solve this problem before now and now the \nminority leader has offered a way to solve the problem on the sanctions \nfor Burma and it is objected to. So not only do we not get to offer \namendments in committee, we do not get to offer amendments on the \nfloor. The one thing we need to accomplish today we are not going to \naccomplish because we don't want to allow amendments.\n  Because we want to keep doing it the way we have always done it. And \nthe way we have always done it has bankrupted our country and stolen \nfrom our children and grandchildren. It is not acceptable anymore.\n  That is the truth. Everything else is the game that Washington plays. \nAnd I will tell my colleagues, I am still willing to work on this. I \nhave a commitment to the Senator from Delaware that next week, if this \ncomes up, I will be the first to offer that amendment and get it out of \nthe way, taking a very short period of time with the Senate. But I want \na recorded vote of the Senators in this body that they want to steal \nthe customs user fees for 10 years for just a $200 million pay-for. If \nthat is what you really want to do, then vote that way. But go out and \ndefend it instead of taking something this administration has \nrecommended we cut--which is what I am using to pay for it, something \nthis administration has recommended to pay for it--and vote against \nwhat your own President says--here is something we need to eliminate.\n  I don't get it. The American people don't get it. No wonder we have a \n9-percent approval rating.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to briefly \ncontribute what I can to this debate.\n  One of the great honors, as the Presiding Officer knows, in being a \nfreshman is the opportunity to preside. I had the opportunity to \npreside when the Republican leader came to the floor and spoke to Burma \nsanctions. So I just wanted to say to the Republican leader that \nbecause of that speech, I have familiarized myself with the issue of \nBurma sanctions that he spoke to earlier. I do think it is important \nthat we move to it. I do think it is important to move forward on it.\n  But the Republican leader made the comment earlier that he doesn't \nmuch understand the other part of the bill, which is AGOA, the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act. I choose to stand briefly to speak to that \nbecause I am the chair of the African Affairs Subcommittee of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Senator Isakson and I joined with Congresswoman Bass and Congressman \nSmith in twice receiving dozens of Ambassadors from across the \ncontinent 3 months ago and 9 months ago as they expressed their grave \nconcern about the thousands of mostly women all across the continent \nwho are losing their jobs as we delay.\n  The AGOA reauthorization expires in September, and I am grateful for \nChairman Baucus and for his vigorous pursuit of renewal in a timely \nfashion. AGOA needs to be renewed promptly, not in September. In part, \nI believe this is why the administration has insisted on holding \ntogether Burma sanctions and this AGOA reauthorization--it is because \nof the urgency of getting AGOA reauthorized.\n  It dates back to the Clinton administration. It was first signed into \nlaw a dozen years ago. I think it has real importance for our view in \nAfrica, for how the United States is viewed in Africa, for our \nbilateral relations with more than a dozen countries. I would be happy \nto answer questions about it.\n  But we have three different issues here: the concerns the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has raised about the pay-for, and I respect his concerns \nabout budget and budgetary discipline and dealing with our deficit; the \nconcerns the Republican leader has raised about Burma and about \nsanctions and about our ongoing role as a global leader in pressing for \nthe liberation of people and process in Burma; and the concerns many \nother Senators and I have shared about timely reauthorization of the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act. Unfortunately, the three of them \nintersect in a way that today is preventing us from moving forward.\n  It is my hope that the Republican leader, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, the Senator from Oklahoma, and I can sit down and craft some \nresponsible compromise that allows this to move forward because, if my \nunderstanding is correct, it is the concerns of the Senator from \nOklahoma that are preventing us from moving forward at this point, and \nit is the administration's concerns that are preventing breaking apart \nthe Burma sanctions and AGOA sanctions. And there is a third provision \nrelating to CAFTA, if I am not mistaken. So if we could work together \nin a way that finds a responsible path forward, it is still possible.\n  There is bipartisan support in the House for the passage of this \npackage. In fact, I believe they were prepared to pass it by unanimous \nconsent earlier this week and only hesitated to proceed because they \nheard there was a hold here in the Senate.\n  I would like to work together in a way that can demonstrate to the \npeople of Burma, to the people of Africa, and to the people around the \nworld that this greatest deliberative body on Earth can still work out \nissues of this scale in a timely fashion. So I offer my willingness to \nwork together to find a path forward either tonight or in the week \nahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't mean to belabor the issue. I see \nthe Republican leader has left the floor. I have just a couple of \npoints.\n  One, I don't want the impression to be left here that this is a \npartisan matter. I don't want the impression to be left here that one \nparty favors Burma sanctions and the other doesn't, and the same with \nrespect to AGOA provisions. The fact is, these are both totally \nbipartisan. Both political parties favor these measures. It is just a \nmatter of working out a way to pass them.\n  The Senator from Delaware has made a very good point, so let's see if \nwe can work things out within the next couple or 3 days.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma makes a very valid point, too; that is, \nsometimes we pay for measures around here with measures that take \nseveral years to actually pay for. It is a common practice around here. \nAnd to say we have done it once does not necessarily mean it is right.\n  But I say to my good friend from Oklahoma, who has voted for this \nkind of measure 11 times, by my count, and once even on the Burma bill, \nthat when we work over the next several weeks and next several months \non resolving the fiscal cliff and tax reform, it will be a good \nopportunity to find ways to reduce our budget deficits, both spending \nand revenue, and an opportunity to address it in a way that does not do \nviolence to them and that respects the concept the Senator from \nOklahoma was mentioning. He has mentioned a\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\nconcept that applies not just with respect to customs user fees but for \na lot of tax provisions around here, and I think it is something we \nshould talk about and figure out how we want to handle it. But in the \nmeantime, I just suggest that--let's keep talking. There are a few days \nleft here before we leave for the August recess.\n  I thank my colleagues for working together to try to find a solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                   Guor Marial and the 2012 Olympics\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, tomorrow the attention of the world will \nturn to London as we witness the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics. \nOver 10,000 athletes representing 204 nations from around the world \nwill be competing in hundreds of sporting events at the games of the \n30th Olympiad. Here in the United States, we will be cheering on the \n529 U.S. athletes as they look to bring home the gold for the United \nStates of America. The Olympics no doubt will have countless stories of \ntriumph and disappointment, competition and camaraderie.\n  I rise today to share the remarkable story of one particular athlete \nwho will be competing this year. His story is one of inspiring triumph \nof character and spirit. But until just days ago, this Olympian had no \nflag to compete under. This story is about a talented young runner \nnamed Guor Marial whose mere survival in southern Sudan defied the \nodds. Having escaped the bloodshed and violence in war-torn Sudan, Guor \nfound his way to my home State of New Hampshire as a teenage refugee. \nWho could have imagined that in just over a decade, Guor would be \napplying for U.S. citizenship and traveling to London to compete in the \nOlympic marathon?\n  Guor was born in a town in what is now part of the fledgling country \nof South Sudan. Many of his family and friends, including his brother, \nwere killed at the hands of Sudanese security forces. Many more died of \nstarvation or disease brought on by the violence and unspeakable crimes \ncommitted by these Sudanese forces.\n  Before escaping Sudan, Guor was a victim of violence on numerous \noccasions. As a child, he was kidnapped from his hometown and enslaved \nas a laborer before eventually finding a way to escape and return to \nhis family. Guor was severely beaten by the Sudanese police and had to \nspend days in a hospital to recover. Finally, he was able to flee to \nneighboring Egypt and eventually to the peace and safety of New \nHampshire as a refugee seeking asylum.\n  Guor arrived in my home State of New Hampshire in 2001, almost \nexactly 11 years ago. He remembers that day well and still considers \nNew Hampshire his home. He lived in Concord, the State capital, moving \nin with the families of his friends, teammates, and his cross-country \ncoach for 2 years in order to graduate from high school. The contrast \nbetween Guor's former life and his new life is stark. In Sudan, he was \nrunning in fear for his life. In New Hampshire, he was running for the \njoy of athletic competition and to be part of a team.\n  Amazingly, in only his second official marathon, Guor ran fast enough \nto qualify for the 2012 London Olympics. Given his unique situation, \nhowever, it looked as if the bureaucracy would triumph over his bravery \nand that Guor might not be able to compete because according to the \nrules of the International Olympic Committee, permanent residents of a \ncountry are not permitted to compete on that country's team. As a \nresult, Guor can't compete under the American flag because he is not \nyet a full citizen. In addition, Guor can't run for the newly \nrecognized country of South Sudan because it is such a new country, it \ndoesn't yet have an official Olympic committee.\n  The International Olympic Committee suggested that Guor compete as a \nmember of the Sudanese team, and the Sudanese Government extended him \nan invitation. But Guor rightfully refused, explaining that running for \nSudan ``would be a disappointment and an embarrassment to me and the \npeople of South Sudan who died for freedom, including my brother.'' \nGuor was not comfortable running on behalf of the country that tortured \nand murdered so many of his family members. That solution would have \nbeen cruel and unacceptable.\n  Fortunately, after some pressure by Refugees International and other \nfriends of Guor who wrote to the International Olympic Committee on his \nbehalf, we received the great news this week that the IOC executive \nboard has decided to make an exception for Guor. He will run in the \nmarathon as an independent Olympic athlete under the great Olympic \nflag. I want to thank the International Olympic Committee for this very \nappropriate ruling. In addition, I want to thank the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee, the U.S. Department of State, and the other friends of Guor \nwho worked so hard to make his participation possible.\n  As he runs under that five-ringed flag, long a symbol of hope for \npeace in our world, Guor will run with the support of his family, his \nNew Hampshire supporters, Americans everywhere, and his new country, \nSouth Sudan. I have a feeling that such support might help him run even \nfaster.\n  We are so proud of Guor in New Hampshire and proud that in the United \nStates someone who has lived through such tragedy and adversity can \nstart a new life and rise to such incredible heights.\n  Scott Hamilton, an American Olympic gold medalist, once said, ``Most \nother competitions are individual competitions. But the Olympic games \nis something that belongs to everybody.'' No matter the outcome in \nLondon, the story of Guor Marial and the adversity he has overcome \nbelongs to everyone. Win or lose, he will stand as a lasting \ninspiration for people around the globe and as a tribute to the \ngreatness that is the United States of America. I look forward to \nwelcoming Guor home from the Olympics as a winner, regardless of the \noutcome of the marathon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                            Colorado Drought\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am here tonight on a different topic \nthan the Senator from New Hampshire, but I wish to congratulate her on \nher fine work here. I know she doesn't need or wouldn't want me to say \nthat, but the people of New Hampshire are so lucky to be represented by \nher. And this is exactly why--a reminder that our Olympic athletes are \nabout to start, I hope, winning gold medals. I suspect they will win \nthe most in this summer's Olympics. We are looking forward to that.\n  The Senator mentioned marathons, which brought to mind what I want to \ntalk about tonight, which is the farm bill--an elegant segue from one \nmarathon to another. I want to talk about it in the context of the \nsevere drought that is facing Colorado and all of rural America, and I \nwant to acknowledge the administration's ongoing efforts to provide \nColoradans with disaster relief during this difficult summer of fires \nand drought.\n  We need to pass a 5-year farm bill as quickly as possible to address \nthe challenges we are seeing in farm country. We have done the work to \nget an agreement on the Senate bill. In fact, we passed the 5-year farm \nbill in this Senate. It was a strong, bipartisan bill. I would like to \nthank the Senator from Michigan, Debbie Stabenow, and the ranking \nmember of the committee for their incredible leadership in working \ntogether, both side of the aisle, never in a partisan way, to produce \namong other things the only bipartisan deficit reduction that any \ncommittee, House or Senate, has produced in this Congress--$24 billion \nof deficit reduction that has been agreed to by Republicans and \nDemocrats. It ends direct payments to producers, which is one of the \nmost substantial reforms we have seen in agriculture policy in a long \ntime, and it strengthens the conservation title of the farm bill, which \nis very important to my State and to the West.\n  Colorado has a $40 billion agriculture sector that extends to all \ncorners of our State. Farming and ranching are two things we do \nextremely well. The Senator from Iowa is here tonight, and his farmers \ndo it extremely well in Iowa as well.\n  Producers in Colorado and nationwide are experiencing the worst \ndrought in 50 years. While Colorado is certainly no stranger to water \nchallenges, this year's growing season has been particularly tough--to \nput it mildly.\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\n  According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, nearly our entire State is \ndesignated as an extreme drought area. This designation means we are \nexperiencing major damage to crops and pastureland, as well as \nwidespread water shortages. While this designation tells us a lot, we \nonly need to ask the farmers and ranchers about how the dry conditions \nare threatening their operations.\n  I met recently with a group of corn growers from eastern Colorado. \nTake a look at what these farmers are up against. This is Steve Scott's \ncornfield 18 miles southeast of Burlington, CO, a town of 4,200 people \nnear the Kansas border. This crop--and many others in the region--has \nwithered under long stretches of high temperatures with little or no \nprecipitation to help.\n  The Department of Agriculture reports that 50 percent of Colorado's \ncorn production is in either poor or very poor condition. The drought \nhas also taken a significant toll on our cattle producers. Colorado is \none of America's top beef producers. Right now 75 percent of \npastureland in Colorado, approximately 900,000 acres--and I am not sure \nhow that measures up to the Presiding Officer's State, but it is pretty \nclose to that size--is rated as either poor or very poor in condition. \nDry pasture and feed shortages have led ranchers to liquidate their \nherds early, well before they have realized their full size and value.\n  The Greeley, CO, auction producers' barn is seeing double the sales \nactivity right now as compared to the same time last year because \nranchers are selling their cattle below full weight and maturity. They \nare losing anywhere from $200 to $400 a head.\n  Next week Carl Hansen of Livermore, CO, is selling 160 of his steers \nand 90 heifers. On average, each animal will be sold 150 pounds \nunderweight due to the drought conditions. If beef is selling at $1.50 \na pound, that is $56,000--actually a little more than that--of lost \nrevenue for Carl Hansen and his family.\n  The consequences of this drought extend well beyond farm country. The \ndamage to our farms and ranches affect other sectors of the economy--\nfrom transportation to energy, from banking to retail. We all know \nthere is nothing Congress can do to stop the drought or prevent the \nnext one from coming, but what we can do is give our farmers and \nranchers the tools they need to manage this drought and plan for the \nfuture by passing a 5-year farm bill.\n  We hear a lot about uncertainty in these two Chambers. I can't \nimagine a set of circumstances creating more uncertainty in a difficult \nsituation than that.\n  Now we hear that the House leadership is planning a 1-year punt on \nthis whole conversation, one more expression that Washington, DC, has \nbecome the land of flickering lights, providing very little opportunity \nfor people to be able to plan and have predictability.\n  What is wrong with the Senate-passed bipartisan farm bill that had \nthe support of 64 Senators? Sixty-four Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans. Some people voted against it because they didn't think it \nwas adequate to their region, but this was not a partisan vote. Neither \nthe majority nor the minority vote was a partisan vote. This was the \nSenate operating as the Senate is meant to operate.\n  A 5-year bill provides our agriculture community with much needed \ncertainty and predictability, but now it is being held up in the House \nby politics. Let's be clear: No one is pretending that the farm bill \ncan correct bad weather. Our producers are not waiting on the farm bill \nto do what they do best. Colorado will continue innovating and \nincreasing productivity, but the last thing on Earth they need is to \nhave Washington's unfinished business hanging around their necks.\n  A 5-year farm bill will provide producers with a set of tools for \nmanaging through this drought and planning for the future. The 1-year \nbill being discussed over in the House by the leadership doesn't \nrecognize--or is unwilling to recognize--the agriculture community's \nneed to do long-term planning.\n  Among many other important provisions, the Senate farm bill contains \nrevamped risk management programs like crop insurance, which is what I \nheard was needed by our farmers, and improvements farmers requested to \nhelp manage a severe drought exactly like the one we are going through \nright now. This is the point of that provision. A 1-year bill doesn't \nhave any of those provisions.\n  Corn farmers on Colorado's eastern plains could lose 40 percent or \nmore of their revenue this season. We need these reforms and the \npredictability of the Senate bill. Our bill also contains permanent \ndisaster programs that provide responsible assistance to producers in \nneed. Some of these programs, such as the livestock disaster program, \nexpired in September 2011, almost a year ago. If Congress takes the \neasy way out and does a 1-year extension, our livestock producers will \nget no relief--none. This means no disaster assistance for ranchers \nwhose pasture is too dry to feed their cattle.\n  Who is going to explain to the people selling at the Greeley auction \nbarn why this is not a priority for our Congress in the middle of the \nworst drought in decades?\n  The House Agriculture Committee passed a 5-year farm bill with a \nstrong bipartisan 35-to-11 vote. Again, this is not the partisan \ndysfunctionality we talked about for so many months on this floor. We \nhave two bipartisan bills: One was passed out of committee on the House \nside with broad bipartisan support, and one was passed on the Senate \nfloor with broad bipartisan support. It is not surprising that I am not \nthe only person who is calling for a long-term extension--a 5-year \nextension. There are 79 House Members, including 41 Republicans, who \nwrote to the Speaker last week asking him to bring the long-term farm \nbill to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter signed by 79 \nHouse Members be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2012.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Cantor, Democratic \n     Leader Pelosi, and Democratic Whip Hoyer: Many current farm \n     bill policies expire on September 30, 2012. The House \n     Agriculture Committee passed H.R. 6083, the Federal \n     Agriculture Reform and Risk Management (FARRM) Act, or the \n     2012 Farm Bill, on July 12th with a strong bipartisan vote of \n     35-11. While by no means perfect, this farm bill is needed \n     for producers and those who rely on sound agriculture policy \n     and nutrition programs during difficult economic times.\n       The House Agriculture Committee has done its work and we \n     now ask that you make time on the floor of the House to \n     consider this legislation, so that it can be debated, \n     conferenced, and ultimately passed into law, before the \n     current bill expires. We need to continue to tell the \n     American success story of agriculture and work to ensure we \n     have strong policies in place so that producers can continue \n     to provide an abundant, affordable and safe food supply.\n       We all share the goal of giving small businesses certainty \n     in these challenging economic times. Agriculture supports \n     nearly 16 million jobs nationwide and over 45 million people \n     are helped each year by the nutrition programs in the farm \n     bill. We have a tremendous opportunity to set the course of \n     farm and nutrition policy for another five years while \n     continuing to maintain and support these jobs nationwide.\n       The message from our constituents and rural America is \n     clear: we need a farm bill now. We ask that you bring a farm \n     bill up before the August District Work Period so that the \n     House will have the opportunity to work its will. We ask that \n     you make this legislation a priority of the House as it is \n     critically important to rural and urban Americans alike.\n       We appreciate your consideration of this request and look \n     forward to working with you to advance the FARRM Act.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. They wrote:\n\n       The message from our constituents and rural America is \n     clear; we need a farm bill now. We ask that you bring a farm \n     bill up before the August District Work Period.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n       We ask that you make this legislation a priority of the \n     House as it is critically important to rural and urban \n     Americans alike.\n\n  Representative Rick Berg, a Republican from North Dakota, took to the \nfloor last week and said:\n\n       Now is the time for the House to act, the time for the farm \n     bill now.\n\n  Jo Ann Emerson, a Republican Congresswoman from Missouri, told \nreporters that ``there are problems with my farmers who need to make \nplanning decisions.''\n  We are seeing that exact same uncertainty plaguing our farmers and \nranchers in Colorado. Yet here we are again. We have seen this before \nin Washington. We are pretty good at starting conversations, but we are \nnot very good at finishing them. We are kicking the can down the road \nonce again, but\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\nthis is the farm bill, which is a bipartisan effort that rarely, if \never, has been used as a political football around this place.\n  Three days ago David Rogers wrote an article, which I think \naccurately describes our dilemma. It was in Politico.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article also be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, July 23, 2012]\n\n              Congress Delays Farm Bill as Drought Spreads\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       To understand how far this Congress will go to kick the \n     proverbial can down the road, consider the farm bill--yes, \n     the farm bill.\n       In the midst of a severe drought, the House Republican \n     leaders are proposing to walk away from farm states and \n     decades of precedent by not calling up the new five-year plan \n     before the current law expires Sept. 30.\n       Whatever its flaws, the bill promises $35 billion in 10-\n     year savings from exactly the type of mandatory spending that \n     Congress promised to tackle in last summer's debt accord. But \n     rather than disrupt its political messaging, the GOP would \n     put it all at risk by delaying action until after the \n     November elections.\n       There's little institutional memory left in the Capitol--or \n     perspective on the accumulation of cans rolling down the road \n     these days. But the farm bill delay is new ground for any \n     Congress.\n       Never before in modern times has a farm bill reported from \n     the House Agriculture Committee been so blocked. POLITICO \n     looked back at 50 years of farm bills and found nothing like \n     this. There have been long debates, often torturous \n     negotiations with the Senate and a famous meltdown in 1995 \n     when the House Agriculture Committee couldn't produce a bill. \n     But no House farm bill, once out of committee, has been kept \n     off the floor while its deadline passes.\n       If pushed into November's lame-duck session, farmers will \n     join Medicare physicians whose pay will be running out, idled \n     workers worried about jobless benefits, and very likely, \n     millions of families faced with expiring tax breaks.\n       For all the backslapping over the recent transportation \n     bill, that measure expires in just 15 months. The Democratic \n     Senate no longer even tries to do 12-month appropriations \n     bills. Already in mid-July--when the floor used to be \n     humming--the ``smart money'' is plotting a stop-gap \n     continuing resolution to get to November or beyond.\n       Such a CR was once treated as a backstop by the \n     Appropriations committees. Now the practice is so prevalent \n     in all areas of government that the letters might stand for \n     ``Congress Retreats.''\n       ``It's to the point where you almost think you should vote \n     against extensions because they are extensions,'' Rep. George \n     Miller (D-Calif.) told POLITICO. ``If you were looking at the \n     United States from outside, you look and you say, `What are \n     these people? Fools?' ''\n       Elections do matter, and there's some logic to letting the \n     voters reshuffle the deck before tackling tough issues. But \n     that's not what's happening here.\n       The presidential campaigns are already being criticized for \n     lacking all substance. But whoever wins, neither President \n     Barack Obama nor Mitt Romney has shown any appetite for this \n     debate--or even knowledge of farm issues.\n       The Senate has already approved its farm bill; even if \n     Republicans were to win control in November, the GOP's \n     majority will be so narrow that Democrats will be able to \n     block wholesale changes. In the House, the only certainty \n     about a lame duck is there will be even more unhappy people \n     hanging around.\n       No, the real reason for Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to \n     delay the farm bill is not because there will be better \n     answers after the election. It's because he doesn't like the \n     answers he sees before.\n       The farm bill came out of the House Agriculture Committee \n     on a strong bipartisan 35-11 vote July 12. Nearly a year \n     after the August debt accords--and eight months after the \n     November collapse of the deficit supercommittee--it is the \n     closest this Congress has come to enacting real deficit \n     reduction from mandatory spending.\n       But it's not perfect, and Boehner's Republicans are split \n     regionally and ideologically, with the right demanding still \n     greater savings and a more free-market approach to \n     agriculture policy.\n       Given Democratic concerns over the depth of the food stamp \n     cuts already made, Boehner says there are not 218 votes for \n     passage. Rather than wrestle with this problem, it's easier \n     to run out the clock with symbolic anti-red tape, anti-tax \n     votes on which the GOP is more united.\n       Senate Democrats have kicked their share of cans as well. \n     First no spring budget resolution. Then no summer \n     appropriations debate. All under the watch of a majority \n     leader--Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.)--who served for years on the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee.\n       Yet there's something bigger about the farm bill.\n       Perhaps because it is a five-year event and so fundamental \n     to one bright spot in the economy. Or maybe it's the pounding \n     drought across the country that gives pause. Farmers live by \n     nature's calendar, not continuing resolutions. And by failing \n     to act, Congress can seem even more detached from the real \n     lives of everyday people.\n       Changes in the Washington press foster this detachment. \n     Major newspapers are more prone to editorials than real \n     reporting on the debate. Regional papers, once the backbone \n     of farm coverage, have closed their bureaus. In the new \n     Capitol trend, some of the most experienced agriculture \n     reporters report to clients--not the public.\n       The biggest irony may be Boehner himself. The speaker, \n     after all, spent his early years on the Agriculture Committee \n     and prides himself on being a ``regular order'' and pro-\n     chairman leader. He chastises Obama regularly for doing \n     precisely this: kicking the can down the road.\n       As if to remind him, Rep. Rick Berg (R-N.D.), a Boehner \n     favorite now running for the Senate, took to the floor \n     Thursday just minutes after the speaker had again ducked farm \n     bill questions at his weekly news conference.\n       ``Now is the time for the House to act,'' Berg told his \n     colleagues. ``The time for the farm bill is now.''\n       The biggest Republican divisions are also where the \n     greatest savings lie: the commodity and nutrition titles.\n       Both the House and Senate put an end to direct cash \n     payments to farmers, a long-demanded reform saving about $5 \n     billion a year. The dispute is over how much of that money is \n     reinvested in new subsidies--and where.\n       The Senate bet heavily on a new shallow-loss revenue-\n     protection program geared to Midwest corn and soybean \n     producers. The House whittles this down to make room for more \n     of a traditional countercyclical program that protects \n     against deep losses but is keyed to government-set target \n     prices--a taboo for free-market types.\n       Southern rice, peanut and wheat producers stand to do far \n     better under the House approach, but the two bills appear to \n     lunge in opposite regional directions. Corn and soybean \n     growers can almost lock in profits in the early years of the \n     Senate plan. At the same time, the House cotton package costs \n     nearly 20 percent more than what was already viewed as a rich \n     Senate deal. And a $14 per hundredweight target price for \n     rice is higher than what many other crops got, when measured \n     against government data for production costs.\n       The 13 Southern states are the backbone of the House GOP's \n     majority, contributing 102 votes or more than 40 percent of \n     the conference. This is also where the lines are clearest, \n     not just for crops but also food-stamp savings.\n       House Agriculture Committee Chairman Frank Lucas (R-Okla.) \n     and the committee's ranking Democrat, Minnesota Rep. Collin \n     Peterson, had hoped to thread this needle by offering a new \n     national eligibility standard for the nutrition program \n     somewhat to the right of Texas's food stamp rules. But for \n     the majority of Southern states, it meant a modest increase \n     from 130 percent to 140 percent of poverty as the high-end \n     income cap--and so it ran aground in the committee.\n       Peterson, refusing to be discouraged, has plunged back into \n     the fray, trying to find some compromise on food stamps and \n     still hoping that Boehner will relent on moving the farm bill \n     this summer.\n       ``Collin is a CPA by training. He's a numbers guy. He's \n     very focused as a Blue Dog about the budgetary consequences \n     of our actions,'' Lucas told POLITICO. ``I think he's \n     basically on the right track as he's described it to me. The \n     question really comes down to: will we wind up with floor \n     time?''\n       And himself?\n       The morning after his late night markup, Lucas sought out \n     Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) face to face. \n     ``They thanked me, smiled at me and left it at that,'' Lucas \n     said.\n       He himself is worried--like Republicans in the Senate--that \n     simply passing a short-term extension of the current farm law \n     will not be an easy matter in September. Having spent the \n     better part of a year saying direct payments must end, will \n     Congress want to extend them?\n       ``I'm trying to maintain a good solid working relationship \n     with my leadership,'' Lucas smiles. ``I'm trying to be a \n     positive advocate for why I believe our bipartisan bill \n     deserves floor time.''\n       ``I've alerted staff to be ready to go on a moment's \n     notice, and I will also tell you there are external events \n     that could impact the situation. If this drought continues in \n     the West and Midwest, it could drive members to want to see \n     some action.''\n\n  Mr. BENNET. To quote Mr. Rogers:\n\n       Never before in modern times has a farm bill reported from \n     the House Agriculture Committee been so blocked.\n\n  Never before in modern times. I suspect it is true in ancient times \nas well, but it has certainly been true in modern times. Rogers tells \nus that he ``looked back at 50 years of farm bills and found nothing \nlike this.'' He continues:\n\n       Farmers live by nature's calendar, not continuing \n     resolutions.\n\n  I could never have said it so eloquently myself. He also said:\n\n       And by failing to act, Congress can seem even more detached \n     from the real lives of everyday people.\n\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\n\n  I would not have thought it was possible that this place could seem \nmore detached from the everyday lives of the American people than it \nalready appears to be. We found a way of doing that, and that is by \nfailing to pass this bipartisan farm bill through the Congress in a \ntimely way that is essential for people who are suffering through this \nkind of drought.\n  I think Mr. Rogers' observation is exactly right, and I have been on \nthis floor many times before saying the people at home in Colorado--\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents--don't identify with the \ncartoon of a conversation that we are having in Washington, DC, right \nnow. I can't think of a clearer example than the failure to act on this \nbipartisan piece of legislation. This is legislation that would \nimmediately help people all across our country, all across America, who \nare struggling today.\n  Mr. President, think for just a moment about our farmers in Colorado \nand rural communities just like our communities all across this \nwonderful country. Our farmers and ranchers are experiencing the worst \ndrought in over half a century. Who is going to look in the eyes of our \nfarmers in Middle America and tell them our dysfunctional politics will \nprevent this bill from moving forward?\n  Who is going to tell Steve Scott and Carl Hansen that this bill isn't \ngoing to be a priority in the Congress, that we are just going to take \nour recess and go home for a month not having passed this bipartisan \npiece of legislation, the only manifestation and example of bipartisan \ndeficit reduction in either the House or the Senate in this entire \nCongress?\n  I implore the House to figure out how to come to its senses and pass \na 5-year bill along the lines of the bill that was passed out of their \ncommittee, and then together we can have a conference and decide how we \nare going to move this bill forward on behalf of farmers and ranchers \nall across my State and the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I didn't come to the floor to speak about the farm bill \nbecause I did that yesterday. I want to assure the Senator from \nColorado that I listened to everything he said, and I agree with him. \nThat was my plea in maybe a little broader context yesterday in asking \nthat the House of Representatives take up the bill. Also, the House \nbrags, legitimately so, about being fiscally conservative, so I agree \nwith what the Senator from Colorado said. This may be the only \nopportunity--presumably the only opportunity--to pass a farm bill or \nany bill that saves money from previous programs of previous years. I \ncompliment the Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Freedom of Speech\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss what I consider a \ndisturbing trend that is occurring in this country. A vicious attack is \nunderway on the right to freedom of speech that is protected by the \nfirst amendment. It needs to be highlighted, and hopefully it will \nstop. Free speech is one of the most important rights that Americans \nenjoy.\n  Speech on public issues is the way democracy discusses and debates \nthe important questions of the day. Many great political movements in \nthis country's history depended upon this first amendment right, \nfreedom of speech. Even when Martin Luther King was jailed and his \nsupporters subjected to violence, free speech enabled him to change the \nviews and practices of an entire nation. Today too many government \nofficials seek to shut up people who disagree with them rather than \ndebate those people and debate those issues.\n  There have been a series of recent incidents to which I want to \nrefer. Consider recently that the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in \nthe past month has held two hearings that prove my point. A hearing was \nheld on a bill that would criminalize supposedly deceptive statements \nin advance of elections. It would allow the government to criminalize \npolitical speech based on its content. It would risk government \nselectively choosing to prosecute its political opponents. t would \nallow political candidates to make accusations against their political \nopponents. So it would chill candidates from speaking.\n\n  A few days after our hearing, the Supreme Court's ruling in the \nAlvarez case confirmed all the free speech problems with that bill. But \neven after that decision, the Justice Department, to my disappointment, \nissued a letter in support of the bill. That letter made no mention of \nany first amendment considerations. I have heard no indication that the \ncommittee will not mark up this bill which represents a grave threat to \nfreedom of speech.\n  This week, the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution \nheld a hearing on the legislative responses to the Citizens United \ncase. In that decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the first \namendment's free speech guarantee protects the rights of corporations \nand unions to make independent expenditures in support of candidates or \non any particular policy issue that they want to speak out on. The \nruling has no effect on campaign contributions. There are proposals in \nthis body to amend the Bill of Rights, the first amendment, for the \nvery first time, to allow the government to limit how much candidates \ncan spend on speech and, therefore, the amount of speech that the \ngovernment will permit. And there are proposed constitutional \namendments to prevent corporations and labor unions from spending in \nelections. To me, this is very serious business that we ought to be \nraising a red flag about.\n  It is worth remembering what rule the Obama administration asked the \nSupreme Court to adopt in Citizens United. The Justice Department \nargued that the government should be able to ban books that contained \neven one sentence that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a \ncandidate if those books were published or distributed by a corporation \nor a union. This administration argued in favor of banning books. In \nlight of the practice of totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, this \nadministration's position on free speech is very astonishing. The \nSupreme Court quite rightly rejected the argument of the administration \non that particular point.\n  It reminded the news media, which is organized in corporate form for \nthe most part, that the exemption from campaign finance laws is by \nstatute, and one which Congress could remove at any time, threatening \nfreedom of the press. If that were to happen and the Constitution were \nto allow restrictions on corporate independent expenditures, the \nguarantee of freedom of the press would be as threatened as freedom of \nspeech.\n  Then there is another situation, and this deals with the restaurant \nchain of Chick-fil-A. The owner of that chain is a Christian who has \nspoken in favor of the value of traditional marriage. The chain has not \ndiscriminated against anyone so far as has been reported. The \nrestaurant seeks to expand in Boston and Chicago where presumably it \nwould create new jobs, and in order to get there, it has to meet the \npermit requirements. However, Mayor Menino of Boston wrote a letter to \nthe company president. He said that because of the owner's ``prejudice \nstatements,'' there would be no place in Boston for the discrimination \nthe company represented. The mayor notified the property owners where \nthe restaurant was to open of his views.\n  In Chicago, an alderman seeks to deny Chick-fil-A from opening in his \nward for the same reason. It is reported that President Obama's former \nChief of Staff, now Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, is sympathetic to the \nalderman's point of view.\n  Once again, this is a gross violation of first amendment free speech. \nGovernment cannot deny a benefit to someone because it disagrees with \nthe applicant's views. This is the fundamental principle of our \nconstitutional democracy.\n  Voicing support for traditional marriage is not discrimination. That \nspeech is not hate speech. Even if it were, the first amendment \nprotects speech that is unpopular with the government. There is no \nconstitutional speech code that allows banning a hate speech any more \nthan government can ban speech in books.\n  Finally, the Alvarez decision a few weeks ago affects another first \namendment issue pending before this body right now. In the Alvarez \ncase, the Supreme Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act which \ncriminalizes lies concerning winning military medals. It did\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\nso on free speech grounds. I know many of my colleagues desire to pass \na new law that will accomplish that goal, and if that law is \nconstitutional, I will probably join them in that effort.\n  Two bills on this subject are now pending in the Senate. Senator \nBrown of Massachusetts introduced the first bill and then Senator Webb \ndid so after the Alvarez decision. There have been efforts to pass both \nbills by voice vote.\n  When the Republicans were asked to move the Webb bill, we were told \nthat all Democrats supported the bill. This is a problem. The Webb bill \nis clearly unconstitutional based upon the Alvarez decision. It \ncriminalizes some lies about medals that the Supreme Court says \nCongress cannot criminalize.\n  For instance, it would prohibit lies in campaigns and in employment, \neven when those lies would not produce the tangible, material benefit \nthat is necessary to punish them. Yet no Democrat objected to passing \nthe bill without debate. Of course, Republicans could not agree to such \na request.\n  Since he did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court decision when \nSenator Brown wrote the bill, right now, because of the decision, and \nhe didn't know about it, Senator Brown's bill is also unconstitutional. \nThe difference between his bill and Senator Webb's bill, however, is \nthat Senator Brown now has a substitute amendment that seems to address \nthe problem in a fully constitutional way. But although Democrats want \nto pass without debate a clearly unconstitutional bill, somehow they \nobject to a clearly constitutional Brown bill.\n  These games should stop. I am sure all the Members of this body \nshould be willing to support a single constitutional bill that would \nreenact the prohibition on lying about whether one is entitled to \ncertain military medals.\n  In short, this country is facing a disturbing increase in government \nactions that violate the freedom of speech. That is a vital right of \nour democracy.\n  Anyone can stand up for speech with which they agree. The test for \ngovernment officials and the test for free speech is whether they will \nallow speech with which they might disagree. They may criticize speech, \ndebate the speech, and seek to change minds. But shutting people up, \ndenying them benefits, passing bills that would put people in jail for \nexercising free speech rights--these are never allowable under our \nConstitution. It is time for elected officials to pay greater heed to \nthe oath to support the Constitution.\n\n\n   Report by Former FBI Director William Webster on Fort Hood Attack\n\n  Recently, former FBI Director William Webster was asked to \ninvestigate how the FBI performed regarding the attack at Fort Hood by \nMAJ Nidal Hasan.\n  Major Hasan's attack killed 12 U.S. soldiers, a Defense Department \nemployee, and wounded 42 others. Following the attack, the FBI \nconducted an internal review and determined that it had information on \nMajor Hasan prior to that attack. As a result, the FBI Director asked \nJudge Webster to conduct an independent review and investigation of the \nFBI's handling of the matter. In short, Judge Webster's commission \nfound that the FBI made mistakes that resulted from a number of \nproblems--some operational, some technological.\n  Some of these mistakes are extremely concerning given that they are \nbasic management failures. For example, the unclassified report states:\n\n       Many agents and most [task force officers] did not receive \n     training on [FBI computer systems] and other FBI databases \n     until after the FBI's internal investigation of the Fort Hood \n     shootings.\n\n  This is clearly unacceptable.\n  Other problems highlighted include failing to issue Intelligence \nInformation Reports on Major Hasan to the Defense Department; confusion \nabout which FBI office was investigating the lead; failure to interview \nMajor Hasan; along with information technology limitations.\n  All in all, the Webster report paints a disturbing picture of the \nFBI. It shows lack of training, failure to follow leads, and continued \ncomputer problems. These are the types of problems that, quite frankly, \nwe thought were corrected following the terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n  Ultimately, Judge Webster issued 18 recommendations for the FBI to \nimplement to prevent future problems such as these. The FBI agreed with \nthese recommendations and has stated they will take action to implement \nthose recommendations.\n  That is good news, of course. The FBI must implement these \nrecommendations and do it immediately. However, we have a duty to make \nsure the FBI implements these recommendations and holds people \naccountable--in fact, hold the FBI accountable--if they don't. The \nFBI's failure in this case is inexcusable and shakes public confidence \nin the FBI's ability to combat homegrown terrorism. Basic management \nproblems and investigative failures can't happen, particularly if \nnational security is at stake. If failures of this magnitude occur on \nhigh profile national security cases, it makes one wonder what the FBI \nis doing on other investigations.\n  Those responsible for these failures should be held accountable. I \nintend to follow up with Director Mueller to determine what action was \ntaken against those people who didn't do the job in the right and \ncorrect way.\n\n\n              Justice Department Inspector General Report\n\n  One more report that can't go ignored is a report released this \nmorning by the Justice Department Office of Inspector General. This \nreport examined improper hiring practices within the Justice \nDepartment's Justice Management Division. Shockingly, the inspector \ngeneral found the Justice Department employees openly and flagrantly \nviolated Federal law.\n  Let me repeat that these employees violated Federal law and the \nDepartment of Justice regulations prohibiting employment of relatives, \ngranting illegal preferences in employment, conflict of interest, and \nmisuse of position. Further, employees who were interviewed by the \nOffice of Inspector General were also found to have made false \nstatements to investigators.\n  This is an example of the Justice Department run wild. It is \ntroubling to me how employees within the Department colluded and \nschemed to hire one another's relatives in order to avoid rules against \nnepotism. It is inexcusable, and I can assure my colleagues that we \nwill be looking into this matter.\n  This wasn't a one-time event, by the way. In fact, the Office of \nInspector General pointed out that similar problems existed in 2008. \nDespite what the Department called ``aggressive action'' to stop this \ntype of behavior back in 2008, it appears nothing has changed.\n  At the very least, the Attorney General needs to hold these employees \naccountable with more than just disciplinary action. Laws were broken \nand false statements were made. The Department can't simply sweep this \nunder the rug. Employees need to be punished because in this town, if \nheads don't roll, nothing changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I return to the floor today to give \nvoice once again to the issue I feel will most significantly define \nthis generation of leadership in the United States and around the \nglobe. I rise to discuss the notable, evident changes taking place in \nour Earth's climate, the relationship between our own activities and \nthe change and the rate of change being observed, and our, so far, \nforsaken responsibility to address climate change head on and with \npurpose.\n  Last month, representatives from world governments, the private \nsector, NGOs, and other major stakeholders gathered in Rio de Janeiro, \nBrazil, for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. \nMarking the 20th anniversary of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, this \nyear's conference was nicknamed ``Rio+20.''\n  So-called sustainable development principles consist of a set of \nprinciples and strategies that, when acted upon by the global \ncommunity, will balance strong economic growth, expansion of just civic \nand government structures, and environmental protection. Another way to \nview sustainable development is in the balance of the needs of the \npresent with those of future generations through the fair use of \nresources.\n  As Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said:\n\n       In the 21st century, the only viable development is \n     sustainable development. The only way to deliver lasting \n     progress for everyone is by preserving our resources and \n     protecting our common environment.\n\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\n\n  One positive aspect of this Rio+20 conference was discussion of the \npower of economic forces in promoting sustainability. The official \nOutcome Document adopted by the conference participants entitled ``The \nFuture We Want'' highlights the role of private companies, the private \nsector--and their close collaboration with governments--in driving \nsustainable development. It reads in part:\n\n       We acknowledge that the implementation of sustainable \n     development will depend on active engagement of both the \n     public and private sectors. We recognize that the active \n     participation of the private sector can contribute to the \n     achievement of sustainable development, including through the \n     important tool of public-private partnerships.\n\n  A number of Rio+20's corporate participants have stepped forward to \naccept this challenge. Many of those global businesses are recognizing \nthat greening their operations is not just good for the environment, it \nis good for their business as well.\n  Dell, for example, has committed to reducing its worldwide \nfacilities' greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2015. Dell is a \ncomputer technology corporation based in Texas that ranks 44th on the \nFortune 500 and employs over 106,000 people. I doubt they made that \ndecision rashly.\n  Bank of America, based in Charlotte, NC, is number 13 on the 2012 \nFortune 500 list and was the first bank to offer coast-to-coast \noperations in the United States. They have committed $50 billion over \n10 years to finance Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy and Energy \nAccess, and other activities that advance the low-carbon economy.\n  Marriott has displayed both internal and external efforts by \ncommitting to build 10 Fairfield by Marriott hotels constructed to \nsustainable building standards; as well, pledging $500,000 to help \npreserve 1.4 million acres of rainforest in the Juma Reserve in the \nstate of Amazonas, Brazil. Marriott ranks first on the Fortune 500 list \nin the category of the hotel-casinos-resorts industry.\n  Microsoft has committed to going completely carbon neutral, and will \nbe factoring the costs of carbon output into the company's business \noperations in over 100 countries.\n  These companies are just a few examples from the effort that is being \nundertaken in the private sector to meet our responsibilities to \naddress climate change. As leaders in government, we must recognize \nthat the private sector will not, however, be able to halt climate \nchange on its own. But these commitments do signify that action on \nclimate change does not need to come at the expense of economic growth.\n  Governments can--and must--provide incentives for sustainable \nproduction and consumption. Indeed, the Rio+20 Outcome Document goes on \nto say: ``We support national regulatory and policy frameworks that \nenable business and industry to advance sustainable development \ninitiatives taking into account the importance of corporate social \nresponsibility.''\n  As leaders in the public sector, we have the capacity to establish \nthose effective incentives that can leverage billions in private sector \ninvestment into sustainable products and services that support \nenvironmental and social improvements. The constructive role that \ngovernment can play is being recognized not just in capitals around the \nworld but in boardrooms around the world.\n  Yet, unfortunately, here in Washington, the special interests that \ndeny carbon pollution causes global temperatures to rise, that deny \nmelting icecaps destabilize our climate so that, for instance, regions \nface extreme drought--as the Senator from Colorado discussed earlier--\nor outsized precipitation events--that we have seen in my home State of \nRhode Island--those special interests in Washington still have a strong \nhold, and they pretend the jury is still out on climate changes caused \nby carbon pollution. This is, to be perfectly blunt about it, an \noutright falsehood.\n  The fact that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere absorbs heat from the \nSun was discovered at the time of the Civil War--1863. Mr. President, \n1863 was when the Irish scientist John Tyndall determined that carbon \ndioxide and also water vapor trapped more heat in the atmosphere as \ntheir concentrations increased.\n  The 1955 textbook, ``Our Astonishing Atmosphere''--from the year I \nwas born--notes that ``Nearly a century ago''--in 1955--``the scientist \nJohn Tyndall suggested that a fall in the atmospheric carbon dioxide \ncould allow the earth to cool, whereas a rise in carbon dioxide would \nmake it warmer.''\n  So this is not something new. This is not something unusual or \nextraordinary. This is solidly established science.\n  In the early 1900s, it became clear that changes in the amount of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere can account for significant increases \nand decreases in the Earth's annual average temperatures, and that \ncarbon dioxide, released primarily by the burning of coal, would \ncontribute to these changes. Again, this is not new stuff. These \nare well-established scientific principles.\n\n  Let's look at the changes we observe in our changing planet. Over the \nlast 800,000 years, until very recently, the atmosphere has stayed \nwithin a bandwidth of 170 to 300 parts per million of carbon dioxide--\n170 to 300 parts per million. That has been the range for 8,000 \ncenturies. By the way, that is a measurement, not a theory. Scientists \nmeasure historic carbon dioxide concentrations by locating trapped air \nbubbles in the ice of ancient glaciers. So we know by measurement over \ntime what the range has been of our carbon dioxide concentration.\n  What else do we know? Well, we know since the Industrial Revolution, \nwe have burned carbon-rich fuels in measurable and ever-increasing \namounts, and that we are now up to 7 to 8 gigatons each year going into \nour atmosphere. A gigaton, by the way, is a billion--with a ``B''--\nmetric tons. Releasing all this carbon into the atmosphere has, \npredictably, increased the carbon concentration in our atmosphere. That \nshould not be a difficult proposition, that when you are dumping 7 to 8 \nbillion metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere every year, it raises \nthe concentration of carbon in the atmosphere.\n  We now measure those carbon concentrations in the atmosphere. We \nmeasure them climbing. Again, this is a measurement, not a theory. The \npresent concentration exceeds 390 parts per million. Mr. President, \n8,000 centuries between 170 to 300 parts per million, and now we are \nout over that range, as far as 390 parts per million. In the Arctic, we \nhave actually clipped over into 400 parts per million.\n  Here is what the Christian Science Monitor said about this:\n\n       The Arctic is the leading indicator in global warming, both \n     in carbon dioxide in the air and effects, said Pieter Tans, a \n     senior NOAA scientist.\n\n  The Arctic is our leading indicator in global warming, both in terms \nof the carbon dioxide concentration in the air and the effects of that \ncarbon dioxide concentration.\n\n       ``This is the first time the entire Arctic is that high,'' \n     he said.\n       Tans called reaching the 400 number ``depressing,'' and \n     [his colleague Jim] Butler--\n\n  Who is the global monitoring director at the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's Earth System Research Lab in Boulder, CO--\n\n       said it was ``a troubling milestone.''\n       ``It's an important threshold,'' said Carnegie Institution \n     ecologist Chris Field, a scientist who helps lead the Nobel \n     Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ``It \n     is an indication that we're in a different world.''\n\n  ``It is an indication that we're in a different world.''\n  In this article, they make the same point I made a moment ago. I \nquote the article:\n\n       It's been at least 800,000 years--probably more--since \n     Earth saw carbon dioxide levels in the 400s, Butler and other \n     climate scientists said.\n\n  So another thing we do pretty regularly around here in business, in \nthe military, in science, is plotting trajectories. It is something \nthat, frankly, scientists, businesspeople, and military folks do every \nday. There is nothing new here.\n  When you plot the trajectory for our carbon concentration, the \ntrajectory for our carbon pollution predicts 688 parts per million in \nthe year 2095 and 1,097 parts per million in the year 2195. Mr. \nPresident, 688 parts per million in the year 2095, when for 8,000 \ncenturies it has been between 170 and 300 parts per million. So 8,000 \ncenturies at 170 to 300 parts per million, and by the end of this \ncentury: 688 parts per million.\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\n  To put that 800,000-year figure in perspective, mankind has engaged \nin agriculture for maybe 10,000 years, maybe a little more. Mr. \nPresident, 800,000 years ago, it is not clear we had yet figured out \nhow to make a fire. Millions of years ago goes back into geologic time. \nThose carbon concentrations--688 parts per million, 1,097 parts per \nmillion--those are carbon concentrations that we have not seen in \nmillions of years on the surface of the Earth. And we are headed for \nthem in just a century and a half--two centuries.\n  As Tyndall determined at the time of the Civil War, increasing carbon \nconcentrations will absorb more of the Sun's heat and raise global \ntemperatures, and experience around the world is proving that is taking \nplace in front of our faces in undeniable ways.\n  We think often of climate change as happening to our atmosphere, and \nwe think of its effects on our lands because we are land-based \ncreatures. But let me talk for a moment about our oceans.\n  In April of this year, a group of scientific experts came together to \ndiscuss the current state of our oceans. Their workshop report stated \nthis:\n\n       Human actions have resulted in warming and acidification of \n     the oceans and are now causing increased hypoxia.\n\n  Hypoxia is when there is not enough oxygen trapped in the ocean to \nsustain life of the creatures that live in the ocean.\n\n       Studies of the Earth's past indicate that these are the \n     three symptoms--\n\n  Warming, acidification and increased hypoxia--\n\n     associated with each of previous five mass extinctions on \n     Earth.\n\n  We experienced two mass ocean extinctions 55 million years ago and \n251 million years ago. Last year, a paleobiologist at Brown University, \nwhose name is Jessica Whiteside, published a study demonstrating that \nit took 8 million years after that earlier extinction--the one 251 \nmillion years ago--it took 8 million years after that for plant and \nanimal diversity to return to preextinction levels. So that was a \npretty heavy-duty wipeout if it took 8 millions years to recover.\n  Here is the tough part. In the lead-up to these past mass ocean \nextinctions, scientists have estimated that the Earth was emitting \ncarbon into the atmosphere at a rate of 2.2 gigatons per year for the \nearlier extinction, and somewhere between 1 and 2 gigatons per year for \nthe second extinction over several thousand years.\n  Remember how much are we releasing now--7 to 8 gigatons a year. So \n2.2 and somewhere between 1 and 2 were the levels that led to those \nmass extinctions in geologic time, and we are now at 7 to 8 gigatons a \nyear.\n  As the group of Oxford scientists noted, both of these estimates, the \nones for how much was being released in those geologic times, are \ndwarfed in comparison to today's emission. Our oceans are indeed \nchanging before our very eyes, and anyone who spends time on the oceans \nor who studies the oceans knows this. The oceans are rising. The oceans \nare swept by more violent storms. The oceans are getting more acid, \naffecting already the creatures at the bottom of the food chain, upon \nwhich ocean life depends.\n  It is very hard for a creature to succeed in an environment in which \nit is becoming soluble. That is what is happening as our oceans \nacidify, and the small basic creatures at the very bottom of the food \nchain that live by making their shells can no longer make shells \nsuccessfully because the water is too acidic.\n  In the Arctic, we see unprecedented icemelt. The caps are shrinking. \nEvery day it seems we hear about a new record being broken, a new loss \nof ice cover in the Arctic. In the tropics, we see coral dying. In some \nplaces, 80 percent of the coral is gone. I have been to places I can \nremember live and lively coral reefs, and now we go back and the coral \nis still there, but it is dead. It is like an abandoned building. Fish \ncan swim around in it, but it is not the fountain of life that a coral \nreef is supposed to be.\n  There is a garbage gyre in the Pacific that is estimated to be larger \nthan the size of the State of Texas in which enormous amounts of the \nplastics we discard are being swept and floating.\n  We have whales that are poisoned to the point where if they come \nashore in Rhode Island on a summer day, if they are hurt or get washed \nashore because they are injured, we often end up with whale cadavers in \nthe summers on our coast. When that happens, it is reasonably likely \nthat whale is toxic waste; that if we towed the body back out to the \nocean to let it sink and let nature take its course, we would be \nviolating our clean water laws by disposing of toxic waste. If we \ncranked that whale's body up into the back of a truck and took it to \nthe town dump and chucked it, we would be violating the hazardous waste \ndisposal laws of the State of Rhode Island because we have put so much \npoison into the ocean that creatures such as whales that live at the \ntop of the food chain have now become so infiltrated with these poisons \nthat they are now swimming toxic waste.\n  Around here we like to think pretty highly of ourselves. But the laws \nof physics, the laws of chemistry, the laws of science, these are laws \nof nature. These are laws of God's Earth. We can repeal some laws \naround here; we cannot repeal those. Senators are used to our opinions \nmattering around here. These laws are not affected by our opinions. For \nthese laws of nature, because we can neither repeal them nor influence \nthem, we bear a duty of stewardship, of responsibility to future \ngenerations to see and respond to the facts that are before our faces \nand to see and respond to those facts according to nature's laws.\n  There is no lobbyist so powerful, there is no secret special interest \nso wealthy that it can change the operation of those laws. What they \nhave done is to change the operation of our laws, inhibited our ability \nto meet our duty to respond to the laws of our God-given Earth. We do \nindeed bear a duty to make the right decisions for our children and \ngrandchildren and our God-given Earth. right now we are failing, \nshamefully failing, in that duty. We are deluded if we think that \nsomehow we will be spared the plain and foreseeable consequences of our \nfailure to act. Some may hope they will find a wizard's hat and wand \nwith which to wish all this away. That is not rational thinking. If we \nhave a simple obligation to our children and to future generations, it \nis to be rational human beings and to make rational decisions based on \nthe evidence and the laws of nature. These laws of nature are known. \nEarth's message to us is clear. Our failure is blameworthy. Its \nconsequences are profound, and the costs will be very high.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Alaska who actually brought a \nwonderful scientist from the University of Alaska who gave one of the \nbetter presentations on ocean acidification that I have ever seen as \npart of our Oceans Caucus.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                                  EPA\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have had an opportunity to listen to \na few moments of the comments from my colleague from Rhode Island. I \nclearly share his passion and concern for the oceans. We have been \nworking together as the cochairmen of the Oceans Caucus in the Senate \nand have had the opportunity to learn from one another on both ends of \nthe country about the significant responsibilities we have, also the \ngreat challenges we have, whether it is ocean acidification, whether it \nis the opportunities we have to ensure that we are good stewards of our \nwater, our land, our air.\n  It is a challenge I think we face on a daily basis. But I think as we \nrise to meet these challenges, we recognize that oftentimes within the \nlaws that we have put in place to provide for that level of protection, \nfor that level of oversight and that stewardship, that we may encounter \nconflict, conflict with the obligation we also have to ensure that the \npeople we represent have an opportunity for good jobs, for a livelihood \nin a region they call home, that there is a level of balance that we \nfind between our obligation to care for the land, the air, the water, \nas well as caring for one another.\n  It is in that vein that I would like to address my comments this \nafternoon. I would like to speak about certain aspects of what we see \nwithin the Environmental Protection Agency and speak specifically to an \nissue that is\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\nunfolding in my State of Alaska. Clearly, the EPA has important \nresponsibilities to set and also enforce environmental standards. I \nthink we would all agree with that. In the 40 years since EPA was \nestablished, our Nation has made dramatic progress in restoring and \npreserving our environmental resources. I am grateful. I am proud to \nlive in a nation with high environmental standards for the benefit of \nthe land and for the people.\n  But the process for setting Federal environmental standards, I would \nsuggest, is broken. We are seeing things present themselves not only in \nmy State but around the country. We see in Alaska, day in and day out, \nthat things are not working perhaps as they were designed. So many \nAlaskans feel the EPA does not ``get'' Alaska.\n  But the challenges I think we see up North are just examples of many \nof the problems we see repeated all over the Nation. I would suggest \nthat what we need to see is balance, balance restored at the EPA. There \nhas always been a recognition that the EPA must go about its work in a \nbalanced way.\n  Back in 1970, there was a memo called the Ash memo, and it listed the \norigin of the EPA. They stated it this way:\n\n       Sound environmental administration must reconcile divergent \n     interests and serve the total public constituency. It must \n     appreciate and take fully into account competing social and \n     economic claims.\n\n  In recent years, EPA has not adequately, let alone fully, taken into \naccount these so-called competing claims such as the genuine welfare of \nour people and their economic needs. EPA says--and I have had many a \nconversation with Administrator Jackson in person and before committee, \nwhere the statements are made that there is a concern about \nenvironmental justice for communities that are historically \nunderrepresented in EPA decisionmaking. The fact is, many of these \ncommunities are very frequently the ones that bear the brunt of \nregressive increases in, for instance in my State, energy and in living \ncosts that are caused by some of these rules we are facing.\n  When I go home, when I meet with people from around the country, I \nhear more complaints, more concerns expressed about the EPA than any \nother Federal agency, bar none. Again and again, I am told the benefits \nof many of the EPA requirements are uncertain at best but that the cost \nof the regulations are very real, and they are detrimental to the human \nwelfare.\n  Today, EPA often seems too eager to impose requirements that are \ndubious in their health or their environmental benefits but whose main \neffect may be to penalize or to perhaps even stop commerce or \ndevelopment. So restoring an appropriate equilibrium is vital if we \nwant to have a healthy people, if we want to have a healthy economy.\n  Today, I would like to speak to one example from my State. There is \nas it relates to ECA. ECA is a reference to the Emissions Control \nArea. The EPA was a major proponent of including the ocean off southern \nand southeastern Alaska in an international emissions control area. \nThis was an effort to reduce emissions from marine vessels through \nlowering sulfur standards within the fuel.\n\n  The purpose of the emissions control areas is to require ships--\nwhich, to be very fair, certainly have significant emissions--to do \ntheir part to curb pollution. This is absolutely reasonable. The \nproblem we are seeing up north is that EPA never gathered any air \nmodeling data to support the claim that we have a problem from ships \nthat travel up to Alaska. There has been no air modeling data \nwhatsoever. We have requested. There has been none. Moreover, one of \nthe proposals advanced to work with the EPA--and we need to be working \nwith our agencies, as we need our agencies to be working with us--was \nan offer for an equivalent method to comply with the ECA requirements \nin North America. We are the only State in the country that is not \naccessible by road. Folks come and visit us by air and they come in by \nship in the summertime. Tourism is big business in Alaska. In Juneau, \nthe ships that are tied up at the docks are utilizing shoreside \nservices so there are no emissions when they are in the community. So \none of the proposals that was out there--this equivalency method--would \nessentially ask for a tradeoff. If we have cruise ships emitting \nnothing when they are in dock or at shore, offset that against those \nthat would be emitted from vessels out at sea, essentially an \naveraging. That was rejected by the EPA.\n  What has made this particularly disconcerting for many Alaskans is \nthat in the EPA's justification they cite a U.S. Forest Service study \nthat purportedly found some evidence that emissions from cruise ships \nin southeast Alaska could impact the lichen in the mountains above \nJuneau. We can see the mountains up here in this chart. They are pretty \nhigh. There is lichen up on the top. It is kind of a short, mossy, \ngreen plant. The report went on to worry that if we have impacted \nlichen growth in Juneau, it could somehow or other harm the caribou.\n  Never mind the link that lichen and cruise ship emissions may be very \ntenuous, there is a bigger problem with EPA's reasoning, and anybody \nfrom Alaska would know the problem, which is there are no caribou in \nJuneau, AK. There are no caribou anywhere in southeastern Alaska. \nEveryone has seen my pictures before. Alaska is a pretty big State. If \nwe are sitting in Juneau, AK, the caribou herd this report was \napparently concerned about is over 1,000 miles away. There are about \n1,000 miles between Juneau and where the southern Alaska Peninsula \ncaribou herd cited in the EPA study live--1,000 miles. It would be as \nif we would make the assertion a cruise ship sitting in Miami might \nsomehow affect the food supply for bears up in the Pocono Mountains \nnorth of Philadelphia, PA.\n  I think we need to look at this and recognize we have a pretty flawed \nstudy to begin with, if the suggestion is we need to ensure there are \nno emissions coming from a cruise ship in Juneau because that is going \nto impact the lichen which will impact the caribou that don't happen to \nlive anywhere near Juneau--no closer than 1,000 miles away. So applying \nthese new fuel standards to save the lichen in Juneau to feed caribou \n1,000 miles from here will mean vessels plying the waters of southeast \nand south central Alaska--whether they are freight vessels that move \njust about all our goods or cruise ships that are the lifeblood of our \ntourist economy--will have to meet the requirement they now burn low-\nsulfur diesel at levels suggested that are, perhaps, not attainable.\n  The question I think is fair to ask is: What is the problem with \nrequiring these cruise ships and these vessels bringing goods north to \nAlaska to meet these standards? What is the problem with this \nrequirement?\n  The problem is while these ECA requirements may not have a measurable \npositive effect on human health--or caribou food, for that matter--they \nwill have a material impact on our cost of living. Look at the State of \nAlaska and the way we get our materials in, the way we get our \nfoodstuffs, our hardware, our lumber. It comes to us over the water. \nThere is some, yes, that comes in by airplane, but guaranteed that is \ngoing to cost much more. There are some that can come up from the lower \n48 across through Canada and into Alaska that way. But if we want to \ntalk about increased emissions, that is surely one way to do it, to put \nit on a truck and haul it all the way up here.\n  So much of our goods come to the State by water. About 85 percent of \nthe goods that come to the State of Alaska come into the Port of \nAnchorage, which is sitting right there.\n  What we see with these ECA regs is that ships coming out of a port \nsuch as Los Angeles or Long Beach--where my colleague from California \nhails from, and she is here on the floor now--have hundreds of ships \ncoming in and out every day, but they are not subject to this same \nemissions control area. They only need to burn this expensive low-\nsulfur fuel for a very short time until they are out of the ECA. The \nproblem is, when traveling along Alaska's coast to bring those goods up \nto our State, you are in an area where our air is pretty clean--our air \nis very pristine--but the entire voyage is within this ECA region. It \nis all within this emissions control area. So throughout that entire \njourney they are required to burn the lower sulfur, more expensive \nfuel.\n  If this were just going to result in an increase in cost to the \ncruise lines or to the freight haulers that come up to the State, that \nmight be one thing, but\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\nI think we recognize the economic reality that every dime that is added \nto the cost of doing business in Alaska is ultimately going to be a \ndime passed on and shared by consumers.\n  The State of Alaska recently cited an estimate that these new \nrequirements will increase the shipping costs to the State of Alaska by \n8 percent. One might say: Eight percent, that is not that bad. We can \nlive with that. But the problem we face is that in 2015, just around \nthe corner, we will see an even higher standard these vessels will be \nheld to. At that point in time, the suggestion is that costs could be \nincreased by as much as 25 percent. That may be on the high margin, but \nlet's say somewhere between 8 and 25 percent. Again, almost every \ncommodity consumed in our State is transported either by ship or by \nship and plane, with the cost of freight adding a significant increase \nto every item out there.\n  We are already one of the most expensive places to live in America, \nand rural Alaska is even more expensive. I check on a weekly basis to \nfind out what Alaskans are paying for their fuel, whether it is in the \ncity of Anchorage or up in Fairbanks or out in Kwethluk or in the \nvillages. I monitor that regularly to see how our villages are faring. \nIn Kotzebue, for instance, this week they are paying about $7.15 for a \ngallon of gas. I asked that we put a link on our Web site to get some \npricing on what we are seeing in our communities as it relates to \nfoodstuffs, things you and I would use in our home here. Here is a \npackage most of us recognize. A 10-pound bag of sugar in Kwethluk is \ngoing for $17.25. There is no other store in Kwethluk, other than the \nNative store, so it is not as if they can go to the Safeway and \ncomparison shop. It is not as if they can get in their car and drive to \nthe city or go to Costco. It just doesn't happen. There are no roads in \nand out of Kwethluk. You might be able to take an airplane.\n\n  A gallon of whole milk costs $30 in Ambler, that is if you can find \nwhole milk or any kind of fresh milk. As a mom who has boys who go \nthrough laundry, I am always looking to see what people are paying for \nlaundry detergent. In Venetie, a 100-ounce bottle of Tide goes for \n$43.50. I had my interns do a little price comparison on Tide. Powdered \nTide, 56 ounces, in Anchorage we are paying $9.98. That is a little \nhigher than here in Washington. Washington is about nine bucks. But in \nAngoon that same box of Tide is $18.33. In Barrow it is $22. In McGrath \nit is $21. In Bethel it is $21.\n  So when we talk about increasing the prices in Alaska by 8 percent, \n10 percent, 12 percent, possibly 25 percent and you are a mom buying a \nbox of Tide and you are already paying $43, believe me, 8 percent \nstarts to add up real quick. When you are trying to buy a bag of sugar \nso you can make the food, put up the jam for the winter, and you are \npaying $17.25 in Kwethluk, I think it is fair to say we are paying \nattention to what happens when there are cost increases.\n  EPA mandated low-sulfur fuel is estimated to add $100 million in \nadditional cost to the summer cruise traffic in Alaska. So one might \nsay, if you can afford the price of a cruise, that is not that big of a \ndeal. You increase the price of the ticket and people will live. But \nwhat happens is that puts Alaska at a competitive disadvantage when we \nare talking about where these businesses are going to operate. Fourteen \npercent of all employment in the State is directly tied to the tourism \nindustry. So if the cruise lines can't fully pass on these increased \ncosts, what they are going to do is move their ships. They will take \nthem to other parts of the world where air quality standards are \ndifferent, and we will have the loss of seasonal visitors. The money \nthey bring to southeastern Alaska is a huge part of the local economy \nand also to year-round institutions. In Juneau, our regional hospital \nis actually able to provide for a higher standard of care, in part, \nbecause of the high influx of patients it serves during the summertime.\n  I would suggest the EPA's one-size-fits-all approach to environmental \nregulation doesn't always work. We can't quite shoehorn that into in \nall situations, and we need to be aware of that. Again, when we talk \nabout the concept of environmental justice, we need to make sure when \nregulations and rules are imposed, we are not hurting the most \nvulnerable. I would suggest the people in Kwethluk, who are looking at \nthe impact of these regulations and what it is going to mean to them \nand their village, they are asking: How do we survive? How do we live? \nThe answer isn't for them to move to Washington, DC. That is not the \nanswer. We need to get back to balance.\n  What is happening now is the State of Alaska has sued the EPA \nAdministrator in Federal Court to stop the new requirements from taking \neffect. Given the immediacy of the threat these requirements pose to my \nState, I think the State's move to advance the litigation was the right \none. But we shouldn't have to sue our own government in order to get \nbalanced regulation.\n  Administrator Lisa Jackson has recently acknowledged that applying \nECA to Alaska has posed a problem. She recognized that. Unfortunately, \nwe haven't seen anything more beyond those words, and we are still no \ncloser to a solution. These new requirements are set to take effect \nnext week, the initial threshold. I have been raising this issue with \nEPA for several years, but again we are still working and we have not \nyet resolved it. I have called on the President himself to marshal the \nState Department to see if ECA can be amended or some other relief can \nbe found to eliminate at least this one burden.\n  This is something that is touching Alaskans in a very immediate and a \nvery direct way. Again, we want to ensure our air is clean, that our \nwater is clean. We want to be the good custodians and stewards of our \nland, and we are. But we need to be able to work with our Federal \nregulators. I have asked the Administrator and I have asked the \nPresident to work with us on this.\n\n\n                            Ted Stevens Day\n\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague from California is here to speak, \nbut I would like the indulgence of the body for just 2 more minutes to \nspeak on a little bit of a happy occasion.\n\n\n                            Ted Stevens Day\n\n  Mr. President, the day after tomorrow, on Saturday, Alaskans are \ngoing to be celebrating Ted Stevens Day. As I travel around the State, \nwhether I am in Fairbanks or down on the Kenai River or up in Bethel, \ndown in Ketchikan, everywhere I go, I am reminded of my good friend and \na friend to so many in this body, Senator Ted Stevens.\n  It was nearly 2 years ago now that we lost Uncle Ted to the tragic \nplane crash in southwest Alaska. But as tragic as that was, I always \nstop to remember that that tragedy struck while Ted was doing what he \nloved to do most, which was enjoying Alaska's great outdoors and going \nfishing, just being outdoors. His passion for Alaska's unique \nwilderness, his love for fishing, and his immense affection for the \noutdoors really embodies the spirit we are now advancing in Ted Stevens \nDay, and the motto of this day is ``Get Out and Play.''\n  On the fourth Saturday of July, we join together to celebrate the \nlife and the legacy of a man who was really dedicated to public \nservice, whether it was his days as a pilot in World War II, to the \nfour decades he served with us here in the Senate.\n  He began working in Alaska long before statehood. When he came here \nto Washington, DC, to represent us in the Senate, he began a battle for \nour State that lasted for 40 years. He fought for roads, for buildings, \nand for infrastructure that new, young States need, as well as many of \nthe programs that are in place today that continue on. He worked to \ntransform not only Alaska but really the rest of the country as well.\n  It is somewhat coincidental that this Ted Stevens Day coincides with \nthe beginning of the 2012 summer Olympic games in London. So as \nAlaskans get together to get out and play this weekend under the \nmidnight sun, there are going to be 530 American athletes who will \nbegin to embark on a 17-day Olympic journey Senator Stevens helped to \npioneer. It is because of legislation he championed that the Olympic \nmovement in the United States exists as it does today.\n  Back in 1978, he fought for the passage of the Olympic and Amateur \nSports Act. This was later renamed the ``Ted Stevens Olympic and \nAmateur Sports Act'' in his honor and declared\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\nthe U.S. Olympic Committee the centralized body of all Olympic \nactivities in the country and ultimately led to the creation of \nnational governing bodies responsible for the oversight of each \nindividual Olympic sport--a structure that is still in place now. He \nreally was so much an inspiration to the progress and to the \ndevelopment of the Olympic movement here in the United States. Earlier \nthis month, the U.S. Olympic Committee honored Senator Stevens as a \nspecial contributor in the Class of 2012 U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame.\n  We all know Senator Stevens was also a huge proponent of title IX. I \nthink he would be very proud that for the first time in American \nhistory, Team USA is comprised of more women than men. I think that \nwould give him a smile. But this feat was made possible by the landmark \nlegislation passed 40 years ago that opened gymnasium doors and leveled \nthe playing field for women and girls across the country.\n  In Alaska, we very often say that Ted Stevens was larger than life. \nToday, in discussing this and bringing this up, we recognize that on \nSaturday we are going to continue a tradition of remembering a man who \nloved Alaska with a passion. As we go out and bike and hike and fish, I \nthink many will share good memories of an amazing Alaskan, an amazing \nman, and truly an amazing American.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak a few \nminutes about a subject which should, hopefully, bring a smile to many \nof us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Cybersecurity \nAct of 2012. I assume that bill is in order and on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed is pending.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor as the chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee to, in my own way, indicate the seriousness \nof the job we are about to begin. I know there is controversy. I know \nthere are differences of opinion. But what people have to understand is \nthat we have breach after breach now, and they have become far more \nnumerous, much more sophisticated, and much more insidious in recent \nyears.\n  I want to give a number of examples of what is happening out there in \nthe real world, and let me begin by going back to 2008, when the \nPentagon's classified military computer networks suffered a \n``significant compromise.'' That is according to former Deputy \nSecretary Bill Lynn in 2010. These breaches are usually classified at \nthe time they happen; therefore, people don't know about them. So all I \nam going to do is run through unclassified breaches, and even that is \nbeyond comprehension. Former Secretary Lynn also detailed that foreign \nhackers stole 24,000 U.S. military files in a single attack on a \ndefense contractor in March 2011.\n  In the 5 months from October 2011 through February 2012, over 50,000 \ncyber attacks were reported on private and governmental networks, with \n86 of those attacks taking place on critical infrastructure networks. \nNow, that is according to the bipartisan Policy Center's Cybersecurity \nTask Force. Fifty thousand incidents were the ones that were reported \nto the Department of Homeland Security, so they represent only a small \nfraction of the cyber attacks carried out against the United States.\n  In December 2011, press reports revealed that the networks of the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce were completely penetrated for more than a \nyear by hackers. The hackers apparently had access to everything in \nChamber computers, including member company communications and industry \npositions on U.S. trade policies.\n  In March 2011, NASA's Inspector General reported that cyber attacks \nsuccessfully compromised NASA computers. In one attack, intruders stole \n150 user credentials that could be used to gain unauthorized access to \nNASA systems.\n  Another attack at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory that involved China-\nbased Internet Protocol addresses let the intruders gain full access to \nkey JPL systems and sensitive user accounts.\n  Forty-eight companies in the chemical, defense, and other industries \nwere penetrated during 2011 for at least 6 months by a hacker looking \nfor intellectual property. The cybersecurity company Symantec \nattributes some of these attacks to computers in Hebei, China.\n  It became worldwide news when Google alleged in April of 2011 that \nChina had compromised hundreds of Gmail passwords for e-mail accounts \nof prominent people, including senior U.S. officials.\n  On March 17, 2011, RSA publicly disclosed that it had detected a very \nsophisticated cyber attack on its systems in an attempt to obtain data \nthat would compromise RSA's authenticated log-in technology. The data \nacquired was then used in an attempt to penetrate Lockheed Martin's \nnetworks.\n  Between March 2010 and April 2011, the FBI identified 20 incidents in \nwhich the online banking credentials of small to medium-sized U.S. \nbusinesses were compromised and used to initiate wire transfers to \nChinese economic and trade companies. As of April 2011, the total \nattempted fraud amounts to approximately $20 million, and the \nactual victim losses are $11 million.\n\n  In October 2010, hackers penetrated the systems of NASDAQ, which \nsparked concerns about the severity of the cyber threat facing the \nfinancial industry.\n  In January 2011, a hacker extracted $6.7 million from South Africa's \nPostbank over the New Year's holiday.\n  In January 2011, hackers penetrated the European Union's carbon \ntrading market, which allows organizations to buy and sell their carbon \nemissions quotas, and stole more than $7 million in credits, forcing \nthe market to shut down temporarily.\n  An international computer-crime ring, broken up in October 2010, \nsiphoned about $70 million in a hacking operation targeting bank \naccounts of small businesses, municipalities, and churches, according \nto the FBI.\n  In November 2008, hackers breached networks at Royal Bank of \nScotland's WorldPay, allowing them to clone 100 ATM cards and withdraw \nover $9 million from machines in 49 cities.\n  In December 2008, retail giant TJX was hacked. The one hacker \ncaptured and convicted, named Maksym Yastremskiy, is said to have made \n$11 million from the hack.\n  In August 2008, computer networks in Georgia were hacked by unknown \nforeign intruders, most likely at the behest of the Russian Government \nbecause they were coordinated with Russian military actions against \nGeorgia.\n  In May 2007, Estonian Government networks were harassed by a denial-\nof-service attack by unknown foreign intruders, most likely again at \nthe behest of the Russian Government because they were part of the \nworst dispute between the two countries since the collapse of the \nSoviet Union.\n  So, as you can see from some of the examples above, for years now, \nthe United States and other countries have been at the receiving end of \nmultiple, concerted efforts by nation-states and non-state actors to \nhack into our networks. These bad actors are infiltrating our \ncommunications, accessing our secrets, and sapping our economic health \nby stealing intellectual property. They may also be building a \ncapability, if necessary in the future, to wage cyber war. We may not \neven know until the attack has been launched.\n\n  These attacks are sophisticated, and involve hacking techniques that \nwe unfortunately now see quite often. Cyber attacks can come in the \nform of viruses and worms, malicious backdoors, logic bombs, and \ndenial-of-service attacks, just to name a few.\n  A groundbreaking unclassified report from November of last year \npublished by the Intelligence Community said cyber intrusions against \nU.S. companies cost billions of dollars annually. The report named \nChina and Russia as aggressive cyber thieves.\n  On China, the report said: ``Chinese actors are the world's most \nactive and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage.'' We know \nthat sophisticated attacks from China against financial and technology \ncompanies, such as Google, resulted in property theft on a massive \nscale. Billions of dollars of trade secrets, technology, and \nintellectual property are being siphoned each year from the United \nStates to benefit the economies of China and other countries.\n  On Russia, the report said: ``Russia's intelligence services are \nconducting a\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\nrange of activities to collect economic information and technology from \nU.S. targets.'' I can assure everyone that the classified assessments \nare far more descriptive and far more devastating.\n  The examples above are bad enough, but cyber threats are evolving, \nand I am very concerned that the next wave will come in the form of \ncrippling intrusions against the computers that control powerplants, \ndams, transportation hubs, and financial networks in these United \nStates.\n  We have already seen the use of cyber attacks in warfare, when \nhackers inside Russia reportedly took down the command and control \nsystems in Estonia in 2007. That was 5 years ago, roughly a lifetime in \nthe realm of cyber attack capability.\n  Senior national security experts from across the political spectrum \nhave sounded the alarm about this threat. For Example, Leon Panetta, at \nhis confirmation hearing to be Secretary of Defense, said:\n\n       The next Pearl Harbor we confront could very well be a \n     cyber attack that cripples our power system, our grid, our \n     security systems, our financial systems, our governmental \n     systems.\n\n  Bob Mueller, Director of the FBI, testified before the Senate \nIntelligence Committee that ``the cyber threat, which cuts across all \nprograms, will be the number one threat to our country.'' We are \ndealing with the No. 1 threat to the country.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Cybersecurity Act of \n2012 with Senators Lieberman, Collins, Rockefeller, and Carper. I wish \nto thank them for their tireless work on this legislation over the past \nseveral years.\n  This act has seven titles. Each of them addresses a key gap in our \nNation's cyber laws. I wish to take a moment to describe the critical \ninfrastructure provisions in Title I, but I wish to focus most of my \nremarks on the information-sharing part of the bill, which makes up \nTitle VII.\n  Title I covers Critical Infrastructure Protection, which means \nprotecting the public and private infrastructure that underpin our \neconomy and our way of life--a big deal. A cyber attack against these \nnetworks could open a dam, crash our financial system, or disable the \nelectric grid. It could stop all planes and interrupt the FAA--on and \non and on.\n  Although some critical infrastructure companies have taken action to \nprotect their networks, too many of them have not. It appears that \nmarket forces are insufficient for many critical infrastructure \ncompanies to adopt adequate cybersecurity practices. Thus, Title I of \nthis bill would create strong incentives for companies to work with the \nFederal Government to establish standards for critical infrastructure \nprotection.\n  Let me be candid. Even though the bill makes cybersecurity standards \nvoluntary, I know many Senators still resist this idea. I do not. I \nwould have preferred that this bill include its original critical \ninfrastructure provisions, which would have mandated baseline standards \nfor cybersecurity. But I recognize we have to compromise. I recognize \nthis legislation is a necessary first step to provide some security, \nand that compromise to the voluntary measures in this bill was \nnecessary. So we have done it. I hope if and when we see a major cyber \nattack against the power grid, or Wall Street, or a major dam, we won't \nsee this compromise as a mistake.\n  Other Senators have spoken at length about critical infrastructure \nand other parts of the bill, so let me move to Title VII, regarding \ninformation sharing. This is the part the Intelligence Committee has \nhad something to do with. This title--at least 40 pages of the bill--\ncovers authorities and protections for sharing information about \nthreats to cybersecurity. The information-sharing title addresses one \nof the main problems I heard from both the private sector and the \ngovernment about existing laws and business practices when it comes to \ncyber: that private sector companies and the government know a lot \nabout the cyber attacks against their networks, but this information is \nso stovepiped that no one is as well protected as they could be if the \ninformation were shared. That, I believe, is fact.\n  As the Bipartisan Policy Center's Cyber Security Task Force recently \nfound:\n\n       Despite general agreement that we need to do it, cyber \n     information sharing is not meeting our needs today.\n\n  Title VII addresses this problem. It reduces the legal barriers that \nhamper a private entity's ability to work with others and the Federal \nGovernment to share cybersecurity threat information.\n  How do we do this? What does that title do specifically? First, it \nexplicitly authorizes companies to monitor and defend their own \nnetworks.\n  Many companies monitor and defend their own networks today in order \nto protect themselves and their customers. But we have heard from \nnumerous companies that the law in this area is unclear, and that \nsometimes it is less risky, from a liability perspective, for them to \nallow attacks to happen than to take additional steps to defend \nthemselves. Can you imagine that? So we make the law clear by giving \ncompanies explicit authority to monitor and defend their own networks.\n  Secondly, the bill authorizes the sharing of cyber threat information \namong private companies. There have been concerns that anti-trust laws \nprevent companies from cooperating on cyber defense. This bill, in \nsection 702, clearly says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any private \n     entity may disclose lawfully obtained cybersecurity threat \n     indicators to any other private entity in accordance with \n     this section.\n\n  Third, the bill authorizes the government, which will largely mean \n(in practice) the Intelligence Community--I hope the DNI--to share \nclassified information about cyber threats with appropriately cleared \norganizations outside of the government.\n  Traditionally, only government employees and contractors have been \neligible to receive security clearances, and therefore to gain access \nto national secrets. To put it another way, those with a valid ``need \nto know'' most security secrets are within the government.\n\n  That isn't true, though, for cybersecurity. In this case, we cannot \nrestrict classified information tightly within government--the \ncompanies that underpin our Nation's economy and way of life have a \n``need to know'' about the nature of cyber attacks so they can better \nsecure their systems.\n  It is not sufficient for the government to be able to defend itself \nagainst an attack. It is also necessary for companies such as Google, \nor an institution such as NASDAQ, to be able to protect themselves and \nto use all possible defenses that we can help provide to them.\n  Under this bill, companies are able to qualify to receive classified \ninformation. They will be certified and then able to obtain classified \ninformation about what cyber threats to look out for.\n  Fourth, the bill establishes a system through which any private \nsector entity--whether a power utility, a defense contractor, a telecom \ncompany, or others--can share cyber threat information with the \ngovernment.\n  When it comes to cyber, information sharing must be a two-way street. \nOftentimes, the private sector has important information about cyber \nintrusions that the government doesn't possess. After all, the private \nsector is the one on the frontlines of incoming cyber assault, so \ncompanies are often best able to understand the attack.\n  The private sector should be able to share that information with the \ngovernment so that the government can protect itself and fulfill its \nresponsibility to warn others about the threat. So let me describe how \nthis bill allows for and encourages that information sharing, and most \nimportantly, let me describe the liability protections that companies \nreceive for doing so.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney \nGeneral, the Secretary of Defense, and the Director of National \nIntelligence, would designate one or more Federal cybersecurity \nexchanges. We envision that these exchanges would be an existing \nentity, such as one of the existing Federal cybersecurity centers.\n  Private companies would share cyber threat information with these \nexchanges directly. These exchanges must be civilian entities, which is \nimportant to a number of Senators. They will have procedures in place \nto share that information as quickly as possible\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\nwith other parts of the government. The information is protected from \ndisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. It cannot be used in a \nregulatory enforcement action.\n  This exchange would serve as a focal point for information sharing \nwith the government. Having a single focal point would establish a \nsingle point of contact for the private sector. Otherwise we would have \nchaos. Some people want multiple points. It is difficult to do and \nstill maintain the security that is necessary.\n  We think this approach solves the problem. Having a single focal \npoint is also more efficient for the government. It would help \neliminate stovepipes, because right now there are dozens of different \nparts of the government receiving information from the private sector \nabout cyber threats they are encountering. It is all over the map. It \nwould also make privacy and civil liberties oversight easier, which I \nknow interests you, Mr. President. I will describe that in a moment.\n  Finally, it should save taxpayers money, because it is more efficient \nto manage--and that has to be a concern--and oversee the operation of \none entity versus many entities.\n  Let me now describe the all-important liability protections that are \nsuch a critical part of this.\n  Section 706 of the bill provides liability protection for the \nvoluntary sharing of cyber threat information with the Federal \nexchange.\n  The bill reads:\n\n       No civil or criminal cause of action shall lie or be \n     maintained in any Federal or State court against any entity \n     [that means a company] acting as authorized by this title, \n     and any such action shall be dismissed promptly for . . . the \n     voluntary disclosure of a lawfully obtained cybersecurity \n     threat indicator to a cybersecurity exchange.\n\n  That is section 706(a). It is clear as a bell. In other words, a \ncompany is immune from lawsuit over sharing cyber threat information \nwith a Federal exchange. The same immunity applies to the following: \ncompanies that monitor their own networks; cybersecurity companies that \nshare threat information with their customers; companies that share \ninformation with a critical infrastructure owner or operator; and \ncompanies that share threat information with other companies, as long \nas they also share that information with the Federal exchange within a \nreasonable time. This ``reasonable, good faith'' defense is also \navailable for the use of defensive countermeasures.\n  If a company shared information in a way other than the five ways I \nhave just mentioned, it still receives a legal defense under this bill \nfrom suit if the company can make a reasonable, good-faith showing that \nthe information-sharing provisions permitted that sharing.\n  Further, no civil or criminal cause of action can be brought against \na company, an officer, an employee, or an agency of a company for the \nreasonable failure to act on information received through information-\nsharing mechanisms set up by this bill.\n  Basically--and this is important; please listen--the only way anyone \nparticipating in the information-sharing system can be held liable is \nif they were found to have knowingly violated a provision of the bill \nor acted in gross negligence.\n  So there are very strong liability protections for anyone who shares \ninformation about cyber threats--which is completely voluntary--under \nthis bill.\n  Now, what information will be shared with the exchange? Information \nthat should be shared includes--but is not limited to--malware threat \nsignatures, known malicious Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses, and \nimmediate cyber attack incident details.\n  The exchanges would be able to share this information in as close to \nreal time as possible over networks. That is the only way for the \nprivate sector and the government to stay a step ahead of our cyber \nadversaries.\n  What kind of information can they share? We define this information \nin our bill as ``cybersecurity threat indicators.'' We define this term \nto include only information that is ``reasonably necessary'' to \ndescribe the technical attributes of cyber attacks. This is not a \nlicense for the government to take in and distribute private citizens' \ninformation. Rather, it is narrowly tailored to cover information that \nrelates specifically to a cyber attack.\n  In addition to narrowly defining what information can be shared with \nan exchange, our bill also requires the Federal Government to adopt a \nvery robust privacy and civil liberties oversight regime for \ninformation shared under this title. There are multiple layers of \noversight from different parts of the Executive Branch, including the \nDepartment of Justice, the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board, as well as the Congress. I wish to direct Members to \nthe privacy and civil liberties protections on pages 185 through 192 of \nthis bill for the litany of procedures, reviews, and reports that are \nrequired.\n  We have worked closely with several Senators, including the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Franken, and Senators Durbin, Coons, Akaka, \nBlumenthal, and Sanders on these protections, and I really thank them \nall for their efforts in that regard. I think my colleagues have really \nhelped the bill become a better bill.\n  I would also be remiss if I didn't show my great appreciation of the \nwork and leadership of the majority leader for his unrelenting focus on \ngetting this bill to the floor and making time to have this debate. It \nis infinitely better having this debate now rather than after a major \ncyber attack. My greatest worry is that we wouldn't pass something.\n  The perfect cannot be the enemy of the good. This legislation is \nunprecedented. It will take some steps. We will find other steps we \nwill need to take. We will need to come back to it and come back to it \nbecause technology is moving so quickly.\n  I think this is as important a bill as I have seen in my 20 years in \nthe Senate. I know what is out there. I know what some other countries \nare doing. I know what some bad actors are doing. The time has come to \nprotect ourselves and take some action.\n  I hope we will have the support, and I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Honoring Ambassadors to Pakistan and Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am here today to express my sincere \nappreciation and thanks and admiration to a number of our distinguished \nForeign Service officers who were similarly lauded by Senator McCain \nearlier today. I heard his remarks, and I wish to be associated with \nthem.\n  I wish to express my thanks to three very brave and able men who have \nserved this country under the most demanding and difficult conditions, \nrequiring huge personal courage as well as insight and strong action. \nThey are Ryan Crocker, who has served as Ambassador to Afghanistan; his \ndeputy who will replace him shortly, James Cunningham; and our \nAmbassador to Pakistan, Cameron Munter. What they share and what they \nhave given us in these two critical posts is the best of our Nation's \npublic service and foreign service.\n  I had occasion to meet both Ambassador Crocker and Ambassador \nCunningham on a number of visits to Afghanistan and to be briefed by \nboth of them, so I know personally how extraordinarily honest and \nforthright they are in the insight and intelligence they give to \ncongressional visitors. And many of us have been among those visitors \nand many of us have met with them, so I know others have had that \nexperience as well. I know them both to be extremely capable and \nintelligent, thoughtful, and insightful. They understand the \ncomplexities of this region, and they have succeeded in maintaining \nstrong relationships with our partners in Afghanistan and Pakistan to \nthe extent they were able to do so amid the most complex and \nchallenging circumstances.\n\n  Somehow, in between all of the challenges they faced on the ground \nday to day, they also welcomed congressional visitors with \nextraordinary grace and\n\n[[Page S5466]]\n\ngraciousness and generosity. I was proud to be one of them in visiting \nboth Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n  I wish to recognize particularly the efforts of Ambassador Munter in \naddressing the supply chain of IED--improvised explosive device--\ningredients, the fertilizer and other chemicals that compose the \nroadside bombs that have literally caused more than half of our \nNation's casualties in Afghanistan. Those ingredients are smuggled, \nsometimes in broad daylight, across the border from Pakistan. He has \nworked hard and made a valuable contribution in challenging the \nGovernment of Pakistan to do better, and to confront the threat and to \nensure interagency coordination between the Department of State and the \nDepartment of Defense in confronting and attacking the IED network. He \nhas written to me personally, and I thank him for his commitment to a \ncause that others have also made a priority, including Dr. Ashton \nCarter, presently Deputy Secretary of Defense. Together, we worked on \nthis issue and made progress, but so much more must be done to stop the \nflow of IED bomb-making material across the border which does such \nhorrific, destructive damage to our troops. One need only visit the \nBethesda Naval Center to see it firsthand. Our hearts go out to the \nyoung men--principally men--and women and their families who are \nvictims of these bombs. Thank you to Ambassador Munter for making it a \npriority.\n  I thank Ambassador Crocker likewise for working on this problem as he \nled the Embassy in Kabul through profoundly and deeply challenging \ntimes. When we here in Washington revise our policy toward Afghanistan \nand as we go through those revisions now, he has adopted and he has \ncarried out policies, and he has served well our national interests, \neven in the midst of change and challenge.\n  I welcome Deputy Ambassador Cunningham to his new post. I have worked \nand been briefed by him. I, in fact, stayed with him in the Embassy. I \nhave seen his keen insight, his quiet, understated manner, and his \nstrength and will.\n  Indeed, all of these men are men of intellect, but they are also men \nof action, committed to delivering results to the Nation. They are men \nof loyalty and courage.\n  I will just finish on this note. Nobody should underestimate the \ncourage that is required to serve in these positions. Anyone who has \nvisited these countries knows the threat of physical danger is ever-\npresent not only to the brave men and women who serve in uniform in our \nArmed Forces but to our diplomats who every day put their lives on the \nline to serve us. So I thank not only them but the thousands of men and \nwomen who have served with them in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, and in \nother countries, at postings in places whose names most Americans can \nbarely pronounce. They have demonstrated the kind of bravery that \nAmbassadors Crocker, Munter, and Cunningham have every day. They \ndeserve our thanks and our good wishes as they leave their present \nposts--as Ambassador Crocker retires--and our good wishes for continued \nsuccess for the sake of their lives and for the sake of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Guns In America\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I, like everyone else in America, have \nfollowed the terrible tragedy in Aurora, CO. Just awful. I was \nparticularly moved when I read in one of our local papers the bios of \nthe 12 who had died. So many of them were young, in the prime of life, \nin their late teens and early twenties. So many of them were brave, \nprotecting others--a child, a girlfriend, a friend. I was so upset on \nreading this, seeing these people's lives snuffed out, just as they had \ngreat futures ahead of them--for nothing.\n  It was the same kind of feeling I had after the World Trade Center--\nof course, magnified by much more because so many more people died, and \nI actually knew some of the people who died. But the same senseless \nkilling of innocent people occurred.\n  Of course, in the days after the tragedy, and as the dust settled--it \nwill never settle for the families whom my heart goes out to--we began \nour usual discussion about guns in America, and there were many voices \non all different sides.\n  As somebody who has been very involved in these issues, I gave it \nsome thought and wanted to share with my colleagues and with my \nconstituents and my country some thoughts about this.\n  The question that comes up is: Can we do anything about guns in \nsociety? Of course, many would ask: Should we do anything about guns in \nsociety? Even the very thoughtful and erudite member of my own party, \nthe Governor of Colorado, said a ban on weapons would not have stopped \nthis tragedy from occurring, in all likelihood.\n  So I wish to share some of my thoughts briefly.\n  The bottom line is, maybe we can come together once and for all on \nthe issue of guns if each side gave some. I have thought about this for \na while.\n  As you know, Mr. President, I was the House author--the leader, of \ncourse, was my colleague from California--of the assault weapons ban. I \nam even prouder of the Brady law, where I was probably the leader, and \nthat has saved so many lives.\n  So the question is: When we were able to pass those kinds of \ngroundbreaking laws, why are we so paralyzed now?\n  Part of the reason--and this has not been mentioned--is that crime \nhas actually decreased dramatically in America for a whole lot of \nreasons. I probably do not share the views of some of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle as to why it happened. I am a pretty-tough-on-\ncrime guy. But when crime went down, the broad middle that wanted to do \nwhatever it took to stop crime--I remember how it ravaged my city--\nstopped caring as much because they were safer. That is logical. So \nthey sort of exited the field. Law enforcement, which had been some of \nour best allies in supporting the assault weapons ban and the Brady \nlaw, sort of left the debate. The debate was simply left to those who \ncared the most, a very small number on the side of more active laws \nagainst gun control and a much larger number on the side of those who \nwere opposed.\n  I know you read in the newspapers: the power of money and the NRA. I \nhave to say this, as somebody who has opposed the NRA and has been \nwritten up regularly in their magazines in not the most flattering way, \nthe NRA's main strength is because they have 2, 3, 4 million people who \ncare passionately about this issue, who may not care about other \nissues, and who are mobilized at the drop of a hat. So when there is a \nbill on the floor of the Senate which a majority of Americans may \nsupport--a majority of Americans support the ban on assault weapons--\neven people in my State like New York hear much more from the people \nwho are opposed to the assault weapons ban than the people who are for \nit. Now, 20 years ago, that would not have happened, again, because I \nthink, more than any other reason, crime was so ravaging our \ncommunities that average folks would call and complain and worry about \ntoo many guns in society, which I think there still are now.\n  In any case, given that situation, which exists, that the activists, \nthe people who care about this issue the most--not the majority of \npeople--are on the side of no limitations or few limitations on guns, \nhow can we address that balance?\n  I think there can be a balance. Those on my side who believe strongly \nin some controls on guns have to acknowledge that there is a right to \nbear arms. It perplexed many in the pro-gun movement how liberals would \nread the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth amendments as broadly as \npossible, but when it came to the second amendment, they saw it through \na pinhole--it only related to militias, which, frankly, is a narrow, \nnarrow, narrow reading of the second amendment.\n  There were many back then in the 1980s and 1990s in the pro-gun \ncontrol movement who basically felt there was no right to bear arms. I \nthink in part, because of that, those on the other side of the issue \nbecame kind of extreme themselves. Their worry was that the\n\n[[Page S5467]]\n\nreal goal of the left was not simply to have rational, if you will, \nlaws that might limit the use of guns--what guns could be had, how many \nclips, who could have them; criminals, the mentally infirm--but, \nrather, that was just a smokescreen to get rid of guns. And there was \nenough evidence back in the 1980s and 1990s that people actually wanted \nto do that.\n  So if you look at the ads from the NRA and the groups even farther \nover, the gun owners of America, their basic complaint is that the \nChuck Schumers of the world want to take away your gun, even if it is \nthe hunting rifle your Uncle Willie gave you when you were 14.\n  I think it would be very important for those of us who are for gun \ncontrol--some rational laws on guns--to make it clear once and for all \nthat is not our goal, to make it clear that the belief is that the \nsecond amendment does matter, that there is a right to bear arms, just \nlike there is a right to free speech and others, and if you are an \naverage, normal American citizen, you have the right to bear arms.\n  I think if the people who are pro-gun and from the more rural areas, \nand different than Brooklyn, the city I am from, were convinced that \nthere was a broad consensus even in the pro-gun control movement that \nthere was a right to bear arms, they might get off their haunches a \nlittle bit. I think that is important for this part of the compromise. \nSo the Heller decision, which basically said that--and now is the law \nof the land, but was not until a few years ago--should not be something \nthat is opposed by those who are for rational laws on guns.\n\n  I saw that even the Brady organization, that I have worked very \nclosely with--Jim and Sarah Brady helped us pass the assault weapons \nban and the Brady law; I have worked with them closely and have known \nthem for decades--but even the Brady organization, which in the past \nhad not had that position, is now beginning to embrace it. I think that \nis for the good, and I think people should know that.\n  Once we establish that it is in the Constitution, it is part of the \nAmerican way of life--even though some do not like that--but once we \nestablish that basic paradigm: that no one wants to abolish guns for \neverybody or only allow a limited few to have them under the most \nlimited circumstances--this is on a national level--then maybe we can \nbegin the other side of the dialog.\n  The other side of the dialog is, once you know no one is going to \ntake away your gun, if you are not a felon--your shotgun that you like \nto go hunting with or a sidearm if you are a store owner in a crime-\nridden area--we can then say to those on the other side: OK. We \nunderstand that it is unfair to read the second amendment so narrowly \nand read all the other amendments so broadly, and you have seen us as \ndoing that. But, in response, we would say, and I would say, that no \namendment is absolute, and whether it is in reaction to what happened \nin the 1980s and the 1990s or because of fanaticism, or for maybe \nfundraising reasons, it seems that too many on the pro-gun side believe \nthe second amendment is as absolute, or more absolute, than all the \nother amendments. They are taking the converse position to what I \nmentioned before--the left seeing the second amendment as minuscule, \nbut the right seeing the second amendment as broader than every other \namendment.\n  Certainly, the right believes in antipornography laws. That is a \nlimitation on the first amendment. Certainly, most people in America \nbelieve what--I think it was Oliver Wendell Holmes or Louis D. Brandeis \nwho said: You cannot falsely scream ``fire'' in a crowded theater. \nThat, too, was a limitation on the first amendment.\n  Every amendment is a balancing test. That is what the Constitution \nhas said.\n  No amendment is absolute or our society would be tied in a complete \nknot. And so we say to our colleagues, this is not a partisan issue \ncompletely. There are some Republicans who are for gun control and some \nDemocrats who oppose it completely. It seems to be more of a regional \nissue than almost an ideological issue. But we would say to our \ncolleagues from the pro-gun side of things, look, there is a right to \nbear arms. We are not trying to take guns away from people we do not \nhave any reason to take them away from. But you have to then admit that \nyou cannot be so rigid, so doctrinaire that there should be no \nlimitation on the second amendment.\n  The Brady law is a reasonable limitation on the second amendment, \nsaying that felons or the mentally infirm or spousal abusers should not \nhave a gun. The Heller decision acknowledged that those kinds of \nreasonable limitations did not violate the second amendment, just as \nthe Court has recognized they are limitations that do not violate the \nfirst amendment, all because it is a balancing test.\n  So I would argue--and we can all find the balance in different ways--\nnot only is the Brady law a reasonable limitation on the second \namendment, it is not interfering with the average person's right to \nbear arms, but neither are the assault weapons. I know there was an \nargument between my colleague from California, with whom I agree, and \nmy colleague from Wisconsin, with whom I do not agree: An AR-15 is used \nfor hunting. But I have heard people say you should be able to buy a \nbazooka or a tank. My view is, the assault weapons ban that was passed, \nwhich was a rather modest bill, was less important in saving lives than \nthe Brady law by many degrees. But I would argue it is a reasonable \nthing to do. A limitation that says you should not be able buy a \nmagazine that holds 1,000 rounds, that is a reasonable thing to do. \nRules that say we should be able to trace where a gun originated so we \ncan find those who are violating some of these limitations such as the \nBrady law--gun shops that do not check your background even though they \nare required to by law--is a reasonable thing to do. Again, we can \ndebate where to draw the line of reasonableness.\n  But we might, might, might--and I do not want to be too optimistic \nhere, having years and years of having gone through this--but we might \nbe able to come to an agreement in the middle where we say, yes, there \nis a right to bear arms, and, yes, there can be reasonable limitations \non the second amendment just as there can be on others.\n  That is the place I suggest we try to go. Maybe, maybe, we can break \nthrough the hard ideological lines that have been drawn on this issue. \nMaybe, maybe, maybe we can tell those who are at the extremes on the \nfar right and the far left that we disagree with you. And maybe, maybe, \nmaybe we could pass some laws that might, might, might stop some of the \nunnecessary tragedies that have occurred, or, at the very least, when \nyou have someone who is mentally infirm, such as the shooter in Aurora, \nlimit the damage they are able to do. Maybe.\n  But I would suggest the place to start here is for us to admit there \nis a right to bear arms, admit the Heller decision has a place in the \nConstitution, just like decisions that supported the other amendments, \nand at the same time say that does not mean that right is absolute. \nThat is just a suggestion. I have been thinking about this since I read \nthose horrible articles about those young men and women being killed. I \nwould welcome comments, particularly from my colleagues on the other \nside of this issue, whether they be Democrat or Republican, on those \nthoughts.\n  Just as we have fought over and over and over again on so many \nissues, and we have gotten into our corners--there may be none that we \nhave gotten into our corners on more than on gun control. Maybe it is \ntime, as on those other issues, to come out of the corners and try, \npeople of good will, who will disagree and come from different parts of \nthe country with different needs, maybe there is a way we can come \ntogether and try and try to break through the logjam and make the \ncountry a better place.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am proud that the 19th biennial \nInternational AIDS conference is being held in the Nation's Capital \nafter 22 years of being held abroad.\n  President Obama was instrumental in bringing the conference back to \nthe United States by announcing in October 2009 that the United States \nwould lift its entry restriction on people living with HIV.\n  The United States has been the leader in combating the scourge of \nHIV/AIDS, and it is fitting that this significant meeting of the best \nand brightest scientists, philanthropists, activists, government \nleaders, and people living with HIV/AIDS is taking place in Washington, \nDC.\n  It is made even more symbolic by the fact that Washington, DC, has \nthe highest rate of AIDS than any city in the Nation.\n  As we look to ``Turn the Tide Together,'' as the theme of the \nconference indicates, we must continue to support a number of long-term \nstrategies both at home and around the world, building on the successes \nwe have seen in the past few decades.\n  Significant scientific breakthroughs have been made this year alone, \nand we can see investments we have made to fight HIV/AIDS beginning to \npay off.\n  The National Institutes of Health, for example, released a study last \nfall on the HPTN 052 clinical trial that showed that if newly infected \nindividuals started antiretroviral treatment when their immune systems \nare relatively healthy, they are 96 percent less likely to transmit the \nvirus to their uninfected partner.\n  Others report that the cost of treating HIV is four times less than \npreviously thought. And now more than ever, scientists believe that an \neffective HIV vaccine is within reach.\n  These are amazing breakthroughs and could reflect the beginning of \nthe end as we work toward an AIDS-free generation.\n  This past year new infection rates and AIDS deaths decreased. Twenty \npercent more people had access to antiretroviral therapy worldwide in \n2011 than they did in 2010.\n  These numbers don't appear out of thin air--they correlate to \nincreased investments from the United States and the Global Fund. This \nis a time when we must continue funding our investments to fight HIV/\nAIDS.\n  But let's talk about how we have achieved these amazing results.\n  President Bush was instrumental in establishing PEPFAR. The \nPresident's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief was initially a $15 billion \ncommitment over 5 years to fight the AIDS pandemic.\n  Today, PEPFAR is one of the largest health initiatives ever \nestablished by a single country and remains critical to saving millions \nof lives.\n  PEPFAR is a strongly bipartisan program, and since its inception, it \nhas directly supported nearly 13 million people with access to care and \nservices.\n  As of 2011, the United States supported lifesaving antiretroviral \ntreatment for more than 3.9 million men, women, and children worldwide.\n  PEPFAR counseled 9.8 million pregnant women to test them for HIV/\nAIDS, allowing more than 200,000 babies to be born AIDS-free.\n  Another key ally in the fight against AIDS is the Global Fund.\n  The Global Fund was established in 2002 as a public-private \npartnership, requiring the buy-in of grant recipient countries. These \nparticipants must commit to continuing the program and serving its \npeople after the Global Fund grant expires.\n  This novel approach has proved wildly successful. To date, the Global \nFund has supported more than 1,000 programs in 151 countries and \nprovided AIDS treatment to over 3 million people.\n  The United States must continue to be a leading supporter of the \nGlobal Fund.\n  The generosity of the American people has improved and saved lives, \nstemmed the spread of HIV/AIDS, and provided medicine, hospitals, and \nclinics to those who are infected.\n  Together, PEPFAR and the Global Fund have built health care systems \nwhere none existed before and allowed individuals infected with HIV/\nAIDS to dream of a future.\n  These programs also ensure that the countries we are working in play \na part in helping their own people survive and thrive.\n  While we have made significant progress in combating HIV/AIDS, we \ncannot be complacent.\n  Here in the Nation's Capital, the AIDS rate is higher than in some \nSub-Saharan African countries, and infection rates are even growing in \nsome demographics.\n  In Illinois, 37,000 individuals are living with AIDS, with 80 percent \nof them residing in Chicago.\n  Internationally, the gains that we have made could easily be lost; \nthe increase of infections in Southeast Asia, Russia, and the Ukraine--\nplaces that have historically had low infection rates is alarming.\n  If we lose our focus or if international donors stop contributing to \nkey programs, we lose out on the momentum built in recent years to \ncombat this disease.\n  That is why it is good that this administration continues to push for \nan AIDS-free generation.\n  Secretary Clinton announced three new efforts during this week's \nconference: $15 million in implementation research to identify specific \ninterventions, $20 million for a challenge fund to support country-led \nefforts to expand services, and $2 million through the Robert Carr \nCivil Society Network Fund to bolster civil society groups.\n  Secretary Clinton also noted: ``Creating an AIDS-free generation \ntakes more than the right tools, as important as they are. Ultimately, \nit's about people--the people who have the most to contribute to this \ngoal and the most to gain from it.'' She is right.\n  Creating an AIDS-free generation is about working together to help \nsave and improve lives. It is about supporting the individuals and \ncommunities that have already made great inroads in addressing this \nepidemic.\n  By reaffirming our leadership to initiatives such as PEPFAR and the \nGlobal Fund, which support these individuals and communities, we can \ncontinue to make a difference. Only then can we truly wish to usher in \nan AIDS-free generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5468-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5468-S5469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OUR SHARED COMMITMENT TO FIGHT HIV/AIDS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic, the tremendous progress we have made thus far, and the need \nto do even more if we are going to stop this devastating disease in its \ntracks.\n  The fight against HIV/AIDS has been a long one. In more than 30 \nyears, approximately 26 million people have died from AIDS, and there \nare still an astounding 7,000 new infections every day. But our \ncommitment to combating this disease is making important strides.\n  In the past decade, new HIV infections fell 20 percent, thanks in \nlarge part to the lifesaving antiretroviral treatment we and our \npartners are making available in every corner of the world that AIDS \ntouches.\n  We know that relatively healthy people with HIV who receive early \ntreatment with antiretroviral drugs are 96 percent less likely to pass \non the virus to their uninfected partners. So treating these \nindividuals not only allows them to live their lives in dignity but is \nalso an important key to prevention.\n  In my home State of Maryland, the Jhpiego program has spent decades \naddressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South America, Africa, Europe and \nAsia. Jhpiego has made enormous strides in prevention of mother-to-\nchild transmission, increasing counseling and testing and providing \ngreater access to antiretroviral drugs.\n  Jhpiego has integrated HIV/AIDS services with tuberculosis, cervical \ncancer, malaria in pregnancy, family planning and maternal and child \nhealth services, to address the problem of coinfection among HIV/AIDS \npatients and to reach as many people as possible. These integrated \nservices represent the future of our health assistance. We have learned \nfrom programs like Jhpiego's what our best practices should be so that \nwe are innovators in prevention, care, and treatment.\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\n  I am pleased that Jhpiego and groups like it from across the globe \nare coming together for this week's AIDS 2012 conference in Washington, \nDC. This conference is the largest gathering of professionals working \nin the field of HIV in the world and will bring together more than \n20,000 people from more than 120 counties all working together to \ncreate a blueprint for combating HIV/AIDS. I can only imagine the \nexciting new synergies that will develop when so many innovative, \ncommitted individuals are in the same room.\n  Among the presenters are luminaries from the public, private, and \nmultilateral sectors such as President Bill Clinton, U.S. Secretary of \nState Hillary Rodham Clinton, and former U.S. First Lady Laura Bush, \nHer Highness Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway, World Bank \nPresident Jim Yong Kim, UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidib, Sir \nElton John, Whoopi Goldberg, and Bill Gates.\n  This is the first time the United States has hosted the conference in \ntwo decades, and I believe it is the right moment for us to be \nshowcasing our strong bipartisan effort to bring the AIDS epidemic to \nan end.\n  The United States has long been a leader in the global fight against \nHIV/AIDS. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on \nInternational Development Assistance, I am proud to note that from 2004 \nto 2010 the United States spent more than $26 billion on bilateral \nfunding to fight AIDS. From my experience leading this subcommittee, I \nknow that dedicated government experts from an array of U.S. agencies \nare involved in the fight, as are thousands of nonprofits and community \norganizations.\n  Yet despite the progress that the numbers and statistics tell us, the \nstory on the ground is still heartbreaking, and now is not the time to \nrest on our laurels. International anti-AIDS funding has not increased \nsignificantly since 2008. In places like the Congo, for example, \ndoctors are only able to supply antiretroviral drugs to 15 percent of \nthe people who need them. Globally, just 8 million of the 15 million \ntreatment-eligible patients in AIDS-ravaged poor regions of the world \nare getting antiretroviral drugs.\n  We must do better. We must do better to improve the lives of people \nliving with HIV/AIDS, and we must do better to save the lives of their \nloved ones.\n  Some experts believe that ``fatigue and forgetting'' are two of the \nreasons we have not reached more people. Though we have been working on \ntreating this disease for decades, we still have an overwhelming number \nof infections to treat.\n  But the good news is that scientists now believe we have the tools to \nmake serious progress in the fight against AIDS. Scientific advances \nover the last year have been remarkable, and we can't afford to abandon \nthe fight and to lose momentum now.\n  In a recent Washington Post article, Michel Sidibe, Executive \nDirector of UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV and AIDS, \nsaid, ``The previous generation fought for treatment, our generation \nmust fight for a cure.''\n  I am proud that in just the last year, the National Institutes of \nHealth has increased spending on cure-related research by $56 million. \nThis is a step in the right direction, and I want to see us do more. I \nstand with the entire HIV/AIDS medical community in renewing the call \nto prevent, treat, and cure HIV/AIDS. Let's use the opportunity of this \nhistoric gathering to renew our call to work on creating an AIDS-free \ngeneration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5469-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5469-S5470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          2012 OLYMPICS GAMES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow evening, hundreds of athletes \nfrom across the world will gather in London for the opening ceremonies \nof the 2012 Summer Olympic games.\n  Among those marching in the Parade of Nations will be 20 athletes \nfrom Illinois.\n  Making his Olympic debut in the 100-meter butterfly is Tyler McGill, \na native of Champaign. After turning in the second-fastest time in the \nworld this year at the U.S. Olympic trials, Tyler will be swimming for \na spot at the top of the podium in London.\n  Lake Forest native and Northwestern Wildcat Matt Grevers is already \nan Olympic Gold-medalist as a member of the two winning relay teams in \nBeijing. This year, he'll be swimming for individual Gold--and maybe a \nworld record--in the 100-meter backstroke.\n  As the son of an All-American, swimming is in Conor Dwyer's blood. \nAfter achieving personal bests in every event in which he competed at \nthe trials, the Winnetka native will compete in the 400-meter freestyle \nas well as a relay at his first Olympic games.\n  Star diver Christina Loukas was born in Riverwoods, where she began \nswimming and diving at an early age. Although she moved away from \nIllinois after high school, Christina remained a Cubs fan and returns \nto Chicago often.\n  Chatham's Kelci Bryant will join Christina on the women's diving team \nas she competes in the 3-meter synchronized diving event. Already a \ntwo-time NCAA champion, this will also be Kelci's second Olympics.\n  Algonquin runner Evan Jager won four Illinois State titles in cross-\ncountry and track, but he will be competing in a relatively new sport \nfor him--the steeplechase--at this year's Olympics. He qualified for \nthe team after just a few years training for the grueling event.\n  Chicago's track and field star Wallace Spearmon, Jr., will be looking \nfor vindication this year in the men's 200-meters--a high-pressured \nsprint that will include many of the fastest runners of all time.\n  Dawn Harper, who hails from my own hometown of East St. Louis, will \nbe defending her 2008 Olympic Gold Medal in the 100-meter hurdles in \nLondon. She won in Beijing in a thrilling upset and with a personal \nbest time, making her the one to beat in this year's games.\n  Member of the Fighting Illini and All-American Gia Lewis-Smallwood \nmade her first international team in 2011 after competing in the discus \nfor 11 years. She remained in Champaign after graduating, where she not \nonly trains but also volunteers at the nearby YWCA and with Parkland \nCommunity College.\n  Competing in the men's discus event will be Lance Brooks, a New \nBerlin high school graduate who attended Decatur's Millikin University, \nwhere he played for the men's basketball team.\n  Growing up in Itasca, Sarah Zelenka tried swimming, soccer, \nvolleyball, and basketball. But it wasn't until she went to college \nthat this naturally gifted athlete found her sport: rowing. She has \nsince won gold at the Rowing World Cup and World Championships and will \nbe looking to add an Olympic medal to that collection in London.\n  Rowing twins Grant and Ross James have competed next to each other \ntheir entire lives and share their biggest fan--their mom. After Ross \ncaptured the final seat on the eight-man boat going to London, the \ntwins learned that they had fulfilled their lifelong dream of competing \nnext to each other at the Olympics.\n  At 6 feet 9 inches, Sean Rooney is a natural for the sport of \nvolleyball. He was named Illinois' Player of the Year in 2001 when he \nled his high school team, Wheaton-Warrenville South, to an Illinois \nState championship. He competed in his first Olympics in Beijing, where \nhe helped Team USA to a gold medal. He will help them defend that title \nthis year.\n  Bob Willis grew up in Chicago and learned to sail on beautiful Lake \nMichigan. After qualifying for the Olympic games, he returned briefly \nto Chicago before leaving for London, where ``the first water [his] \nOlympic board touched was Lake Michigan water.''\n  Greco-Roman wrestler Ellis Coleman grew up in Chicago's Humboldt Park \nand joined the wrestling team as a way to stay out of trouble in a \nrough neighborhood. His signature move is an impressive leap called the \nFlying Squirrel, which he may employ as he wrestles to win Olympic Gold \nthis year in London.\n  Growing up in Naperville, Candace Parker was a devoted Chicago Bulls \nfan. So it wasn't surprising when she began to play basketball herself, \nleading her high school team to multiple Illinois State championships \nand becoming the first female high school player to dunk a basketball \nin a sanctioned game. She has been a member of the USA Basketball \nWomen's National Team since 2009 and helped win Gold for the United \nStates at the Beijing Olympics.\n  Swin Cash will join her on the women's basketball team. Swin was \ndrafted\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\ninto the WNBA after leading her college team to an undefeated 39 to 0 \nseason and her second national championship. She now plays for the \nChicago Sky.\n  Born and raised in Springfield, basketball swingman Andre Iguodala \nwill represent the United States on the 2012 Dream Team, or Dream Team \nThree. His jersey number is now retired at Lanphier High School, where \nhe was both a star student and athlete.\n  Star defender on the women's soccer team, Amy LePeilbet grew up in \nCrystal Lake. Her high school coach at Prairie Ridge remembers her not \nonly for her athleticism but for her work ethic and persistence. She \nwill compete as a member of the U.S. women's soccer team in London.\n  Each of these athletes has arrived in London as a result of years of \nperseverance and hard work. They have woken up in the dark for early \nmorning practices and endured aching muscles and sore limbs. They have \narrived early and stayed late, spending hours at the gym, on the field, \nor in the pool training for this moment and their Olympic dream.\n  I congratulate the athletes from Illinois and every athlete \nrepresenting his or her country at these Olympic games. I look forward \nto watching them over the coming weeks as they compete for Olympic \nGold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5470-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           2012 OLYMPIC GAMES\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored on the opening day of the \n2012 London Olympics to congratulate our U.S. Olympic and Paralympic \nTeams. Proudly, 16 of our top Olympian athletes hail from Connecticut, \nincluding 6 women, who played for our legendary University of \nConnecticut women's teams and will represent our State and Nation as \nmembers of the U.S. women's basketball team.\n  These athletes will make history on a global stage, representing the \nUnited States and sharing personal stories that fuel their drive to \nwin. They have this momentous opportunity and responsibility because \nthey have worked hard, demonstrated unremitting character and \nintegrity, and believed in the power of athletic excellence to bring \nour nation and the world together.\n  Six extraordinary UConn alumni will compete as members of the 2012 \nU.S. women's basketball team: Sue Bird, Swin Cash, Tina Charles, Asjha \nJones, Maya Moore, and Diana Taurasi. All six players brought UConn \nteams to national championships during their college careers. The head \ncoach of the U.S. Olympic team, Geno Auriemma, has led the University \nof Connecticut teams through many exciting seasons while serving as a \ntremendous role model and mentor. Both Asjha Jones and Tina Charles \ncurrently live in Uncasville and play for the Connecticut Sun. Although \nthe others may no longer list Connecticut as their formal residence, \nthese players remain a part of our lives.\n  Charlie Cole, Ken Jurkowski, Nick LaCava, Sara Hendershot, and Sarah \nTrowbridge will compete in London as members of our U.S. rowing team. \nMr. Cole grew up in New Canaan, CT, and attended New Canaan High School \nand Yale University where he rowed for the heavyweight team. He has \nreceived many national and international titles, including most \nrecently winning the pair at the 2012 National Selection Regatta number \n1 and finishing fourth in the four at the 2011 World Rowing \nChampionships. He has been named USRowing's 2011 Athlete of the Year.\n  Mr. Jurkowski was raised in New Fairfield and attended New Fairfield \nHigh School and Cornell University, where he walked onto the team his \nfreshman year, competed all 4 years, and graduated with a degree in \nbiological engineering. He has also served as a volunteer assistant \ncoach for the University of Texas women's rowing team. In London, he \nwill compete in the single sculls event an event that he placed 11th in \nduring the 2008 Beijing games.\n  Mr. LaCava is from Weston, CT, and attended Phillips Exeter Academy \nand Columbia University. Among other distinctions, he placed fifth in \nthe lightweight eight at the 2011World Rowing Championships and placed \nfirst at the lightweight eight at the 2011 Head of the Charles Regatta. \nIn London, he will compete in the men's lightweight four.\n  Ms. Hendershot grew up in West Simsbury Connecticut, only starting to \nrow in 2003 as a high school freshman. Already by 2004 and again in \n2005, she won the open eight at the USRowing National Championships. \nShe rowed for Princeton University and graduated in 2010. She will \ncompete in the Women's Pair in London with Sarah Zelenka of Illinois.\n  Ms. Trowbridge was born in Washington, DC, and is a member of the \nPotomac Boat Club. She was raised in Guilford, CT, and attended \nGuilford High School. She rowed at University of Michigan on a \nscholarship. Most recently among her international and national \nresults, she finished ninth in the double sculls at the 2011 World \nRowing Championships and won the double sculls at the 2011 National \nSelection Regatta No. 2. She cites her parents, coaches, teammates, and \nOlympic hero, Nadia Comaneci, as inspirations. She will compete in the \nWomen's Double Sculls event.\n  Craig Kinsley and Donn Cabral will represent the United States in \ntrack and field. Hailing from Fairfield, CT, Mr. Kinsley brings his \nexperience at high jump and javelin at Fairfield Preparatory High \nSchool and Brown University to the international arena. He won the NCAA \ntitle in the javelin event in 2010 and in the same year was named \nAcademic All-American and Northeast Region Field Athlete of the Year by \nthe U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association. At \nBrown University, he studied geology and economics.\n  Mr. Cabral was born and raised in Glastonbury, CT. He attended \nPrinceton University, where he received All-American titles in track \nand field and cross country, and in 2012 won the NCAA title and set the \nU.S. collegiate record in the steeplechase event. He will compete in \nthe Men's 3000M steeplechase this Olympic games.\n  Rob Crane will hit the water in sailing. Born in Stamford and raised \nin Darien, he went on to attend the Holderness School and Hobart \nCollege. He continues a family legacy of sailing, joining the ranks of \nhis mother and father, who won world and North American championships, \nrespectively. In 2011, he finished 14th in the International Sailing \nAssociation and Federal's Sailing World Championships. This Olympics, \nhe will participate in the men's singlehanded laser dinghy sailing \nevent.\n  In addition to the successes of these 10 accomplished and inspiring \nathletes, I wish to recognize all around the world poised to \nparticipate in the USA Paralympics. Guided by the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee's Paralympic Military, Veteran, and Community Program, State \nand local communities have developed important programs to enable \nindividuals with physical or visual disabilities to participate and \ncompete in sports. The growing prevalence of community level sports \nclubs, such as the paralympic sports clubs, offers disabled Americans \nthe opportunity to come together as a community, share their love of \nsports, and rally around each other.\n  Our American competitors are inspirational to athletes and \nnonathletes of all generations. Athletics and sportsmanship connect us, \nreaching the core of our humanity. They represent our hopes, dreams, \nand aspirations. They serve as national and international diplomats, \nworking together as a team to best represent our country. Along with my \nSenate colleagues, I wish our athletes from Connecticut and around the \nNation the best of luck and thank them for their incredible public \nservice as leaders during these Olympic games.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5470-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5470-S5471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EXTENSION OF THE FISA AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Last week, the Judiciary Committee considered S.3276, a \nbill reauthorizing the surveillance provisions of the FISA Amendments \nAct of 2008, which is set to expire at the end of this year. The \nDirector of National Intelligence and the Attorney General have both \nstated that reauthorization of these important national security \nauthorities is the ``top legislative priority of the Intelligence \nCommunity.''\n  After the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported its \nreauthorization bill, I asked for a sequential referral. Senator \nGrassley joined me in that request. It was for a limited time and had \nwe not completed our markup last Thursday, time might well have expired \nfor this committee to act on it. I was surprised last week and since to \nbe criticized for seeking to improve the\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nbill within its four corners. I thought that was why we sought the \nsequential referral, in order to consider and improve the bill where we \ncould.\n  I worked with Senator Feinstein, the chair of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence. We came to an understanding and she supported the \nsubstitute amendment I offered to shorten the sunset and add more \naccountability and oversight protections. I thank her for that. I am \nalways willing to work with the Senator from California, who is so \ndiligent in her efforts on the Intelligence Committee. We reached a \ngood compromise and agreement.\n  I had circulated the core of my amendment, to shorten the sunset, \nback on July 11, before the bill was to be considered. At the request \nof Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, the bill was held \nover. I protected their right to do so under our rules. We finally \nproceeded to the bill last Thursday, July 19. Despite the delay, no \nRepublicans spoke to me about any potential amendments to the bill.\n  Instead, the evening before the delayed markup, for the first time, \nRepublican offices circulated scores of amendments. It is unfortunate \nthat there have been mischaracterizations of our committee process. \nContrary to the statements of some on the other side, no one was \nprecluded from offering an amendment. In fact, a number were offered by \nRepublican Senators. The committee proceeded to vote on Senator Kyl's \namendment, for example, to create a new material support of terrorism \noffense in title 18, and rejected it after Senator Feinstein argued \nagainst including it on this important measure, despite her support for \nthe substance of the amendment. We proceeded to vote on Senator Lee's \namendment, which was about FISA surveillance, and it, too, was \ndefeated. So despite the misstatements to the contrary, the committee \nproceeded to consider and reject amendments.\n  There came a point during our initial 2-hour markup when Senator \nFeinstein urged that amendments about matters not involving the FISA \nAmendments Act extension be considered on other vehicles at other \ntimes, and moved to table amendments. Those motions prevailed. We have \nhad such motions before and sometimes they succeed.\n  After 2 hours, as Republican Senators left, we lost a quorum and had \nto reconvene to vote on reporting the bill as amended to the Senate. I \nthank those Senators from both sides of the aisle who reconvened. The \ncommittee voted to report the measure and was able to do so within the \nshort timeframe of our sequential referral.\n  The FISA Amendments Act legislation is a top priority of the \nadministration and our intelligence community. We have all acknowledged \nthat. The ranking member acknowledged that it is ``a program vital to \nour national security.'' A number of Republicans proclaimed last week \nthat they were ready to expedite consideration of the measure and would \nnot offer amendments. Then, when the committee adopted the June 2015 \nsunset date instead of one of the 2017 dates in other versions of the \nbill, they changed position and sought to use it as a vehicle for \nextraneous matters and to offer a number of riders to it that were \nrejected. I do not understand that logic and why the change in the \nsunset date or the addition of oversight provisions should change the \ncharacter of the bill or its importance to our national security. The \nbill is needed to continue the authority to conduct electronic \nsurveillance of non-U.S. persons overseas under certain procedures \napproved by the FISA Court.\n  The Justice Department and DNI have told us:\n\n       [It] is vital in keeping the Nation safe. It provides \n     information about the plans and identities of terrorists, \n     allowing us to glimpse inside terrorist organizations and \n     obtain information about how those groups function and \n     receive support. In addition, it lets us collect information \n     about the intentions and capabilities of weapons \n     proliferators and other foreign adversaries who threaten the \n     United States. Failure to reauthorize Section 702 would \n     result in a loss of significant intelligence and impede the \n     ability of the intelligence community to respond quickly to \n     new threats and intelligence opportunities.\n\n  The committee agreed with Senator Feinstein when she asked us not to \nopen the bill up to ``extraneous amendments.'' As it was, the committee \nconsidered half a dozen amendments offered by Republican Senators. I \nappreciated Senator Kyl volunteering to have his staff convene a \nmeeting to consider amendments to our terrorist statutes that he does \nnot think will be controversial.\n  Notably, the vast majority of the amendments filed and offered by the \nRepublicans would not have changed or added a single word to either the \nunderlying bill or the underlying statute. Senator Lee's amendment was \nthe only Republican amendment that dealt in any way with the relevant \nFISA authorities. That amendment received an up-or-down vote by the \ncommittee, and most Republican members voted against it.\n  Once it became clear that the Republican Senators intended to offer a \nseries of extraneous amendments, Senator Feinstein moved to table \namendments that were not germane to her bill. She has that right. I \nprotect the rights of all members of the committee, Republicans and \nDemocrats. Four such amendments were tabled, but notably they were \ntabled by a vote of the full committee, not simply through a ruling by \nthe chairman or my making up rules, as Republican chairmen have done in \nthe past. Indeed, although a motion to table is typically not subject \nto debate, I asked the committee's indulgence to permit such \ndiscussion. No Senator was cut off from offering amendments or engaging \nin debate.\n  It is telling that the two amendments that Senator Grassley offered \nduring the committee's consideration of the FISA Amendments Act had \nabsolutely no connection whatsoever with the provisions of title VII of \nFISA. The first amendment that Senator Grassley offered would have \nadded the death penalty as a punishment to certain crimes involving \nweapons of mass destruction. The second amendment that he offered would \nhave required a Department of Justice Inspector General audit of \ncriminal wiretap applications from 2009 to 2010. This amendment may be \nimportant to Senator Grassley in the context of the Fast and Furious \ncontroversy, but it certainly is not relevant to the FISA Amendments \nAct. Senator Feinstein moved to table both amendments and the motion \ncarried each time.\n  Let us be accurate, Republican members of the committee were afforded \nthe opportunity to offer amendments, even ones outside the scope of the \nlegislation. The committee has a process, and we followed that process.\n  I understand that Republican Senators are disappointed that they were \nnot able to use the FISA Amendments Act legislation as a vehicle to \ncarry other legislation. I am disappointed that, as with so many good \nbills the committee has reported, there was so little Republican \nsupport for a measure that everyone concedes is vital to our national \nsecurity. Like the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, which \nreceived no Republican vote on this committee; and the Second Chance \nAct, which received no Republican votes on this committee after a \nnumber of Republican amendments were considered and even though it had \nbeen a program strongly supported by Republicans historically; the FISA \nAmendments Act Sunsets Extension Act was not supported by a single \nRepublican Senator on this committee.\n  Let me remind Senators, again, that the Director of National \nIntelligence and the Attorney General have emphasized that the \nreauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act is the intelligence \ncommunity's ``top legislative priority.'' I encourage any Senator who \nhas not yet done so to review the classified information that the \nadministration has provided to Congress about the implementation of the \nFISA Amendments Act. This is a measure that requires serious debate and \nswift action not partisan bickering or baseless accusations. I \nsincerely hope that we can set aside the election year posturing and \npress ahead with consideration of this important national security \nmeasure. The American people deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5471-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5471-S5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAA SUNSETS EXTENSION ACT\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, on July 19, the Judiciary Committee \nconsidered legislation to reauthorize the title VII provisions of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. These surveillance authorities \nare vital to our\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\nnational security, and it is imperative that they be reauthorized \nbefore they expire at the end of this year. The reauthorization bill is \nnarrow in scope, and many amendments were proposed at the committee \nmarkup that had little or nothing to do with the reauthorization of \nFISA. As I stated during the markup, I may have supported or been open \nto working out a compromise on several of the amendments in other \ncontexts. However, I voted in opposition to all of the extraneous \namendments offered because I felt their adoption would threaten the \ntimely passage of the FISA reauthorization bill. That is not a risk I \nwas willing to take.\n  In particular, as for Senator Kyl's amendment to criminalize certain \nbehavior that would reward past terrorist acts and Senator Grassley's \namendment to impose the death penalty on terrorists who use weapons of \nmass destruction, I want to make clear that I strongly oppose the \nfunding of terrorism and I believe that terrorists should be subject to \nthe death penalty. I support the objectives of both of these \namendments, but I was concerned that their adoption by the committee \ncould delay or prevent passage of the FISA reauthorization bill. I am \nprepared to work with Senator Kyl and Senator Grassley to address these \nimportant issues at a more appropriate time going forward.\n  I hope that these amendments and others are raised in the appropriate \ncontext so they can be adequately addressed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5472-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL PAUL W. BRICKER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our men and women in uniform sacrifice much \nto keep our Nation strong and free. They are well-trained, \nextraordinarily capable and are some of our country's best and \nbrightest. It is with this in mind that I recognize COL Paul W. Bricker \nas he retires from the United States Army this week. Colonel Bricker \nhas served our country in uniform for more than a quarter of a century, \nand I am honored to congratulate him on a long and distinguished \nmilitary career.\n  COL Paul W. Bricker has served as the Chief of the Army's Senate \nLiaison Division since May 2011. As a member of the Secretary of the \nArmy's Office of Legislative Liaison, Colonel Bricker was responsible \nfor advising Army senior leadership on legislative and congressional \nissues, as well as assisting Senators and our staff on Army matters. It \nis in this capacity that my Armed Services Committee staff and I have \nworked closely with Colonel Bricker. Throughout his tenure, he has \nconsistently provided important technical expertise and useful insight \non the issues, challenges and opportunities that face our soldiers and \ntheir families and has exemplified the highest level of \nprofessionalism. I also benefited from Colonel Bricker's organizational \ndiligence and military insights on a number of congressional delegation \ntrips over the past year, including to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey \nand NATO. The success of these trips were due in large part to Colonel \nBricker's careful preparation and adaptability in making course \ncorrections on the fly, often literally.\n  Colonel Bricker has strong Michigan roots. He is a native of northern \nMichigan and a proud graduate of Michigan State University, where, upon \ngraduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant of Aviation. \nColonel Bricker has served in a variety of tactical and operational \nassignments from platoon to corps level in airborne, air assault, light \ninfantry, and motorized units in the United States, Afghanistan, Iraq, \nand South Korea. He has commanded in combat with the 82nd Airborne \nDivision at both the battalion and brigade level. Additionally, in \n2007, he served as the 82nd Airborne Division's Rear Detachment \nCommander, and from 2005-2006, as the Chief of Aviation for the Multi \nNational Corps-Iraq.\n  From 2008 to 2010, Colonel Bricker commanded the 82nd Airborne \nDivision's Combat Aviation Brigade and led them to war on short notice \nas part of the Afghanistan surge. He assumed no-notice responsibility \nfor the DoD Consequence Management Response Force Aviation Brigade \nwhile simultaneously executing Department of the Army Pilot Reset. Once \nin Afghanistan, his brigade supported more than 40,000 coalition troops \nin Regional Command-South with lift, reconnaissance, MEDEVAC, and \nattack aviation. They executed the largest air assault in our nation's \nhistory without error or incident, a testament to his exceptional \nleadership. Colonel Bricker's brigade was commended by the ISAF Joint \nCommand Deputy Commander for his exceptional maintenance and safety \nrecord under the most trying combat conditions.\n  We know that our military personnel don't shoulder the stress and \nsacrifice of military service alone, and Colonel Bricker is no \nexception.

Mr. President, July 26, 1990--22 years ago today was a \ngreat day in our Nation's history. When President George Herbert Walker \nBush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act, we could see the \nfuture before us, full of possibility and opportunity for people with \ndisabilities. It was one of the proudest days of my legislative career.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act is one of the landmark civil \nrights laws of the 20th century--a long-overdue emancipation \nproclamation for Americans with disabilities. The ADA has played a huge \nrole in making our country more accessible, in raising the expectations \nof people with disabilities about what they can hope to achieve at work \nand in life, and in inspiring the world to view disability issues \nthrough the lens of equality and opportunity.\n  In these times, it is valuable to remember that passage of the \noriginal Americans with Disabilities Act was a robustly bipartisan \neffort. As chief sponsor of the ADA in the Senate, I worked very \nclosely with Senator Bob Dole and others on both sides of the aisle. We \nreceived invaluable support from President George Herbert Walker Bush \nand key members of his administration, including White House Counsel \nBoyden Gray, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, and Transportation \nSecretary Sam Skinner. Other Members of Congress also played critical \nroles in passing the ADA first and foremost, Senator Ted Kennedy; but \nalso Senator Orrin Hatch, and Representatives Tony Coelho, Steny Hoyer, \nMajor Owens, and Steve Bartlett.\n  Before the ADA, life was very different for folks with disabilities \nin Iowa and across the country. Being an American with a disability \nmeant not being able to ride on a bus because there was no lift, not \nbeing able to attend a concert or ball game because there was no \naccessible seating, and not being able to cross the street in a \nwheelchair because there were no curb cuts. In short, it meant not \nbeing able to work or participate in community life. Discrimination was \nboth commonplace and accepted.\n  Since then, we have seen amazing progress. The ADA literally \ntransformed the American landscape by requiring that architectural and \ncommunications barriers be removed and replaced with accessible \nfeatures such as ramps, lifts, curb cuts, widening doorways, and closed \ncaptioning. More importantly, the ADA gave millions of Americans the \nopportunity to participate in their communities. We have made \nsubstantial progress in advancing the four goals of the ADA--equality \nof opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic \nself-sufficiency.\n  But despite this progress, we still have more work to do. Last month \nmarked the 13th anniversary of the\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\nU.S. Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., which held that the \nADA requires that people with significant disabilities be given a \nmeaningful opportunity to live and remain in their communities, with \nthe appropriate supports and services, rather than having to live in an \ninstitution or nursing home in order to receive the services they need. \nYet too many people with significant disabilities still do not have \naccess to these home and community-based long-term services and \nsupports--and we must do more. Last month, following a hearing I \nchaired to assess the progress we have made on this issue in the \nvarious States, I sent a letter to the Governor of each State with \ninformation about the variety of new tools available through the \nMedicaid Program to make it easier to provide community-based services, \nincluding the Community First Choice Option and the Money Follows the \nPerson Program. I asked each Governor to let me know by September 7 \nwhat they are doing within their State to ensure that the promise of \nthe ADA and Olmstead is being met.\n  We have made significant progress in the last 22 years in making sure \nthat public transportation options, such as buses, are fully accessible \nto people with disabilities. But we have not made similar progress on \nthe accessibility of taxicabs. During the past year, there have been \nmajor advances in New York City on this issue, and I commend Governor \nCuomo and the disability advocates. However, we still have a lot of \nwork to do here in Washington, DC, and in other major metropolitan \nareas of this country. When I was in London last year, every taxicab \nwas accessible to people with disabilities, through universal design. \nThere is no reason that we cannot work toward this same goal here in \nthe United States.\n  Yet the most critical challenge we still need to address is the \npersistently low employment rates among Americans with disabilities.\n  More than two-thirds of working-age adults with disabilities are not \npart of the labor force. This is shameful, and we need to do better.\n  Sometimes a picture is more powerful than any words, so I ask you to \nlook at the chart that I have here. This chart compares the labor force \nparticipation rates of working-age Americans in the general population, \nwith the participation rates among women, African Americans, Latinos, \nand people with disabilities between 1990 and 2011.\n  Less than 35 percent of American adults with disabilities were in the \nworkforce when we passed the ADA in 1990, and less than 20 percent of \nthis population was in the workforce in 2011. Although our country \ncontinues to have employment gaps for women, African Americans, and \nLatinos, the gap for workers with disabilities is many times the gap \nfor these other groups.\n  The other noteworthy trend this chart shows is that workers with \ndisabilities often don't benefit even when our economy is doing well. \nBetween 1994 and 2000 and between 2005 and 2007 you can see that while \nlabor participation rates went up for other groups, they were either \nflat or declining for workers with disabilities.\n  Since the passage of the ADA we have not made a lot of progress on \nincreasing the employment rate of people with disabilities. This was \npartly due to the confusion about the requirements of the ADA's \nemployment provisions caused by the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in \nthe Sutton trilogy in 1999 and the Toyota case in 2002. But in 2008, we \npassed the ADA Amendments Act which once and for all clarified the \ndefinition of ``disability'' and started the clock anew on our efforts \nto increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities.\n  But I believe our country is on the verge of major progress on the \nissue of disability employment. I released a report last week calling \non the country to finally make this issue a national priority, because \nI believe in my heart that we can make substantial progress in the next \n3 years. A copy of that report, entitled ``Unfinished Business: Making \nEmployment of People with Disabilities a National Priority,'' is \navailable on the HELP Committee Web site.\n  I think we are on the cusp of making real progress on this issue for \na number of reasons.\n  First, we have a new generation of young adults with disabilities who \ngrew up since the passage of the ADA, sometimes referred to as the \n``ADA Generation.'' These young people have high expectations for \nthemselves. This generation sees disability as a natural part of human \nexperience and does not carry the fears, myths, and stereotypes that \nlowered expectations for individuals with disabilities in earlier \ngenerations.\n  Along with the ADA generation, we have hundreds of thousands of \nreturning soldiers from Iraq and Afghanistan who do not want their \nvisible and invisible war injuries to prevent them from having a career \nand supporting their families. These veterans are demonstrating their \nleadership in our civilian workforce just as they did in service to our \ncountry.\n  In part, to seize on these demographic advantages, I worked with the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce to set a goal last year that we increase the \nsize of the disability labor force by over 20 percent by 2015. With the \nleadership of people with disabilities, the Chamber of Commerce, along \nwith elected officials and businesses like Walgreens and Lowes who have \nalso made this a priority, I think we are at a real tipping point.\n  In particular, Walgreens has been a leader in employing people with \ndisabilities. I attended a CEO Summit on disability employment at \nWalgreens' distribution center in Windsor, CT, last month, and saw \nfirsthand how Walgreens built a distribution center designed for a \ndiverse workforce, a distribution center with about half of its \nemployees being people with disabilities, a distribution center that is \njust as productive as the other Walgreens distribution centers, and is \nin fact outperforming all of Walgreens' other distribution centers on \nkey indicators like time away from work, turnover, and workplace \nsafety.\n  Today I hosted a roundtable with many different stakeholders, \nincluding Members of the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis, \nFederal and State government officials, people with disabilities, \nbusiness leaders, and foundations--all committed to increasing \nemployment opportunities for people with disabilities in competitive \nemployment.\n  If all of us--Members of Congress, business leaders, employers, and \npeople with disabilities--work together, I believe that we can meet the \ngoal of 1 million new workers with disabilities--and ensure that all \nindividuals with disabilities have real opportunities for employment \nthat meet their goals, interests, and high expectations.\n  So as we celebrate the anniversary of this great civil rights law, we \ntake time to remember the remarkable progress that we have made in the \npast 22 years, as well as the progress that we will continue to make--\nincluding today.\n  Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee marked up the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, and \napproved the treaty on a bipartisan vote of 13 to 6. This brings us one \nstep closer to bringing the convention before the full Senate. I would \nlike to thank my colleague, Chairman Kerry, for considering this \nconvention in such a timely manner, and also Senator McCain for his \ncommitment to this issue. I am proud to support the convention's goal \nto ensure that people with disabilities have the same rights and \nopportunities as everyone else.\n  Americans with disabilities already enjoy these rights at home. \nHowever, U.S. citizens with disabilities, including our veterans, \nfrequently face barriers when they travel, conduct business, study, or \nreside overseas. Ratification of the convention would underscore the \nenduring U.S. commitment to disability rights and enhance the ability \nof the United States to promote these rights overseas.\n  American ratification of the convention would not require us to \nchange any U.S. laws, and the amendments adopted today in committee \nmake this abundantly, explicitly clear. The ADA and disability rights \nissues have always enjoyed bipartisan support, and passage of the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities should as well. I \nam pleased to note the convention is supported by former Senator Dole, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 21 veterans groups and countless \ndisability rights advocates.\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\n  On July 26, 1990, when he signed ADA into law, President George \nHerbert Walker Bush spoke with great eloquence. And I will never forget \nhis final words before taking up his pen. He said, ``Let the shameful \nwall of exclusion finally come tumbling down.''\n  Mr. President, today, that wall is indeed falling. And we must join \ntogether, on a bipartisan basis, to continue this progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5474-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             VA AND NIH JOINT PARKINSON'S DISEASE RESEARCH\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I would like to take a moment to recognize the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health, \nNIH, for their research into an innovative surgery that has \ndemonstrated success in improving the stability of muscle movement for \nveterans with Parkinson's disease. VA and NIH's joint research \ncollaboration regarding deep brain stimulation therapy has furthered \nthe medical community's understanding of Parkinson's disease and will \nbe incredibly valuable to doctors and Parkinson's patients throughout \nthe world.\n  For many individuals, medication alone is insufficient when it comes \nto dealing with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease. VA \nand NIH conducted research into an alternative treatment option known \nas deep brain stimulation therapy to test the long-term outcomes of the \ntreatment. Deep brain stimulation therapy is a surgical procedure that \nimplants electrodes into specific stimulation sites within the brain. \nThese electrodes are then able to send electrical pulses to areas of \nthe brain that controls movement and motor control and helps mitigate \nthe symptoms of Parkinson's disease as well as reduce some of the side \neffects caused by medication. Thanks to deep brain stimulation therapy, \nthousands of individuals suffering from Parkinson's disease have \nexperienced a dramatic improvement in their quality of life.\n  Since deep brain stimulation therapy was approved by the Food and \nDrug Administration, FDA, as a therapy for Parkinson's disease in the \nlate 1990s, there has been an ongoing debate about which stimulation \nsites within the brain provide the best and most durable treatment \noutcomes and how long those results last. To better understand the role \nthat stimulation sites play in deep brain stimulation therapy, VA and \nNIH conducted a 3-year clinical trial. The trial ultimately found that \nthe benefits gained from deep brain stimulation therapy remained after \n3 years and the benefits from the surgery were not dependent by which \nstimulation site was selected for implantation.\n  This is the type of research that is crucial to providing the care \nthat our Nation's veterans need and deserve. Thanks to the hard work of \nVA and NIH researchers, the 40,000 veterans living with Parkinson's \ndisease whom VA cares for along with Parkinson's patients across the \nworld will be better equipped to make informed decisions about their \ntreatment options.\n  In closing, I commend VA and NIH for their efforts to combat a \ndisease that affects so many of America's veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5474-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR L. BRUCE LAINGEN\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an accomplished \ndiplomat and distinguished public servant, Ambassador L. Bruce Laingen. \nOn August 6, Bruce will celebrate his 90th birthday. I want to take \nthis momentous occasion to reflect on his contributions and efforts in \nsupport of our Nation. Despite the personal sacrifice, Bruce honorably \nserved the United States with expert skill and dedication throughout \nhis long career.\n  Bruce was born and raised on a farm in southern Minnesota. He joined \nthe U.S. Navy, and served our Nation during World War II. Bruce \nreceived his officer training at Wellesley College in 1943, and \nattended the University of Dubuque in Iowa for general Naval training. \nHe was a commissioned officer in the Naval Supply Corps. Bruce served \nin the Pacific with amphibious forces in the Philippine campaigns. \nAfter World War II, Bruce graduated from St. Olaf College in Minnesota \nin 1947. He went on to further his education at the University of \nMinnesota, where he received a Master's degree in International \nRelations in 1949.\n  As a result of his passion and interest in what was happening across \nthe globe, Bruce dedicated 38 years to the Foreign Service. He joined \nthe Foreign Service in 1949, and served this Nation across the world in \nGermany, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The United States was very \nfortunate to have Bruce serve as U.S. Ambassador to Malta from 1977 to \n1979.\n  In June 1979, Bruce returned to Iran to serve as the U.S. Charge \nd'Affaires in the wake of the Iranian revolution. Within a few months \nof his arrival, a group of demonstrators took over the U.S. Embassy in \nTehran. The students and militants were protesting the United States' \nrelationship with the government of Iran and the Shah's entry into the \nUnited States on humanitarian grounds. On November 4, 1979, Bruce was \ntaken hostage along with more than 60 other Americans. For a total of \n444 days, he and 51 other Americans were held hostage in Iran. \nThroughout the entire ordeal, he worked diligently to protect the \nhostages and resolve the crisis. He showed true professionalism and \nstrength. In his book Yellow Ribbon: The Secret Journal of Bruce \nLaingen, Bruce describes his personal perspective and thoughts about \nthe events that took place over those 444 days.\n  Shortly after Bruce's capture, his wife Penelope ``Penne'' Laingen \ntied a yellow ribbon around an oak tree on their lawn in Maryland to \nsymbolize her hope for a safe return for her husband and all of the \nhostages. Penne encouraged others to show their support and \ndetermination to be reunited with their loved ones through the use of \nyellow ribbons. The original yellow ribbon was later donated to the \nLibrary of Congress. It is because of her efforts that Penne is \ncredited with founding the yellow ribbon campaign during the Iran \nhostage crisis.\n  After his release, Bruce became the Vice President of the National \nDefense University until he retired from the Foreign Service in 1987. \nHe went on to be the Executive Director of the National Commission on \nPublic Service from 1987 until 1990. Between 1991 and 2006, Bruce was \nPresident of the American Academy of Diplomacy.\n  Bruce continued to share his expertise and knowledge through his \nefforts on several distinguished Boards of Directors including No \nGreater Love, A Presidential Classroom for Young Americans, the \nMercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, and the National Defense \nUniversity Foundation. I had the honor of working with Bruce on the \nBoard of Directors of the Presidential Classroom. He has been a strong \nadvocate for this wonderful program, which encourages students to learn \nabout how their government works and aspire to leadership through \npublic service.\n  Bruce has received many honors as a result of his brave service to \nour Nation. He was awarded the Department of State's Award for Valor, \nthe Department of Defense's Distinguished Public Service Medal, the \nPresidential Meritorious Award, and the Foreign Service Cup.\n  I am grateful for his willingness to serve our Nation and provide \nstrong leadership in implementing the foreign policy goals of the \nUnited States. Bruce, Penne, and their three sons Bill, Chip, and Jim \nhave given so much to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5474-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5474-S5478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CROWDFUNDING\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that I \nand many of my colleagues are very excited about: crowdfunding, which \nallows startups and small businesses to harness the power of the \nInternet to pool investments from ordinary Americans intrigued by their \nideas. These ideas can range from revolutionary new technologies to \nsimple projects that can improve communities in need.\n  If crowdfunding is going to take off, this new market needs to \ninspire confidence in both investors and small businesses. That is why \nin December of 2011, I introduced S. 1970 with Senators Michael Bennet \nand Mary Landrieu and in March of this year the bipartisan, compromise \ncrowdfunding amendment with Senators Michael Bennet and Scott Brown. \nThat amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 64 to 35 and was included \nin the\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\nJOBS Act, which passed the Senate and the House of Representatives and \nwas signed into law by President Obama in April of this year.\n  In putting this legislation together, I was guided by two goals: 1, \nenabling this market to work for startups and small businesses and 2, \nprotecting ordinary investors from fraud and deception. Fortunately, in \nmany cases, these goals are aligned. The long-term ability for \ncompanies to efficiently raise capital will depend on investors' \nconfidence in the reliability of the marketplace. I believe that the \nlegislation we produced sets the right framework for this marketplace \nto meet both goals. But, for success to be achieved, this framework \nmust be filled in with smart, effective rules and consistent, \nconscientious oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, \na professional and independent self-regulatory organization, and the \nState securities regulators.\n  The SEC is currently in the early stages of the rulemaking process \nrequired under the law. I seek to offer these comments today to add to \nthe creative thinking going into that process. I explore several ways \nin which the law is designed to provide a streamlined and simplified \ncrowdfunding process, as well as provide critical investor protections. \nI will touch on funding portal regulation, national securities \nassociation membership, target amounts, disclosures, accountability, \naggregate caps, advertising and promotion, the relationship of \ncrowdfunding to other capital raising, the public review period, the \nrole of State securities regulators, and on-going review and \nadjustment.\n  The law provides two regulatory options for firms seeking to provide \ncrowdfunding services. A crowdfunding company under the ``funding \nportal'' option benefits from streamlined regulatory treatment but must \nbe a neutral platform towards investors. Alternatively, a firm can \nregister as a broker-dealer, in which case it can, through its website \nor otherwise, provide a broader range of investment guidance to \ninvestors. These two options provide a solid foundation for a \ncrowdfunding marketplace with a range of business models.\n  Because both intermediary vehicles will be repeat players in the \ncrowdfunding marketplace, the rules governing their activities are of \nparamount importance to the success of the marketplace. Registered \nbroker-dealers are subject to a well-established set of regulations. \nThe registered funding portal structure is, however, a new, streamlined \napproach. As such, attention should be given to how it can fulfill its \npromise of a streamlined regulatory approach while also providing the \nappropriate level of investor protection, as set forth in the law and \notherwise.\n  The CROWDFUND Act is designed so that funding portals will be subject \nto fewer regulatory requirements than broker-dealers because they will \ndo fewer things than broker-dealers. Among other limits, the law \nprohibits funding portals from engaging in solicitation, making \nrecommendations, and providing investment advice. Relative passivity \nand neutrality, especially with respect to the investing public, are \ntouchstones of the funding portal streamlined treatment. The SEC will, \nof course, have to establish boundaries, and I encourage the Commission \nto consider several points:\n  Provided that funding portals are not subject to financial incentives \nthat would cause them to favor certain companies or otherwise create a \nconflict of interest, funding portals should be able to exclude \nprospective issuers from their platform, whether that exclusion is \nbased on the size of the offering, the type of security being offered, \nthe industry of the business, the subjective quality of the issuer, the \namount that the issuer would charge for its securities, e.g., the \npricing of shares based on an evaluation of the company's potential, or \nthe interest rate on a debt security given a certain risk profile of \nthe issuer as analyzed by the funding portal, or almost any other \nreason, including at the discretion of the platform. In short, a \nfunding portal should not be forced, directly or indirectly, to conduct \na crowdfunding offering of an issuer it does not have faith in or on \nterms it does not believe should be made available to its customers.\n  Subject to such limits as the SEC determines necessary for the \nprotection of investors and the crowdfunding issuers, funding portals \nshould be able to provide, or make available through service providers, \nservices to assist entrepreneurs utilizing crowdfunding, including, for \nexample, providing basic standardized templates, models, and \nchecklists. Enabling them to help small businesses construct simple, \nstandard deal structures will facilitate quality, low-cost offerings. \nIf necessary, streamlined oversight of these may be appropriate, for \nexample, by the relevant national securities association.\n  Funding portals should be able to highlight for investors, such as \nthrough searches, requested email alerts, or profile ``matches,'' \nissuers according to objective criteria for example, geographic, \nindustry, trending, or not trending, amount an investor wants to pay \nfor a security, or interest rate desired, or randomly.\n  Funding portals should be able to provide relevant factual \ninformation from third parties. For example, in the context of the sale \nof debt securities, this could be information from credit bureaus \nregarding the creditworthiness of issuers and their backers.\n  It is important to remember that nothing in the CROWDFUND Act \nprevents or limits a person independent of the funding portal from \nproviding recommendations or investment advice to their clients. For \nexample, Community Development Financial Institutions, CDFIs, with \ntheir mission-driven mandate and economic empowerment experience, may \noffer valuable insight for investors seeking to identify healthy, \ncommunity-based investments.\n  Some have argued that discretion-based curation, such as highlighting \ncertain companies on a home page for all investors, is important to the \nsuccess of crowdfunding. However, the activity also comes very close to \nthe line of making recommendations or providing investment advice, \nwhich are not permitted owing to the reduced duties that funding \nportals have compared to broker-dealers. Some of the CROWDFUND Act's \nstreamlining was precisely to enable small companies to successfully \nraise capital at modest cost, but some of those duties are also \nimportant investor protections. The SEC should carefully weigh these \nconcerns and adopt practical, easy-to-manage solutions that facilitate \nsuccessful crowdfunding for company, investor, and platform.\n  For example, it should be carefully considered whether organizing of \nthe presentation of companies on the homepage facilitates success, \nespecially by less sophisticated users, and so should be permitted. Of \ncourse, the funding portal should not match specific investors with \nspecific companies and must not be compensated in a way that would \ncause them to favor certain companies or otherwise create a conflict of \ninterest.\n  Indeed, some argue that discretion-based curation is essential to \nprevent fraudsters from gaming an objective system. On the other hand, \nsome vigorously context this point and identify it as creating a \nserious risk for pump-and-dump schemes. One of the reasons I feel \nregulatory supervision of this space is so important--and fought for it \nso vigorously during the CROWDFUND Act debate--is because of the \nprofessional expertise regulators bring to addressing difficult \ntechnical issues. In short, I urge the SEC and the relevant national \nsecurities association to consider competing views like these \ncarefully. It should be remembered that crowdfunding comes with a \nnumber of investor protections, including the aggregate cap, and so may \nprovide some space for modest experimentation, especially when done in \npartnership with investor protection advocates and industry \nparticipants acting in good faith, and with adjustments made based on \nactual performance and measurable data.\n  The SEC is and should feel fully empowered by the law to take actions \nto protect investors and this is essential, especially at the early \nstages, when reputational risk to the crowdfunding market is very high. \nAt the same time, I encourage it to approach this marketplace with a \nspirit of smart, careful experimentation and regular review and \nadjustment.\n  In addition, I encourage the SEC to move swiftly to address potential \nconcerns about timing for the registration\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\nof potential funding portals so that they can be ready to go when \ncrowdfunding goes live.\n  The legislation requires firms offering crowdfunding services to join \na national securities association registered with the SEC, also known \nas a self-regulatory organization, SRO. The vision of the SRO as a \ngenuine regulatory entity owes much to the leadership of SEC Chairman \nWilliam O. Douglas, the ``sheriff of Wall Street'' during the Great \nDepression, who believed the SEC had a duty to establish strong \nregulation in the public interest but that Wall Street itself was well \npositioned--and should be obligated--to participate in the maintenance \nof high standards of conduct. Accordingly, any such association must be \nstrictly independent and thoroughly professional, with a strong mandate \nto operate in the highest forms of public interest and for the \nprotection of investors.\n  The legislation does not foreclose funding portals from developing \ntheir own association. After consulting with the SEC and the Financial \nIndustry Regulatory Authority, FINRA, they may indeed decide such an \nassociation would better serve their goals of a professional, \nindependent, high-quality SRO. Setting up an SRO is not easy, though, \nand it may also make practical sense for funding portals to tap into \nthe architecture already present in FINRA. To facilitate that, I \nencourage FINRA to work with new funding portals to keep bureaucracy, \npaperwork, and fees to a minimum, and to ensure funding portals can \nmeaningfully participate in FINRA governance.\n  Moreover, I urge FINRA to act quickly and in close coordination with \nthe SEC to address potential timing concerns that may exist with \nrespect to the relationship between registration and membership of \nfunding portals and the effective date of crowdfunding. Prospective \nfunding portals should not be disadvantaged in their ability to compete \nin the initial stages of the crowdfunding marketplace.\n  The law says companies can only access investor funds once they have \nraised an amount ``equal to or greater than'' their target amount. The \ngoal of this provision is to ensure that disclosures provided are \nconnected to the target amount--and any higher amount--while also \nenabling companies which attract more interest than they had expected \nto obtain the additional funds raised. For example, if an issuer sets \nits target amount at $50,000 and discloses that it needs the $50,000 \nfor a set of ovens for a vegan bakery, if it only raises $35,000, an \ninvestor would have no way of knowing what the company would do with \nthe money--and this is not permitted. However, if the issuer discloses \nit would buy a small oven if it raised $50,000 and a higher-capacity \noven if it raised $70,000, then that would give investors confidence \nthat funds raised and distributed would go to their disclosed use. In \nshort, the disclosures should be tied to the target amounts being \nraised, and issuers should provide some level of disclosure for how \nthey will use funds above some reasonable percentage beyond their \noriginal target.\n  The law puts in place aggregate caps on an individual's crowdfunding \ninvestments in a given year. Without aggregate caps, someone could in \ntheory max out a per-company investment in a single company and then \nrepeat that bet ten, a hundred, or a thousand times, perhaps \nunintentionally wiping out their entire savings. The challenge is that \ncrowdfunding is a new framework to provide small companies, including \nmany start-ups, opportunities to raise capital. The risks that are \npresent in this space are not amenable to ordinary means of mitigation \nthrough diversification. Angel and venture capital funds, whose mission \nis to invest in the start-up sector, tend to invest in perhaps one out \nof one hundred opportunities presented and assume that ninety-five \npercent of investments will fail entirely. Their profits commonly \nemerge out of only a handful of big winners. Even with the investor \neducation mandated under the law, ordinary investors might not fully \nappreciate these risks. Aggregate caps can help address this problem.\n  Because caps scale up as investors can bear greater risk, an \nimportant investor protection is the cap--$2000, to be adjusted for \ninflation--for persons of lower income. One way to ensure that the \ninvestor protection inherent in the scaled approach is meaningfully \nimplemented might be to only require persons seeking to qualify for the \nhigher investment amounts make showing regarding their income, but then \nmake that showing slightly higher than simply ``checking a box.'' This \napproach could protect less sophisticated investors from opting into \nthe higher limits accidentally or due to potentially misleading \npromptings from a less scrupulous intermediary, while retaining ease of \nuse for the majority of participants utilizing the default amount of \n$2000.\n  Some have expressed concern about how to implement the aggregate \namounts across platforms. A data sharing regime is one way to do that, \nbut the SEC might also consider whether to pair it with a presumption \nthat ordinary investors that remain within an amount below the default \naggregate, for example $500, on any one platform are also presumed \ncompliant across other unaffiliated platforms. This streamlining may be \nparticularly useful for those seeking to make small investments and for \nthose that want to engage in community-based crowdfunding, including \nthose serving the CDFI community.\n  As the market develops, the SEC should carefully evaluate how these \ncaps are working from perspectives of investors, issuers, and \nintermediaries.\n  The bipartisan Senate approach to crowdfunding provides critical \ndisclosures that should help investors make intelligent investment \nchoices. These include core financial information, basics about the \nbusiness of the issuer, information about major owners, and other key \nbasics any investor needs to know before investing. Disclosures should \nbe designed specifically for the crowdfunding market, enabling start-\nups and small businesses to present basic, accurate information \nappropriate to the amount of money being put at risk by each investor \nand raised overall by the issuer.\n  With respect to financial information, the law allows companies \nraising smaller amounts of money to provide financial information \nappropriate to the amount of capital being raised--but all companies \nmust provide something. If, for example, an issuer wants to raise \n$90,000 to develop a prototype project but it is a new company without \nany previous revenue, that is fine--under the law, it just has to, for \nexample, certify that the company has not yet filed tax returns and \nprovide a CEO-certified set of financial statements displaying the \nappropriate zeroes. I want this process to work for all kinds of \nstartups and be reasonably tailored to the amount of capital being \nraised.\n  The law mandates strong disclosures about capital structure and risks \nof dilution. Crowdfunding is available for both equity and debt \nsecurities, but the more complex the security or capital structure is, \nthe greater the need is for strong disclosure. The goal with the strong \ndisclosure mandate in the law to push issuers towards easy-to-\nunderstand, investor-friendly approaches, while also permitting more \ncomplex approaches if the appropriate disclosures are made. It was \nenvisioned that the SEC might even adopt safe harbors for simple, \ninvestor-friendly structures. It may wish to convene an advisory \ncommittee specifically designed to evaluate these issues, as well as \nalso to seek input from the Office of the Investor Advocate.\n  The legislation also provides for annual reports by issuers to \ninvestors. This should be a similarly streamlined approach that allows \nstartups and small businesses to provide basic information to investors \nabout business performance and future prospects, as well as other \nbasic, relevant information that may be important for investor \ndecision-making--e.g., related party transactions and conflicts of \ninterest.\n  We urge the SEC to consult with the advisory committee noted above, \nas well as market participants and investors to develop a properly \ntailored approach. Consumer testing may be a useful tool as well, and \nthe SEC should not be shy about adjusting its approach based on how \nthey work in the marketplace.\n  When selling securities to the public, companies and the key players \ninvolved have a special obligation to provide truthful information. \nWhen they do not, the law properly holds them accountable. This is an \nessential civil right that has long been a critical tool\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\nensuring U.S. markets are the deepest and most reliable capital markets \nin the world.\n  Here too, the law seeks to adopt a fair, practical approach. The \nCROWDFUND Act sets forth a ``due diligence'' standard for \naccountability, which is essentially a ``do your homework'' standard. \nThis is a standard that was reached after considerable bipartisan \neffort as well as consultation with legal experts, and I believe it is \nand can be workable and effective for this marketplace.\n  The promise of crowdfunding is that centralized platforms and social \nmedia can allow the ``wisdom of the crowd'' to help direct capital to \ndeserving start-ups and small businesses in a cost-effective, efficient \nmanner that provides fair returns. Critical to the success of the \nventure is the reliability of the information and commentary presented. \nWhile the Internet can be a tremendous tool for transparency, that is \nnot always the case. The CROWDFUND Act seeks to provide a reliable, \ntransparent marketplace by centralizing information about the offering \non a registered intermediary that maintains strong standards.\n  Off-platform advertising is limited to pointing the public to the \nregistered intermediary. Whether on or off the intermediary, persons \npaid or financially incentivized to promote--including officers, \ndirectors, and 20 percent shareholders--must clearly disclose \nthemselves each and every time they engage in a promotional activity. \nFurthermore, the limitation on off-platform advertising is intended to \nprohibit issuers--including officers, directors, and 20 percent \nshareholders--from promoting or paying promoters to express opinions \noutside the platform that would go beyond pointing the public to the \nfunding portal. Such paid testimonials and manufactured excitement \nwould represent a prohibited form of off-site advertising if those \ndisclosures were not present. Whether on or off the platform, paid \nadvertising must clearly be disclosed as such. In short, the investor \ndeserves a transparent medium for making healthy decisions.\n  These limits will help to ensure that ordinary investors can rely on \nthe information they encounter online and accurately gauge a company's \nlevel of public support, while also helping to ensure that honest \nstartups can compete for investors without hiring armies of paid \npromoters or engaging in manipulative tactics.\n  Another important issue the SEC will need to address is the \nrelationship of crowdfunding to other capital raisings, and in \nparticular to Regulation D offerings. This is a difficult issue, \nespecially as Regulation D's restrictions on general solicitation have \nbeen loosened by Title II of the JOBS Act. I believe that careful study \nand attention needs to be paid to how the two should interact in \nvarious contexts, including with respect to integration.\n  Although crowdfunding is a public offering, it is unlike other public \nofferings, and, absent evidence of problems, most likely should be able \nto proceed parallel to a Regulation D private offering, provided the \nappropriate protections are put in place--and the SEC adjusts them as \nnecessary based on their performance in the real world. It is critical, \nthough, that the now-looser solicitation rules for a post-JOBS Act \nRegulation D offering not be permitted to undermine the centralized \ntransparency protections of crowdfunding's restrictions on advertising. \nOne solution could be to provide a safeharbor from integration rules \nonly where the Regulation D offering followed the pre-JOBS Act approach \non Regulation D. Naturally, the Regulation D offering and the \ncrowdfunding offering would have to provide the same information to \ninvestors.\n  With respect to subsequent offerings, crowdfunding should be flexible \nenough to fit into the start-up ecosystem, and the SEC should carefully \ninvestigate this question. However, crowdfunding investors will likely \nface a higher risk of unfair dilution than ordinary angel investors. \nThe disclosures mandated in the CROWDFUND Act should be helpful. But, \nshould issuers seek to engage in private offerings within only a short \nperiod after a crowdfunding, which would normally not be permitted \nunder Regulation D, the SEC should consider whether it can be possible \nfor these offerings can proceed if they are especially protective of \ninvestors along the lines of how an angel investor might protect \nhimself or herself from unfair dilution or other problems arising from \nnear-term subsequent offerings.\n  This may require the SEC to adopt approaches more substantive than is \nnormally the case. For example, dilution might only be permitted to the \nsame or lesser extent than the directors, officers, and major \nshareholders, or the crowd would have to be bought out at a profit \ndisclosed in the original offering. Again, for the success of the \ncrowdfunding marketplace, the SEC should ensure that crowdfunding fits \ninto the start-up ecosystem but should do so in a way that ensures \ncrowdfunding investors are treated fairly.\n  Similar issues may arise with respect to other corporate governance \nmatters and relationships with other aspects of securities law, such as \nmanaging the large number of investors in a crowdfunded company. In \nthese instances, the SEC should look to find ways to ensure that \ninvestors are properly protected--in many instances, by ensuring that \nthey are aligned with the interests of the directors, officers, and \nmajor shareholders--while also being practical and ensuring that \ncrowdfunding can function within the start-up ecosystem.\n  Two important investor protections in the CROWDFUND Act are the \npublic review period and withdrawl rights. They are designed to allow \ninvestors the chance to carefully consider offerings, permitting the \n``wisdom of the crowd'' to develop, rather than perhaps just the \n``excitement of the crowd.''\n  The public review period commences upon the date 21 days prior to \nwhen the securities are ``sold'' to any investor. This means that when \nthe offering is made available to the public--``potential investors''--\nto consider investing: i.e., it is put up on the platform which is the \npoint at which information is made available to regulators and is also \nthe point when a notice filing is made with the relevant state \nsecurities regulator the public has 21 days to review it. At the end of \nthat, the offering can close and the securities can be ``sold'' to \ninvestors. The 21-day period does not reset for each and every \npotential investor who might look at the offering--which is why the \nlanguage specifically says ``potential investors.'' For example, when a \npotential investor considers investing on the seventeenth day the \noffering has been up on the platform, the offering can still close four \ndays later whether that person invests or not.\n  The SEC must also provide appropriate ways for investors to cancel \ncommitments to invest.\n  The law envisions an important role for State securities regulators. \nThe State securities regulators are the ``50 cops on the beat'' that \nhave time and again proven crucial for policing smaller offerings, such \nas those envisioned under crowdfunding.\n  One way the law has been designed to empower them is through the 21-\nday public review period for all offerings. When combined with the \nnotice filings to the State securities regulator of the principal place \nof business of the issuers--and States where more than 50 percent of \ninvestors are located--and the anti-fraud authority preserved for them, \nthe 21-day public review period is designed to provide the State \nsecurities regulators with practical ability to assist in policing the \nmarketplace.\n  In addition, State securities regulators have examination and \nenforcement power for funding portals headquartered in their states. \nAlthough they will be limited to enforcing federal rules, this \noversight authority is an important tool, especially for smaller \ncrowdfunding portals that may emerge in particular states. Of course, \noversight should be coordinated with the SEC and the relevant national \nsecurities association to the greatest extent possible.\n  I also encourage the SEC and the relevant national securities \nassociation to work closely with state regulators in crafting the rules \nand learning from their on-the-ground experience.\n  We have also heard recently from the CDFI community with ideas about \nhow crowdfunding can support their work bringing growth and job \ncreation to underserved communities. CDFIs are lenders and partners to \nbusinesses in underserved communities. They tend to obtain low rates of \nreturn on mission-driven investments, and frequently encounter \nfinancing gaps that\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nmight be filled through mission-driven crowdfunding--much the way such \ninvesting occurs in certain segments of the non-security-based \ncrowdfunding universe today.\n  I believe that the overall structure of our bill offers CDFI's \npowerful tools to support their job-creation work, while protecting \nordinary investors from undue risk of fraud and loss. In addition, some \nin the CDFI community have suggested to us that because of the types of \nbusinesses CDFI's work with, the types of low returns that might be \nderived, and the particular financing gaps that might be filled through \ncrowdfunding, that mission-driven, CDFI-supported crowdfunding may \nyield better results for investors and positive job creation for \ncommunities if the rules reflect the particular work they do. \nSuggestions include ensuring crowdfunding can fill the financing gap \nfor projects supported by federally-regulated, 501(c)3 CDFIs, a \nclarification to ensure that CDFIs and issuers can make sure investors \nunderstand the mission and charitable aspects of investments, and fast \ntreatment from the SEC and FINRA related to registration and \nmembership.\n  The SEC should be receptive to concepts CDFIs may bring that could \naid in accomplishing the job-creating goals of the legislation, while \nprotecting investors. It should consult with CDFI's and the CDFI Fund \nat the Treasury Department on how best to maximize the social and jobs \npotential for investing through crowdfunding and CDFI's.\n  Although it was not included in the final legislation for procedural \nreasons, I would encourage the SEC and the relevant national securities \nassociation to engage in regular reviews and reports regarding \ndevelopments in the crowdfunding marketplace, including thorough \ncoordination and consultation with State securities regulators. Should \nproblems arise, these authorities should act quickly, including use of \ntheir full rulemaking and enforcement authorities. Crowdfunding holds \ngreat potential, but it is also experimental and presents risks. For it \nto succeed long-term, it will require careful oversight, especially \nduring the early stages.\n  I also urge the SEC and the relevant national securities association \nto speed the publication of final rules. Crowdfunding cannot get \nstarted until rules fill out the framework to make the law effective.\n  I believe the features outlined above are essential if crowdfunding \nis going to succeed. Success should be judged both on returns to and \nsatisfaction of investors, and the growth and development of new and \nexciting companies. I am excited about the potential of this new \nmarket, but also cognizant of its risks. It won't be without its \nhiccups in the short run, but done properly, I believe this framework \nhas the potential over the long run to help millions of new startups \nget the funding they need to grow their businesses and create jobs, and \nprovide investors with opportunities for meaningful returns and \ncommunity involvement.\n  I wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to the hard work and cooperation \nof my fellow senators, especially Michael Bennet, Mary Landrieu, and \nScott Brown. I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of our \nstaffs, who did so much to get the original legislative idea into law \nin strong, responsible form.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5478-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING OLIVIA CULPO, MISS USA\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I congratulate Olivia Culpo of my own \nhometown, Cranston, RI, for being crowned Miss USA on June 3, 2012, in \nLas Vegas, NV. She is the first titleholder from our State.\n  A native Rhode Islander, Olivia attended St. Mary Academy-Bay View \nand graduated with high honors. She is currently a sophomore at Boston \nUniversity and has been on the dean's list every semester. Olivia is \nalso an accomplished cellist who has performed with the Rhode Island \nPhilharmonic Pops Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Rhode \nIsland Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, the Rhode Island Philharmonic \nChamber Ensemble, the Bay View Orchestra, and the Rhode Island All-\nState Orchestra.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting Olivia recently when she came to \nCapitol Hill to passionately advocate for ovarian cancer prevention. \nOlivia is an impressive and intelligent young woman, and I appreciated \nthe opportunity to discuss this and other issues with her.\n  Rhode Island is very proud that such a talented young woman is \nrepresenting our State. We look forward to continuing to see Olivia \nserve as a positive role model both during and beyond her reign as Miss \nUSA, and wish her the best of luck when she represents the United \nStates at the Miss Universe pageant in December. Once again, I offer my \nsincerest congratulations to Olivia Culpo for being the first Rhode \nIslander to be crowned Miss USA.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rhode Island \nnative Olivia Culpo for her recent win of the Miss USA title. Miss \nCulpo is the first Rhode Islander to win the Miss USA competition, and \nmy fellow Rhode Islanders and I couldn't be happier for her. We offer \nher our heartfelt congratulations.\n  A Cranston native, 20-year-old Olivia is the middle child of Peter \nand Susan Culpo. As a parent myself, I would especially like to extend \nmy congratulations to Peter and Susan, who I know must be extremely \nproud of their daughter's accomplishment.\n  Olivia sets a great example for all Rhode Island children, graduating \nfrom Rhode Island's own St. Mary's Academy Bay View as a member of the \nNational Honor Society. She currently attends Boston University in \nneighboring Massachusetts, where she has made the dean's list every \nsemester.\n  In addition to excelling in her academic studies, Miss Culpo is a \ntalented and dedicated musician. With two musicians for parents, Olivia \nwas encouraged to pursue her love for music at a young age. She took \ncello lessons from second grade on, and has since performed with the \nRhode Island Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, RI Philharmonic Chamber \nEnsemble, Bay View Orchestra, and Rhode Island All-State Orchestra. She \nhas also had the distinct honor of performing with the Boston Symphony \nHall in Boston and Carnegie Hall in New York City, and completed a tour \nof England in 2010. Most recently, Olivia performed with the Boston \nAccompanietta.\n  Olivia will spend her yearlong reign as Miss USA giving back to the \ncommunity by raising awareness about breast and ovarian cancer, and by \nworking closely with organizations fighting to find cures for these \ndevastating diseases.\n  I would like to thank Miss Culpo for being a great representative for \nthe State of Rhode Island in the Miss USA pageant, and again offer my \ncongratulations to her and her family on her incredible win.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5478-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        RECOGNIZING KATRINA COBB\n\n Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I pay \ntribute to MAJ General Hugh Broomall. After spending nearly 38 years \nserving Delaware and our Nation with the Delaware National Guard, \nGeneral Broomall is retiring. He will leave behind an organization he \nhelped to strengthen and a legacy of service that will not soon be \nforgotten. A native of Wilmington, DE, General Broomall's military \ncareer began when he enlisted in the Delaware Air National Guard, where \nhe went on to receive a commission in 1974. General Broomall became an \nair intelligence officer and deployed worldwide in support of exercises \nand contingencies. Most recently, General Broomall served as the \nspecial assistant to the Director of the Air National Guard, where he \nwas responsible for strategy development, State and Federal liaison, \ninteragency coordination, and special studies supporting the 106,000 \nAir National Guard members nationwide.\n  General Broomall's impact is not limited to Delaware. When asked \nabout General Broomall, LTG Bud Wyatt said, ``his multi-dimensional \nexperience, both civilian and military, makes him an outstanding asset \nto the Nation. His tireless work with the military, private industry \nand the Hill during critical budget times, directly contributed to \nkeeping the Air National Guard ready, relevant and reliable to serve \nboth our state and federal military requirements well into the future. \nHe is an outstanding American.''\n  I couldn't agree more. And so, I congratulate Hugh Broomall for his \nyears of exemplary service and countless contributions to the Delaware \nNational Guard, as well as the national military community, the people \nof Delaware and the country that he loves. General Broomall is an \nexemplary citizen, and on behalf of all Delawareans I would like to \nthank him and his family for their many sacrifices during his 38 years \nof service and wish him well in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5480-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SYLVIA WOODS\n\n Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to \nSylvia Woods, the ``Queen of Soul Food'' and a New York icon whose \neponymous restaurant for decades served as a home away from home for \nscores of Harlem residents, New Yorkers, Presidents, dignitaries, \ncelebrities, and visitors from all over the world.\n  As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of Sylvia's Restaurant, we \ncelebrate the life and legacy of Sylvia Woods. Ms. Woods' big heart, \nentrepreneurial spirit, and extraordinary strength exemplified the \nvibrancy of the Harlem community she helped bring together.\n  Ms. Woods was born in Hemingway, SC, in 1926. In 1954, she worked as \na waitress at Johnson's Luncheonette in Harlem. Her mother helped Ms. \nWoods pursue her dreams by mortgaging the farm in South Carolina where \nSylvia was born. Ms. Woods and her late husband Herbert used the \n$18,000 borrowed from her mother to buy the luncheonette in 1962 and \nfounded the namesake restaurant.\n  Ms. Woods' dream became an instant reality when people from all over \nthe world flocked to 126th Street and Lenox Avenue to taste Sylvia's \nworld-famous comfort food, including mouthwatering fried chicken, \ncollard greens, and peach cobbler. Ms. Woods purchased six lots which \ntook up nearly one city block on Lenox Avenue between 126th and 127th \nStreets, setting in motion the growth of the legendary soul food \nestablishment. She ran the business until she retired at age 80 and had \noverseen its expansion to seat more than 450 people.\n  Her famed eatery not only became a center of globally-renowned \ncuisine, but it also became a special meeting place for African-\nAmerican leaders. I fondly remember Sylvia's being one of the first \nplaces I visited with Rev. Al Sharpton in 2009 as Senator. I, along \nwith countless others, deeply felt the love, life, and history of this \niconic institution.\n  Ms. Woods cared deeply about the community she loved and found ways \nto give back to her beloved Harlem. The Woods family created the Sylvia \nand Herbert Woods Scholarship Endowment Foundation in 2001 to provide \nscholarships to Harlem youth.\n  Ms. Woods undoubtedly made an indelible impact on our great city and \nNation. The landmark restaurant she created will continue to thrive for \nfuture generations of New York City families. Ms. Woods' legacy, \naccomplishments, and endearing spirit will live on in Harlem and around \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5480-4", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE DISABILITY RIGHTS MOVEMENT\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the National Constitution Center in \nPhiladelphia, which opened on July 4, 2003, is the first and only \nnonprofit, nonpartisan institution devoted to the world's oldest and \nmost respected framework for democratic government: the Constitution of \nthe United States. Located on historic Independence Mall, the center is \nmany things: an interactive museum, a national town hall, and a civic \nhub for millions of visitors from around the world. It inspires active \ncitizenship by shining a spotlight on our great constitutional \nprinciples, ideals, and freedoms.\n  This Saturday, the center's main exhibition, which is called ``The \nStory of We the People,'' is inaugurating an important new addition: \nthe wheelchair used by disability-rights advocate Justin Dart, Jr., \nwhen he was present alongside President George H.W. Bush at the signing \nof the Americans with Disabilities Act on July 26, 1990. Mr. Dart used \nthat wheelchair on countless other occasions as he advocated for \npassage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and to secure for people \nwith disabilities the civil rights that all Americans hold sacred.\n  This wonderful new addition to the National Constitution Center will \nserve as a symbol of freedom for all Americans. The wheelchair will \nremind visitors of the visionary leadership and inspired advocacy of \nJustin Dart, Jr., and the courageous struggle of all those in the \ndisability rights movement who fought to pass the ADA, one of the great \ncivil rights laws of the 20th century, often referred to as the \nEmancipation Proclamation for people with disabilities.\n  Twenty-two years ago today, as President Bush signed the ADA into \nlaw, he said: ``Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come \ntumbling down.'' I was present at that White House ceremony, and I \nvividly remember the joy and pride on Justin Dart's face as he sat \naside the President. As of this Saturday, visitors to the National \nConstitution Center, when they view Justin Dart's wheelchair and \naccompanying photos, will be able to relive that great moment and \nmilestone in our Nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5480-5", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5480-S5481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING CLARISSA MARTINS\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate one of \nNevada's own, Clarissa Martins. Clarissa is a student at the University \nof Nevada, Reno, who was recently awarded the 2012 Thomas J. Bardos \nAward for her participation in cancer and nutrition\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n\nresearch. Presented by the American Association of Cancer Research, \nthis prestigious award recognizes and encourages young science students \nto pursue the field of cancer research. I am proud to honor Clarissa \nfor her commitment to the scientific community in addressing a deadly \ndisease that affects thousands of Nevadans each year.\n  For UNR senior, Clarissa, the devastating impact of cancer hit home \nwhen her mother lost her battle with pancreatic cancer in 2009. \nInspired by her mother, Clarissa began researching the intricacies of \nthis fatal disease. She is currently working on a UNR research project \nto determine rates of breast and lung cancer.\n  As someone whose family has been touched by cancer, I am humbled by \nClarissa's efforts to study the second most common cause of death in \nAmerica. Cancer is one of our most pressing health concerns in this \ncountry. Over 1.6 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed this year, \nand more than half a million Americans will lose their lives to this \ndisease. In order for our country to be better prepared to combat this \ndevastating disease, we must continue to research and provide better \noncology care.\n  I am proud that such an ambitious student calls Nevada home, and that \nshe has remained committed to fighting this deadly disease. I wish \nClarissa continued success and the best of luck in her future academic \nendeavors. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating her \non this great accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5481-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           2012 OLYMPIC GAMES\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this Friday marks the beginning of \nthe 2012 London Olympic Games. Every 4 years, our national pride is \ndisplayed as we join our family and friends to cheer on Team USA. In \nthis summer's London Games, the 530-member U.S. team will compete in 25 \nsports that span 246 medal events. Individuals and families make so \nmany sacrifices just to have the opportunity to be a part of these \ncompetitions every 4 years. Rigorous physical challenges, early morning \nworkouts, and total commitment are hallmarks of Olympians. Support of \nfamily and friends are also key to the success of these athletes.\n  Several of the team members have ties to my home State of Oklahoma. \nMany basketball players have Oklahoma ties--Blake Griffin, James \nHarden, Kevin Durant, and Russell Westbrook are all members of the USA \nbasketball team. Many of us have followed Griffin's career from his \nearly days, even before he was a University of Oklahoma Sooner. Then, \nof course Durant, Westbrook, and Harden are members of the Oklahoma \nCity Thunder team that captivated our State and drew us together on \ntheir amazing journey through the NBA playoffs this past season.\n  All eyes will be on the Team USA's rowing team as they compete for a \nmedal. Anthony Fahden of Oklahoma City, Will Newell of Oklahoma City, \nTom Peszek of Oklahoma City, Nick LaCava of Oklahoma City, and Robin \nPrendes of Oklahoma City, will compete in rowing events.\n  Our State has a rich wrestling heritage. Three wrestlers, one from \nOklahoma State University and two from the University of Oklahoma, will \nrepresent our Nation and State. Cowboy Coleman Scott and Sooners Jared \nFrayer and Sam Hazewinkel will continue that tradition in London as \nthey hit the mat for Team USA.\n  Oklahoma will also be represented during the track and field events. \nTia Brooks, a shot putter residing in Norman, secured a spot on the \nOlympic team with a big second throw at the U.S. trials. Brittany \nBorman, a javelin thrower also residing in Norman, secured first place \nand a spot on the U.S. team on her final throw at U.S. trials.\n  In gymnastics, Norman resident Jake Dalton will regale audiences on \nthe vault and floor exercises. Meanwhile, in the pool, Mary Killman, \nwho was born in Ada, will compete in solo, duet, and team synchronized \nswimming.\n  My wife Kay and I and our 20 kids and grandchildren will be watching \nthese individuals and the entire U.S. Olympic team during the London \nGames, and we wish them every success as they make our State and our \nentire Nation proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5481-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MOUNTAIN STATE SECURITY FELLOWSHIP\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nthousands of West Virginians who have chosen to serve this great Nation \nas members of our military. West Virginia is one of the most patriotic \nStates in the Nation, and we are humbled by the sacrifice of 39 brave \nWest Virginians who gave their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Throughout the generations, thousands of brave men and women gave us \nour freedom; they deserve the best we can give them in return.\n  In recognition of these values and the service of all West \nVirginians, today I am launching the Mountain State National Security \nFellowship.\n  While working on Capitol Hill or in my State offices, selected \nfellows will use the skills and experience gained while serving in our \narmed services to assist my office with military and veterans-related \nissues. They will also personally represent the West Virginia veteran \ncommunity and embody the values of all who served, including those who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n  This is our next generation of leaders, and this fellowship will help \nencourage them to develop their interest in public service. Fellows \nwill gain a firsthand understanding of how we help our constituents by \nstaying connected to their lives and serving their needs. Our office \nwill benefit from a servicemember's perspective on the problems we are \ntrying to solve.\n  This fellowship is a small but important step in a much larger \nnational problem. Veterans face the highest unemployment levels of \nalmost any group of people in our economy, and that is wrong. We need \nto do more to match our veterans with available jobs in their \ncommunities.\n  As cofounder of the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus, I have joined \nwith many colleagues from both parties to focus on the problem of \nveterans' unemployment. As we draw down from the Middle East, veterans \nwill be returning to our communities and trying to build new lives with \ntheir families, and we should do everything we can to put their \nincredible skills to good use.\n  In my own office, we employ four veterans, and they are the most \ndedicated, trained, committed kind of employees imaginable. I am so \nappreciative to have that quality of a workforce in my office.\n  As a nation, we fly the flag and we proudly display yellow ribbons, \nbut if you really want to say thank you to someone who was willing to \nsacrifice and give their all, you hire a veteran. They are well \ntrained, disciplined, and ready to go to work.\n  That is the drive behind our jobs caucus, our ``I Hire Veterans'' \nproject, and this fellowship program. It is easy to talk the talk, but \nyou have to walk the walk, and this fellowship is one way for us to do \nso.\n  I want to say thank you to all West Virginia veterans and their \nfamilies and that it will be an honor to work with you as Mountain \nState National Security Fellows.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5481-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5481-S5482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING COZY HARBOR SEAFOOD\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, with over 220 miles of beautiful \nAtlantic coastline, my home State knows the benefits and the rigors of \nliving off the water. The very mention of Maine will evoke, for many, \nthe pristine natural beauty and rugged terrain of our rocky coast. Hand \nin hand with these romantic images is that of hard-working fishermen, \nwhose relationship with Maine's waters is key to maintaining a thriving \nseafood market so characteristic of our State. I rise to recognize a \nsmall business whose dedication to producing and marketing a quality \nproduct epitomizes the entrepreneurial spirit so characteristic of \nMaine.\n  From its founding in 1980, Cozy Harbor Seafood of Portland, ME has \nstriven to provide a consistently high-quality product to consumers \nboth local and abroad with a recent expansion into the European \nmarkets. Specializing in processing and distributing lobster, fresh \nfish, and frozen seafood for supermarkets, seafood wholesalers,\n\n[[Page S5482]]\n\nand restaurants, Cozy Harbor is aggressively seeking new venues and \nopportunities to expand through participation in seafood expositions, \nas seen through its recent involvement at the European Seafood \nExposition and the upcoming Asian Seafood Show and China Fisheries Show \nlater this year.\n  The seafood industry in Maine is more than a profession; it is a \nlifestyle. The passion, love, and dedication shown by those in my home \nState to producing a quality product not only reaps its benefits in the \nledger books, it is also a major contributing factor in the development \nof the tradition and reputation of excellence that Maine seafood has \ncome to be known for worldwide. Through programs such as the Gulf of \nMaine Responsibly Harvested Program, the sustainability of the fishing \nindustry is further developed. Cozy Harbor also participates in the \nTrace Register which records the product's origin for consumers to view \nonline, has been recognized internationally for high-quality product, \nand has received the British Retail Consortium's certification grade A \nlevel for food safety. These efforts not only increase quality \nstandards, they ensure that the fishing industry is viable for \ngenerations to come.\n  Like many small businesses in Maine, Cozy Harbor is steadfast in \nserving the local community and giving back to the area. Its devotion \nis illustrated by its donation of approximately 500 lobsters to the \nBike MS: Great Maine Getaway sponsored annually by the National MS \nSociety's New England chapter, which supports multiple sclerosis \nresearch and programs in the New England area.\n  Cozy Harbor exhibits the ingenuity, commitment to quality, and \ndedication to competing in an ever-growing market that is so \ncharacteristic of entrepreneurs in Maine. I commend Cozy Harbor on its \nsuccess and offer my best wishes for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5482-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ARVID ``BUTCH'' HILLER\n\n Mr. TESTER.

The dam was a massive endeavor for the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, standing 245 feet tall with an earth fill volume of 92 \nmillion cubic yards and a concrete fill volume of 1,122,000 yards. The \nreservoir stretches 231 miles to Bismarck, ND. The Oahe Dam is the 14th \nlargest manmade reservoir in the world.\n  Oahe Dam is beneficial not only to South Dakota but throughout the \nMidwest. The powerplant on the dam is the largest producer of energy on \nthe Missouri River. North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, \nand Montana receive power produced by the Oahe Dam. Local farmers and \nranchers benefit from the irrigation that is provided from the \nreservoir.\n  I would like to recognize the efforts of all those who have \ncontributed to the construction and maintenance of the Oahe Dam. It has \nbecome one of South Dakota's greatest resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5482-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING GROSSENBURG IMPLEMENT\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 75th \nanniversary of Grossenburg Implement. The company was founded during \nthe Great Depression in 1937 by Charles Jacob Grossenburg in Tripp \nCounty, SD. The demand for two-cylinder tractors during World War II \nled to the company's success and prosperity. Since then, Grossenburg \nImplement has stayed true to their mission statement ``to provide the \nbest product at a reasonable price and with the highest level of \nservice.'' Along with products from John Deere, Grossenburg sold \nOldsmobile and Cadillac automobiles. Throughout the years, the \nGrossenburg family remained dedicated to quality service and continued \nsuccess.\n  Charlie, son of Barry and Marilyn Grossenburg, represents the fourth \ngeneration of the family business and is now the vice president. In \n1998, Grossenburg Implement continued its success by adding a combine \nshop in Winner and subsequently an overhead crane to the shop in 2005. \nIn 2009, the company also celebrated the opening of another combine \nshop in Pierre. Most recently in 2012, the company expanded their \nbusiness by purchasing Northeast Equipment, Inc. in Nebraska. Today, \nthe company has grown from one store to a projected $150 million \ncompany.\n  I would like to congratulate the Grossenburg family and the employees \nof Grossenburg Implement for 75 years of success and wish them a \nprosperous future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5482-4", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5482-S5483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Inouye) announced that on today, July \n26, 2012, he had signed the following enrolled bill, previously signed \nby the Speaker of the House:\n\n       S. 1335.

A bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, to provide for \nthe development of a plan to increase oil and gas exploration, \ndevelopment, and production under oil and gas leases of Federal land, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss this comprehensive plan \nfor energy security for our Nation.\n  When I say ``energy security,'' I mean producing more energy than we \nconsume. I believe, with this approach, within 5 to 7 years we can \ntruly be a nation that is energy secure. Again, I mean producing more \nenergy than we consume. This comprehensive plan for energy security is \nabout truly producing all our energy resources in this country.\n  Many of these bills in this package of Energy bills have already been \npassed by the House that we are introducing now in the Senate, as well \nas additional legislation--ideas that Senators have put forward that \nwere adding to it as well.\n  The approach is similar to the approach we have taken in North Dakota \nover the last decade. My home State of North Dakota has developed all \nits energy resources--both traditional and renewable--in a vigorous way \nover the last decade, and we are now an energy powerhouse for the \nNation. We can see what we are doing in oil and gas, but we are doing a \ntremendous amount in all other forms of energy as well--both \ntraditional and renewable. It is because we worked in a very inclusive \nway to include everybody's ideas in building a comprehensive energy \nplan that we call Empower ND--Empower North Dakota.\n  There was no one person who came up this whole comprehensive plan or \nwith all the ideas, but we reached out to everyone--all the different \nenergy sectors--and said: Let's collaborate, let's work together, let's \npass a comprehensive energy plan, and then let's keep improving it. \nLet's make it a process rather than a one-time product and keep adding \nideas and bringing forth items that will help us spur and drive our \nenergy development in the State, ideas that will create the kind of \nbusiness climate that will truly empower private investment--private \ninvestment that will deploy the new technologies that not only produce \nmore energy but do it with sound environmental stewardship. That is \nexactly what is happening in North Dakota, and that is exactly what \nneed to do at the national level.\n  This Domestic Energy and Jobs Act clearly demonstrates that we have \nan energy plan and that we are ready to go and that we are coordinating \nwith our colleagues in the House as well. Right now there are 30 \nsponsors for this legislation, including the Republican leadership, as \nwell as the energy leaders.\n  It also is a plan which has reached out to what the House calls their \nHEAT team--which stands for House Energy Action Team. Representative \nMcCarthy and others, certainly Fred Upton, who is head of their Energy \nand Commerce Committee, Representative Hastings, and others who are \ntruly energy leaders in the House--people whom I have worked with on \nthings such as the Keystone Pipeline, Representative Terry and \nRepresentative Connie Mack and others.\n  This is about getting people involved in an inclusive way and putting \nin place an energy policy that truly serves this Nation and empowers \nprivate investment. We see how important that is now.\n  We have hundreds of billions of investment dollars waiting to be \ninvested in producing more energy, more jobs, and more security for our \ncountry. This approach will empower private investment to develop all \nour energy resources. It does things such as reduce the regulatory \nburden, streamlines permitting--both onshore and offshore--and helps us \ndevelop vital infrastructure such as the Keystone Pipeline. It develops \nour resources on public lands, including our renewables, and setting \nrealistic goals with a market-based approach, not picking winners or \nlosers, and preserving multiple use on our public lands throughout this \ncountry. It would put in a freeze and require a study of rules that are \ndriving up our gasoline prices.\n  It also includes a bill from Senator Murkowski. It directs the U.S. \nGeological Survey to establish an inventory of critical minerals in the \nUnited States and to set policies to help us develop those minerals.\n  What is the impact? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in March of 2011, \nundertook a study. In that study, they looked and determined there are \nmore\n\n[[Page S5489]]\n\nthan 350 energy projects that are being held up because of an inability \nto get permitted or a regulatory burden or other hurdles and \nroadblocks. In that study, they determined that if these energy \nprojects--again, more than 350 energy projects--could be green-lighted, \nit would $1.1 trillion in additional gross domestic product and 1.9 \nmillion jobs a year--1.9 million jobs a year just in the construction \nphase for those energy projects.\n  So this legislation isn't just about energy for our country. It is \nabout energy. It is about a comprehensive approach--more than 13 \ndifferent pieces of legislation, many of which have already passed the \nHouse. It is about a comprehensive approach to get development of our \nenergy resources underway in a big way. But it is about job creation. \nIt is about economic growth. It is about economic growth that will help \nus get the 13 million-plus people who are currently unemployed back to \nwork. It is about economic growth that will help us generate revenue to \nreduce our deficit and our debt, and it truly is about national \nsecurity.\n  Look what is going on right now in the Middle East. Look what is \ngoing on in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt with the rise of the Muslim \nBrotherhood. Look at the instability. Yet we still depend on oil from \nthe Middle East and places such as Venezuela. There is no need for \nthat. We can produce our own energy and more. It is an interconnected \nworld. We all know that.\n  So when I talk about energy security, I mean producing more energy \nthan we consume. That is what I mean by energy security. Of course, \nwhen there is an increased supply, what happens? It helps bring prices \ndown. Think of the impact that has for families and for our economy.\n  Just recently, in the last few days, a company called CNOOC out of \nChina--which is essentially a Chinese Government-owned company--offered \n$15 billion to buy Nexen, a major Canadian oil company--$15 billion. \nWhy did they do that? To buy energy resources in Canada, so China would \nown energy resources in Canada.\n  As you know, I have been down on the floor many times, and I have \nworked very hard to get the Keystone Pipeline approved because if we \ndon't produce and get that oil from Canada, somebody else will, and \nChina is working to do just that.\n  So after the administration held up the Keystone XL Pipeline, what \nhappened? Canadian Prime Minister Harper went to China. There, he met \nwith Chairman Wu and the other energy leaders in China and they signed \nan MOU or MOA, a memorandum of understanding/memorandum of agreement.\n  In it, what did they say? They said China and Canada are going to \ncooperate on developing resources, energy resources in Canada. Of \ncourse, that energy then goes to China.\n  The question we have to ask is are we going to work with our closest \nfriend and ally, Canada, to develop things such as the Keystone XL \nPipeline so oil will come from Canada to the United States rather than \ngoing to China.\n  Or are we in this country going to be in a position where we have to \nbuy our oil back from the Chinese? I know how the Americans want that \nquestion answered. That is what I am talking about. We need to be \ndeveloping these energy resources in this country, and together with \nour closest friend and ally, Canada, we can do it.\n  There is another important point to be made here. I know there are \nsome opponents of developing the Canadian oil sands concerned about \nCO2 emissions. But here are some things they have to think \nabout. Already you can see China coming in, working with Canada to \ndevelop those resources. So those resources are going to be developed. \nThe question is, is that oil going to China or is it going to come to \nthe United States?\n  The point is this: By building pipelines, we not only bring it to the \nUnited States but we empower investment in the Canadian oil sands that \nwill help us produce more energy but do it with better environmental \nstewardship. Eighty percent of the new development in the Canadian oil \nsands is what is called ``in situ,'' which means drilling instead of \nthe excavation. That means lower CO2 emissions, that means \nemissions very much in line with what we produce now in the United \nStates with our conventional drilling.\n  We have an opportunity, an incredible opportunity. We need to seize \nit with both hands. As I say, we can be energy secure in this country \nwithin 5 years. I think when people look at what is going on in the \nMiddle East, when they see our soldiers over there, when they see the \ninstability that is being created by regimes like Syria or Iran, when \nthey see what is going on in countries like Egypt and they understand \nthere could be an event that closes the Strait of Hormuz, they \nunderstand what that would mean for oil prices and energy prices in \nthis country.\n  We do not want to be dependent on that situation, which means it is \ntime to act. This is not about spending money; this is about generating \njobs and generating revenue that will help us reduce our deficit, that \nwill put our people to work, that will unleash the private investment, \nthe entrepreneurship, the ingenuity of the American people to truly \npropel our Nation forward, to propel our economy forward, and to make \nus safer and more secure. The time has come to act. The House passed \nmuch of this plan with bipartisan support. We need to do the same in \nthe Senate.\n  This is not the end of the story. This is an important part, the \nfoundation, if you will, of building the right energy story for our \ncountry. We can do it and I urge my colleagues to join me in this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. \n        Whitehouse):\n  S. 3452. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to establish a \nnational usury rate for consumer credit transactions; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as our economy continues to recover, \nfamilies across America are still facing financial hardships. Our \npriority to help working families must persevere, and we must protect \nthem from future financial harm.\n  Some have compared today's predatory lending practices to the \nsubprime lending that caused the financial crisis in 2008. We need to \nfree our financial system from these abuses and prevent consumers from \nnever-ending debt traps.\n  Today I am introducing the Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable \nCredit Rates Act to protect consumers from aggressive predatory lending \npractices. The bill caps annualized interest rates on consumer credit \nat 36 percent.\n  Consumers spend over $30 billion every year on predatory payday \nloans, high-cost overdraft loans, and other forms of credit. Imagine if \na portion of that $300 billion ten-year cost of credit could be \nredirected towards buying American goods and services.\n  In an era that has called for trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail \nout banks and jumpstart economic demand, this proposal costs the \ntaxpayers nothing. In fact, in the case of payday lending, it could \npotentially save billions of dollars in fees and interest paid by the \n12 million American taxpayers who use these products annually.\n  The Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act would \nestablish a new federal annualized Fee and Interest Rate calculation--\nthe FAIR--and institute a 36 percent cap for all types of consumer \ncredit.\n  In 2006, Congress enacted a Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap \nfor certain credit products marketed to military servicemembers and \ntheir families, which curbed payday, car title, and other forms of \ncredit around military bases. My bill would provide the same \nprotections for all Americans.\n  Although I hope to gain widespread support for this bill from \nresponsible lenders, I understand that some of the financial service \nfirms in this country will be uneasy with a broad bill establishing a \nhigh interest rate cap.\n  There are those that will claim it is not possible to create a \nprofitable, small-dollar, short-term loan with APR capped at 36 percent \nand consumer protections. However, there are financial institutions \nthat currently offer access to quick credit through products with \nconsumer protections and interest less than 36 percent. I hope with the \nintroduction of this bill we can open an honest conversation about \nconsumer credit rates and how it impacts American families.\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\n  I would first start by asking what services these firms provide that \ncan justify charging customers over 36 percent in annual interest. How \ndo lenders in my home state of Illinois justify charging annual rates \nover 400 percent? In my opinion, there is no justification.\n  Consider 66 year-old Rosa Mobley, who lives on Social Security and a \nsmall pension.\n  The Chicago Tribune reports that Ms. Mobley took out a car title \nloan--a type of payday loan in which the borrowers put up their cars as \ncollateral--for $1,000. Ms. Mobley was charged 300 percent interest.\n  She wound up paying more than $4,000 over 28 months and at the time \nof the report was struggling just to get by.\n  This bill would require that all fees and finance changes be included \nin the new usury rate calculation and would require all lending to \nconform to the limit, thereby eliminating the many loopholes that have \nallowed these predatory practices to flourish.\n  It would not preempt stronger state laws, it would allow states' \nattorneys general to help enforce this new rate cap, and it would \nprovide for strong civil penalties to deter lender violations.\n  The Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act would \neliminate predatory lenders, as well as would help borrowers make \nsmarter choices.\n  The Truth in Lending Act was enacted over 40 years ago to help \nconsumers compare the costs of borrowing when buying a home, a car, or \nother items by establishing a standard Annual Percentage Rate that all \nlenders should advertise.\n  My first mentor in politics, the late Senator Paul Douglas from my \nhome state of Illinois, said all the way back in 1963 that too often \nlenders:\n\n       compound the camouflaging of credit by loading on all sorts \n     of extraneous fees, such as exorbitant fees for credit life \n     insurance, excessive fees for credit investigation, and all \n     sorts of loan processing fees which rightfully should be \n     included in the percentage rate statement so that any \n     percentage rate quoted is meaningless and deceptive.\n\n  That was before anyone had ever heard of ``subprime lending.''\n  Unfortunately, as the use of credit has exploded and as the \ncomplexity of the credit products offered by lenders has become mind-\nboggling, Congress and the Federal Reserve have taken several actions \nsince the passage of Truth in Lending to weaken the APR as a tool for \ncomparison shopping. Today, many fees can be excluded from the rate \nthat is given to borrowers. The APR no longer gives consumers the \nconvenient and accurate information it once did.\n  This bill would give consumers a way to accurately compare credit \noptions, by requiring that the new FAIR calculation be disclosed both \nfor open-end credit plans such as credit cards and for closed-end \ncredit such as mortgages and payday loans.\n  On a related note, I commend my colleague, Senator Jeff Merkley of \nOregon, who introduced the SAFE Lending Act of 2012 earlier this week. \nI am proud to be an original cosponsor of the bill. The bill would \nrequire better compliance among lenders within existing laws and \nprovide new enforcement measures for offshore lenders or those who \nclaim the right to tribal sovereign immunity. These provisions, along \nwith further consumer protections offered within his bill, offer much-\nneeded lending reforms.\n  Various Federal and State loopholes allow unscrupulous lenders to \ncharge struggling consumers 400 percent annual interest for payday \nloans on average, 300 percent annual interest for car title loans, up \nto 3500 percent annual interest for bank overdraft loans, and triple-\ndigit rates for online installment loans.\n  As Congress continues to address economic challenges facing our \nnation, I urge my colleagues to also consider simple solutions to help \nworking families make ends meet. We can help give more money to \nAmerican consumers today without borrowing money that must be repaid \ntomorrow. Let's start by eliminating some of the worst abuses in \nlending by establishing a reasonable fee and interest rate cap.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Protecting Consumers from \nUnreasonable Credit Rates Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Consumers from \n     Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) attempts have been made to prohibit usurious interest \n     rates in America since colonial times;\n       (2) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress enacted a \n     Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap for service members \n     and their families for covered credit products, as defined by \n     the Department of Defense, which curbed payday, car title, \n     and tax refund lending around military bases;\n       (3) notwithstanding such attempts to curb predatory \n     lending, high-cost lending persists in all 50 States due to \n     loopholes in State laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms \n     of credit, and the exportation of unregulated interest rates \n     permitted by preemption;\n       (4) due to the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap, \n     consumers annually pay approximately $23,700,000,000 for \n     high-cost overdraft loans, as much as $8,100,000,000 for \n     storefront and online payday loans, and additional amounts in \n     unreported revenues from bank direct deposit advance loans \n     and high-cost online installment loans;\n       (5) cash-strapped consumers pay on average 400 percent \n     annual interest for payday loans, 300 percent annual interest \n     for car title loans, up to 3,500 percent for bank overdraft \n     loans, and triple-digit rates for online installment loans;\n       (6) a national maximum interest rate that includes all \n     forms of fees and closes all loopholes is necessary to \n     eliminate such predatory lending; and\n       (7) alternatives to predatory lending that encourage small \n     dollar loans with minimal or no fees, installment payment \n     schedules, and affordable repayment periods should be \n     encouraged.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.\n\n       The Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 141.

A bill to provide for an increase in the Federal minimum \nwage; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor many times over \nthe past couple of years to talk about the decline of the American \nDream. The American Dream is supposed to be about building a better \nlife. If you work hard and play by the rules, you should be able to \nsupport your family, join the middle class, and provide a brighter \nfuture for your children. Unfortunately, this dream is nothing more \nthan an illusion for millions of hardworking people who are trying to \nget by working in low-wage jobs. They are working hard and playing by \nthe rules, but they face declining wages, declining opportunities, and \ndeclining economic security. Even working full-time, all year round, \nthey can't make ends meet, much less join the middle class. That is not \nwhat America is supposed to be about.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation that has one of the \nsimplest and most effective policy solutions for shoring up the wages \nand financial security of our nation's low-wage workers. My bill, the \nFair Minimum Wage Act of 2012, will raise the minimum wage. I would \nlike to recognize my colleague in the House of Representatives, Ranking \nMember on the Education and Workforce Committee, George Miller, who is \njoining me in this effort.\n  My bill will do three things: First, it will raise the minimum wage \nto $9.80 per hour in three steps over the course of 2 years. Second, it \nwill link the minimum wage in the future to increases in the cost of \nliving, through the Consumer Price Index, so that low-wage workers no \nlonger fall further and further behind. Third, for the first time in \nmore than 20 years, it will raise the minimum wage lags for tipped \nworkers, from a paltry $2.13 per hour to a level that is 70 percent of \nthe full minimum wage, or around $6.85 per hour. This will be a gradual \nchange, accomplished over 5 years, that will give businesses time to \nadjust while providing more fairness for hardworking people who work in \ntipped industries.\n  This bill and these raises are long overdue. We all know that working \nAmericans' paychecks have been stagnant for decades. But the situation \nis even worse for minimum wage workers. Today the minimum wage lags far \nbehind its historic levels. It hasn't kept up with any other indicator \nin our economy, not with costs, or average wages, or our still rapid \ngrowth in productivity.\n  At its peak value in 1968, the minimum wage was worth more than \n$10.50 in today's dollars. That means that the minimum wage has lost 31 \npercent of its buying power since the late 1960s. How can we possibly \nallow this to be? Costs have been rising in real terms, on everything \nfrom food and rent to big-ticket items like health care and a college \neducation. But Congress has let the minimum wage languish. The lowest \nwage workers in our society simply cannot afford this.\n  Even if we measured the minimum wage against other indicators in our \neconomy, it has not kept up. The minimum wage used to be more than half \nof average wages; now it is barely a third. In the 1960s and 1970s, the \nminimum wage kept a family of three above the poverty line, 20 percent \nabove it in 1968. But today, the minimum wage lags behind the poverty \nline by 16 percent. And let's not forget that the poverty line is a \nwoefully inadequate measure of what families really need by any \nrealistic measure. Who in this chamber could support two children on \n$18,000 per year, which is the official poverty line? Yet the minimum \nwage only pays $15,000 a year to someone working full-time who never \ntakes a single day off all year. My bill will raise the minimum wage to \nabout $20,000 per year, and it will maintain the wage at a level that \nkeeps up with rising costs.\n  While workers are working longer and harder than ever, their \npaychecks don't reflect that contribution. If the minimum wage had kept \nup with productivity growth since 1968, it would be nearly $22 an hour \nthis year; even if it had kept up with just one-quarter of productivity \ngrowth, it would be $12.25 per hour. So while companies have reaped the \nbenefits of all this productivity growth, the people who actually do \nthe work have seen none of its value. It has all gone to executive \nmanagement and shareholders. It has gone to profits, not the people who \ndo the work.\n  There will be tens of millions of people in this country who will \nbenefit from this legislation. Twenty-eight million workers will get a \nraise, either directly by the legislation, or indirectly through the \n``trickle up'' effects of a higher wage floor--that is more than a \nfifth of our workforce that will be impacted. Among them, more than \nhalf are women, and more than four in ten are people of color--both of \nthese groups are overrepresented in low-wage work. They are the ones \nwho care for our children and elders, who clean our offices and \nfactories, who serve us food, who keep our economic engine running. \nThese are some of the hardest jobs and\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\nhardest workers, and yet their pay is simply paltry. We will never have \nfair wages for women or greater racial equality if the minimum wage is \nnot a just and fair minimum wage.\n  The families of these 28 million workers will also benefit. More than \n21 million children have parents who will get a raise. This will be so \nmeaningful to these families. After all, children represent more than a \nthird of poor Americans. Nearly half of children, 44 percent, are poor \nor low-income, and even among families with parents working full-time \nyear-round, nearly three in ten children are poor or low-income. This \nis largely because wages are much too low to support a family.\n  Yet wages aren't low because our economy can't afford them. No. Our \neconomic growth is going to profits, not to workers. Inequality is at \nthe highest level we've seen since the eve of the Great Depression. \nCEOs are raking in millions--even if their companies are not performing \nwell--while low-wage workers are barely able to put food on the table, \nand even then it is often with the help of food stamps. Last year, the \naverage CEO earned nearly $13 million. That was after a 23 percent \nraise in 2010 and a 14 percent raise in 2011. Minimum wage workers had \nno raises in those years. But CEOs are getting $13 million a year. That \nis more than $6,200 an hour. A CEO earns more before lunch on his first \nday of work than a minimum wage worker earns in an entire year.\n  Some people will criticize this measure, saying it will force \nbusinesses to lay off workers, and that workers will actually be hurt \nby getting a raise. History proves that these assertions are simply \nwrong. We know from decades of rigorous research that minimum wage \nraises along the lines of what I am proposing do not have negative jobs \neffects--and if there are any effects on jobs, they are small, but \npositive effects. This goes for teenagers, too; study after study \nconfirms minimum wage raises do not cause teenage unemployment.\n  Indeed, businesses are helped when their workers get a raise because \nraising the minimum wage acts like a stimulus. Businesses will reap \nmore in sales when their customers have more money in their pockets, \nand they will save money through increased productivity and morale and \nreduced turnover. My bill will put an extra $40 billion in the hands of \nlow-wage workers and their families. We know that these workers don't \nhave much if any room for savings--they will go out and spend it, and \nthis will benefit the local businesses in their communities. Indeed, \nthis extra spending power will boost GDP by more than $25 billion and \nadd 100,000 jobs, as increased economic activity ripples through the \neconomy.\n  Businesses will also save from reduced turnover cost, since turnover \nrates fall when workers earn more money. It can cost thousands of \ndollars to recruit, hire, and train new employees, even for low-skill \njobs. Of course all businesses would have the same minimum wage, \nmeaning no business would be any worse off than a competitor. A raise \nin the minimum wage would also reduce competitive disadvantage faced by \nbusinesses that already pay a higher wage. These businesses should be \nrewarded, not punished for paying fair wages.\n  We must also look at what is happening in our economy. We are \nbecoming a low-wage economy. Low-wage jobs are growing faster than \nmiddle- or high-wage jobs. Over the next decade, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics estimates that 7 of the 10 occupations with the largest job \ngrowth will be low-wage jobs. With so much of our economy moving to the \nlow end of the wage scale, we must ensure that those wages are \nadequate.\n  It is long past time to establish a fair minimum wage in our country. \nIt is good for families, good for business and good for our economy. \nMost importantly, it is the right thing to do. People who work hard for \na living should not have to live in poverty. I am proud to introduce \nthis bill today, to raise the minimum wage, and to help tens of \nmillions of workers and their families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record. as follows:\n\n                                S. 3453\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Washington Convention Center, \n     in Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas AIDS 2012, organized by the International AIDS \n     Society, is expected to convene more than 20,000 delegates, \n     including 2,000 journalists, from nearly 200 countries;\n       Whereas the theme of AIDS 2012, ``Turning the Tide \n     Together'', embodies the promise and urgency of utilizing \n     recent scientific advances in HIV/AIDS treatment and \n     biomedical prevention, continuing research for an HIV vaccine \n     and cure, and increasing effective, evidence-based \n     interventions in key settings to change the course of the \n     HIV/AIDS crisis;\n       Whereas AIDS 2012 seeks to engage governments, \n     nongovernmental organizations, policymakers, the scientific \n     community, the private sector, civil society, faith-based \n     organizations, the media, and people living with HIV/AIDS to \n     more effectively address regional, national, and local \n     responses to HIV/AIDS around the world and overcome barriers \n     that limit access to preventative care, treatment, and other \n     services; and\n       Whereas AIDS 2012 is a tremendous opportunity to strengthen \n     the role of the United States in global HIV/AIDS initiatives \n     within the context of significant global economic challenges, \n     reenergize the response to the domestic epidemic, and focus \n     particular attention on the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS \n     that continues in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the XIX International AIDS Conference and the \n     goal of renewing awareness of, and commitment to, addressing \n     the HIV/AIDS crisis in the United States and abroad;\n       (2) recognizes that continued HIV/AIDS research, \n     prevention, and treatment programs are crucial to improving \n     global health;\n       (3) understands that the key to overcoming HIV/AIDS \n     includes efforts to formulate sound public health policy, \n     protect human rights, address the needs of women and girls, \n     direct effective programming toward the populations at the \n     highest risk of infection, ensure accountability, and combat \n     stigma, poverty, and other social challenges related to HIV/\n     AIDS;\n       (4) seeks to work with all stakeholders--\n       (A) to prevent the transmission of HIV;\n       (B) to increase access to testing, treatment, and care;\n       (C) to improve health outcomes for all people living with \n     HIV/AIDS; and\n       (D) to foster greater scientific and programmatic \n     collaborations around the world to translate scientific \n     advances and apply best practices to international efforts to \n     end HIV/AIDS;\n       (5) commits to supporting a stronger global response to \n     HIV/AIDS, protecting the rights of people living with HIV/\n     AIDS, and working to create an ``AIDS-free generation''; and\n       (6) encourages the ongoing development in the public and \n     private sectors of innovative therapies and advances in \n     clinical treatment for HIV/AIDS, including--\n       (A) new and improved biomedical and behavioral prevention \n     strategies;\n       (B) safer and more affordable, accessible, and effective \n     treatment regimens for infected individuals; and\n       (C) research for an HIV vaccine and cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5494-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5494-S5495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2581.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to lay before the Senate \na message from the House with respect to S. 1959.\n  The Presiding officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 1959) entitled \n     ``An Act to require a report on the designation of the \n     Haqqani Network as a foreign terrorist organization and for \n     other purposes,'' do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Haqqani Network Terrorist \n     Designation Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF THE HAQQANI NETWORK AS A \n                   FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A report of the Congressional Research Service on \n     relations between the United States and Pakistan states that \n     ``[t]he terrorist network led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his \n     son Sirajuddin, based in the FATA, is commonly identified as \n     the most dangerous of Afghan insurgent groups battling U.S.-\n     led forces in eastern Afghanistan''.\n       (2) The report further states that, in mid-2011, the \n     Haqqanis undertook several high-visibility attacks in \n     Afghanistan. First, a late June assault on the \n     Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul by 8 Haqqani gunmen and \n     suicide bombers left 18 people dead. Then, on September 10, a \n     truck bomb attack on a United States military base by Haqqani \n     fighters in the Wardak province injured 77 United States \n     troops and killed 5 Afghans. A September 13 attack on the \n     United\n\n[[Page S5625]]\n\n     States Embassy compound in Kabul involved an assault that \n     sparked a 20-hour-long gun battle and left 16 Afghans dead, 5 \n     police officers and at least 6 children among them.\n       (3) The report further states that ``U.S. and Afghan \n     officials concluded the Embassy attackers were members of the \n     Haqqani network''.\n       (4) In September 22, 2011, testimony before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff Admiral Mullen stated that ``[t]he Haqqani network, \n     for one, acts as a veritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services \n     Intelligence agency. With ISI support, Haqqani operatives \n     plan and conducted that [September 13] truck bomb attack, as \n     well as the assault on our embassy. We also have credible \n     evidence they were behind the June 28th attack on the \n     Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul and a host of other smaller \n     but effective operations''.\n       (5) In October 27, 2011, testimony before the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, Secretary of \n     State Hillary Clinton stated that ``we are taking action to \n     target the Haqqani leadership on both sides of the border. \n     We're increasing international efforts to squeeze them \n     operationally and financially. We are already working with \n     the Pakistanis to target those who are behind a lot of the \n     attacks against Afghans and Americans. And I made it very \n     clear to the Pakistanis that the attack on our embassy was an \n     outrage and the attack on our forward operating base that \n     injured 77 of our soldiers was a similar outrage.''.\n       (6) At the same hearing, Secretary of State Clinton further \n     stated that ``I think everyone agrees that the Haqqani \n     Network has safe havens inside Pakistan; that those safe \n     havens give them a place to plan and direct operations that \n     kill Afghans and Americans.''.\n       (7) On November 1, 2011, the United States Government added \n     Haji Mali Kahn to a list of specially designated global \n     terrorists under Executive Order 13224. The Department of \n     State described Khan as ``a Haqqani Network commander'' who \n     has ``overseen hundreds of fighters, and has instructed his \n     subordinates to conduct terrorist acts.'' The designation \n     continued, ``Mali Khan has provided support and logistics to \n     the Haqqani Network, and has been involved in the planning \n     and execution of attacks in Afghanistan against civilians, \n     coalition forces, and Afghan police''. According to Jason \n     Blazakis, the chief of the Terrorist Designations Unit of the \n     Department of State, Khan also has links to al-Qaeda.\n       (8) Five other top Haqqani Network leaders have been placed \n     on the list of specially designated global terrorists under \n     Executive Order 13224 since 2008, and three of them have been \n     so placed in the last year. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the overall \n     leader of the Haqqani Network as well as the leader of the \n     Taliban's Mira shah Regional Military Shura, was designated \n     by the Secretary of State as a terrorist in March 2008, and \n     in March 2009, the Secretary of State put out a bounty of \n     $5,000,000 for information leading to his capture. The other \n     four individuals so designated are Nasiruddin Haqqani, Khalil \n     al Rahman Haqqani, Badruddin Haqqani, and Mullah Sangeen \n     Zadran.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Haqqani Network meets the criteria for designation \n     as a foreign terrorist organization as set forth in section \n     219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189); \n     and\n       (2) the Secretary of State should so designate the Haqqani \n     Network as a foreign terrorist organization under such \n     section 219.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress--\n       (A) a detailed report on whether the Haqqani Network meets \n     the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist \n     organization as set forth in section 219 of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189); and\n       (B) if the Secretary determines that the Haqqani Network \n     does not meet the criteria set forth under such section 219, \n     a detailed justification as to which criteria have not been \n     met.\n       (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n       (3) Appropriate committees of congress defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed to \n     infringe upon the sovereignty of Pakistan to combat militant \n     or terrorist groups operating inside the boundaries of \n     Pakistan.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I make a motion to concur in the House amendment, and I \nknow of no further debate on this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lions Clubs International \n     Century of Service Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Lions Clubs International is the world's largest \n     service club organization founded in 1917 by Chicago business \n     leader Melvin Jones. Lions Clubs International empowers \n     volunteers to serve their communities, meet humanitarian \n     needs, encourage peace and promote international \n     understanding through Lions clubs.\n       (2) Today, Lions Clubs International has over 1.35 million \n     members in more than 45,000 clubs globally, extending its \n     mission of service throughout the world every day.\n       (3) In 1945, Lions Clubs International became one of the \n     first nongovernmental organizations invited to assist in \n     drafting the United Nations Charter and has enjoyed a special \n     relationship with the United Nations ever since.\n       (4) In 1968, Lions Clubs International Foundation was \n     established to assist with global and large-scale local \n     humanitarian projects and has since then awarded more than \n     $700 million to fund five unique areas of service: preserving \n     sight, combating disability, promoting health, serving youth \n     and providing disaster relief.\n       (5) In 1990, the Lions Clubs International Foundation \n     launched the SightFirst program to build comprehensive eye \n     care systems to fight the major causes of blindness and care \n     for the blind or visually impaired. Thanks to the generosity \n     of Lions worldwide, over $415 million has been raised, \n     resulting in the prevention of serious vision loss in 30 \n     million people and improved eye care for hundreds of millions \n     of people.\n       (6) On June 7, 2017, Lions Clubs International will \n     celebrate 100 years of community service to men, women, and \n     children in need throughout the world.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration en bloc of the following \nresolutions which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 529, S. Res. \n530, and S. Res. 531.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolutions en bloc.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed \nto, the preambles be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table en bloc with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements related to the resolutions be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 529\n\n       Whereas the incidence of prostate cancer in African-\n     American men is more than one and a half times higher than in \n     any other racial or ethnic group in the United States;\n       Whereas African-American men have the highest mortality \n     rate of any ethnic and racial group in the United States, \n     dying at a rate that is approximately two and a half times \n     higher than other ethnic and racial groups;\n       Whereas that rate of mortality represents the largest \n     disparity of mortality rates in any of the major cancers;\n       Whereas prostate cancer can be cured with early detection \n     and the proper treatment, regardless of the ethnic or racial \n     group of the cancer patient;\n       Whereas African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed \n     at an earlier age and at a later stage of cancer progression \n     than all other ethnic and racial groups, leading to lower \n     cure rates and lower chances of survival;\n       Whereas, for patients diagnosed early, studies show a 5-\n     year survival rate of nearly 100 percent, but the survival \n     rate drops significantly to 28 percent for patients diagnosed \n     in late stages; and\n       Whereas recent genomics research has increased the ability \n     to identify men at high risk for aggressive prostate cancer: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that prostate cancer has created a health \n     crisis for African-American men;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of health coverage and access \n     to care, as well as promoting informed decisionmaking between \n     men and their doctors, taking into consideration the known \n     risks and potential benefits of screening and treatment \n     options for prostate cancer;\n       (3) urges Federal agencies to support--\n       (A) research to address and attempt to end the health \n     crisis created by prostate cancer;\n       (B) efforts relating to education, awareness, and early \n     detection at the grassroots level to end that health crisis; \n     and\n       (C) the Office of Minority Health of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services in focusing on improving health and \n     healthcare outcomes for African Americans at an elevated risk \n     of prostate cancer; and\n       (4) urges investment by Federal agencies in research \n     focusing on the improvement of early detection and treatment \n     of prostate cancer, such as the use of--\n       (A) biomarkers to accurately distinguish indolent forms of \n     prostate cancer from lethal forms; and\n       (B) advanced imaging tools to ensure the best level of \n     individualized patient care.\n\n                              S. Res. 530\n\n       Whereas 2012 marks the 75th anniversary of the enactment of \n     the Act of August 16, 1937 (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.) (commonly \n     known as the ``National Apprenticeship Act''), which \n     established the national registered apprenticeship system;\n       Whereas the State of Wisconsin created the first State \n     registered apprenticeship system in 1911;\n       Whereas the Act of August 16, 1937 (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.) \n     (commonly known as the ``National Apprenticeship Act'') \n     established a comprehensive system of partnerships among \n     employers, labor organizations, educational institutions, and \n     Federal and State governments, which has shaped skill \n     training for succeeding generations of United States workers;\n       Whereas for 75 years, the national registered \n     apprenticeship system has provided state of the art training \n     using an model known as ``earn while you learn'' that offers \n     a pathway to the middle class and a sustainable career for \n     millions of workers in the United States;\n       Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system has \n     grown to include approximately 24,000 programs across the \n     United States, providing education and training for \n     apprentices in emerging and high-growth sectors, such as \n     information technology and health care, as well as in \n     traditional industries;\n       Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system \n     leverages approximately $1,000,000,000 in private investment, \n     reflecting the strong commitment of the sponsors of the \n     system, which include industry associations, individual \n     employers, and labor-management partnerships;\n       Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system is an \n     important post-secondary pathway for United States workers, \n     offering a combination of academic and technical instruction \n     with paid, on-the-job training, resulting in a nationally and \n     industry-recognized occupational credential that ensures \n     higher earnings for apprentices and a highly skilled \n     workforce for United States businesses;\n       Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system has \n     continually modernized and developed innovative training \n     approaches to meet the workforce needs of industry and \n     address the evolving challenges of staying competitive in the \n     global economy;\n       Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system of \n     the 21st century, as envisioned by the Advisory Committee on \n     Apprenticeship of the Secretary of Labor and administered as \n     a partnership between the Federal Government and State \n     apprenticeship programs, is positioned to produce the highly \n     skilled workers the United States economy needs now and in \n     the future; and\n       Whereas the celebration of National Registered \n     Apprenticeship Month--\n       (1) honors the industries that use the registered \n     apprenticeship model;\n       (2) encourages other industries that could benefit from the \n     registered apprenticeship model to train United States \n     workers using the model; and\n       (3) recognizes the role the national registered \n     apprenticeship system has played in preparing United States \n     workers for jobs with family-sustaining wages: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 2012, as ``National Registered \n     Apprenticeship Month'';\n       (2) celebrates the 101st anniversary of the enactment of \n     the first State registered apprenticeship law; and\n       (3) celebrates the 75th anniversary of the enactment of the \n     Act of August 16, 1937 (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.)

Res. 531\n\n       Whereas, for over 100 years, the Olympic Movement has built \n     a more peaceful and better world by educating young people \n     through\n\n[[Page S5627]]\n\n     amateur athletics, bringing together athletes from many \n     countries in friendly competition, and forging new \n     relationships bound by friendship, solidarity, and fair play;\n       Whereas the 2012 Olympic Games will take place in London, \n     England from July 27, 2012 to August 12, 2012, and the 2012 \n     Paralympic Games will take place from August 29, 2012 to \n     September 9, 2012;\n       Whereas, at the 2012 Olympic Games, over 200 nations will \n     compete in over 300 events, and Team USA will compete in 246 \n     events;\n       Whereas, at the 2012 Olympic Games, over 200 nations will \n     compete in 39 disciplines, and Team USA will compete in 38 of \n     those disciplines;\n       Whereas 529 Olympians and over 245 Paralympians will \n     compete on behalf of Team USA in London, England;\n       Whereas Team USA has won 934 gold medals, 730 silver \n     medals, and 643 bronze medals, totaling 2,307 medals over the \n     past 25 Olympic Games;\n       Whereas the people of the United States stand united in \n     respect and admiration for the members of the United States \n     Olympic and Paralympic teams, and the athletic \n     accomplishments, sportsmanship, and dedication to excellence \n     of the teams;\n       Whereas the many accomplishments of the United States \n     Olympic and Paralympic teams would not have been possible \n     without the hard work and dedication of many others, \n     including the United States Olympic Committee and the many \n     administrators, coaches, and family members who provided \n     critical support to the athletes;\n       Whereas the Nation takes great pride in the qualities of \n     commitment to excellence, grace under pressure, and good will \n     toward other competitors exhibited by the athletes of Team \n     USA; and\n       Whereas the Olympic Movement celebrates competition, fair \n     play, and the pursuit of dreams: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) applauds all of the athletes and coaches of Team USA \n     and their families who support them;\n       (2) supports the athletes of Team USA in their endeavors at \n     the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games held in London, \n     England;\n       (3) thanks all of the members of the United States Olympics \n     Committee for their unwavering support of the athletes of \n     Team USA; and\n       (4) supports the goals and ideals of the Olympic Games.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5627-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   XIX INTERNATIONAL AIDS CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Washington Convention Center, \n     in Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas AIDS 2012, organized by the International AIDS \n     Society, is expected to convene more than 20,000 delegates, \n     including 2,000 journalists, from nearly 200 countries;\n       Whereas the theme of AIDS 2012, ``Turning the Tide \n     Together'', embodies the promise and urgency of utilizing \n     recent scientific advances in HIV/AIDS treatment and \n     biomedical prevention, continuing research for an HIV vaccine \n     and cure, and increasing effective, evidence-based \n     interventions in key settings to change the course of the \n     HIV/AIDS crisis;\n       Whereas AIDS 2012 seeks to engage governments, \n     nongovernmental organizations, policymakers, the scientific \n     community, the private sector, civil society, faith-based \n     organizations, the media, and people living with HIV/AIDS to \n     more effectively address regional, national, and local \n     responses to HIV/AIDS around the world and overcome barriers \n     that limit access to preventative care, treatment, and other \n     services; and\n       Whereas AIDS 2012 is a tremendous opportunity to strengthen \n     the role of the United States in global HIV/AIDS initiatives \n     within the context of significant global economic challenges, \n     reenergize the response to the domestic epidemic, and focus \n     particular attention on the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS \n     that continues in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the XIX International AIDS Conference and the \n     goal of renewing awareness of, and commitment to, addressing \n     the HIV/AIDS crisis in the United States and abroad;\n       (2) recognizes that continued HIV/AIDS research, \n     prevention, and treatment programs are crucial to improving \n     global health;\n       (3) understands that the key to overcoming HIV/AIDS \n     includes efforts to formulate sound public health policy, \n     protect human rights, address the needs of women and girls, \n     direct effective programming toward the populations at the \n     highest risk of infection, ensure accountability, and combat \n     stigma, poverty, and other social challenges related to HIV/\n     AIDS;\n       (4) seeks to work with all stakeholders--\n       (A) to prevent the transmission of HIV;\n       (B) to increase access to testing, treatment, and care;\n       (C) to improve health outcomes for all people living with \n     HIV/AIDS; and\n       (D) to foster greater scientific and programmatic \n     collaborations around the world to translate scientific \n     advances and apply best practices to international efforts to \n     end HIV/AIDS;\n       (5) commits to supporting a stronger global response to \n     HIV/AIDS, protecting the rights of people living with HIV/\n     AIDS, and working to create an ``AIDS-free generation''; and\n       (6) encourages the ongoing development in the public and \n     private sectors of innovative therapies and advances in \n     clinical treatment for HIV/AIDS, including--\n       (A) new and improved biomedical and behavioral prevention \n     strategies;\n       (B) safer and more affordable, accessible, and effective \n     treatment regimens for infected individuals; and\n       (C) research for an HIV vaccine and cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/26/senate-section/article/S5627-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5627-S5628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AUTHORIZING THE PRINTING OF THE 25TH EDITION OF THE POCKET VERSION OF \n                     THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.
