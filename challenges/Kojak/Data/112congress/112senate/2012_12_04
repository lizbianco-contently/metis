Mr. President, it has been almost 3 weeks since we all met \nwith the President to avert that fiscal cliff we hear so much about. \nYesterday, after weeks of delay, and as the days dwindle and taxes are \nset to go up for millions of families and businesses, Republicans in \nthe House finally showed up at the negotiating table.\n  Now we know why they have been holding their cards so close to their \nvests. Their proposal would raise taxes on millions of middle-class \nfamilies. Their plan is to raise $800 billion in revenue by eliminating \npopular tax deductions and credits that would reach deep into the \npockets of middle-class families. Republicans are so intent on \nprotecting low tax rates for millionaires and billionaires, they are \nwilling to sacrifice middle-class families' economic security to do so.\n  In the first year, unless we do something, middle-class families; \nthat is, people making less than $250,000 a year, will get an average \nof $2,200 in additional tax, taxes they will have to pay.\n  Their proposal that we received yesterday was short on specifics, but \nwe do know from independent analysis that it is impossible to raise \nenough revenue to make a dent in the deficit\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\nwithout using one of two things: raising tax rates on the top 2 percent \nor raising taxes on the middle class.\n  As my friend, the senior Senator from Missouri, said on the Sunday \ntalk shows, the Speaker has to make a decision whether it is more \nimportant to keep his job or to do something about the economy that is \nin such difficult shape in America. He has to make a choice.\n  The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center called it mathematically impossible \nto reduce the deficit and give more tax cuts to the rich without \nharming the middle class. This is the same thing President Clinton \ntalked about so often during the campaign, saying to everyone it is \narithmetic.\n  As usual, given the choice between millionaires and billionaires and \nthe middle class, Republicans again sided with the wealthy of this \ncountry. In fact, their plan doesn't just keep rates low for the \nrichest 2 percent, it actually lowers them further. The Democrats' plan \nwould protect 98 percent of families and 97 percent of small businesses \nfrom painful tax increases by asking the top 2 percent to pay a little \nbit more to reduce the deficit.\n  The Republicans' plan, on the other hand, is more of the same. Not \nonly does it balance the budget on the backs of the middle class, it \nvoids our promise to seniors with steep cuts to Social Security and \nMedicare, all to pay for even more handouts to the rich.\n  At least we now know where they stand. Republicans have sought cover \nby invoking Erskine Bowles' name, but he has disavowed their plan in no \nuncertain terms. We are glad to finally see Republicans joining in the \nnegotiating process instead of watching from the sidelines.\n  While their proposal may be serious, it is also a nonstarter. They \nknow any agreement that raises taxes on the middle class in order to \nprotect more unnecessary giveaways to the top 2 percent is doomed from \nthe start. It will not pass.\n  Democrats would not agree to it. President Obama wouldn't sign such a \nbill, and the American people would not support it. That is in all the \npolls that are in at press this morning.\n  The American people are tired of budget-busting giveaways to the \nwealthiest few people who have enjoyed growing paychecks and shrinking \ntax bills for more than a decade. The American people want a balanced \ndeal. Simple math dictates that a balanced deal must include higher \ntaxes on the richest of the rich. Republicans would be wise to keep \nthat in mind as negotiations move forward.\n  We are willing to compromise, but we also will not consign the middle \nclass to higher tax bills while millionaires and billionaires avoid all \nthe pain.\n  I have been told the leader of the Democrats in the House will file \ntoday a discharge petition asking the Speaker to bring the bill to the \nfloor. All Democratic House Members, as far as I know, every one of \nthem will sign this discharge petition.\n  We have heard Republicans in the House who are willing to move \nforward. If every Democrat signs this, we will only need about 25 \nRepublicans to join. The American people should see that picture. With \n25 Republican votes--25 Republican votes--middle-class America would be \nable to rest assured that they will not have a tax increase at the \nfirst of the year. Twenty-five Republicans is all it would take.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7364-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, during the past couple days, we have \ndiscussed the plans of the Democratic majority to make the Senate more \n``efficient'' and to do it by breaking the rules of the Senate. It is \nwhat my Senate colleagues roundly criticized during the Bush \nadministration as ``breaking the rules to change the rules.'' It is \nsomething Senate Republicans thought about but wisely chose not to do.\n  The Senate has two great traditions, two great rights of Members and, \nby extension, the citizens they represent; the right to amend and the \nright to debate.\n  Yesterday and last week I talked about the first of these great \nSenate rights and how the Democratic majority has sought systematically \nto marginalize the minority in its exercise of this right.\n  I noted how the Democratic majority has bypassed committees to an \nunprecedented extent, how it has blocked members of the minority and \nmembers of the majority, too, from offering amendments on the Senate \nfloor before cloture is invoked and how, when that didn't shut out the \nminority, the majority used a bare majoritarian means to change Senate \nprocedure to bar the minority from offering motions to suspend the \nrules after cloture was invoked.\n  This systemic effort to marginalize the minority stands in stark \ncontrast to the trend in the House under the Republican majority. It \nhas allowed the minority in the House more chances to amend legislation \non the House floor than existed under previous majorities.\n  In fact, according to the Wall Street Journal, last year, the House \nheld more votes on amendments on the floor than it did during the 2 \nprevious years combined, when congressional Democrats were in the \nmajority.\n  When one compares the amendments and the motions voted on in the \nHouse this year with those voted on in the Senate, as the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service has done, the difference is truly \nstartling. The House minority has been able to offer 214 such motions \nand amendments, compared to only 67 for the Senate minority, which is \nmore than three times as many motions and amendments, but the minority \nin the House has had three times as many votes as the minority in the \nSenate. In terms of protecting the right of the minority to represent \ntheir constituents through amendments on the floor, the House is \nbecoming more like the Senate used to be, and the Senate is becoming \nmore like the House used to be.\n  But what about the second great right in the Senate, the right to \ndebate? How has the exercise of this right fared under the Democratic \nmajority? The short answer is not so great. The filing of cloture under \nthe Senate rules is the beginning of the process to end debate, and the \nwielding of this powerful tool is in the hands of the majority leader. \nIf one wants to simply equate the filing of cloture, if one wants to \nequate the filing of cloture with a filibuster, there is the potential \nfor the majority to generate a lot of filibusters with a quick trigger \non the cloture motion.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have painted a picture \nwhere cloture filings are needed to overcome an obstinate minority. \nCloture is needed, so we are told, because of Members of the minority \nwho refuse to stop delaying.\n  But does filing cloture on a matter, be it on a bill, an amendment or \na conference report, on the very same day the Senate is considering \nthat matter, indicate a minority that is prolonging debate or does it \nindicate a majority that is eager not to have a debate at all? To me, a \nhabitual effort to file cloture on a matter as soon as the Senate \nbegins to consider the matter indicates the latter.\n  What do the numbers show about the use of cloture by this Democratic \nmajority? According to CRS, the current Senate majority has filed \ncloture on a matter--exclusive of motions to proceed to a matter--on \nthe very same day it considered the matter three and a half times more \noften than the Senate Republicans did when they were in the majority.\n  According to CRS, Senate Republicans filed same-day cloture on a \nmatter just 30 times in 4 years. The current Democratic majority has \ndone so well over 100 times. Put another way, Senate Democrats are much \nmore apt to try to shut off debate on a matter as soon as the Senate \nbegins considering the matter than were prior majorities including, \nmost recently, Senate Republicans.\n  The desire of my Democratic colleagues to shut down debate before it \nbegins in these instances has nothing to do with overcoming resistance \nto the Senate taking up a bill because, as I have just noted, this \nanalysis specifically excludes--excludes--same-day cloture filings on a \nmotion to proceed.\n  It is not just the right to amend that has taken a hit under the \nDemocratic\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\nmajority but the right to debate as well. All Senators and all \nAmericans are disserved when these rights are systematically \nmarginalized.\n  This is not the ``golden rule'' we were promised when the Senate \nDemocrats assumed the majority in 2007--far from it.\n  Rather than continuing to diminish the great tradition to the Senate, \nrather than breaking the rules to change the rules, we need to \nstrengthen those rights and traditions. As Senator Byrd noted, \nmajorities are fleeting. One can wake after the first Tuesday in \nNovember and find oneself in the minority.\n  I say with respect, I hope our Democratic colleagues are mindful of \nthat as we continue this discussion and are prepared not only to live \nunder the rules they would change but to live with a precedent they \nwould establish by making those changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it would be hard to travel to a university \ncampus or to a chamber of commerce meeting or anyplace in the country, \ntravel just to a supermarket and talk to people where they wouldn't all \nagree that the Senate is dysfunctional, has not worked well. To show \nhow right they are is a statement made yesterday by John McCain.\n  Now, Mr. President, John McCain and I have had our political \ndifferences, but no one--no one--can quibble with the fact that John \nMcCain is an American patriot. He was a Navy aviator shot down in \nVietnam, spent years--I think it was 6\\1/2\\ or 7 years--as a prisoner \nof war, 4\\1/2\\ of those in solitary confinement.\n  He and I came to the House of Representatives together. I know how \nthe House works. I served there. While I appreciate my friend the \nRepublican leader giving me a minilecture on the House, I don't need \none. I served in the House, and I know how the House works. And I know \nwhat John McCain said yesterday because I am reading a verbatim \ntranscript from those proceedings, and here is what he said:\n\n       . . . I apologize for what seems to have happened. Much to \n     my dismay, it lends credence to the argument that maybe we \n     ought not to do business the way we are doing here in the \n     Senate.\n\n  That is a direct quote from John McCain.\n  As I said in my opening statement, I served in the House, and the \nreason I mentioned today in my opening statement about the discharge \npetition is that when I served there, under the leadership of Speaker \nO'Neill, Majority Leader Michel, and then Jim Wright and Michel, a \nRepublican, there was no way they would ever consider doing a vote with \nthe majority of the majority. They wanted to get 218 votes. That is \nwhat they did on reforming Social Security; that is what they did on \nvirtually everything--get Democrats and Republicans together and get \n218 votes.\n  And that is the challenge I gave to the Speaker today, Speaker \nBoehner. Let the House vote. One Republican House Member suggested that \nmore than half of the Republicans in the House would vote for giving \ntax security to people making less than $250,000 a year. So I say, \nlet's have Speaker Boehner call upon the Republicans in the House to \nadd 25 or so votes to what the Democrats would do, and they would have \n218 votes and we could go on to taking care of the fiscal cliff.\n  Mr. President, my friend protesteth too much. The Senate is broken, \nit needs to be fixed, and we need to change the rules. We change them \nall the time. Last year we changed the rules. Why? Because of what they \nwere doing--the Republicans--just to stop and slow down everything. \nAfter two cloture votes--and remember that takes a long time, to file \ntwo cloture motions, a couple of days and then 30 hours. So after 60 \nhours, you would think the debate would be all over. Oh no. What they \ndecided to do was to suspend the rules and have more votes. We put up \nwith it for a while--a couple here, a couple there. I think the last \ntime they had 15 or 16 motions to suspend the rules. That was enough. \nThey overruled the Chair. They can't do that anymore.\n  What the Republicans have done is they have brought the Senate to its \nknees, and that is unfortunate. We need to be able to have the Senate \noperate the way it should operate, and we need to make sure people \nunderstand how dysfunctional we are and how we need to move forward.\n  They can say all they want about ``we need more amendments.'' Nobody \ncriticizes having more amendments, but when we spend 9 or 10 days \ngetting on a bill, we have wasted all that time. Nothing happens during \nthat time. We do nothing here in the Senate. Everything comes to a \nstandstill. Yet they complain because they do not have time to offer \namendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7365-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12 noon will be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are now, as everybody knows, on the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It is my \nunderstanding that we have about 48 minutes for each side. I would ask \nthe opponents of the treaty to do what we normally do, which is go back \nand forth from one side to the other. I notice there is no one here for \nthe other side, so what we will do is use up a component of our time, \nand then, because they are not here, I think it would be fair not to \nchew up the time in a quorum call.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that if the opponents on the other side \nare not ready to speak or to use their time, that the quorum call be \ncharged against them because I don't think we should give up our time \nas a result of their simply not being here. So I ask unanimous consent \nthat if there is a quorum and we are not speaking, the time be charged \nto their side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I believe \nthe chairman has stated a fair position. On the other hand, in terms of \nour side, the Republican side, I wish to preserve at least the rights \nof our Members to have the maximum amount of time as possible. So I am \ninclined to believe the time should be charged equally against both \nsides.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is fine. I accept that. What I am \ntrying to do is to use this debate period, important as it is, as \neffectively as possible on both sides.\n  I see there is a Member from the other side who is in opposition, so \nI withdraw my request, and I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, may I ask what we just decided in terms of \ntime?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would inform the Senator from Oklahoma \nthat we have agreed to simply proceed, hopefully alternating from side \nto side. We have about 48 minutes on each side, and I have yielded 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the quorum calls \nwill be equally divided between the sides.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as we all now know, the Senate will vote \ntoday on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The \nUnited States has long been a leader in its treatment of those with \ndisabilities. Becoming a party to the convention would provide an \nimportant platform and forum for the United States to continue this \nleadership.\n  We received strong expressions of support for the convention from a \nwide\n\n[[Page S7366]]\n\nrange of groups who advocate on behalf of the disabled. This includes \nnumerous veterans organizations representing those who have become \ndisabled while serving our country in the Armed Forces.\n  An important factor in my decision to support the convention has been \nthe testimony received by the Foreign Relations Committee that joining \nthe convention will not require any change--and I emphasize that: will \nnot require any change--in existing U.S. law or policies regarding \ntreatment of the disabled.\n  In their statements before the Foreign Relations Committee, officials \nfrom the executive branch as well as former Attorney General Richard \nThornburgh stressed that current U.S. law satisfies all obligations the \nUnited States would assume in joining the convention.\n  In order to underscore the importance of this point, the Foreign \nRelations Committee specifically addressed it in a declaration in the \nresolution of advice and consent. The declaration formulated by the \nForeign Relations Committee reads as follows:\n\n       The Senate declares that, in view of the reservations to be \n     included in the instrument of ratification, current United \n     States law fulfills or exceeds the obligations of the \n     Convention for the United States of America.\n\n  On a related point, the resolution of advice and consent also \nunderscores that the convention will not be self-executing in U.S. law. \nThis means its provisions are not directly enforceable in U.S. courts \nand do not confer private rights of action enforceable in the United \nStates.\n  These provisions of the resolution of advice and consent establish \nimportant parameters for U.S. accession to the convention. They give \neffect to the intent of the Senate that joining the convention will not \nrequire any changes in U.S. laws and policies with regard to the \ndisabled, either now or in the future, and will not provide a basis for \nlawsuits in U.S. courts. Such matters will continue to be governed \nsolely by U.S. laws.\n  It is my hope these provisions in the resolution of advice and \nconsent will provide assurance to Members who may be concerned that \njoining the convention could somehow confer new rights on disabled \npersons in particular areas or that the convention can be used to \nrequire the United States to change its laws or policies with respect \nto the disabled. With these provisions, the United States can join the \nconvention as an expression of our leadership on disability rights \nwithout ceding any of our ability to decide for ourselves how best to \naddress those issues in our laws.\n  The United States can play an important leadership role in helping \ncountries around the world identify ways to expand opportunities for \nthe disabled. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting United \nStates accession to the convention as a means of advancing this goal.\n  I would point out that many of us have visited with veterans--\ndisabled veterans, as a matter of fact--in the corridors of the Capitol \nin the last 24 hours. They have expressed without reservation the fact \nthat their lives would be enhanced in the event we were able to pass \nthis treaty, because their treatment in other countries would improve \nas other countries adopt principles we have found useful as a practical \nmeans of helping the disabled.\n  I believe each one of us ought to be moved by the testimony of our \nveterans--veterans I have seen here in the corridors who have lost legs \nduring fights on behalf of the United States of America. This is a \nserious issue and a humanitarian, thoughtful way. And I emphasize again \nand again, the United States joins with other countries, sharing our \nexperiences of how we can improve treatment of the handicapped, with no \npossible provision in the treaty--and we have reserved this \ncompletely--that there could be any change in our laws.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to make sure people understand \nthere are different thoughts on this convention. It seems as though \nmost of the time when the U.N. conventions or treaties come up that I \nhave been opposed to them, and my concern always has been that of \nsovereignty. I do oppose the United Nations Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities because I think it does infringe upon our \nsovereignty, establishing an unelected United Nations bureaucratic body \ncalled the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and a \nConference of State Parties. These unelected bureaucratic bodies would \nimplement the treaty and pass so-called recommendations that would be \nforced upon the United Nations and the United States if the United \nStates is a signatory.\n  We already have the 1980 act. We all remember that. We went through \nthat a few years ago. I was here at that time. It is considered to be \nthe gold standard for the disabled. We don't need the United Nations \nbureaucrats changing it in our country in the name of worldwide \nadvocation.\n  While the Obama administration affirms that no changes to the Federal \nor State law will be necessary if the CRPD is ratified, the CRPD can be \namended. The Senator from Indiana talked about the fact that there are \nno changes in this. But it can be amended by the bureaucrats and, \ntherefore, require changes to U.S. law.\n  Further, the ability of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities to investigate and recommend changes chips away at the \nability of a sovereign nation in governing itself.\n  I know a lot of people feel that no idea is a good idea unless it \ncomes from an international organization. I kind of fall at the other \nend of the spectrum. Specifically, the treaty could be used to \ninterfere with the ability of parents with disabled children to decide \nwhat action is in the best interest of their children. This would \nespecially affect those parents who homeschool their children.\n  I have a daughter--the runt of my litter, I say to the president--who \nis No. 4. Katie homeschools her children. She and I have talked about \nthis, and this is very much a concern in that community, that unelected \nforeign bureaucrats--not parents--would decide what is in the best \ninterests of the disabled child even in the home. No less than 40 \norganizations and tens of thousands of parents who advocate children \nand parental rights have written us, and me, specifically opposing the \ntreaty.\n  The Home Schooling Legal Defense Fund writes:\n\n       Article 7 of this treaty establishes the ``best interests \n     of the child'' legal standard, which would override the \n     traditional fundamental rights of parents to direct the \n     education and upbringing of their child with special needs.\n\n  This could result in forcibly transferring a disabled child from the \nhome to government-run schools if these unelected, unaccountable \nbureaucrats deem it necessary, even if the Senate puts reservations \ninto this treaty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters, \none from the HSLDA and one from the Concerned Women of America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Concerned Women for America\n\n\n                                 Legislative Action Committee,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 2012.\n     The Honorable,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator, On behalf of Concerned Women for America \n     Legislative Action Committee's (CWALAC) over 500,000 members, \n     I urge you to reject ratification of the United Nations' \n     Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).\n       CRPD is a feel-good attempt at limiting liberty for the \n     United States abroad and at home. This treaty will hurt \n     parents and caregivers of people with disabilities by \n     subjecting them to UN oversight, regulations, and control. In \n     doing this, a judge or other government official would be \n     able to trump the parent's wishes when it comes to education \n     of their child with disabilities.\n       While CWALAC is for protecting those with disabilities, \n     Americans should be the ones making laws for America. If \n     improvements are needed to the laws, that already are the \n     leading examples of providing freedom and justice for persons \n     with disabilities, it needs to be done within America's \n     legislature. Like other United Nation treaties, this will \n     open the door for infringing upon our sovereignty by \n     subjecting the United States to foreign, anti-American \n     biases.\n\n[[Page S7367]]\n\n       Parents know what is in the best interest of their child, \n     not the government or the United Nations.\n       CWALAC will include a vote against this treaty on our \n     scorecard for the 112th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Penny Young Nance,\n     Chief Executive Officer and President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                            HSLDA,\n\n\n                                  Advocates for Homeschooling,\n\n                                                November 20, 2012.\n     Re Please Oppose the UN CRPD.\n\n       Honorable Senator: We the below-signed leaders from forty \n     national organizations represent millions of Americans. We \n     respectfully urge the United States Senate to reject \n     ratification of the United Nations' Convention on the Rights \n     of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).\n       We are troubled that article 7 of this treaty, in \n     establishing the ``best interests of the child'' legal \n     standard, would override the traditional fundamental right of \n     parents to direct the education and upbringing of their child \n     with special needs.\n       We are troubled that such a reduction in legal protection \n     in cases of children with disabilities will create an \n     atmosphere discriminatory against those children and their \n     families.\n       We are troubled that New Zealand's Education Act of 1989, \n     which has been held to conform to the CRPD, allows the \n     Secretary of Education to force any child with special needs \n     into government-run schools ``if the Secretary thinks [the \n     student] would be better off.'' This transfers the right to \n     direct a child's education from fit and loving parents to an \n     officer of the State, in contravention of American tradition \n     and the International Declaration of Human Rights. Yet it \n     accords with this treaty.\n       We are troubled that accession to this treaty, despite \n     assurances to the contrary, will lead to legal action against \n     private individuals, as seen in the 2011 case of Bond v. \n     United States. In this case, a woman was found guilty of \n     violating the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act, \n     a federal law over a matter formerly of state jurisdiction, \n     which was adopted as a direct result of the eponymous treaty.\n       We are troubled that accession to this treaty would place \n     our nation under the scrutiny and review of an international \n     committee unelected by the American people, thus violating \n     the vital principle of American self-government.\n       For these and other reasons, we urge you: please vote \n     against any effort to ratify the CRPD.\n           Sincerely,\n         Michael P.

Mr. President, I have been a consistent advocate for \nhuman rights around the world and support ensuring that the world is \naccessible to those with disabilities. However, I do not support the \ncumbersome regulations and potentially overzealous international \norganizations with anti-American biases that infringe upon American \nsovereignty.\n  If we had not passed what I consider to be the gold standard for the \ndisabled--and I do remember at that time the activity of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts very strongly supporting it. But we have done our \njob. Other nations maybe haven't, but in our case I think we are looked \nupon by the outside as doing the responsible thing within our Nation: \ntaking care of our own disabled.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would be glad to respond to a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator has raised the specter of somehow there would \nbe a change in this treaty at some point that might affect America. Is \nthe Senator not aware that any change to a treaty, in order to go into \neffect and have any impact on the United States, would require the \nadvice and consent of the United States Senate?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I do understand that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Without the advice and consent of the Senate, no change \ncould possibly impact the United States.\n  Mr. INHOFE. But I would also say that the bureaucrats who would be \nrunning the program would have points of clarification where it is \notherwise vague, and I think that could happen. And the point I am \nmaking here is we don't need to do that when we have our own here.\n  I understand there is a difference of opinion on this, and there are \na lot of emotions. I saw in this morning's Roll Call magazine all the \npeople lined up here with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. \nIt doesn't say anything in the article, but it certainly attacks the \nemotions of individuals.\n  So I am not satisfied they would not interfere or through their \nclarifications could change the intent. And even if they don't, we have \ntaken care of our problem here.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is important in this kind of debate as \nwe make a judgment with the Senators that we base our judgment on facts \nand on the reality. The Senator has suggested he is opposed to this \ntreaty because an outside group could impose its will on the United \nStates of America. What he has just acknowledged is they can't do that \nbecause it would require the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  But, secondly, is the Senator aware that Senator Risch asked the \nJustice Department whether the Court interpreted the effect of a \nnonself-executing declaration--which is in this treaty? And the \nresponse is, the Court said: The United States ratified the \ninternational covenant on civil and political rights on the express \nunderstanding that it was not self-executing. And so it did not create \nobligations enforceable in the Federal courts.\n  So the Supreme Court of the United States has held that the very \nstandard being applied in this treaty, that it is not self-executing, \nmeans nobody has access to any court. There is no enforceable right \nagainst anybody in America created in this treaty.\n  Mr. INHOFE. To answer the Senator, I am not aware of the specific \nRisch request and what kind of response it drew.\n  I would only say this: It is important to understand that while the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts and I differ on most of these \ntreaties--we had the same disagreement on the Law of the Sea treaty. \nThe question is, in my opinion, our sovereignty. I believe this \ninfringes upon our sovereignty.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Kerry, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Lugar, and so many others who have brought this matter \nto the floor.\n  It was 22 years ago when an historic event took place on the floor of \nthis Senate which changed the United States of America. It was 22 years \nago when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, and we said a \ndisability should not disqualify you or\n\n[[Page S7368]]\n\nlimit you in terms of your opportunity as an American.\n  Some people thought: This is obvious, everyone knows. But what was \nalso obvious was there was discrimination taking place all across this \ngreat land. We removed that barrier to discrimination. And in passing \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, we stepped forward as a Nation.\n  Was there fear and concern? Of course. I can recall going to Green \nCounty in rural Illinois and walking in Carrollton into City Hall, and \nthey said: Does this mean we have to build a new restroom for the \ndisabled? The answer was, Yes, and curb cuts, and other changes that \nseem so superficial to many but mean literally whether a disabled \nperson can be part of America.\n  What we did 22 years ago, though, wasn't novel. Because if you look \nat the course of American history, I think we have distinguished \nourselves and successive generations by expanding the reach of freedom \nand opportunity. Think about how many times we have done that.\n  If you go back to the earliest days of this great Nation when older \nwhite men sat together and decided who would rule America, they weren't \nthinking about those of color; they weren't thinking about women; they \nweren't thinking about the disabled; they sure weren't thinking about \nthose who weren't property owners. No. It was a pretty elite group that \nwould form our democracy. And then successive generations of Americans \ndecided that if democracy meant anything, if America meant anything, we \nneeded to expand that reach of opportunity each generation.\n  The bloodiest experience of course was in the Civil War, when 600,000 \nAmericans were killed in the course of a war that went on for years and \ncould have divided us once and for all as a Nation. But it didn't. With \nthe leadership of Abraham Lincoln and the inspiration of so many others \nand the blood, sweat, tears, and lives of the victims, we saved this \nRepublic. We ended slavery. We created an opportunity, which still took \nus years and years to become a reality--a reality we are still working \nfor today.\n  So now comes this treaty to the floor, and this treaty says to the \nworld: What we did 22 years ago as a Nation is something we are proud \nto stand behind. It is basically an ideal that we have created an \nAmerica that we want to export to the world. As we reflect on this \ndebate--and you have heard some of those who oppose it--it is \ninteresting the approach they are taking. They are fearful of change. \nThey are fearful of what the expansion of opportunity for the disabled \nmight mean to America.\n  Senator Kerry has made the point very clearly: This convention, this \ntreaty, will not require the United States to change any law. And if \nany changes are to be made in the future, they will be made with the \nworkings of Congress and the President. This treaty, this convention, \nwill not force that change.\n  We meet all of the standards that are established in this convention \nwhen it comes to disabilities, and President George Herbert Walker \nBush, a Republican, when he negotiated and crafted this treaty, said as \nmuch. Of course there are those who still question it. But, remember, \nevery time we have opened this door of opportunity in America, every \ntime we have expanded this definition of democracy to include another \ngroup that was being at least partially if not fully excluded, there \nhave always been voices of concern and worry.\n  There have been voices of those who have said maybe we are not ready \nfor that much change. They would say: Oh, I am not opposed to people of \ncolor, but if you force every hotel and restaurant across America in \ninterstate commerce to open their doors, that may be going to far. We \nhave always heard those voices and, after listening patiently, we have \nignored them and moved forward with the new definition of freedom in \nthis country, a new definition of opportunity, and that is what this \ndoes.\n  As we come together on the floor of the Senate, as we gather to \ndiscuss this historic treaty and what it means to us and our future, \nthere is a reception taking place across the street. It is a reception \nfor people with disabilities, and they are honoring one of our own: a \nman who served this country and this Senate in an exceptional way. His \nname is Bob Dole, of Russell, KS, who served in World War II, was \nseverely disabled, came home uncertain of his future but dedicated his \nlife to public service.\n  I don't know how many weeks or months or years are left in Bob Dole's \nlife, but he has made the passage of this convention on disabilities \nhis life's work of the moment. We owe it to Bob Dole and to all of the \ndisabled veterans like him who stand with locked arms, begging us to \npass this convention--we owe it to the disabled people across America \nand around the world to stand once again for the rights of the disabled \nand for expanding opportunity, not just in America but across the \nworld.\n  People say we are an exceptional nation. There is a little bit of \negotism in that statement, but I believe it is factual that America is \nan exceptional nation when it steps forward in the belief that freedom \nand liberty and opportunity should be for everyone within our country \nand around the world.\n  Today is our chance. Let no argument over some minor political issue \nstop us from focusing on the reality that what we are doing is \nhistoric, not just for America but for the world. We owe it not just to \nBob Dole, we owe it to the disabled veterans and the disabled community \nto stand and say to the world: Join us, join us in expanding the reach \nof opportunity to those who have been left behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the \nratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities. I understand it is a sensitive topic, one about \nwhich many of my constituents on both sides of the issue have strong \nfeelings.\n  Certainly most of us, if not all of us, have a family member or \nfriend with a disability, and all of us live in a society that includes \nthe disabled as highly valued members of our communities.\n  I have heard from advocacy groups consisting of people who hope and \nbelieve that this treaty will protect disabled Americans as they travel \nabroad and as they go about their lives. But I have also heard from \nparents of disabled children who are concerned that this treaty, in \nadherence to the ``best interests of the child'' standard in article 7, \nwill threaten their rights as a parent to determine the best education, \ntreatment, and care for their disabled children. Proponents of this \ntreaty will dismiss those concerns as myth, but I simply cannot support \na treaty that threatens the right of parents to raise their children \nwith the constant looming threat of State interference.\n  If this vote and this treaty were in fact about protecting the rights \nof Americans with disabilities, then I might have a different position \nand the debate today would take on a very different tone. But this \ntreaty is ultimately not about protecting the rights of Americans with \ndisabilities because this treaty simply has no enforcement mechanism to \nprotect those rights, the rights of disabled Americans, including \nveterans, who might travel to countries such as China or Russia or Mali \nor any other country that might choose to adopt this treaty.\n  If the Senate desires to protect the rights of disabled Americans who \ntravel abroad, then this Senate would do better to encourage other \nnations to model their own reforms, their own internal legal structures \nafter the Americans with Disabilities Act which, 20 years after its \npassage, still sends a message that disabled Americans will always have \nfair access to housing, employment, and education in this Nation.\n  I have mentioned a few things the treaty does not do. Now I would \nlike to mention a few things the treaty does do that causes me some \nconcern. First, article 34 establishes a committee, a committee on the \nrights of persons with disabilities. This committee will establish its \nown rules of procedure, and parties to the treaty are required to \nsubmit reports to the committee every 4 years.\n  In general, U.N. human rights treaty committees have made demands of \nstate parties that fall well outside of\n\n[[Page S7369]]\n\nthe legal, social, economic, and cultural traditions and norms of state \nparties. Sometimes their recommendations also fall far afield from the \nstated topics of concern within the individual treaties. For example, \nthe U.N. Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, \nor CEDAW, as it is sometimes known, included a recommendation that \nChina decriminalize prostitution.\n  The U.N. Committee on Racial Discrimination went to great lengths to \nscold the United States on its detention policy at Guantanamo Bay. \nThese recommendations often fall well beyond or are even in direct \nconflict with the treaty's goals.\n  Article 7 of this treaty provides a ``best interests of the child'' \nstandard stating:\n\n       In all actions concerning children with disabilities, the \n     best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.\n\n  We all want to support the best interests of the child, every child. \nBut I and many of my constituents, including those who homeschool their \nchildren or send their children to private or religious schools, have \ndoubts that a foreign, U.N. body, a committee operating out of Geneva, \nSwitzerland, should decide what is in the interests of the child at \nhome with his or her parents in Utah or in any other State in our great \nUnion.\n  Article 4 of this treaty obligates the United States to recognize \neconomic, social, and cultural entitlements as rights under domestic \nU.S. law. The Senate, in my opinion, has not adequately investigated \nhow this standard will affect domestic U.S. Federal and State law. We \nhave had one hearing on this issue that included both proponents and \nopponents of the treaty but did not substantively address my concerns \nabout this standard, about this significant addition to what would \nbecome the law of the land of the United States of America.\n  For these and other reasons I must oppose the U.N. Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities, and I encourage my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator, and I \nunderstand there are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have \nconcerns about the United Nations, and I respect that. We have had \nthese fights before, but I am having difficulty finding where the \nthreat that the Senator has described gains any reality.\n  Specifically, with respect to children, the Senator mentioned the \nquestion of a committee being created, and sometimes committees make \nrecommendations outside of the purview of something. That may be true. \nBut when have words, I ask the Senator--when have words or suggestions \nthat have no power, that cannot be implemented, that have no access to \nthe courts, that have no effect on the law of the United States and \ncannot change the law of the United States--when has that ever \nthreatened anybody in our country?\n  Mr. LEE. Whatever the United States ratifies----\n  Mr. KERRY. Does the Senator agree that there is no power to change \nour law?\n  Mr. LEE. No. I do not agree with that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Can the Senator show where it is specifically when the \nSupreme Court has held this is not self-executing, there is no access \nto American courts; when it is clear by the statements of the treaty \nitself there is no law of the United States that is changed? When \nAttorney General Thornburgh, who helped to negotiate this treaty on \nbehalf of President George Bush, says there is no change in law, what \nis it that the Senator suddenly has that suggests otherwise that has \nany basis in fact?\n  Mr. LEE. First of all, whenever we ratify a treaty it becomes the law \nof the land under article VI of the U.S. Constitution. Secondly, \nwhenever a body of law, whether embodied in U.N. convention or \notherwise, becomes part of the corpus of customary international law, \nthat often makes its way into U.S. judicial opinions. Is it direct? No. \nDoes it directly undo any statute? No. But that doesn't mean it has no \neffect. If it had no effect we would not be here debating it today. It \nis the type of effect we worry about.\n  The Senator and I see things differently as far as what type of \neffect it might have. But that is not to say it has no effect. We \nshould not be ratifying a treaty that we think might offset U.S. law as \nit exists now. We believe this could have that impact. Exactly where \nthat is going to come up, I cannot prove to the Senator where that is \ngoing to happen. But it does have some impact, and when we ratify a \ntreaty we make it the law of the land.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator further, I know he is a \ngood student of law, practitioner of law. I believe he understands that \na treaty does not become customary international law just because the \nUnited States or another country ratifies it. The Senator is aware of \nthat, I assume?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes, of course. It doesn't become the law of the land just \nbecause it is in the treaty. But it often does. Its entry into \ncustomary international law can become facilitated by the U.S. \nratification of it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Again, the Senator has acknowledged that it does not \nbecome customary law; as a consequence, it has to somehow change. \nWithin this--the Senator will agree that because the treaty adopts, in \nthe body of the treaty, the statement that this is not self-executing \nand the Supreme Court has held that a nonexecuting treaty--let me just \nreference the specific case--Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, a \n2004 case--the Supreme Court said it is dispositive. Nonself-executing \ndeclaration is dispositive. The Court noted that the United States \nratified a prior thing then--and said, ``it does not create obligations \nenforceable in Federal courts.''\n  So there is no obligation created. The Senator then said: Why would \nwe do this? Because we are the gold standard, and every other country \nis encouraged--encouraged; we cannot require them, but they are \nencouraged--to raise their standard to U.S. standards.\n  Why would the Senator resist? I know the Senator and many of his \ncolleagues argue we want other countries to be more like America. This \nis a treaty that, in fact, embraces that notion that they must be more \nlike America. Why would the Senator not embrace that?\n  Mr. LEE. If my distinguished colleague and friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is correct, that this would have no impact on our \nlaw, if in fact it does nothing, then why would we make it part of the \nU.S. law? Why would we make it part of the law by ratifying it and \nmaking it the law of the land under article VI of the Constitution?\n  Mr. KERRY. I would say to the Senator, for a number of reasons: That \nallows the United States to sit at the table and actually advocate on \nbehalf of our veterans, disabled veterans, who travel abroad.\n  Mr. LEE. What table is it at which we have no seat because we have \nnot ratified this treaty? What is it that we cannot do by having the \nmost aggressive laws, the most robust laws protecting Americans with \ndisabilities that we somehow achieve simply because we ratify this? If, \nin fact, that does nothing more than embrace that set of laws that we \nhave actually passed, and if, in fact, as my friend says, this does \nnothing, then why do we ratify it?\n  Mr. KERRY. No, let me make clear to the Senator, I have not said it \ndoes nothing. I have said it does not require a change in American law. \nI have said that it does not obligate the United States to a new set of \nstandards or anything different from what we do today. I have said it \ndoes not allow anybody access to the Federal courts. That is different \nfrom saying it doesn't do anything. If it didn't do anything, I would \nnot be here either. Nor would George Bush have signed this. Nor would \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush have begun the negotiations.\n  This is not a Democrat-inspired treaty. This is a universally \naccepted set of principles about how we would like to see people in the \nrest of the world treat people with disabilities.\n  There is more to be said about that, and there is more to be said. I \nwant my colleagues to speak about why we are here.\n  Let me recognize, if I can, the Senator from Arizona?--no, I will \nhold off on that, if I may.\n  Let me recognize the Senator from New Mexico for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S7370]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kerry for the \nrecognition. I appreciate it. I have been an earlier supporter of the \nratification of this important treaty. I am pleased to have worked with \nSenators Durbin, McCain, Harkin, Coons, and Barrasso. In particular, I \nwant to thank the chairman and ranking member on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I thank all of these fine Senators for their bipartisan work \non this bill.\n  We still have work to do to improve our treatment and acceptance of \ndisabled persons. But through the Americans with Disabilities Act, the \nUnited States has been at the forefront of protecting the dignity of \npeople with disabilities. This treaty will help expand American values \nand leadership throughout the world. It is a vital step forward in \nrespecting the rights of the disabled.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I am aware of the \nchallenges many countries face. These challenges include supporting \ntheir disabled citizens. Our Nation has set the standard for improving \naccess to buildings, technology, and other areas for the disabled. \nWithout the United States accepting its leadership role, it is possible \nthat different standards could be adopted internationally. As for one \nexample, this would place disabled travelers at a disadvantage. They \nwould be forced to deal with different standards while traveling \noverseas.\n  In many countries there has been insignificant investment in \ninfrastructure to improve access for the disabled, and in many cases \nthere is a misunderstanding about what rights disabled persons should \nbe afforded. Ratifying this treaty will help the United States clarify \nto the world that people with disabilities have dignity and that they \nare capable of living full and meaningful lives.\n  For instance, article 6 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities addresses the issue of women with disabilities. The \narticle provides that:\n\n       State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure \n     the full development, advancement, and empowerment of women \n     for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and \n     enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms set \n     out in the present Convention.\n\n  Many countries are falling short in protecting the rights of women. \nIt is tragic that so many women are subject to human rights abuses in a \nnumber of countries. Secretary of State Clinton has made empowering \nwomen an important part of our diplomatic priorities, and I support her \nefforts.\n  Fortunately for the United States, we do not need to implement \nadditional legislation in order to be in full compliance with the \nconvention. Laws such as the Civil Rights Act, Title IX, the Family and \nMedical Leave Act strengthen the U.S. position in the convention, and \nour leadership could lead to other countries adopting similar \nprotections for disabled women.\n  Most importantly, I am reminded of the veterans who have returned \nfrom the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. These brave veterans have served \nin all the places we have asked them to go. They have advanced the \ninterests and ideals of the United States. We owe them a debt for their \nservice. Many of them have returned with severe wounds, some requiring \na lifetime of care.\n  I wish to read a statement from one of the veterans who appeared in \nfront of the Foreign Relations Committee. John Lancaster is a disabled \nattorney and marine veteran. This is what he said:\n\n       In 1968, I arrived in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive, \n     assigned to the 1st Battalion, 27th Marines as an Infantry \n     Platoon Commander. Five months later, I was shot and injured \n     in a firefight. After months of rehabilitation, I arrived \n     back home in Western New York a disabled veteran. Although my \n     friends and family welcomed me home, society did not receive \n     me quite as well. While there was certainly tension around \n     the politics of the Vietnam war, it was the inaccessibility \n     of my environment that made me feel the least welcome. I \n     returned to a country not ready to receive me as a man who \n     now used a wheelchair.\n\n  That was the reality that an honored soldier had to overcome until \nthe United States improved its laws to protect the disabled, and it is \nstill a reality in many places overseas, places where our veterans and \nother disabled citizens will likely travel in the future for either \nbusiness or pleasure. We must ratify this treaty because protecting the \nrights of the disabled is the right thing to do in the United States of \nAmerica, and it is the right thing to do throughout the world.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar for their hard work on \nthis treaty. We look forward to our colleagues voting for it in a short \nhour from now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-seven minutes still remains.\n  Mr. KERRY. How much on the opponent's side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About the same.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Coons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I also thank Senator Kerry for his \nchairmanship on the Foreign Relations Committee and his leadership on \nthis very important issue. I thank Senator Lugar as well. Both \nSenators, in combination, led strongly on this important issue.\n  Let me briefly add 2 minutes to the chorus on this floor today. \nFirst, as to the Senators who have spoken pointedly about their fears \nand their concerns about home schooling. I listened to their arguments \nwhile I was the Presiding Officer. Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma spoke \npassionately about his youngest daughter who homeschools her kids and \nabout their fears that somehow this convention would hand the power to \nan unelected group of bureaucrats to direct the schooling of children \nin Oklahoma.\n  I heard Senator Lee of Utah add a question to that negative chorus. \nHe said, I have justifiable doubts that a U.N. committee in Geneva can \njudge the best interests of children in Utah.\n  I agree. This convention does nothing to empower an international \nconvention of bureaucrats to direct the schooling of children in \nDelaware, West Virginia, Indiana, or in Massachusetts.\n  I am, frankly, upset that they have succeeded in scaring the parents \nwho homeschool their children all over this country. My own office has \ngotten dozens of calls and letters demanding that I vote against this \nconvention. As a matter of international law and as a matter of U.S. \nlaw, this convention does nothing to change the home schooling of \nchildren in America; rather, it does something positive.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act, which was led so brilliantly in \nits ratification by Senator Tom Harkin and Senator Robert Dole, who was \na central architect in the passage in this Chamber, stands as a great \naccomplishment in this country in our steady progress toward freedom \nand inclusion. This convention, ratified by this Senate, would allow \nour voice to be heard in an international forum all over the world. A \nbillion citizens of this world live with disabilities every day, and \nour voice deserves to be heard.\n  When we open the Senate every day, we say the Pledge of Allegiance. \nAt the end of it, we hold up to the world our standards: Liberty and \njustice for all. In this country, the Americans with Disabilities Act \nsays we have accomplished real progress toward liberty for the disabled \nand justice for all. By ratifying this convention, our voice would be \nheard on these vital issues all over the world. It is a voice that \ndeserves to be heard. I urge my colleagues to ratify the convention.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Almost 24 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first I thank Senator Kerry, Senator \nLugar, and Senator McCain for their great leadership and their dogged \npersistence in making sure we can get this treaty through the committee \nand to the floor. It has been inspirational to\n\n[[Page S7371]]\n\nwatch them work together in a bipartisan fashion to bring us to this \npoint. I hope we don't lose that in terms of the vote.\n  I just came over from the Dirksen building where we had a wonderful \nceremony honoring former Senator Bob Dole. Some time ago I went back \nand I read Senator Dole's maiden speech on the Senate floor, dated \nApril 14, 1969.\n  Mr. President, I commend these remarks to my colleagues.\n  Senator Dole spoke of the future of people with disabilities in \nAmerica and what we need to do to change our society. That was in 1969. \nIt was 21 years later when we passed the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. The country has changed so much for the better because of that.\n  We are sitting here now with a convention by the U.N. which basically \nsays to the rest of the world: You have to do what America did. In \nestablishing this convention, the U.N. was informed by the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, and a lot of it is based upon what we did here.\n  As the committee showed, not one of our laws or anything has to be \nchanged. Not one. We are the best in the world at this. Yet what this \nconvention gives us is a seat at the table. When other countries have \nsigned on to the treaty, it gives us a seat at the table to be able to \nwork with other countries and to help them upgrade their laws so that \npeople with disabilities have more opportunities in other countries. \nWhy would we deny ourselves a seat at the table when we have been a \nleader in this effort for so long?\n  I listened to the speeches by both Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma and \nSenator Lee from Utah. These are unfounded fears. I repeat, there is \nnothing in there that is going to allow anyone from the United Nations \nto take a child away from a family or tell a family they cannot \nhomeschool a kid or anything such as that. There is nothing in there. \nThese are totally unfounded fears. We should not be driven by unfounded \nfears. We should be driven by what we know of our experience, what we \nhave done, what the wording of the convention is, and the fact that \nnone of our laws has to be changed because of it.\n  The Senator from Utah made the point that we all know people with \ndisabilities. We have family members or friends, and we value them. We \ntruly do value people with disabilities in our society. Well, if we \ntruly value them, why don't we listen to them?\n  There are over 300 disability rights groups that support this. Not \none said they won't support it. So if we value them, why don't we \nlisten to them? Do we want to keep patronizing people with disabilities \nand say, you are all right, but we won't listen to you because we know \nwhat is best for you? We don't know what is best for people with \ndisabilities. We know who knows what is best for people with \ndisabilities: It is people with disabilities. They all said this is \nimportant.\n  There are 300 disability organizations that asked us to support this \nratification. I think we should listen to them and get their advice. \nThink about what the disabilities community here in America could do \nwith that seat at the table and how we can work with other countries to \nhelp them upgrade their laws. I have a hard time understanding why \npeople would be driven by unfounded fears to vote against this with all \nof the evidence from 22 years of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nincluding the hearings held by Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar which \nbrought out all the information and pointed out that not one of our \nlaws has to be changed at all. In the face of all of that evidence, \nsomeone will vote on the basis of an unfounded fear.\n  I remember when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act in \n1990. It took a long time. There were a lot of fears out there. There \nwere fears of: Oh, my gosh, we are going to have to do this and that. \nBuses have to have lifts on them, and we have to build those curb cuts. \nWhat, kids with disabilities get to go to school?\n  They were unfounded fears. We became a stronger and better society \nbecause of it. This treaty will make us a better world in which to live \nfor all people and not just those who have disabilities.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, don't give in to unfounded fears. Take \nthe good advice of Senator Bob Dole, President Bush, former Congressman \nSteve Bartlett, John McCain, John Kerry, and Dick Lugar,  people who \nhave been in the trenches on this, and take the advice of the \ndisability community here and abroad. If you will do that, we will win \na resounding victory today.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the United \nNations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have participated \nin the hearings and debates on this treaty, and I understand the \naspirations of the groups who support it. But I have serious concerns \nabout reaching those goals through a legally binding United Nations \ntreaty.\n  Other U.N. organizations have failed to achieve their stated purposes \nand actively work against the interests of the United States.\n  Not even a week ago, the United Nations General Assembly voted \noverwhelmingly to upgrade the Palestinian Authority to ``non-member \nobserver state'' over the objections of the United States and Israel. \nThis is a breach of the Oslo accords and will hurt the Middle East \npeace process. Secretary Clinton called it ``unfortunate and \ncounterproductive.''\n  The U.N. Human Rights Council includes notable human rights violators \nsuch as Cuba, China, and Russia. These countries have made little \nprogress improving the rights of their citizens, and nearly 40 percent \nof the council's country-specific human-rights condemnations are \nagainst Israel.\n  More worrisome, convention committees--such as the Committee on the \nElimination of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the \nElimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women--have a track \nrecord of overstepping their authority and advocating positions \ncontrary to American laws and values.\n  In the past, these committees have supported giving voting rights to \nfelons, the decriminalization of prostitution, gender quotas, and \nincreased access to abortion.\n  Overly broad language included in this treaty would likely allow the \nU.N. to meddle in many of our domestic matters. International \nbureaucrats working with the U.N. should not be able to influence how \nthe United States creates and implements laws for the disabled, \nespecially when members come from countries with lower human rights \nstandards than our own.\n  The purpose of any treaty should be to advance specific security or \neconomic interests that make us a stronger and safer nation. This \ntreaty does neither.\n  Last week on the floor, Leader Reid argued that we must ratify this \ntreaty to ``take the high ground'' on these issues with the rest of the \nworld. But the United States does not have to join a U.N. convention or \nany other organization to give ourselves legitimacy and moral authority \nin the world.\n  For decades, the United States has been the global leader and \nchampion for persons with disabilities. We must continue to work hard \nto improve the lives of disabled citizens in our country. Encouraging \nrespect for disabled persons is important and the goals of this \nconvention are admirable.\n  This convention will do nothing to improve the rights of Americans in \nthe United States. We have little evidence to suggest that joining this \nconvention and its committee will ensure that other countries improve \ntheir protection of disabled people. Of the 126 member countries, this \nconvention's committee has only issued recommendations to a handful.\n  Portions of this convention also concern reproductive health, the \nrights of families, and the use of the treaty in our courts.\n  Attempts were made in the committee to clarify some of these sections \nand protect American sovereignty, but those attempts were defeated.\n  These issues should be addressed by individual U.S. States and local \ngovernments, not an international bureaucracy where Americans have no \nelected representation.\n  We should never cede the authority of these matters to an \ninternational organization. President Washington's warning in his \nfarewell address bears repeating here. He said:\n\n       The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign \n     nations, is, in extending our commercial relations, to have \n     with them as little\n\n[[Page S7372]]\n\n     political connection as possible. So far as we have already \n     formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good \n     faith. Here let us stop.\n\n  His words serve as a compelling argument against this treaty today.\n  We should be wary of international alliances and only work within \nthem when they will strengthen America or make her safer.\n  I encourage my colleagues to reject this treaty and address this \nimportant issue in a format that does not endanger the sovereignty of \nthe United States.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the U.N. Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities has the admirable goal of advancing the \ninterests and rights of the disabled across the world. However, I have \ngreat concerns about acceding to this convention. I am also \ndisappointed that the Senate will dedicate just 2 hours of debate to \nconsider this convention, without the ability for any Senators to offer \nor consider worthy amendments.\n  U.S. leadership in advancing and safeguarding the rights of the \ndisabled is unmatched. The United States is the leader on disability \nissues. It's for this reason that the convention is modeled on the \ndisability rights laws of the United States. However, I have serious \ndoubts that simply joining the convention will lead to greater U.S. \ninfluence in promoting disability rights abroad. The ability of the \nUnited States to lead on this issue is not and should not be dependent \nupon joining this convention. We can lead on disability rights abroad \nbecause we lead on disability rights at home.\n  Joining this convention will have no impact on the disability rights \nof Americans in this country. Americans with disabilities are already \nafforded the rights contained with the treaty. Many Federal and State \nlaws protect the rights of the disabled, including the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. Even proponents of the convention acknowledge that it \nwill not enhance the rights of individuals with disabilities in \nAmerica.\n  We have made great strides in disability policy in America. Laws \nwhich I authored, such as the Family Opportunity Act and Money Follows \nthe Person, not only gave the disabled health care coverage but gave \nthem real self-determination in that health care coverage. In the \nfuture, I will continue to work to protect coverage of the disabled \nduring difficult budgetary times and work to find solutions for the \ndisabled that allow for coordination of support services across all an \nindividual's needs. While I respect the concerns and goals of \nsupporters of this treaty, we should not let this take the place of \nfocusing on problems and solutions here in America.\n  However, becoming a party to the convention would subject the United \nStates to the eighteen-member Committee on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities. This committee is created to monitor the implementation \nof the convention and provide conclusions and recommendations with \nregard to State Party's treaty reports. I have serious concerns about \nthe infringement upon U.S. sovereignty by a committee tasked with \nproviding criticisms and recommendations for the United States on our \ndisability laws.\n  Further, the convention raises additional concerns by unnecessarily \nincluding references in the area of ``sexual and reproductive health'' \nand the ``best interests of the child.'' These provisions call into \nquestion the purpose of the convention regarding abortion rights and \nthe fundamental rights of parents to determine how best to raise their \nchildren.\n  It is for these reasons, along with the decision of the majority \nleader to shut out the rights of Senators by prohibiting the \nconsideration of any amendments, that I oppose this convention.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, my late grandfather was one of the most \ninfluential people in my life. Until his death when I was 13, ``Papa'' \nwas a mentor who spent countless hours on our front porch with me \ndiscussing history, politics and baseball. As a Cuban immigrant, he \nknew how special America is, and it is one lesson from him that I will \nnever forget.\n  Papa was also my hero for the way he lived his life. Stricken by \npolio as a boy, he would be disabled for the rest of his life. He would \noften walk miles to work at a cigar factory to provide for his family. \nBecause of his disability, walking was difficult for him and he would \noften return home at night with his clothes dirty from repeatedly \nfalling to the ground. But he kept getting up, and lived a life that I \nadmire and will never forget. Because of him, I knew from a very early \nage the inherent dignity and beauty evident in every disabled human \nbeing on earth, whether they were born with their disability or \ndeveloped it in the course of their lives.\n  The landmark Americans With Disabilities Act, enshrined into law many \nfundamental rights to help disabled people live life. As Americans, it \nshould make us all proud because it is one reason the United States has \nset the gold standard in the world for disability rights. It has \ndemonstrated to everyone else one more dimension of our exceptional \npeople, ensuring that our disabled brothers and sisters have better \nopportunities to rise above their physical limitations to stake their \nclaim on the American Dream.\n  As the Senate considers the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities today, it is important to note that a failure to approve \nit would in no way diminish what we have accomplished in America on \ndisability rights, just as its passage would not improve the laws \naffecting Americans with disabilities. Furthermore, nothing on this \ntreaty compels other nations to raise their standards or in any way \nimprove the care they afford to persons with disabilities. Therefore, I \nstand in opposition of its ratification today.\n  The treaty's supporters have argued that its passage will elevate \ndisability rights abroad, to the benefit of disabled people not \nfortunate enough to live under laws like ours and also to disabled \nAmericans when they travel. However, the United States already promotes \ndisabled rights and better laws abroad through the State Department and \nour foreign embassies. The Americans With Disabilities Act, and \nsubsequent improvements to it, should be the law upon which other \ncountries base their own laws protecting their disabled people and \naiming to make their lives better.\n  I believe America's example should lead the way on achieving stronger \nuniversal disability rights than the United Nations, the governing body \nentrusted to oversee this treaty's implementation. The American example \nof millions of disabled Americans living their dreams is a stronger \nforce to compel other countries to do the same than a United Nations \nbody populated by such chronic human rights abusers as China and \nRussia, nations that fail to respect the fundamental rights of \neveryone, much less their disabled.\n  When this treaty was originally negotiated, a bipartisan consensus \nexisted that this treaty would not address abortion. This is an \nappropriate position when you consider that, too often, unborn children \nin the United States and across the world are aborted because their \ndisabilities have been detected while in the womb. When the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee debated this issue in July, I offered an \namendment to make clear this Convention does not create, endorse or \npromote abortion rights as reproductive health. I made clear its intent \nwas not to change U.S. domestic laws on this matter. All my proposed \nchange did was state very clearly that, at the end of the day, this \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is about \nprotecting persons with disabilities, regardless of their stage in \nlife. Because this important change was not adopted and for all the \nreasons I have outlined here, I cannot support Senate ratification of \nthis treaty.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. The Senate today is considering the \nratification of an important treaty that will further strengthen the \nUnited States' longstanding role as a beacon of human rights around the \nworld. I support ratification of the United Nations Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, and hope that this treaty, \nwhich enjoys bipartisan support, will be approved by the Senate today.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, ADA, which has served to protect the rights of \ndisabled U.S. citizens for more than 2 decades. The CRPD is a natural \nextension of many of the core principles guided by the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. I believe that any person living with a disability, \nregardless\n\n[[Page S7373]]\n\nof where they were born or where they reside, should be protected from \ndiscrimination and unfair treatment.\n  President Obama signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities in 2009, and earlier this year, he submitted the treaty to \nthe Senate for ratification. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nreported the CRPD to the full Senate in July, and it is right that the \nSenate is taking action on this important treaty before this Congress \nadjourns. Current U.S. law already provides a number of protections \ncalled for under the CRPD. The Foreign Relations Committee included in \nits reported treaty reservations, understandings, and a declaration \nwhich will allow the United States to be in full compliance with the \ntreaty, without making changes to existing U.S. law.\n  Like President Obama, I believe this convention serves a number of \nAmerican interests, including encouraging protection of U.S. citizens \nand servicemembers with disabilities who live or travel abroad, and \nassisting U.S. businesses by ensuring that their international \ncounterparts are required to comply with similar laws.\n  Around the world, 125 nations have signed the Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities, and are parties to this treaty. \nIts ratification is supported by both Democrats and Republicans, and by \nwell over 300 religious organizations, health care centers, advocates \nfor people with disabilities, and veterans' organizations. Disability \nRights Vermont and the Vermont Center for Independent Living are among \nthose organizations supporting ratification. I hope all Senators will \nsupport this important treaty. It sends the right message to the rest \nof the world that the United States cares about the dignity of all \npeople.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today the United States Senate is \nconsidering a resolution to provide its advice and consent with respect \nto the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD. At \nits heart, the Convention is a non-discrimination treaty, which \nrequires that persons with disabilities have the same general rights as \nthose without disabilities.\n  I am grateful for the opportunities this Nation provided me as a \nyoung man who returned from World War II as an amputee. Those \nopportunities included a college and law degree, eventually serving the \nTerritory and State of Hawaii. I was fortunate my injury did not hinder \nmy dream to work for, and serve the people of Hawaii. Throughout my \nyears in the Senate, I joined with my colleagues to advance non-\ndiscrimination initiatives that protect all Americans. In 1989, I was \nproud to join with my good friend Senator Harkin as an original \ncosponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, in the Senate, \nand vote for its passage in 1990. The ADA, established in law, our \nNation's dedication to ensure those born with disabilities, or those \nwho suffer life changing disabilities, are individuals with dignity. \nFurthermore, that those individuals enjoy the same rights and \nopportunities all Americans are guaranteed under the Constitution. \nUnfortunately, this is not necessarily the case around the world.\n  The ADA and its goals served as the model for the treaty resolution \nbefore us today. This Convention will help move countries toward \nprotecting the rights of disabled individuals. Practically, it will \nallow the U.S. to engage other countries in the international arena to \nwork toward the standards and accessibility here in the United States, \nwhich will benefit disabled Americans who work, live, and travel the \nworld. We are fortunate U.S. law meets or exceeds the obligations of \nthe CRPD, and that no implementing legislation is required. Our country \nstands up to protect the rights of the most vulnerable in our society. \nWe cannot comprehend the mistreatment or simply the disregard of the \nlives of those with disabilities. Ratifying this treaty will reaffirm \nour country's leadership and commitment to the basic human rights of \ndisabled men, women, and children. I am pleased to join my colleagues \nin support of the ratification of the CRPD.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I renew my request now. We have had about \nfour successive Democrats speak. There is nobody here from the other \nside. I do not think it is fair to have our time docked as a result. So \nI suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged to the opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask that I be notified after 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, when the Senate gives its advice and consent to a \ntreaty, it becomes the ``supreme law of the land'' on par with Federal \nstatutes. This is Article VI, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution. It is \nin our Constitution. That is why we must take great care in ratifying \ntreaties and doing so only if it advances U.S. interests at home or \nabroad.\n  The overwhelming majority of constituent comments my office has \nreceived have been in opposition to the convention--approximately 1,000 \nletters in opposition; 40 letters or so in support.\n  Moreover, I, along with 36 other Senators, joined a letter to the \nSenate leadership requesting that no treaties be brought to the floor \nduring the lameduck session.\n  A treaty is a powerful document, equal to or above statutory law. \nHistorically, treaties are to regulate the relationship between \nsovereign nations. They do things like settle border disputes and \ncreate trade relations between those two nations. While treaties on \noccasion have blurred the line between international relations, the \nline, the principle still remains fundamentally intact.\n  This Nation has never ratified a treaty of which the entire focus is \nto empower an international agency--here, the United Nations, an \norganization that truly is proving to be dysfunctional and often \nhostile to the most legitimate interests of the United States--to \nmonitor the internal policies of the United States. This is \nparticularly curious in that the United States has the world's best \nrecord on disability issues.\n  Se we are told, let's ratify the treaty because we already meet, at \nleast today, all the requirements of the treaty. This will set an \nexample. In truth, we have already set an example. We lead the world.\n  This treaty, however, has misdirected the focus of the United States \nand the world community away from nations who do little or nothing for \nthe disabled and to direct blame first on this Nation.\n  Of course, the United States has a most magnificent system of law. It \nis the foundation of our liberty, our prosperity, and our happiness. \nThus, if we were to ratify this treaty, we can be sure that \ninternational hypocrites will soon demand that the United States do \nthis or that. All the while, their countries will have been in full \nviolation of virtually every provision of the treaty. Many other \nmischievous actions will certainly arise to bedevil our country, and we \nwill have hypocritical meddlers complicating our internal disability \nefforts, as well as our internal social and health policies. I do not \nthink this is necessary.\n  Now, I agree that the United States and the world can do more to \nadvance the cause of the disabled. I truly do. I recently visited the \nvery fine Alabama School for the Deaf and Blind. I personally saw how \ninexpensive computers can transform the daily lives of the disabled. \nDeaf and blind can move from being disconnected to connected, from \nunemployed to highly productive. It was such a moving and positive \nexperience to see what can be done today with the technology this world \nhas.\n  When one visits our magnificent military hospital at Walter Reed \nNational Military Medical Center, one can see the devices that are used \nthere on a regular basis to make the lives of those who have been \ninjured better. The whole world will benefit if more of this technology \nis made available.\n  The right way to advance assistance for the disabled worldwide is to \nbe active internationally, to be on the front\n\n[[Page S7374]]\n\nlines promoting these good techniques and policies, and to use more of \nour existing foreign aid for this purpose rather than wasting it, as we \ntoo often do, on corrupt governments that take it and do little for \ntheir people. I believe the State Department should strengthen its \noutreach in this important area. I have even drafted a law that would \nrequire them to establish such a department within their agency. As we \nspend billions yearly on aid, surely we can be more effective in \nensuring that the equipment, devices and treatments that are life \ntransfiguring are given more emphasis by our government.\n  We ought to raise the level of priority we give to the disabled.\n  Yes, I acknowledge that such expenditures are not purely a part of \nour Nation's national security policy, but America has always responded \nto the call to be a force for good in the world.\n  I just left a meeting 15 minutes ago with United Methodists from the \nNorth Alabama Conference who have a project to fight AIDS, HIV, and \nmalaria in Africa. This is part of the American heritage, and we do \nthis every day, and it should be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  This is our heritage, a heritage that has proven to be a blessing to \nthe world. We do not want to walk away from that.\n  Another part of our heritage is the rule of law--that clear and \nstrong understanding of the unique quality of national sovereignty. We \nare honest people. We are productive people. We are lawful people. We \nknow that we will be able to be more prosperous and thus able to help \nothers if we protect our economy from reckless, dangerous spending and \nthe authority of our legal system from erosion. Thus, I conclude this \ntreaty is unnecessary and, in fact, dangerous for our Nation.\n  So let's do more for the disabled worldwide. I will be supportive of \nthat. But let's do it without enmeshing our Nation into another binding \ninternational organization that will cause more grief than benefit.\n  I will conclude with one more thing.\n  I am coming to the view that we as a nation need to be more legally \naware of the dangers of signing agreements with foreign nations that \nregulate internal affairs, even if we are not giving away direct powers \nover the United States. I do not see that is necessary. I think that is \na bad step. I am opposed to that. I think that in the long run, we will \nhave difficulties.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, yield the floor, and reserve the \nremainder of our time for my colleagues who I know want to speak on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Arizona 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor with a bit of a heavy \nheart today because I think the Senate may not act to approve the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I would say the \nissue is not going away. I think there are too many Americans and too \nmany veterans organizations and too many people who are committed to \nthis cause, that over time we may have every chance and every \nopportunity to succeed.\n  I remind my colleagues that virtually every major veterans \norganization in America supports the treaty, people who represent those \nmen and women who have fought and particularly try to assist those with \ndisabilities that are the result of combat. They are AMVETS; the Air \nForce Sergeants Association; Air Force Women Officers Associated; the \nAmerican GI Forum; the Association of the United States Navy; the \nBlinded Veterans Association; Disabled American Veterans; Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America; Jewish War Veterans; the Military \nOfficers Association of America; the National Association of Black \nVeterans; the National Guard Association of the United States; the \nNational Military Family Association; Paralyzed Veterans of America; \nthe American Legion; Veterans for Common Sense; Veterans of Foreign \nWars; Veterans of Modern Warfare; VetsFirst, a program of the United \nSpinal Association; Vietnam Veterans of America; and the Wounded \nWarrior Project.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of all \nthese veterans organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Veterans Support the Convention as the Rights of Persons with \n                              Disabilities\n\n       Vote YES for the CRPD in 2012! In a letter of support for \n     the disability treaty, 21 veterans service organizations \n     highlight why the CRPD is important to them:\n       The CRPD is important to veterans and servicemembers with \n     disabilities because it embodies the principles of the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Like the ADA, the CRPD \n     supports equal treatment and non-discrimination in access to \n     rehabilitation, employment and educational opportunities. We \n     support the principles of the ADA because it promotes \n     empowerment of our nation's veterans and servicemembers with \n     disabilities by providing the opportunity to achieve \n     independent living and inclusion into all aspects of society.\n       As organizations that represent veterans and servicemembers \n     and their families, we believe that the CRPD would remove \n     barriers and allow American servicemembers and veterans with \n     disabilities to work, serve, study, and live abroad. In part, \n     barriers will be diminished due to changing attitudes around \n     the world regarding people with disabilities. As a result of \n     the changes occurring through the CRPD, servicemembers and \n     veterans with disabilities will be able to continue leading \n     active lives within the global community.\n       VSOs that Support U.S. Ratification of the CRPD: AMVETS; \n     Air Force Sergeants Association; Air Force Women Officers \n     Associated; American GI Forum; Association of the United \n     States Navy; Blinded Veterans Association; Disabled American \n     Veterans; Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America; Jewish \n     War Veterans; Military Officers Association of America; \n     National Association for Black Veterans; National Guard \n     Association of the United States; National Military Family \n     Association; Paralyzed Veterans of America; The American \n     Legion; Veterans for Common Sense; Veterans of Foreign Wars; \n     Veterans of Modern Warfare; VetsFirst, a program of United \n     Spinal Association; Vietnam Veterans of America; Wounded \n     Warrior Project.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues a very moving \nletter to the U.S. Senate from a very famous man, a Chinese dissident \nwho was blinded, who recently was able to leave China, which was \nprinted in the Record yesterday.\n  I will not quote from his whole letter. He says:\n\n       This treaty is making this idea real in significant ways \n     around the world. Today there are over 1 billion people with \n     disabilities, and 80 percent of them live in developing \n     countries. Disability rights is an issue that the world \n     cannot afford to overlook. When the United States enacted the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act over 20 years ago, the idea \n     of true equality for people with disabilities became a \n     reality. Many nations have followed in America's footsteps \n     and are now coming together under shared principles of \n     equality, respect and dignity for people with disabilities as \n     entailed in the treaty.\n       The United States, which was instrumental in negotiating \n     this treaty, can continue to advance both its principles and \n     issues of practical accessibility for its citizens and all \n     people around the world and, by ratifying the treaty, so take \n     its rightful place of leadership in the arena of human \n     rights.\n\n  That is what this is all about--American leadership, American \nleadership in the world. I don't know how many millions of people \naround the world are deprived of the same rights that Bob Dole and Tom \nHarkin and so many others made possible, but do I know this is an \nexpression of American leadership throughout the world--I think an \nobligation America should embrace.\n  I would like to read a statement by our distinguished former \ncolleague and leader, Bob Dole. More than a dear friend, Bob remains an \nauthentic hero to millions of his countrymen, someone whose personal \nexample of wartime sacrifice was equaled--if such a thing is possible--\nby his service in this body. He is respected wherever people value \npolitical courage and civility.\n  Bob Dole returned from World War II, one of the countless wounded \nwarriors whose defense of our liberty curtailed his own. Gravely \ninjured, disabled for life, he developed a unique personal \nunderstanding of his fellow Americans excluded from the mainstream. In \nthe years that followed, Bob fought to ensure not only that no American \nwould be relegated to the back of the bus but also, in the case of the \ndisabled, that no one would be prevented from boarding the bus.\n  Bob Dole has been our leader on the issue of disabilities from the \nmoment he stepped foot into the Chamber. To Bob, it is unthinkable that \nAmericans\n\n[[Page S7375]]\n\ncould not get over a curb or enter a school building or even watch a \ndebate in this Chamber if they were in a wheelchair.\n  On April 14, 1969, the same date he was injured in the hills of Italy \n24 years earlier, he made his maiden speech on the topic of Americans \nwith disabilities. In every legislative initiative since then, Bob Dole \nhas been a leader on behalf of people with disabilities, bills such as \nthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA; the Developmental Disabilities Act, and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. He was responsible for including \npeople with disabilities in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and for \nensuring that people with disabilities are part of the State \nDepartment's annual report on human rights around the world.\n  After leaving this Chamber, Bob Dole prompted the Congress to pass \nthe Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999--\nbreakthrough legislation on health care and employment for people with \ndisabilities.\n  This past year he has been instrumental in working with the \nadministration and Congress to ensure bipartisan support for the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to reflect \nAmerican leadership and values and safeguarding the rights of every \nindividual in the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes to be added on to \nthe time of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to have Bob Dole's statement \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenator Robert J. Dole, December 4, 2012, Statement on the Senate Vote \n  on the Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (CRPD)\n\n       I'd like to thank my former colleagues, members of the \n     Administration, and many friends whose efforts have brought \n     about the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \n     Disabilities. In their diversity they reflect America \n     itself--I'm thinking of people including our former \n     colleagues Tony Coehlo, former Attorney General Dick \n     Thornburgh, and former White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray--\n     key leaders on the landmark and bipartisan 1990 Americans \n     with Disabilities Act. They have taken great pains to ensure \n     that this treaty is in the best interest of our Nation, and \n     reflective of the values that we all believe transcend any \n     party label. I especially thank President George H.W. Bush \n     for his indispensable leadership and support.\n       The approaching vote on the Convention on the Rights of \n     Persons with Disabilities is a proud moment for the Senate, \n     the latest chapter of an untold story including the Americans \n     that say: no first class democracy can tolerate second class \n     citizens.\n       In recent years, we have recognized that people with \n     disabilities are integral to our society, that we cannot \n     afford to waste their talents, nor can we proclaim our \n     beloved America demonstrably--the home of the brave, the land \n     of the free--as we overlook the abilities that trump any \n     disabilities. As the ranks of the disabled and their families \n     swell, so does popular support for measures to ensure \n     equality of access and opportunity. One way or another \n     disability issues touch nearly every family in America.\n       Eight years ago, in dedicating the National World War II \n     Memorial on the Mall, I tried to put into words what makes \n     America worth fighting for--if need be, dying for. I spoke of \n     the American promise, imperfectly realized and too long \n     delayed for some of our fellow citizens--but a promise of \n     individual opportunity and universal justice for which we all \n     aspire. ``This is the golden thread that runs throughout the \n     tapestry of our nationhood,'' I said, ``the dignity of every \n     life, the possibility of every mind, the divinity of every \n     soul.'' In ratifying the CRPD, we can affirm these goals for \n     Americans with disabilities. We can join with our allies in \n     entrusting the blessings of freedom to millions outside our \n     borders. I urge your support of this important treaty and I \n     thank you for your consideration.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nratification of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities or the CRPD. The United States has a long and proud \ntradition of protecting human rights, especially those of the disabled. \nI do not believe we need to ratify an international convention to \ndemonstrate our firm commitment in this area.\n  CRPD ratification would do nothing to improve the lives of the \ndisabled in the United States, and if other countries are looking for \ngood examples of how to improve their laws, they could do no better \nthan to refer to U.S. laws. Just as with many treaties before this one, \nthe CRPD would offer cover to regimes that have no intention of \nactually helping their citizens, while needlessly tying the hands of \ncountries such as the United States that have actually made great \nstrides in this area.\n  I take China as just one example. According to Human Rights Watch, \nChinese citizens even suspected of having a mental disability can be \narbitrarily committed to institutions because Chinese law offers almost \nno protections against involuntary civil commitment. Moreover, Beijing \nis now considering a draft mental health disability law that would \n``permit the indefinite involuntary detention, forced medication, and \nforced labor of persons suspected of having a mental disability.'' \nObviously, this is in direct contravention to both the spirit and the \nletter of the CRPD even though Beijing has ratified it--I repeat: even \nthough Beijing has already ratified the treaty. So while this \nconvention has no mechanism to force countries such as China to \nactually respect their disabled citizens, what it does do is allow \ntheir leaders to falsely present themselves as forward-leaning on \ndisabled rights just as they continue to run roughshod over such \nprotections at home.\n  Supporters of this convention claim that ratifying it would allow our \ncountry to assume the moral high ground when it comes to addressing \nother countries' gaps in disabilities rights. I would argue just the \nopposite. As I just mentioned, becoming a party to this convention \nwould actually put us in the company of nations that are nowhere near \nthe high ground on this issue, moral or otherwise.\n  Moreover, we already have the most comprehensive disability rights \nlaws and protections in the world, period. In fact, the U.S. record of \ndisabilities rights-related laws stretches back more than four decades, \nunequivocally demonstrating our commitment and leadership in this area. \nThat is why many nations look to us for guidance in developing their \nown disability laws and discrimination protections. We do not need a \ntreaty to provide that guidance, obviously.\n  For example, the European Union is looking to current U.S. law as a \nmodel for its own accessibility initiatives. In January of 2011, \nEuropean Commission Vice President Viviane Reding discussed proposals \nfor what is designated a ``European Accessibility Act,'' citing \nprogress made in the United States under the provisions of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990,'' which I was proud to \nsupport. Reding believes ``that the EU should learn from this positive \nexperience and go ahead in Europe too.''\n  The convention's supporters also erroneously contend that U.S. \nratification would result in tangible benefits for Americans with \ndisabilities who choose to live, travel, or work abroad. They assert \nthat it would allow the United States to have greater influence over \ndisability rights in such areas as employment or accessibility among \nother states that are party to CRPD. I think this is far from certain.\n  To be sure, Americans with disabilities face serious challenges when \nthey travel abroad precisely because those nations' laws are not as \nsupportive as are those here in the United States--the matter I spoke \nof a moment ago. But it is the example we have set through our \nlegislation, not ratification of this convention, that could improve \ntheir access, for example, to technology, as our Telecommunications Act \nof 1996 does, or accommodations that would be available, as the \nAmerican Fair Housing Act does, for example. Only individual member \nstates can draft and implement and enforce the type of wide-ranging \nlaws that are necessary to actually protect the rights of persons with \ndisabilities--laws, I might add, that are already in place here in the \nUnited States of America.\n  We know all too well from experience with other treaties that states \nsuch as China routinely flout their treaty obligations. I believe it \nboils down to this: Countries look to the United States for leadership \nin this area not because we are party to an international treaty but \nbecause we have actually demonstrated our commitment through tangible \nand sustained action. Our\n\n[[Page S7376]]\n\ncommitment to the rights of the disabled does not end with the passage \nof laws or the enforcement of regulations; rather, it is an ongoing \ncommitment through civil society and a myriad of civic groups, NGOs, \nand religious organizations, many of which work abroad to help improve \nthe lives of persons with disabilities. It also extends to individuals, \nincluding entrepreneurial Americans who continuously seek to develop \nnew cutting-edge technologies to improve the lives of anyone who might \nbenefit from such tools.\n  I am not naive regarding the challenges we face in ensuring that \npersons with disabilities around the world can benefit from the kind of \neducation, employment, and housing access Americans with disabilities \nalready enjoy here in the United States. I firmly believe the United \nStates must continue to pursue this disability diplomacy on both a \nbilateral and multilateral basis where it is appropriate. But it is not \nat all clear to me that it is necessary to ratify this convention to \nachieve our goal of promoting disability rights and protecting the \ndisabled from discrimination.\n  At the end of the day, I believe the proponents argue two \ncontradictory positions: first, that it is really important that the \nUnited States ratify the convention so that nations will have to \nrespect the rights of disabled persons. The second argument they make \nis that the United States need not be concerned about obligations under \nthe treaty because it is not enforceable, it really has no effect on \nus.\n  Well, both things cannot be true. Either it is a problem or it is not \neffective. In either event, it is not an argument for ratification of \nthe treaty. So while I respect the goals and the aspirations of the \nproponents, they do not justify committing the United States to another \ninternational obligation. As a result, I will oppose the resolution of \nratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the time allegation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 10 minutes, \nand the time in opposition has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona--it is my \nunderstanding that there is no other speaker on the Senator's side. I \nwould simply ask if we could have an additional 5 minutes on this side, \nif the Senator would not object, and that would bring us to the vote at \nnoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say to the Senator from Arizona \nbefore he leaves, the Senator and I have engaged on these issues for \nsome years now, and we have disagreed respectfully and in a friendly \nway.\n  I would say to him, very respectfully, that there is no contradiction \nin the position of the proponents of this bill. While I understand what \nhe said about China, the fact is that because China has signed up--and \nRussia and other countries--if we were a party to this and at the table \ndiscussing it, we would have greater leverage in order to be able to \nadvance the rights of persons in China and elsewhere.\n  Now, don't take that from me, I would say to the Senator from \nArizona. Guongcheng Chen is the blind activist for civil rights in \nChina who has sought refuge in America for a brief period of time. His \nfamily has suffered in China, and he has written a letter to us. He \nsays:\n\n       Dear Senators,\n       I am writing you to personally ask for your support for the \n     Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. As you \n     know, my work on civil rights began with trying to ensure \n     that people with disabilities in my home country of China \n     were afforded the same rights as everyone else. The CRPD is \n     making this idea real in significant ways around the world \n     today.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I am hopeful that you will support ratification and allow \n     others to benefit from these triumphs.\n\n  And he is referring to the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \nother things we have done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this document of organizations \nsupporting the treaty be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  The Coalition for United States Ratification of the United Nations \n         Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities\n\n       President Herbert Walker Bush;

Over 328 veterans and disability organizations, all of our \nveterans organizations, who deal with people with disabilities and \nchallenges support this treaty and believe it will make a difference.\n  So when the Senator says: I don't believe it will make a difference, \nevery working member of the disabilities community disagrees with the \nSenator.\n  I would just say to him respectfully that the facts are clear. He \nsaid this ties our hands. It doesn't tie our hands. Senator Lee came to \nthe floor earlier, and he agreed this doesn't require any change of \nU.S. law.\n  So I would say to my friend, there is no tying of the hands. We \nunderstand the fears people have, but I think it is important to try to \ndecide this on the basis of fact.\n  I yield to the Senator on his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As per the previous request, without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. First of all, I want to say to my colleague from \nMassachusetts that I very much have enjoyed the conversations we have \nhad, and perhaps more so when we have been in disagreement because I \nthink we have brought out a number of important points on a variety of \nissues. So I always appreciate his views. Secondly, since the Senator \nhas specifically referred to the points I have made, let me just \nrespond in one way.\n  I don't gainsay the argument that people who have a deep belief in \ntrying to pursue a particular human right or other goal believe that \ngetting together in the international community and talking about these \nthings is a useful exercise. It is hard to argue in the abstract with \nthat proposition, so I can understand the letters that would be \nwritten.\n  The hard reality is, however, that there are nation states such as \nChina that do like to sign up to these organizations and gain the \nreputation for doing good things while, in fact, not doing things, as I \npointed out. So to some extent it can serve the opposite goal of giving \ncover to countries that really have no intention of acting in good \nfaith or in good ways that we have demonstrated as the United States, \nand that is one of the problems here.\n  I do acknowledge, and I will not use any more of the Senator's time, \nbut when one of two things is true, either it is fairly meaningless or \nit is really meaningful. I don't think that we can make both arguments \nas arguments in support of our signing up to the treaty.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, we obviously differ on that.\n  Let me emphasize the importance of the 328 groups, and I have \nsubmitted that for the Record.\n  We are going to vote in a few minutes, and we are going to vote on a \ntreaty that I regret to say some people\n\n[[Page S7378]]\n\nare making controversial when, in fact, it really isn't controversial.\n  What this treaty says is very simple: It just says that people can't \ndiscriminate against the disabled. It says other countries have to do \nwhat we did 22 years ago when we set the example for the world and \npassed the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  In four simple words, this treaty says to other countries that don't \nrespect the rights of the disabled: Be more like us. That is what we \nare asking people to do. It doesn't require any changes to American \nlaw, zero. This has no tying of the hands of America. There isn't one \nlaw in the United States that would be negatively affected. But it will \npush, it will leverage, it will require other countries by their \ncommitment to be held accountable to the standard that we have set and \ntake our gold standard and extend it to the rest of the world.\n  There are three reasons I have heard that we can't do this. When I \nhear them, I am reminded of what I learned when I was a prosecutor, \nwhich was quite a few years ago now. I learned: If the facts are \nagainst you, then argue the law. If the law is against you, then argue \nthe facts. If both are against you, just make it up.\n  Well, that is exactly what is happening here. Neither the law nor the \nfacts support any argument that has been made on the other side of this \ntreaty. Accordingly, we are facing an entirely fictitious set of \narguments--on abortion, on homeschooling, on lameduck sessions. All of \ntheir arguments have been contradicted by the facts in the law, and let \nme document that.\n  This treaty is based on the Americans with Disabilities Act. We \npassed that 20 years ago.\n  The father of the act is sitting here, the Senator from Iowa. In all \nthose 20 years, has any child been separated from a parent because of \nthe ADA? No. Has homeschooling been hurt? No. In fact it has grown and \nis flourishing across the Nation.\n  How is it possible a treaty, that according to our Supreme Court \noffers no recourse, no change in American law, no access to American \ncourts, how is it possible that such a treaty could threaten anybody in \nour country? The answer is simple: It doesn't and it can't.\n  Well, let's go through the arguments one by one. First, they say it \nwould undermine our sovereignty. I have heard several people suggest \nthat, the laws governing the disabled. Well, that is wrong. Senator Lee \njust admitted it doesn't affect any law in the United States. All it \ndoes is create a committee on the rights of persons with disabilities.\n  What can this committee do? All it can do is review reports and make \na suggestion. Are we scared, in the United States of America, of \nsomeone making a suggestion to us about how we might do something? It \nhas no recourse in the court, no legal standing.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee even included language in the \nresolution of advice and consent to make it crystal clear. What are we \nafraid of? That the committee would give us this advice?\n  The second misconception is that this will allow the Federal \nGovernment, acting under U.N. instructions, to determine what is best \nfor children with disabilities. Again, that is just flat wrong. The \ntreaty does not give the Federal Government or any State government any \nnew powers with respect to children with disabilities. It doesn't \nchange the balance of power between Federal and State government. It \ndoesn't require any change to existing State or Federal law.\n\n  The Justice Department, former Republican Attorney General Dick \nThornburgh, testified before the Foreign Relations Committee that any \nassertion to the contrary is incorrect. Our committee even included \nlanguage in the resolution of advice and consent to absolutely \ncrystallize those limitations.\n  Finally, there are those who argue that a lameduck session is an \ninappropriate time for Senators to consider this treaty. Well, my \ncolleagues, please, since the 1970s alone, the Senate has approved \ntreaties during lameduck sessions a total of 19 times. There is nothing \nspecial or different about a lameduck. It is a session of the Congress. \nJust as we are going to consider important fiscal matters, we should \nconsider other important matters.\n  Our constituents expect us to do our jobs. There is no difference \nbetween a lameduck, a dead duck, or a regular duck. We ought to be here \ndoing our jobs.\n  More than any of the straw men, though, that we would have to deal \nwith in this debate, there is, in fact, something much bigger at stake. \nThis treaty and this vote will say a great deal about who we are in the \nSenate and who we are as a country.\n  In the nearly 30 years I have been here, I think this is the first \ntime I have seen a former majority leader of the Senate come to the \nSenate floor for a vote. It is certainly the first time that I have \nseen it happen when he had every right to be at home at age 89 taking \ncare of his health, but that is not Bob Dole.\n  Almost 70 years ago, when he came home to Kansas from the \nbattlefields of Italy in a full body cast, people said that Bob would \nnever have to work another day in his life. That is what they said; he \nwas a hero; he had made his contribution. But Bob Dole worked every \nsingle day to stand, to walk, and to use his arms again. He made \nhimself get out of that bed, and he made himself a public servant and a \nU.S. Senator and the Republican nominee for President in 1996. But his \ngreatest pride was passing the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Bob Dole, why is he here? He is not here because he is here to \nadvocate for the United Nations, and certainly this man who served his \ncountry is not here because he doesn't want to defend the sovereignty \nof the United States of America. He is here because he wants to know \nthat other countries will come to treat the disabled the way we do.\n  He is here because he wants to know that when a disabled American \nveteran, our wounded warriors, travel overseas, they are treated with \nthe same dignity and respect they receive at home. That is why an 89-\nyear-old veteran, 1 week removed from Bethesda Naval Hospital, comes \nback to the Senate on an early December day. Because it matters.\n  What we do in the Senate matters not just to us but to people all \nacross the globe, and maybe some people here need to be reminded of \nthat. This is not about politics, this is not about ideology, this is \nabout people.\n  This treaty helps thousands of vets, men and women, who paid the \nprice of devotion to our country with their limbs--with their limbs--\nand they struggle every day to get up, button their shirts, get out of \nthe house. Some of them struggle to be able to share in life as all of \nus are able to share in it.\n  I met one of them yesterday, Army Afghan vet Dan Berschinski, a \ndouble amputee as a result of the war in Afghanistan. He has fought \nback, and he has recovered enough to create a small business. Here is \nwhat he said, this West Point grad of 2007:\n\n       I'm proud to be able to walk using prosthetic legs. Yet \n     obstacles that might seem inconsequential to the fully able-\n     bodied, like sidewalk curbs and stairs, take on a whole new \n     meaning for veterans like me who struggle to walk, or use a \n     wheelchair. Very fortunately for me, the United States leads \n     the world in accessibility and equality of opportunity for \n     the disabled. Unfortunately, the advantages granted here at \n     home--that allow people like me to live fulfilling, \n     independent lives--don't exist in much of the rest of the \n     world.\n       Eight months after being wounded in combat, and while still \n     a patient at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, I joined--\n\n  And I am speaking for him--\n\n       a few friends in a trip to South Africa to watch the World \n     Cup.\n       There I found myself in a different country, with no legs, \n     a brand-new wheelchair and a lot of apprehension. While I \n     should have been enjoying this once-in-a-lifetime trip, I was \n     constantly worried about my ability to get around. Would the \n     restaurant have an accessible bathroom or would I have to go \n     without it? Would my wheelchair be able to fit in the hotel \n     doorway or would I need to be carried into the lobby? Those \n     are the kinds of questions we take for granted here in \n     America, but, unfortunately, the accessibility measures we \n     enjoy here simply aren't present in many other countries.\n\n  That is why Bob Dole and CPT Dan Berschinski want us to approve this \ntreaty. I have heard nothing from the other side that outweighs the \nreality of that consideration for not just veterans but all persons \nwith disabilities.\n  What is at stake here is big. The outcome here will not, despite the \nfear, change one election here in the Senate. It is not going to decide \none of the primaries that I fear are distorting the\n\n[[Page S7379]]\n\npolitics of our country. But you know what, it will decide whether some \npeople live or die in another country, where there is no accountability \nand only United States values and standards are the difference to the \nprospects of someone with a disability.\n  In some countries children are disposed of--killed--because they have \na disability. Our treaty can actually help prevent that. In some \ncountries children do not get to go to school and certainly have no \nprospects of a future simply because they are born with a disability. \nThis treaty will help offer hope where there is none. The United States \ncould actually sit at the table and make the difference for people with \ndisabilities because we are willing to push our values and hold other \nnations accountable to meet our standards--the gold standard of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  Mr. President, I have heard some of my Republican colleagues talk \nmany times about making the rest of the world more like America. I hate \nto think that now, when we have an opportunity to do that, they will \nretreat from that core conviction and oppose a treaty modeled on the \nUnited States' example which has no recourse in American courts and no \neffect on American law.\n  This treaty isn't about American behavior, except to the degree that \nit influences other countries to be more like us. This treaty is about \nthe behavior of other countries and their willingness to raise their \ntreatment of people with disabilities to our level. It is that simple. \nThis treaty isn't about changing America, it is a treaty to change the \nworld to be more like America.\n  So why join, I have heard my colleagues ask several times. If it \ndoesn't have recourse in the law, why join? I will tell you why: \nBecause we can sit at the table and affect the lives of our citizens by \npushing other countries upwards; because we gain credibility and \naccelerate change through our advocacy by being part of a process; \nbecause it is good for American businesses, which can sell products and \nservices as other nations raise their standards and need our expertise \nto meet their goals. That is why, incidentally, the United States \nChamber of Commerce supports this treaty as do a huge number of \nbusinesses.\n  Why support it? Because George H. W. Bush started this process and \nPresident George W. Bush signed the treaty to participate in it. And \nbecause, in the end, this treaty and our participation in it--and this \nis the most important--can improve the quality of life for people with \ndisabilities. To join it is to keep faith with the men and women who \nhave suffered grievous disability in defense of our Nation, and we owe \nthem nothing less. This treaty is not about changing America, it is \nabout America changing the world.\n  But a vote here is a test of this institution. This vote is a test of \nwhether the Senate, which passed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting \nRights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, is still capable of \nvoting to change things, not to mention sending a message that could \nchange the world.\n  I ask my colleagues to do for the world what they have done for \nAmerica, walk down the aisle here for millions everywhere who cannot \nwalk and make a statement; raise your voice and vote for millions who \nare voiceless in their own lands; stand for those who cannot stand for \nthemselves. This is not about the United Nations, this is about common \nhumanity. This vote is to test to see whether the Senate will stand for \nthose who cannot see or hear and whether Senators can hear the truth \nand see the facts.\n  Please don't let Captain Berschinski down. Don't let Senator Bob Dole \ndown. Most importantly, don't let the Senate and the country down. \nApprove this treaty.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Resolution \nof Advice and Consent to Ratification of the Convention on the Rights \nof Persons with Disabilities.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to bring attention to a \ncritically important piece of legislation the Senate has passed and the \nHouse needs to pass immediately. It passed the Senate with bipartisan \nsupport. There are those on both sides of the aisle in the House of \nRepresentatives who support passing it. I am here to urge, in the \nstrongest terms possible, that the Speaker bring up this bill before \nthe House and get it passed.\n  Many people, because of my speaking in the past, may think I am \nreferring to the farm bill, which I also believe we need to have the \nHouse take up and pass because of our bipartisan work. But I actually \nam referring to the fact that we have only 27 days until we go over the \nfiscal cliff. For middle-class families what this means is 27 days \nbefore their taxes go up on average $2,200.\n  What we are talking about is the fact that we passed a bill. We did \nnot just pass a bill, we passed a bill in July. July 25 of this year \nthe Senate passed a bill to extend tax cuts on all income up to \n$250,000. That is for anyone. It is now sitting in the House and \neverybody agrees middle-class families should not get a tax increase. \nYet they have not taken it up. This needs to be taken up and passed \nbefore the end of the year so we can make sure middle-class families do \nnot get caught in what we are talking about, which is the fiscal cliff.\n  For a family on a budget, $2,200 more in taxes means a lot of things. \nIt means a lot of things as families are trying to figure out how to \npay for Christmas this year. It is not an accident that we\n\n[[Page S7380]]\n\nare seeing layaway becoming very popular again as families are trying \nto figure out how to make sure their children have the Christmas they \nwant to give them, yet juggle their cash flow situation in trying to \nfigure out how to pay for it and pay the bills. That $2,200 will make a \nhuge difference to millions of families. It is the difference between \njust paying the regular bills--utility bills, the mortgage, the rent, \nthe car payment.\n  There is absolutely no reason families should find themselves in this \nsituation right now when they are worried about this, absolutely none. \nAs I said before, we passed a bill on July 25--not August, not \nSeptember, not October, July 25--to get this issue off the table. We \nknow there are broader issues on which we have to come together. There \nhas to be a balanced approach, we know that, on long-term deficit \nreduction. But we said in the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, we do not \nwant middle-class families caught in the middle of that. We do not want \nthem being held hostage in order to get an additional tax break for \nmultimillionaires.\n  It has been 132 days since the House Republican leadership got that \nbill. For 132 days they have been refusing to take it up. I commend the \nDemocratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, for now bringing forward \na discharge petition to bring that directly to the floor. I think it is \nwidely believed--I certainly believe--that there are enough votes on \nthe floor of the House to pass this, to make sure middle-class families \ndo not see an additional $2,200 coming out of their paychecks starting \nin January.\n  For 132 days families have been waiting for their own economic \ncertainty. Yet it still has not been taken up in the House. Christmas \nis 3 weeks from today. This is the worst possible time to create \nuncertainty for families across America. We also know this is about \nhurting the economy. It is a drag on consumer spending not to continue \nthe tax cuts--consumer spending which makes up about 70 percent of the \neconomy. So there is a direct relationship between what happens in \ngrowing the economy and what happens for middle-class families. Now we \nhave 27 days for the House to get this done. There are 27 days to stop \nholding middle-class families hostage while we work out a larger \nagreement on what needs to be done on deficit reduction. All we need to \ndo is to pass the Senate bill.\n  Let me repeat. By extending this particular bill, every American will \nget a tax cut on their first 250,000 in income. The good news is that \ninvolves tax cuts for 98 percent of American families; 98 percent of \nAmerican families will be protected from seeing any kind of a tax \nincrease--and 97 percent of small businesses, by the way. So if someone \nhas $1 over $250,000, they would not be protected from a tax increase. \nThey would get the first $250,000 in tax cuts, but they would not get \nadditional bonus tax cuts on top of that. This makes sure 98 percent of \nthe American people do not see their taxes go up, and those who \nbenefited the most by the tax cuts in the last decade will be able to \nstep up and be part of the solution on deficit reduction, which the \nvast majority of people in this country agree is fair.\n  People in Michigan are worried about what is going to happen. They \ncome to me in the grocery store. I received many e-mails and calls to \nmy office and meetings, on Facebook and Twitter. People in Michigan \nunderstand that $2,200 more coming out of their pockets next year can \nbe devastating.\n  Terri from Lansing told me she unexpectedly lost her job when her \ncompany went out of business and had to struggle in foreclosure, \nsimilar to many people, and used her Roth IRA to get by. ``I am part of \nthe baby boomer generation and now I live paycheck to paycheck, just \nbarely surviving.''\n  Two thousand dollars makes a huge difference.\n  Zelda from Washington writes that $2,200 is our groceries for 4 \nmonths; 4 months of groceries for Zelda's family. That is what we are \ntalking about if the Senate bill does not get passed by the House.\n  Carol from Michigan writes:\n\n       I am a retired grandmother getting a State pension and \n     Social Security. I also have three teenage grandchildren \n     living with me.\n\n  That is not a new story for many people--``three teenage \ngrandchildren living with me.''\n\n       Any increase in anything might break me.\n\n  Thomas from Grand Rapids writes:\n\n       I will most likely have to find a job to make ends meet. So \n     much for being retired.\n\n  Again, so many families, so many individuals find themselves in this \nsituation. They think they have planned for their retirement and now \ncannot count on what they thought would be there. They watch this and \nthe fact that we have a choice to make sure tax cuts continue for 98 \npercent of the American families, middle-class families, that everybody \ngets a tax cut up to $250,000 a year. Yet the House Republicans will \nnot even bring it up for a vote because they want extra tax cuts for \nmultimillionaires? They look at that and they say: What, are you crazy? \nThis makes absolutely no sense.\n\n  President Obama ran on a plan to end the tax breaks for millionaires; \nbasically, that plan that passed the Senate, by the way, on a \nbipartisan vote. He ran on a plan that would say those savings would \nthen be applied to deficit reduction. We know that is so critical.\n  We saw what people thought about that. He was reelected by a wide \nmargin. The American people want us to come together, to work together \nin a bipartisan way to reduce the deficit, and they support the \napproach that starts by making sure middle-class families are not once \nagain asked to pay for the full burden of what needs to be done. They \nsupport an effort that says extend tax cuts for middle-class families \nand ask those at the very top who have gotten extra tax cuts to forgo \nthose and chip in to be part of the larger deficit reduction solution.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday Speaker Boehner ignored this when he offered \na Republican counterproposal to the President's proposal that would \nessentially raise taxes on middle-class families and cut Medicare for \nour senior citizens. As Senator Reid said yesterday, ``It flunks the \ntest of balance.''\n  To get the kind of revenue to reduce the deficit that is needed, that \nwe all agree has to be done, their plan does some radical things. Their \nidea of revenue is to continue the tax cuts for any income above \n$250,000 for multimillionaires and, instead, to get rid of tax \ndeductions used by middle-class families. So middle-class families \nmight not have a mortgage deduction on their home that millions of \npeople rely on; the student loan deduction for middle-class families \nthat is allowing college to be more affordable; the charitable giving \ndeduction that middle-class families rely on when they donate to \nchurches and other nonprofits; the marriage penalty; the child credit; \nthe mortgage tax relief deduction I offered to make sure if someone has \nto do a short sale at the bank, they do not pay extra taxes.\n  That is important for everyone to understand; that we--and I am \nspeaking now as a Senate majority--are not going to balance the budget \non the backs of middle-class families. We are not going to balance the \nbudget, reduce the deficit by asking middle-class families who had the \nbiggest hit of anybody with everything that has happened in the \nrecession--and I certainly can speak for Michigan on this--we are not \ngoing to put the burden on middle-class families one more time. That is \nnot what this is about.\n  On election day 60 percent of voters said they wanted to end the \nextra tax breaks for people making over $250,000--for income over \n$250,500. Yet the House Republican leadership wants to welcome middle-\nclass families into the new year by having their taxes go up on average \n$2,200. As Zelda from Michigan said, that is 4 months of groceries. No \nway. There is no way I am going to support letting that happen.\n  Thankfully, we do have Republican colleagues who join us wanting to \nget this passed. We did in the Senate and those speaking out in the \nHouse and I commend them. Congressman Tom Cole from Oklahoma stated the \nobvious last week--and I encourage and congratulate him for speaking \nout. He said Republicans should immediately extend the tax cuts for \nfamilies making under $250,000 a year. That is what he said. I agree \nwith that. His Oklahoma constituents praised him. His constituents \npraised him. Unfortunately, his leadership dismissed him. The \nWashington Post reported that 70 percent of the calls to Congressman \nCole's Washington, DC, office are positive and that 90 percent of his \ncalls back home in Oklahoma--90 percent--have supported his position.\n\n[[Page S7381]]\n\n  Congressman Cole knows he should be listening to his constituents, \nand he is. If we all listened to the people we represent and if the \nHouse leadership listens to the people of this country and those they \nrepresent, they will pass the bill we sent to them in July.\n  If taxes go up for middle-class families on January 1, people are \ngoing to know who is responsible for letting that happen. I urge House \nRepublican leadership to take up S. 3412, the Middle-Class Tax Cut Act, \npass it now, so the overwhelming number of families in this country \nhave certainty going into this important holiday season and into the \nnew year, so they can enjoy the season without knowing that their taxes \nare going to be going up on January 1. As of today we have 27 days \nbefore the vast majority of people in America--98 percent--see tax \nincreases occur. It makes no sense, there is no reason for it to \nhappen, and we have already passed a bill. If the House passes a bill, \nthat is step one. Step one very clearly says we are all together on \nsupporting the middle class continuing their tax cuts. We know there is \nmore to do. We are fully prepared to do that. But step one is to make \nsure the middle class is not held hostage while the debate goes on \nabout what should happen for the wealthiest few in this country.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7381-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, we are about to wrap up the Defense bill. \nThis is the sixth Defense bill I have had the privilege of working on \nas a member of the Armed Services Committee. It is also the final \nDefense bill I will be working on as a Member of the U.S. Senate. I \nwant to take this opportunity to say what an honor and privilege it has \nbeen to serve as a member of that committee and express my thanks to \nChairman Levin.\n  As someone who began his time on Capitol Hill as a full-committee \ncounsel on the House side many years ago and then spent 5 years in the \nPentagon--often working over here on the Hill--and now after 6 years in \nthe Senate, I can say that Senator Levin is a five-star committee \nchairman. He is what one always hopes for when he or she serves on a \ncommittee in the U.S. Congress. It has been a true honor.\n  This committee is an example of how committee work should be \nundertaken in the U.S. Congress. People like to say this is the 51st \nconsecutive year we have, hopefully, been able to pass a Defense \nauthorization bill. I would suggest to my colleagues that perhaps that \nexample should be used more broadly in this body. I think it would make \nfor good governance if it did.\n  I want to also express my appreciation to Senator McCain, the Senator \nfrom Arizona. I have known him as a colleague and friend for more than \n30 years. He comes from a family that has a long tradition of military \nservice to our country that continues even until today. Senator McCain \nand I have had occasional disagreements on the conduct of foreign \npolicy, but I think it has been very rare that we have seen differently \nas to our views of how the Department of Defense should undertake its \nresponsibilities.\n  As the subcommittee chair of the personnel subcommittee, I want to \nexpress my appreciation to my staff, Gary Leeling, Jon Clark, Brie \nFahrer, and Jennifer Knowles. They have always been accessible and \nextremely professional. It has been a great privilege to work with \nthem.\n  I also want to take a special moment of privilege here to recognize \nGordon Peterson, who has been my military assistant throughout my time \nin the U.S. Senate. Gordon Peterson and I graduated from the Naval \nAcademy in the same year. He was a very fine and respected athlete at \nthe Naval Academy. He went on to become a helicopter pilot in combat in \nVietnam. He gave our country 30 years of distinguished service as a \nnaval officer. He was later the editor in chief of Seapower magazine, \nand was a special assistant to the Commandant of the Coast Guard. He \nhas been unflagging in his attention to detail in everything we have \nworked on in the last 6 years.\n  We were talking a few days ago about whether either of us would have \nthought that during the days of our plebe summers so many years ago we \nwould be sitting on the floor of the U.S. Senate as stewards of the \nwell-being of our country and of the people who served it. I give a \nspecial thanks to Gordon Peterson as he moves on to other challenges in \nhis life.\n  Again, it has been my privilege to serve on this committee.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I wanted to come down and \ntalk about an amendment I am working on to the Defense authorization \nbill. Last week Senator Corker and I filed amendment No. 3049, which \nwould create an open burn pit registry in the Defense Authorization \nAct.\n  Our veterans and Active-Duty members suffering from exposure to burn \npits should not have to wait any longer. The Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee agrees and has passed the legislation after holding hearings. \nHowever, I understand there is currently opposition to passing this \namendment via a managers' package.\n  I would note that we have already passed two amendments dealing with \nveterans yesterday, both the Pryor amendment No. 3291 dealing with \nveterans employment and training and the Reed of Rhode Island amendment \nNo. 3165 dealing with housing assistance for veterans. Both of these \nwere outstanding amendments and help maintain the trust we have made to \nour veterans and our current servicemembers whom we have an obligation \nto care for when they have completed their service.\n  In both Afghanistan and Iraq, open-air burn pits were widely used at \nforward operating bases. Disposing of trash and other debris was a \nmajor challenge. I believe, like the rest of my colleagues, that if we \nare forever in debt to our veterans for their service, we must be \nasking this question: How did these burn pits impact the health of our \nreturning heroes? This amendment is a step toward finding the answers \nwe owe them. It is supported by numerous groups, including Burnpits \n360, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Association of the U.S. Navy, \nRetired Enlisted Association, the Uniformed Services Disabled Retirees, \nand the National Military Family Association.\n  I am hopeful that we can pass this amendment No. 3049 through a \nunanimous consent agreement, but I respectfully request a vote at this \ntime if no such agreement can be made.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7382]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I just wanted to spend a few minutes talking about Reed \namendment No. 3255 and to point out to my colleagues I know this \namendment will pass, but I believe we ought to be on record as voting \nto add $1.7 billion in additional funds that our kids are going to pay \nfor.\n  This is paid for, but it is smoke and mirrors. We have used a trick \nin how we do this. Ultimately, what is going to happen is here is \nanother bill that will require funding from the health account at the \nPentagon, which is in operations and maintenance, which means we will \nnot have $1.7 billion for naval exercises, for flight training, for \ntank training, for range training. In other words, out of this account \nis where it comes to all the preparedness.\n  I must give President Obama credit. He has recommended what the \ncommittee recommended doing for the last 2\\1/2\\ years. Now we have an \namendment that takes where the committee went to, actually, a small \ncopay, increasing copay on pharmacy benefits for retirees, and reverses \nthat and forces our veterans to have to use mail order. I am OK with \nmail order. I know we save a lot of money with that, but the CBO says \nas soon as we stop this one year, the mandate is going to go back the \nother way and the cost is going to be this amount of money. They have \nmet the literal requirements of pay-go, but they haven't met the \nfunctional requirements. Here we have another amendment that we will \ntake out of the operations and maintenance account, and that is \nimportant. But the most important issue in this debate is we continue \nto want to have benefits for our retired military that are growing \nfaster than the rate of inflation--certainly faster than--and not have \nthem help pay for the increase in the benefits.\n  We have $16.4 trillion worth of debt this morning. We have $88 \ntrillion worth of unfunded liabilities, and now we are at this juncture \nwhere we are having a discussion between the Speaker of the House and \nthe President on how we get over the fiscal cliff and start to solve \nsome of these problems. We have an amendment put up because there is a \nvery powerful force, all the service organizations and everything else, \nthat said don't do this.\n  Everybody in our country, if we are to get out of the problem, is \ngoing to have to pay a small sacrifice. This is not a large amount of \nmoney, unless you are absolutely destitute, in terms of the copays. The \nPresident has recommended we do that, the committee recommended it and \nwe are reversing it and using the gimmick so there can't be a budget \npoint of order on it.\n  There will be a time in the not-too-distant future when the decisions \nto control our future will be out of our hands in terms of the \neconomics and the debt. Delaying that now, because we do not want to \nyield against the popular criticism, will cause us to pay a further \ngreat price. The very people who are going to be asked to contribute as \npart of fixing our country are going to be paying a greater price.\n  I just received a book from our colleague, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Sheldon Whitehouse. I received it today, and I have already \nfinished half of it. It has a wonderful introduction. I would recommend \nto all my colleagues--I know they will get one--to read it. It is a \ncollection of thoughts and sayings. If we read what Daniel Webster \nsaid, we read what Benjamin Franklin said, and we read what Winston \nChurchill has said about bowing to the public pressure rather than \ndoing the best right thing, we will not regret it.\n  This is a popular amendment. It is going to pass. The service \norganizations want us to do it, but it is not the right thing to do. We \nhave to begin, as we negotiate, to increase revenues from the very \nwealthy in this country, declining expenses at the Defense Department; \neverybody has to share, everybody in America. If they don't share now, \nthey will share much more painfully in the future.\n  I don't have anything else to say on this other than I will vote \nagainst it, not because I want veterans to have to have a copay but \nbecause I want our country to get out of the hole we are in. Part of \nthe sharing of that is a copay on retail pharmacy.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As we are wrapping up, I would like to tell the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma he is correct.\n  Former Secretary of Defense Gates, probably the most respected \nSecretary of Defense we have had in many years, said, ``Health care \ncosts are,'' in his words, ``eating us alive.''\n  None of us, I don't know a single Member of this body, no matter \nwhere they are, who doesn't want to make sure our veterans are cared \nfor, the widows, the orphans, the veterans, as Abraham Lincoln \ndescribed them. We are going to have to find ways to bring these costs \nunder control and still, at the same time, provide our veterans with \nthe benefits they have earned.\n  I know of no one who joined the military because of TRICARE--I hear \nfrom all the retirees and all that--they joined the military because of \nTRICARE. I have not yet met a single 18-year-old, including my own son, \nwho joined the Marine Corps who said: Gee, I want to join the Marine \nCorps because of TRICARE. No, they joined the military because they \nwant to serve their country.\n  They understand our obligation to them is not to hand them a bankrupt \nDefense Department, that all the costs are in things such as TRICARE \nand retirement benefits and other personnel costs so we can't provide \nthem with what they need to fight.\n  I understand the positions of the veterans groups in this country. I \nrespect them, I love them, and I appreciate them. But we are going to \nhave to get serious about entitlements for the military just as we are \ngoing to have to get serious about entitlements for nonmilitary.\n  I admit our veterans are in a special category. No group of Americans \nhas been willing to serve and sacrifice as our veterans have, although \nthere are certainly other Americans who sacrifice and serve in many \nother ways.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I look forward, perhaps next year--\nI hope the Reed amendment will not be proposed at this time. We need to \nsit down with the chairman, and we will have to have some hearings to \nfind out what these future costs of health care will be. For example, I \nbelieve it has gone now from 11 percent--health care costs have gone \nfrom 11 percent now to 13 percent of the entire defense budget, and it \nwill continue higher. We can't keep doing that.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Gillibrand on autism services. The \nway it is written will require an increase of $1.7 billion over the \nnext 10 years and no way to pay for it. I appreciate the dedication of \nthe Senator from New York, but her answer was: We would like to work \nwith you on that.\n  We have to do more than work on it. We have to solve it. All I can \nsay is while we are waiting, I hope we understand that here it is. The \nDOD health care costs represent nearly 11 percent of the total budget \nrequest for DOD, and it will continue to rise to more than 13 percent. \nThen it will go even higher and higher and higher.\n  There was an editorial in the Washington Post today that says, ``Time \nto Rein in TRICARE.'' It says, in part:\n\n       . . . the administration plans cuts, including shrinking \n     the Army and the Marine Corps. This is risky, given the \n     potential threats the United States faces.\n\n  Unfortunately, Congress is compounding the problem by protecting \nexpensive items that inflate personnel costs without any corresponding \npayoff in defense readiness.''\n  So I would urge my colleagues to pay attention to the editorial in \nthe Washington Post, ``Time To Rein In Tricare,'' because I think it is \nimportant for us to understand.\n  Let me quote from the article:\n\n       Tricare's costs have surged in recent years from $19 \n     billion in fiscal year 2001 to $52.8 billion in fiscal 2011.\n\n  I repeat: In 2001 TRICARE costs were $19 billion. In 2011 it was \n$52.8 billion.\n\n       Much of the growth was driven by Congresses' 2001 decision \n     to add what is essentially a free Medigap plan for retirees \n     over 65. But the main issue is the ultra-low fees and \n     deductibles--which give retirees still of\n\n[[Page S7383]]\n\n     working age little incentive to economize or choose employer \n     plans. President Obama's budget plan would save $12.8 billion \n     over five years by gradually increasing working-age retirees' \n     annual enrollment fees, with lower-income retirees paying the \n     least, and then adjusting them according to national health \n     spending growth thereafter.\n\n  We would not be doing any of that with this bill. We would not be \ndoing any of that. But I would argue this is not the time now, as we \nfinish with this bill, to add another additional cost that we have not \nfound ways to pay for, which consumes a larger and larger part of the \ndefense budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to note the absence \nof a quorum unless there is someone who wishes to speak.\n  I want to try to work through this pending issue. I think it is the \nlast issue we need to work through in some way before there will be a \nunanimous consent request that is propounded. If we can figure out the \nbest way to handle this, and then offer a unanimous consent request, we \nwill be able to reach the end of the bill this very day.\n  So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Oh, I withhold that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would just ask my friend--I understand we have a \nmanagers' package--is it his preference we have the managers' package \ndone at the same time as the UC; do that together?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Hopefully, we will do that shortly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 2927, 3019, 3062, 3113, 3175, 3241, 3242, 3277, 3285, \n                             3226, and 3117\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider these \namendments en bloc, the amendments be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SPECTRUM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Nation's mobile communications industry is a \n     significant economic engine, by one estimate directly or \n     indirectly supporting 3,800,000 jobs, or 2.6 percent of all \n     United States employment, contributing $195,500,000,000 to \n     the United States gross domestic product and driving \n     $33,000,000,000 in productivity improvements in 2011;\n       (2) while wireless carriers are continually implementing \n     new and more efficient technologies and techniques to \n     maximize their existing spectrum capacity, there is a \n     pressing need for additional spectrum for mobile broadband \n     services, with one report predicting that global mobile data \n     traffic will increase 18-fold between 2011 and 2016 at a \n     compound annual growth rate of 78 percent, reaching 10.8 \n     exabytes per month by 2016;\n       (3) as the Nation faces the growing demand for spectrum, \n     consideration should be given to both the supply of spectrum \n     for licensed networks and for unlicensed devices;\n       (4) while this additional demand can be met in part by \n     reallocating spectrum from existing non-governmental uses, \n     the long-term solution must include reallocation and sharing \n     of Federal Government spectrum for private sector use;\n       (5) recognizing the important uses of spectrum by the \n     Federal Government, including for national and homeland \n     security, law enforcement and other critical federal uses, \n     existing law ensures that Federal operations are not harmed \n     as a result of a reallocation of spectrum for commercial use, \n     including through the establishment of the Spectrum \n     Relocation Fund to reimburse Federal users for the costs of \n     planning and implementing relocation and sharing \n     arranagements and, with respect to spectrum vacated by the \n     Department of Defense, certification under section 1062 of \n     P.L. 106-65 by the Secretaries of Defense and Commerce and \n     the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that replacement \n     spectrum provides comparable technical\n\n[[Page S7385]]\n\n     characteristics to restore essential military capability;\n       (6) given the need to determine equitable outcomes for the \n     Nation in relation to spectrum use that balances the private \n     sector's demand for spectrum with national security and other \n     critical federal missions, all interested parties should be \n     encouraged to continue the collaborative efforts between \n     industry and government stakeholders that have been launched \n     by the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration to assess and recommend practical frameworks \n     for the development of relocation, transition, and sharing \n     arrangements and plans for 110 megahertz of federal spectrum \n     in the 1695-1710 MHz and the 1755-1850 MHz bands.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3285, as modified\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1064.

Madam President, I believe the Senator from Kentucky is \nhere to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the amendment before us requires that the \nPresident submit a plan for a no-fly zone for Syria. I want to \ncompliment the authors for including in this amendment a clause that \nsays nothing in this amendment shall be construed as a declaration of \nwar or an authorization for the use of force. I think it is very \nimportant in our Nation today that we are not saying we are starting, \nbeginning, or getting involved in a new war.\n  However, I do think this amendment is ill-advised for two reasons. \nNo. 1, I don't think I know with certainty whether the Syrian rebels \nwill be freedom-loving, tolerant, constitution-toting believers in a \nrepublican form of government or whether they will institute an Islamic \nrepublic that will have no tolerance for Christians and no tolerance \nfor people of any other faith.\n  It still remains to be seen whether a secular government will be \nestablished in Libya, Tunisia, or Egypt. There is the question of \nwhether al-Qaida is more or less of a threat in Libya today since the \nrebels have won the civil war. I don't think we know for certain what a \nrebel government in Syria will do with the 1 million Christians who \nlive in Syria.\n  Since the Iraq war, hundreds of thousands of Christians have fled \nIraq and gone to Syria. Even after the war, apparently Syria was seen \nas more of a tolerant nation than Iraq. Will a rebel Islamic government \nin Syria tolerate or persecute Christians? Will a rebel Islamic \ngovernment institute the death penalty for blasphemy, for conversion, \nor for apostasy? Will they have a true democracy, a secular government, \nor will they have a Syrian rebel government that is less tolerant than \nwhat they currently have? In many ways the Arab spring has become the \nArab winter.\n  In Egypt we have a leader from the Muslim Brotherhood who recited \namen when a radical cleric stood up and said: Death to Israel. As a \nradical cleric said: Death to Israel and anyone who supports them, this \nMuslim Brotherhood leader of Egypt that came out of the Arab spring is \nnodding his head in assent and seemed to be chanting amen.\n  Will they seek peace with Israel or war? Will the Syrian rebels seek \na secular government or one ruled by Shari'a? I think there are many \nunknowns we need to be asking ourselves before we involve ourselves in \na civil war.\n  Secondly, I think it is a bad idea to discuss contingency plans for \nwar. While I am in favor of the Senate retaining our prerogative to \ndeclare war, I believe that the details of the execution of war are in \nthe purview of the Executive. In other words, we do have the power to \nbegin or to not begin a war. That is the power the Constitution gave \nus, but I don't think the Constitution intended to have 535 generals. I \ndon't think it intended to have us explicitly talking about every \ncontingency plan for every possible war in every corner of the globe.\n  Our Defense Department, no doubt, has contingency plans for a \nballistic missile attack on the United States, a conventional land \ninvasion, naval or air encounters throughout the world, but we don't \nnecessarily openly discuss them or encourage them. I don't think it is \nbest to openly discuss these plans for defending against an attack and \nespecially not for involving ourselves in a civil war.\n  Our Nation and our soldiers are weary of war. Our Nation yearns for \nleaders who will strive to keep us out of war. Our Nation yearns for \nleaders who are reluctant to begin a new war or get involved in a new \nwar. I hope my colleagues today will not encourage a rush to war by \npublicly clamoring for a plan to become involved in Syria's civil war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S7387]]\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of \namendment No. 3262, which I am honored to cosponsor with Senators \nMcCain and Levin. I thank the Senators for their disciplined, diligent, \nand very strong leadership of this year's NDAA process. This is an \nauthorization bill that has been taken up and considered by the Senate \nfor 52 years, and despite a lot of challenges and a lot of difficulties \nwe had getting to bills, getting past objections, getting to reasonable \nprocesses and amendments, these two fine Senators have led admirably in \na very difficult environment.\n  This amendment does what I think we need to do next, to put before \nthe Senate in an appropriate classified setting useful information \nabout the possibilities before us and before our allies in a very \ndifficult and very complex region that is, as Senator Paul has noted, \ncurrently undergoing dramatic conflict.\n  Let me speak to a few points that persuaded me to join Senator McCain \nand Senator Levin in cosponsoring this amendment.\n  First, despite the comments from my colleague from Kentucky, these \nplans will be delivered to the Senate in classified form. They will not \nbe accessible to the general public, and they will not be broadcast to \nour opponents or those who might seek to learn about America's plans. \nThey will only be delivered in classified form.\n  Second, and I think most important, it is explicit in this amendment \nthat nothing in this section shall be construed as a declaration of war \nor an authorization for the use of force. Senator Paul's repeated \nconcerns that we are rushing headlong into an overengagement in a civil \nwar that is best left to the people of Syria is reflected clearly and \nin plain language in that provision within this amendment.\n  Earlier today we took up and voted on the Convention on the Rights of \nPersons with Disabilities. I spoke to this issue as well. Despite the \nplain language of that convention that would prevent it from having any \nof the noxious impacts it would have on families in the United States, \ndespite the plain language of that convention and the various \nrestrictions and reservations that were added to it, it would have no \nimpact on homeschooling and no impact on reproductive rights in the \nUnited States. It would have no impact on any of the variety of things \nthat were cast about on the floor of the Senate today. So, too, here we \nshould not allow--despite this plain language--Senators to mislead our \ncolleagues into thinking that somehow secretly embedded within this is \nan authorization for the use of force.\n  So what is this? This is asking that the United States, in \nconsultation between the Department of Defense and this Senate, make \nreasonable assessments of what our path forward in dealing with the \ntragic situation in Syria might be. This amendment is clear that it \nwill not consider ground troops being deployed onto Syrian territory. \nIt will only look at a means that might be used by the United States or \nour allies to stop Assad's reckless, relentless criminal use of \nairpower to murder his own civilians and his own citizens.\n  I have been heartbroken as I have read account after account of jets \nand helicopters being used to stray from red lines, being used to bomb \nhospitals and schools, and of the thousands of innocents who have died.\n  The Syrian civil war is a very complex conflict. Senator Paul asked \nwhat I really think is the central question. He said: How can we be \nconfident that the opposition will be tolerant, inclusive, peaceful, \nand that it will not prosecute or persecute Christians; that they will \nbe an ally to Israel and not impose the sorts of threats and \ndifficulties he cited from Libya, Egypt, and other countries? That is \nexactly the core question at issue for us going forward: Should the \nUnited States stand on the sidelines as Bashar al-Assad massacres tens \nof thousands more of his civilians or should we consider what ways we \ncan be involved through providing humanitarian assistance?\n  Should we support our regional allies, Turkey and Jordan, through \nmultilateral engagement, supporting Turkey's request to NATO for \ndefensive material? Should we better learn and understand what the \nopposition on the ground is inclined to do and set clear standards for \nhow, if they demonstrate they are reliable partners in pursuing peace \nand if they commit themselves to the elements of the national coalition \nand the Free Syrian Army and to being exactly what Senator Paul would \nhope--tolerant, inclusive, pro-democracy--why would we stand on the \nsidelines of history and allow Islamic extremists to instead write the \nfuture of the Syrian people?\n  For these and many reasons I am grateful for the opportunity to join \nwith Senators McCain and Levin in cosponsoring this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut be allowed 4 minutes, the Senator from Michigan be \nallowed 3 minutes, and I be allowed 2 minutes before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I am honored to rise to support this \namendment and just to make a few points. The first is to assure all of \nour colleagues that this is just an amendment that asks the Pentagon to \nconduct a study. It is nothing more than that. I want to particularly \nsay that to reassure anyone who is concerned that somehow this is an \nauthorization for the use of military force. Look at the wording. That \nis just not the case.\n  All we are debating and voting on is whether the Pentagon should be \nasked to do a study of the possibility of how we might stop Bashar al-\nAssad's air force from committing acts of murder against his own \npeople. In my way of thinking, to tell the truth, it is two things: \nOne, this amendment is simply a way of saying that we in the Senate are \nconcerned and care about the slaughter that is going on in Syria and \nagitated that the United States and the rest of the world is not doing \nmore to come to the assistance of those who are fighting for their \nfreedom and lives in Syria.\n  I want to point out that there are a lot of options for the Pentagon \nto study. One is a traditional no-fly zone. We know a lot of people in \nthe Pentagon are concerned that to carry out a traditional no-fly zone \nwith our aircraft, we need to spend a lot of time and energy and assume \nrisks to knock out the Syrian air defenses. Well enough.\n\n  But there are other ways to achieve the goal of keeping Assad's \naircraft from destroying Syria's people. One is to use Patriot \nantimissile batteries to keep Syrian planes--placed in Turkey and \nJordan--out of the air. The second, of course, that I can think of is \nto fire precision guided missiles from offshore to hit the Syrian Air \nForce on the ground so it cannot take off.\n  All of those should be considered as part of this study, as the most \nobvious, which is to make sure that the freedom fighters on the ground \nhave their own antiaircraft weapons to fire from the ground at Assad's \naircraft so they can protect their own lives.\n  The truth is, in supporting this amendment, I come to say that I \ncontinue to be troubled, deeply, by why the United States and so much \nof the rest of the civilized world is standing by and letting this \nhappen. To me--and I speak only personally, and I do so with respect--\ngetting involved in this on behalf of the opposition in Syria has been \nnow for 18 months as close to a no-brainer as America ever has the \nopportunity to get involved in in foreign policy.\n  I say that because from the beginning we knew which side was fighting \nfor freedom and which side was against it. And America is supposed to \nbe on the side of the freedom fighters. Secondly, this has developed \ninto a humanitarian disaster: 40,000 people killed. And, third, we have \nnot just humanitarian interests here and values interests, we have \nstrategic interests because Assad's government is the No. 1 friend of \nour No. 1 enemy in the world, which is the Islamic Republic of Iran. If \nhe goes down, Iran and its radical regime suffers a body blow. If we \ncontinue to stand back, we run the risk of terrible sectarian conflict \nin Syria, which runs the risk of spreading beyond, between Sunni and \nShia, also between secular and religious modernizers and people who do \nnot want to modernize.\n  We have every good reason to come to the aid of these people in need, \nand I do not see an argument for not at\n\n[[Page S7388]]\n\nleast studying how we might better do that.\n  I thank my colleagues. I am proud to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I wonder if I might be able to proceed \nfor 1 minute before we begin the votes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that 1 minute be \nadded and that the Senator from Mississippi be recognized for that 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me to \nbreeze in here at the last moment.\n  I would like to speak today about a Department of Defense policy that \nhas an impact on American jobs and is in urgent need of greater \ntransparency. Until recently, this policy picked industry winners and \nlosers. We must ensure that the Federal Government's adopted standards \nfor green buildings are consensus-based, fair, and established by sound \nscience.\n  Before last year's Defense authorization bill was signed into law, \nthe Department of Defense exclusively recognized or showed preference \nfor a single green building rating system.\n  The U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and \nEnvironmental Design--or LEED--became DOD's adopted benchmark for green \nbuilding.\n  This raised concerns, primarily because LEED standards are not \ndeveloped in a transparent manner and do not allow meaningful input \nfrom all affected stakeholders.\n  For example, for some reason LEED standards are unreasonably biased \nagainst American timber.\n  Obtaining the highest LEED certifications often requires green \nbuildings to exclude domestic wood. Instead, the use of bamboo, often \nshipped from overseas, is favored over more cost-efficient local \ntimber.\n  The next version of LEED threatens to eliminate the use of other \napproved materials and proven products that are currently used to \nachieve true energy savings.\n  It makes sense to anticipate that a blanket adoption of LEED by the \nDepartment of Defense would have a significant impact on American \nindustry.\n  To put the scope of DOD's green building policies into perspective: \nDOD has more than 500,000 facilities, covering more than 2 billion \nsquare feet. If we combined all of the nearly 5,000 Wal-Mart buildings \nin America, it would make up about a third of DOD's real estate.\n  That is why I fought for language--included in the 2012 Defense \nauthorization conference report--requiring DOD to conduct a cost-\nbenefit analysis of various green building rating systems.\n  Last year's Defense authorization conference report prohibited the \nuse of funds to implement LEED standards.\n  This year, the Armed Services Committee accepted language I offered \nto extend the prohibition of funds for LEED until 6 months after the \ncost-benefit study is reported to Congress.\n  I look forward to the findings of this study but remain concerned \nabout DOD's adoption of any green building standards that are not \ntransparent and consensus-based.\n  I have yet another amendment that would direct DOD to utilize green \nbuilding standards that are driven by consensus as determined by the \nAmerican Nationa Standards nstitute, and include sufficient input from \nall affected stakeholders.\n  My amendment also would support green building standards that \nconsider the full environmental benefits provided by a building \nmaterial throughout its lifetime. Life Cycle Assessment is a science-\nbased approach used to measure these benefits.\n  Together, I believe these provisions would create a level playing \nfield for materials to compete for green building and energy savings in \nDOD construction.\n  The Federal Government should be in the business of choosing winners \nand losers, Adoption of LEED only--or/any other green building standard \nnot developed by consensus--would discriminate against American-made \nproducts, reduce transparency, impact jobs, and ultimately undermine \nenergy savings and sustainability sought using taxpayer dollars.\n  Although I am going to withhold my amendment, I will continue to \nclosely monitor this issue to ensure that fair competition is part of \nDOD's construction of green buildings.\n  I want to thank the chairman, ranking member, and all the members of \nthe committee.\n  In conclusion, as we have learned, there is more than one way to have \ngreen building standards. The Defense Department has tilted toward the \nLEED standards in the past. I think we have authorized now a scientific \nanalysis of other methods that is proceeding apace. I had planned to \noffer yet another amendment which would be withdrawn directing that the \nDepartment of Defense utilize green building standards that are driven \nby consensus as determined by the American National Standards \nInstitute. As I say, I am withholding that amendment.\n  I do appreciate the language that is in the bill now, and I think we \nwill end up with green building standards that save energy and serve \nthe purposes of national defense and do not tilt toward one industry \nover the other.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for her indulgence, I thank my \ncolleagues on the committee, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3262, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I very much support the amendment offered \nby Senator McCain and thank him for it.\n  The suffering of the Syrian people and, increasingly, the people of \nthe region continues to grow daily. This amendment tells the Secretary \nof Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs that we want a \nclassified assessment of the effectiveness of various military \nsolutions to the problems that are there in Syria and in the region.\n  This information is going to help inform Congress on the challenges \nand the obstacles to various solutions, including the very challenges \nand questions which were identified by Senator Paul. Those are the \nkinds of questions--not the total list, but the kinds of questions--\nwhich this assessment will help us to address. It will also help inform \nus about the budget and the policy decisions that the congressional \ndefense committees make in the upcoming fiscal year.\n  The principal purpose of this amendment, as is stated in the \namendment, is ``to advance the goals of President Obama of stopping the \nkilling of civilians in Syria and creating conditions for a transition \nto a democratic, pluralistic political system in Syria.'' That is what \nis on the mind, I believe, of all of us.\n  This report--an assessment, to use the word in the amendment--is \ncritically important to Congress, and I very much support the effort of \nSenator McCain and thank him for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would point out again that section \n(d)(e) of this amendment says:\n\n       No Authorization For Use Of Military Force.--Nothing in \n     this section shall be construed as a declaration of war or an \n     authorization for the use of force.\n\n  And it will be in ``classified form.''\n  Yesterday, this was the front-page headline of the Washington Post: \nObama Sternly Warns Syria. There is no doubt that as this conflict has \ndragged on and on, the risk of a wider conflict and terrible \nconsequences can ensue. It is well known that Bashar Assad has a very \nlarge inventory of chemical weapons, including sarin gas, which is a \ndeadly nerve agent.\n  I am not predicting that the United States has to be involved, but \nthere is very little doubt in anyone's mind that as this conflict \nescalates, the risk of spreading, the risk of greater jihadist \ninvolvement, the greater risk of problems on the borders of Lebanon, of \nIraq, of Jordan increase.\n  And if military action has to be taken in order, for example, to \nprevent sarin gas to be used, the Congress of the United States has to \nbe involved. We have a thing called the War Powers Act. The War Powers \nAct expressly calls that Congress make decisions. The Congress needs to \nbe informed. I believe all this amendment does is informs, in a \nclassified manner, the Defense committees so that we will have the \ninformation necessary to understand the various eventualities that \ncould result in this terribly, terribly\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\nescalating and deteriorating situation in Syria.\n  As my friend from Connecticut said, 40,000 people have already been \nslaughtered. I think the U.S. Congress needs to be made aware not of \nwhat we should do but what we can do in case of that eventuality. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, the \nSenator from Delaware, and, of course, the chairman of the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nis expired and the question occurs on agreeing to McCain amendment No. \n3262, as modified.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Madam President, I move to reconsider, and I move to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Kyl Amendment No. 3213, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 3123, \nas modified, is agreed to.\n\n\n                         Export Controls Reform\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I rise to engage the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee in a colloquy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to have a colloquy with the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Earlier this year, I introduced a bill that reforms \nexport controls on satellites and their related items. Under the \ncurrent law, satellites must be subject to the most restrictive export \ncontrols regardless of whether they are sensitive, militarily \nsignificant, or widely available outside of the U.S. This has both \ndiminished our Nation's economic competitiveness and our national \nsecurity. In fact, the State and Defense departments recently concluded \nthat the ``current law forces the U.S. Government to continue to \nprotect commonly available satellites and related items on the USML, \nthus impeding the U.S. ability to work with partners and putting U.S. \nmanufacturers at a disadvantage, but providing no noticeable benefit to \nnational security.''\n  My bill reforms our export control laws so that the executive branch \nhas the discretion to determine the appropriate level of export \ncontrols for satellites and related items. The executive branch \ncurrently has such discretion for all other types of items whether the \nitem serves a military or a dual-use purpose. The bill also prohibits \nthe transfer of such items to China, North Korea, and state sponsors of \nterrorism.\n  Last week, I filed an amendment to the defense authorization bill \nthat mirrors my legislation. Senators Rubio, Warner, Mark Udall, and \nCardin cosponsored the measure. While I had hoped to offer and pass our \namendment, it is my understanding that the chairman intends to address \nthese reforms in conference. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I first want to thank the Senator from Colorado for his \nwork on reforming our Nation's export control laws. The House version \nof the National Defense Authorization Act includes provisions \naddressing these issues. I support his efforts in this area and I \nintend to work with the House of Representatives to address these \nreforms in conference.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the chairman for his support and assurance.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3054\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise to explain the scope of, and \nintent behind, my amendment on naval vessel naming. Amendment No. 3054, \nas modified, to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2013 is a direct response to recent criticism that the Secretary of the \nNavy has, in some instances, politicized the ship naming process.\n  Since its establishment, the U.S. Navy has developed a rich tradition \nof vessel naming. Traditional sources for vessel names customarily \nencompassed categories such as geographic locations in the United \nStates; historic sites, battles, and ships; naval and military heroes \nand leaders; and, other noted individuals who have made distinguished \ncontributions to the Navy or our Nation's national security. The name \nthe Navy selects for a vessel should reflect the very best of our \nNation's and our Navy's great heritage. It should impart a sense of \nhonor and serve as an inspiration for the vessel's crew. It should not, \nin any way, be tarnished by controversy. Unfortunately, controversy and \ncriticism have surrounded some of the Secretary's recent vessel naming \nchoices.\n  This amendment seeks to avoid similar controversy in the future. It \nsets forth necessary and appropriate standards, grounded in historical \npractice, to guide the Secretary of the Navy's decisions on vessel \nnaming. It requires that the Secretary assure the Senate and House \nCommittees on Armed Services that the proposed vessel name comports \nwith those standards 30 days before announcing or assigning a vessel's \nname.\n  Under the procedure established by my amendment, I fully intend and \nexpect that the Navy will not move forward with any vessel naming \nproposal, unless the Congressional defense committees approve. Much as \nthe Department of Defense seeks prior approval for reprogramming \nrequests, the Secretary of the Navy should secure the prior approval of \nthe Congressional defense committees before announcing or implementing \na vessel naming proposal.\n  I take no joy or pride in this amendment, but believe it is \nnecessitated by the spate of controversies over the last few years. I \nsincerely hope the amendment helps the U.S. Navy preserve the high \nstandards it has traditionally employed for vessel naming.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2943\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I was very pleased that the Senate \nadopted last night an amendment to improve the Law Enforcement Officers \nSafety Act, LEOSA. I was pleased to join Senator Webb, a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, as a cosponsor to strengthen a policy \nthat is important to our Nation's law enforcement community. I thank \nChairman Levin and Senator Webb for their efforts.\n  The amendment we adopt today will place military police and civilian \npolice officers within the Department of Defense on equal footing with \ntheir law enforcement counterparts across the country when it comes to \ncoverage under LEOSA. The LEOSA law permits active and qualified \nretired law enforcement officers to carry a concealed firearm across \nState lines. This law, which has been in place since 2004, gives our \nlaw enforcement officers, should they choose, the peace of mind that \nthey are protected wherever they may be.\n\n[[Page S7390]]\n\n  One of the qualifications required of active or retired officers to \nbe covered by the LEOSA law is that they must have ``statutory arrest \nauthority''. Some law enforcement personnel within the Department of \nDefense do have such statutory arrest authority. Others do not. For \nexample, civilian police officers that conduct law enforcement \nactivities on military bases or installations derive their authority \nfrom the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This authority, while \nstatutory, is ``apprehension'' authority. Due to that difference \nbetween the LEOSA law's specific enumerated requirements, and the \nauthority pursuant to which civilian police in the military operate, \nthese law enforcement officers have not been able to obtain the law's \nbenefits.\n  To remedy this, the amendment we have adopted will expressly include \nwithin the LEOSA statute currently non-covered civilian police officers \nand military police. It will do so by adding a statutory citation \nwithin Title 18 of the United States Code to the relevant portion of \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice. This will provide legal certainty \nfor the Department of Defense, and will provide the needed LEOSA \ncoverage for currently non-covered law enforcement personnel within the \nmilitary.\n  The Senate has agreed unanimously to extend LEOSA to the law \nenforcement officers that serve within our military who are currently \nnot eligible for coverage under LEOSA. They are no less deserving or \nworthy of this privilege and I am very pleased we have acted to \nequalize their treatment under the Federal law. Given the productive \ndiscussions we have had with the Department of Defense Office of Law \nEnforcement Policy and Support, and with Chairman Levin in developing \nthis amendment. I expect that it will be implemented without delay so \nthat those intended to be covered may gain the law's benefit quickly. \nThese police officers, who largely perform the same duties as their \ncounterparts elsewhere in the Federal Government and at the State and \nlocal level, deserve the equal treatment this amendment will provide.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss what more we can do \nto prevent the scourge of suicides among our servicemembers. I have \nbeen concerned for quite some time about the physical and psychological \nchallenges facing the men and women who serve in our military, \nincluding the unique challenges faced by members of the National Guard \nand Reserve.\n  Despite a variety of programs to address the rate of suicide among \nNational Guard and Reserve personnel, current statistics raise ongoing \nconcerns about what more we can do to address this serious issue. In \n2011, 165 Active-Duty soldiers and 118 Guard and Reservists took their \nlives, and the Army is on track to meet or surpass the same number of \nsuicide related deaths again this year.\n  I appreciate that the Armed Services Committee has included Section \n512 in the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, which \nestablishes a suicide prevention and resiliency program specifically \nfor the reserve component of the military. In order for these programs \nto succeed, all members of a community must work together and watch out \nfor one another. This includes involving the private sector and \nuniversities, who can contribute valuable resources. I would note that \nthe Department's Office of Suicide Prevention, in carrying out Section \n512 and 722 of this bill, must work with private sector and university \npartners to develop and implement suicide prevention training for \ncommunity-based organizations, including schools, hospitals, religious \norganizations and employers, to raise awareness and provide tools for \nintervention to members of the National Guard and Reserve and their \nfamilies. Universities and researchers, including those throughout \nPennsylvania, have explored this issue and stand ready to support our \nreturning servicemembers.\n  This is a national challenge and Congress must work hand in hand with \nthe Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs as well with State and \nlocal community leaders to end this terrible epidemic.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3232\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I would first like to take this time to \nthank my colleagues Senator Menendez and Senator Kirk for putting forth \na comprehensive plan to arm the administration with the tools they need \nto put a stop to Iran's rogue nuclear program and for working to put \ntogether the final text of this amendment.\n  Look, time's a-wasting, so we need to ratchet up the sanctions now.\n  And rest assured--this is a powerful package that will paralyze the \nIranian economy.\n  I believe that when it comes to Iran, we should never take the \nmilitary option off the table. But I have long argued that economic \nsanctions are the preferred and probably most effective way to choke \nIran's nuclear ambitions.\n  It should come as no surprise that today the head of International \nAtomic Energy Agency, IAEA, suggested that his inspectors in Iran are \ncoming under increased duress amid fears that the Iranian regime might \nbe aspiring to make atomic arms. And according to published reports, \nIran could have at least one workable nuclear weapon by next year and \nanother maybe 6 months after that. This cannot be allowed!\n  Additionally, the IAEA has reported that Iran possesses a highly \norganized program dedicated to acquiring the skills necessary to \nproduce and test a nuclear bomb.\n  Earlier this year, Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper told \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee that Iran's leaders seem prepared to \nattack U.S. interests overseas.\n  Just last year we saw U.S. authorities successfully thwart an Iranian \nplot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in this very city.\n  So by giving the administration the capability to tighten their \ncrippling sanctions on Iran should they continue with their nuclear \nweapons program, the Senate is continuing to address the very real \nthreat Iran poses to the United States and our allies, particularly \nIsrael.\n  And make no mistake--after Hamas initiated their bloody rocket \nattacks against innocent civilians in Israel last month, who did they \nthank afterwards? They actually thanked Iran for their support in \nhelping make ``Israel scream with pain.'' Iran sends rockets to \nterrorist groups to kill innocent civilians. That is just one out of \nmany reasons why the international community just cannot allow Iran to \nhave a nuclear weapons capability.\n  This bill will do several important things to strangle Iran's ability \nto continue with its illegal nuclear program.\n  First, it designates Iran's energy, port, shipping, and shipbuilding \nsectors as ``entities of proliferation concern'' due to the role they \nplay in supporting Iran's proliferation activities.\n  Secondly, it blocks and prohibits all transactions in property in the \nUnited States by any person who is part of Iran's energy, port, and \nshipping sectors.\n  Additionally, it sanctions the sale, supply, and transfer of certain \nmaterials and precious metals to Iran.\n  And importantly, this bill sanctions foreign financial institutions \nfor knowingly conducting transactions on behalf of any sanctioned \nIranian person.\n  Mr. President, I believe my colleagues Senator Menendez and Senator \nKirk have done an excellent job ensuring that the administration has \nthe tools they need to put a stop to Iran's rogue nuclear program.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, as we conclude our work on S. 3254, the \nfiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, I would like to \ndraw attention to yet another important role my State is playing in our \nnational defense.\n  North Carolina is home to the two major lithium suppliers in the \nUnited States. Not only are these important employers in my State, but \nthey are serving our defense industry with critical materials that are \nvital to our Nation's defense capabilities both now and in the future.\n  The Defense Department has recognized through its Defense Production \nAct Title III office that ``Li Ion batteries are extremely attractive \nto military customers with the most demanding set of requirements such \nas the space/satellite communities for spacecraft applications and the \nSpecial Operation forces.''\n  Lithium metal is an important component in a wide range of defense \napplications. For over a decade, the US\n\n[[Page S7391]]\n\nmilitary has been widely using non-rechargeable--primary--lithium \nbatteries to provide power for mines, missiles, torpedoes, sonobuoys, \nguided artillery, fuses, communication devices, countermeasure devices, \nglobal positioning systems, and guidance systems. Presently, primary \nlithium batteries are the power source of choice for a majority of \ndevices that a servicemember uses in combat and realistic training \noperations. An infantryman on a 72-hour mission in Afghanistan carries \naround 30 pounds of batteries. Lithium metal used in these defense \napplications affords today's Armed Forces fluid movement on the \nbattlefield and in remote areas.\n  We need to remain vigilant to the world's lithium supply situation. \nOffshore suppliers of lithium are poised to expand their capacity at \nthe risk of domestic U.S. lithium production capability. It will be \nessential to our future national defense needs that we are able protect \nand enhance our domestic supply chain of battery-grade lithium metal.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the importance of this industry to our \nNation's defense. I am proud that over 600 men and women in my State \nare dedicated to creating these critical materials for our Armed \nservices and urge that we continue to recognize the essential role this \nindustry plays in our future defense strategies.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3291\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I want to thank Chairman Levin and \nRanking Member McCain for the work they have done on the National \nDefense Authorization and for working with me on this amendment.\n  This bipartisan amendment, the Helping Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans \nReturn to Employment, HIRE, at Home Act, introduced by myself and \nSenator Johanns encourages states to consider the training \nservicemembers receive during active duty when determining eligibility \nfor State licenses and certifications.\n  This amendment will encourage States to consider the specialized \nmilitary training and experience servicemembers acquire on active duty \nas filling all or some of the State certification and licensing \nrequirements. Specifically, the amendment will apply to individuals \nseeking employment as commercial truck drivers, certified nursing \nassistants or emergency medical technicians.\n  By eliminating the expensive and time consuming hurdles \nservicemembers often face, this amendment will help ensure our \nreturning veterans come home to new job opportunities and help lower \nthe high unemployment rate among our young veterans.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the National \nDefense Authorization Act, NDAA, for Fiscal Year 2013. I wish to \ncommend Senator Levin and Senator McCain for their leadership in \nbringing this legislation to the floor. The Senate has passed the NDAA \nevery year for over one-half century. Senators Levin and McCain have \nplayed a key role on NDAA over the past several years, and I am \ngrateful for their dedication and concern for the men and women of our \nArmed Forces and the defense of the Nation.\n  I am pleased that NDAA, as amended, includes three of my amendments, \nincluding a sense of the Senate resolution regarding conflict-induced \ndisplacements in Afghanistan. As Afghan refugees are being pushed into \nfaster repatriation, they are often forced into returning to a country \nwhere they have little or no hope. In particular, Pakistan, which has \nhosted Afghan refugees for more than 30 years, plans to cancel refugee \nstatus for the 3 million Afghans at the end of this year. Forcing these \nrefugees back into Afghanistan would only exacerbate the crisis for a \ncountry that is still struggling with an ongoing insurgency, an economy \ndependent on U.S. foreign assistance, and the impending withdraw of \nNATO troops in 2014.\n  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \nUNHCR, more than 5.7 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan \nsince 2002, increasing the population of the country by approximately \n25 percent. In both urban and rural areas, however, more than 40 \npercent of the returnees have not integrated into their home \ncommunities. In addition to difficulties returning refugees face, \ninternal displacement has been dramatically on the rise.\n  The conflict-induced displaced Afghans face numerous challenges due \nto continuing violence, tribal conflicts, lack of land tenure and \nhousing, limited opportunities to earn a livelihood, and reduced access \nto public services and water. As winter approaches, I am especially \nconcerned for the children who will be vulnerable to the harsh weather \nand illnesses likely to occur from living in such severe conditions. \nLast winter, there were many reports of children freezing to death in \nsettlement camps and other temporary shelters.\n  The sense of the Senate resolution not only expresses these concerns \nfor the dramatic rise in conflict-induced displacements in Afghanistan \nand the corresponding humanitarian needs; it also recommends that the \nDepartment of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees & Migration and \nthe Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan jointly develop \na comprehensive strategy to address these displacement issues.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate passed my two amendments to add the \nCoast Guard to the current baseline NDAA sections addressing military \ndiversity and military hazing. Nearly 2 years ago, the Military \nLeadership Diversity Commission issued a report with 20 recommendations \nto the Armed Forces, including the Coast Guard. The Commission found \nthat the services' leadership does not reflect the diversity of the \nenlisted members they lead or the American population they fight to \nprotect. While the Coast Guard has made strides in addressing its lack \nof diversity among women and minorities, it still has significant \nobstacles to overcome. For instance, of the 91 graduates of the Coast \nGuard's Officer Candidate School last year, only five were African-\nAmerican, four were Asian, and nine were Hispanic. The Coast Guard can \nand must do better to enhance diversity among its senior leadership, \nwhich will have a positive impact for generations to come. And like \nother branches of the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard continues to suffer \nfrom hazing incidents. Just last year, seven members of the Coast Guard \nwere found to have tied down their fellow crew members and performed \nsexual hazing on them.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate adopted the Feinstein amendment, \nwhich restricts the ability of the U.S. Government to detain without \ncharge or trial U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents suspected \nof carrying out terrorist activities. The role our civilian-led \nmilitary plays within the borders of the United States has always been \nbalanced with the protections of civil liberties, civil rights, and the \ndue process of law.\n  On the subject of detainees, however, I am disappointed that the \nSenate approved the Ayotte amendment, which prohibits the use of funds \nfor transferring or releasing detainees from the detention facilities \nat Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for prosecution and trial in the United \nStates. In my view, any provision that extends the life of detention \nfacilities at Guantanamo Bay unnecessarily sullies America's human \nrights record. The Ayotte amendment also represents a significant cost \nburden going forward for the U.S. Government, as it would force the \nGuantanamo Bay detention facility to remain open indefinitely. The \nAyotte amendment also handicaps our Federal courts. Our Federal \ncourts--unlike military tribunals--have an excellent track record of \ntrying and convicting the most dangerous criminals and terrorists in \nthe world, and Congress should not tie the hands of our law enforcement \nand intelligence agencies to use our Article III courts. Our Federal \nprison system can also securely hold for life those convicted of \nterrorism offenses.\n  When it comes to personnel issues, I support the baseline NDAA bill, \nwhich will improve the quality of life for our men and women in uniform \nand their families. The bill provides a 1.7-percent pay increase for \nall Active, Reserve, and Guard servicemembers. The bill prevents the \nDepartment of Defense from increasing TRICARE deductibles and annual \ncatastrophic caps and levying enrollment fees for TRICARE Standard and \nTRICARE for Life. Also, the bill further advances service opportunities \nfor women by directing the Secretary of Defense to make further \nregulatory and statutory changes in\n\n[[Page S7392]]\n\ncombat-related restrictions. Finally, I want to commend the Senate \nArmed Services Committee for authorizing veterans to participate in the \nTransition Assistance Program for 1 year after their discharge so that \nthey can be better prepared to lead a productive civilian life.\n  On another crucial personnel matter, however, I am deeply \ndisappointed that the Senate defeated my amendment to prevent an \nacross-the-board cut to the Defense civilian workforce that could lead \nto an additional 36,000 government job losses in the coming years. \nThese cuts--on top of cuts that already will occur--would be made \nwithout consideration to required workload, mission, or funding as \ncurrently required by law. The Senate version of NDAA, if unchanged, \nwill force an arbitrary, sequestration-type of cut in the DOD's \ncivilian workforce, injuring the defense industrial base and \nundermining economic recovery. There is a better way to make judicious \npersonnel decisions in the Department of Defense than the bill's \nsection 341. I hope the NDAA conferees will heed the administration's \ndeep concerns with regard to section 341, which the House NDAA--H.R. \n4310--does not include.\n  A bill this large and complex won't please everybody entirely. I have \njust outlined some of the provisions I support and some of the \nprovisions I don't support. I will vote to pass NDAA to advance it to \nconference. H.R. 4310, like S. 3254, has good and bad provisions, in my \nestimation. For instance, it contains provisions that further restrict \nthe transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States or foreign \ncountries, and it limits the administration's ability to implement the \nNew START Treaty or to set U.S. nuclear weapon policy to further \nnuclear force reduction. But, on the other hand, it doesn't contain \nsection 341. I hope the legislation the conferees report will be \nsomething I can support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I will be very brief. I feel so grateful \nand so proud that the tradition of our committee and this Senate has \nbeen maintained on our 51st consecutive Defense authorization bill, a \nbill that is so vitally important to the Nation. I am grateful to all \nof our colleagues for working on a bipartisan basis through the normal \nand open legislative process to produce this bill. I am grateful to \nstand here with my partner, Senator McCain--we worked together on this \nbill--to all of the members of the committee, to our staff and the \nfloor and cloakroom staff. We passed over 100 amendments. It was a \nprocess that allowed us to be just as accommodating as we humanly \ncould.\n  One person I wish to single out as someone who has worked for the \ncommittee for 41 years--this will be her last year--is Chris Cowart. \nShe is our chief clerk, and I would like to take an additional 2 \nseconds to mention her name as a symbol of the staff for whom we are so \ngrateful.\n  I don't know if Senator McCain is here, but I know that I speak for \nhim about our staffs and about our colleagues on the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause is stricken, and the text of S. 3254 as passed is \ninserted in lieu thereof.\n  The clerk will read the title of the bill for the third time.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, H.R. 4310, as \namended, is passed, and the motion to reconsider is considered made and \nlaid upon the table.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate insists on its amendment, \nrequests a conference with the House, and the Chair appoints the \nfollowing conferees:\n  Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nNelson of Nebraska, Mr. Webb, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Udall of Colorado, \nMrs. Hagan, Mr. Begich, Mr. Manchin, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nBlumenthal, Mr. McCain, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. \nWicker, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Portman, Ms. Ayotte, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Vitter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7392-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7392-S7393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RUSSIA AND MOLDOVA JACKSON-VANIK REPEAL ACT OF 2012--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I now move to proceed to calendar No. 552, \nH.R. 6156, which is the Russia-Moldova trade agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to calendar No. 552, H.R. 6156, an act to \n     authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment \n     (normal trade relations treatment) to products of the Russian \n     Federation and Moldova and to require reports on the \n     compliance of the Russian Federation with its obligations as \n     a member of the World Trade Organization, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                     National Defense Authorization\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the chairman for his \npatience in allowing this legislation to be completed. I would note \nthat there were 145 amendments and many recorded votes and good debate \nand discussion over very important issues.\n  I also wish to say thank you to the majority leader.\n  I wish to note the good work of the staff, showing again that work \nrelease programs can be successful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say a word, I was looking for an \nopportunity to express my appreciation to the two managers of this \nbill.\n  This has been hard, but they have done an excellent job. There is \nnothing\n\n[[Page S7393]]\n\nmore important we do here than make sure that our fighting men and \nwomen have the resources to do what they need to do for our country, \nand there are no two better managers that we could have on this bill \nthan these two fine Senators. I appreciate very much their hard work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while the leader is here, I would add my \nthanks to the majority leader. This could not have happened without the \nwillingness of the majority leader to take a little bit of risk at this \ntime of year with so few days left.\n  Senator McCain and I told the majority leader that we thought we \ncould do it in 3 days, and I want you to know that we did it in 3 days. \nWe don't count half days. If we counted half days, it took us more than \n3 days, I must confess to the majority leader. But, nonetheless, the \nmajority leader was willing to let us start down this road. And we did \nit in a unanimous way. I think it is only the second time in 51 years \nthat there has been a unanimous vote on a Defense authorization bill, \nand it is because of the willingness and determination of our \nleadership that we proceed with this bill and that we allow the kind of \nprocess to occur that we did and to take the time we did, and I am very \ngrateful.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I took no risk, because Senator Levin from \nMichigan and Senator McCain from Arizona said, We will finish the bill \nin 3 days. So I had no risk because I knew that is what they would do. \nWe may have spilled over a few hours, but basically they held to their \nagreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Again, I thank the majority leader and my friend from \nMichigan.\n  I do want to thank our staff who worked many long hours, long after \nwe had shut down regular business. They continued to work through a \ntotal of 392 amendments that were filed on this legislation. I \nappreciate the hard work and the cooperative spirit that enabled us not \nonly to dispose of the amendments, but also I heard no complaint from \nany Member that their amendment did not get the consideration they felt \nit deserved. I think that is pretty remarkable, and I thank them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I want to join in thanking the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, and the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator McCain, for the extraordinary \nbipartisan work they have done on this measure, and also the \naccommodation and consideration they have given to all of us who have \nproposed amendments, as well as to their staff and the majority leader.\n  On behalf of Connecticut, which produces many of the key products \nthat are affected by this bill, such as the Joint Strike Fighter, our \nsubmarines, and the Sikorsky helicopter, we have a great deal of pride \nin the support that the U.S. Senate has given today to our national \ndefense and the production of these products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7393-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7393-S7397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ANIMAL FIGHTING SPECTATOR PROHIBITION ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 1947, and that the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1947) to prohibit attendance of an animal \n     fighting venture, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous consent that the Blumenthal \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to and that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3309) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 21, insert ``knowingly'' before ``cause''.\n\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I recognize that the hour is late. I \nwish to take a very brief moment to thank my colleagues, beginning with \nSenator Kirk and Senator Brown--my distinguished colleagues from \nIllinois and Massachusetts--who have done such great work on this \nmeasure over many months, as well as Senator Cantwell of Washington and \nother colleagues who have cosponsored this measure, including Senators \nCollins, Feinstein, Gillibrand, Kerry, Landrieu, Merkley, Mikulski, \nMurray, Vitter, and Wyden. They are all tireless advocates for animals.\n  This bill is about ending animal fighting which, plainly and simply, \nis a blood sport. It is cruel and inhumane. It leaves animals scarred \nand disabled. And, it is associated with many other criminal \nactivities. People who attend animal fights are often also engaged in \ndrug dealing, extortion, assault, and a variety of other crimes, and \nthe enabling activity is animal fighting.\n  That is why this bill increases the penalties for knowingly attending \nan animal fight with a child and, indeed, makes it a crime to knowingly \nattend an animal fight. These stricter penalties are contingent upon a \npurposeful support for this cruel and inhumane sport.\n  Very simply, this legislation provides new tools to law enforcement \nfor eliminating not only animal fighting, but also the activities that \nmay be attendant to them.\n  Animal fighting is a Federal matter, and it requires a Federal \nresponse. This is particularly important because an animal fighting \nring often involves players from many different States. Under current \nlaw, a county sheriff or a local prosecutor simply lacks the authority \nto root out, apprehend, and effectively prosecute such an operation.\n  This bill has the support of many law enforcement organizations whom \nI thank, including the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association and \nFraternal Order of Police. County sheriffs from across the country have \nalso signed on as supporters, along with the American Veterinary \nMedical Association and the Humane Society of the United States. I hope \nit will have support from this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on passage of the bill.\n  The bill (S. 1947), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1947\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Animal Fighting Spectator \n     Prohibition Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON ATTENDING AN ANIMAL FIGHT OR CAUSING A \n                   MINOR TO ATTEND AN ANIMAL FIGHT.\n\n       Section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2156) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in the heading, by striking ``Sponsoring or Exhibiting \n     an Animal in'' and inserting ``Sponsoring or Exhibiting an \n     Animal in, Attending, or Causing a Minor To Attend'';\n       (B) in paragraph (1)--\n       (i) in the heading, by striking ``In General'' and \n     inserting ``Sponsoring or Exhibiting''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``paragraph (2)'' and inserting \n     ``paragraph (3)'';\n       (C) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and\n       (D) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(2) Attending or causing a minor to attend.--It shall be \n     unlawful for any person to--\n       ``(A) knowingly attend an animal fighting venture; or\n       ``(B) knowingly cause a minor to attend an animal fighting \n     venture.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (g), by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(5) the term `minor' means a person under the age of 18 \n     years old.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First of all, I commend and compliment my friend from \nConnecticut for sponsoring this bill and pushing it through. Animal \nfighting is a despicable thing to be engaged in. To think people take \ntheir kids there, and families. It is something we should not be doing \nand I thank the Senator for his leadership on that issue, getting the \nbill passed.\n\n\n         Convention on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities\n\n  I want to take the floor for a few moments. I know others want to \nspeak. They were kind enough to let me get in front of them. I want to \ncomment for a couple of minutes on the vote today on the Convention on \nthe Rights of Persons With Disabilities. I said off the floor that this \nwas a shameful day for the Senate, and I meant it. Today was a shameful \nday for the Senate. To turn our backs on a convention, a treaty which \nwas based upon the Americans With Disabilities Act in our own country \nthat is now 22 years old and has done so much to enhance opportunities \nfor people with disabilities and their families, to turn our backs on \nthat for no real reason is something I have a hard time comprehending, \nand I have been in the Senate a long time now.\n  There are reasons people can come up with a vote this way or that on \ncertain things and most times they are very legitimate. People might \nhave some legitimate concerns about a bill or an amendment. I could \nfind no legitimate concerns about the Convention on the Rights of \nPeople With Disabilities--legitimate concerns. We heard all this talk \nabout home schoolers, people who are homeschooling their kids, the U.N. \nwas going to come in and take them away--nonsense, utter, sheer \nnonsense.\n  What happened today was the triumph on the Senate floor of fear. \nUnfounded, unreasonable fear triumphed over experience--the experience \nwe have had with the Americans With Disabilities Act, reasoned, \nrational thought--unfounded fears that somehow, someplace, somebody is \ngoing to do something. Out of the U.N. they are going to come in and \ntake over or something. But we proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that \nnone of our laws had to be changed. This gave the U.N. no authority \nover our country or our laws or anything. Yet this unfounded fear took \nhold to the point where people who were sponsors of the bill voted \nagainst it. Sponsors of it now turned around and voted against it. \nAgain, for what reason? Unfounded fear.\n  What message did we send today to the rest of the world? A message \nthat, OK, we are pretty good. We did a lot of good stuff in terms of \npassing legislation to uphold the rights of people with disabilities, \nto break down barriers, give people with disabilities opportunities the \nsame as everyone else. We have become a better country for it, a better \nNation.\n  Other countries have come to us over the intervening last 22 years to \nfind out how we did it, what they could do. So here the United Nations \nsaid we would come up with a convention, a treaty for all countries, \nand put it up for them to sign it, encouraging them to emulate what we \ndid. This would be giving us a seat at the table helping other \ncountries to bring their laws more up to what ours are in terms of the \nrights of people with disabilities.\n  But we turned our backs on that. There are a lot of things that make \nAmerica a shining city on a hill, but there is one thing that no one \ncan dispute that does put America as a shining city on a hill and that \nis the Americans With Disabilities Act and what it has done to our \nsociety, like our Civil Rights Act, what it has done to break down the \nbarriers and to show that people with disabilities can contribute to \nsociety if only given the chance and the opportunity.\n  You would think we would want to then say, yes, we will be a part of \na worldwide effort to break down those barriers against people with \ndisabilities. We want to be part of a worldwide effort to say it is not \nall right, it is not OK to leave a baby on the side of the road to die \nsimply because that baby has Down Syndrome. You would think we would \nwant to be part of a global effort that says it is not all right to \nkeep kids out of school and away from education because they have a \nphysical disability--they use a wheelchair--or have an intellectual \ndisability. You would think we would want to be part of an effort such \nas that, that says it is not OK to put people in cells, chained in \ncells, people whose only crime is that they are disabled. You would \nthink we would want to be part of that effort.\n  We have done that in this country. We have done wonderful things. Yet \nthere is some fear, some unfounded fear that the United Nations is \ngoing to come in with a black helicopter or something, I don't know \nwhat, and say you cannot homeschool your kids.\n  The Americans With Disabilities Act, we had it for 20 years. Did it \nstop home schooling? Of course not. Did it lead to more abortions? Of \ncourse not.\n  After this vote, after it was defeated, I walked out into the \nreception room, the Senate reception room. There was a throng, a number \nof people in the disability community. They were crushed, just crushed. \nThey could not understand this. How could it be? Every disability \ncommunity in America, every disability organization supported this. We \nhad 21 veterans organizations, everything from the American Legion to \nthe VFW, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Disabled Veterans of \nAmerica--21. Every veterans group supported this.\n\n  I ask, were these veterans groups so dumb, so blind, so misled to \nsupport something that is going to give the U.N. the right to come in \nand take kids out of your home? That is what people were saying. They \ndo not get it, veterans groups? Is that what they were saying, that \nthey do not understand this?\n  Of course they understood it. They know those were unfounded fears. \nWalk out and see Yoshiko Dart out there, holding Justin Dart's hat; \nJustin Dart, God love him. A man in a wheelchair, used it almost every \nday in his life; a man who traveled throughout this country day after \nday to get people organized to support the Americans With Disabilities \nAct, Justin Dart. He has since passed on, but his widow carries his hat \naround. She had his hat there and they were just crushed by this vote. \nHow could we turn our backs on something so important to our country \nand the world? Pat Wright--others.\n  Before we had the vote we had a wonderful ceremony honoring Bob Dole. \nYesterday was the International Disability Rights Day, so they wanted \nto honor Bob Dole for all he had done, Senator Dole. It was a wonderful \nevent. I saw people over there honoring Bob Dole for all the work he \nhad done on disability rights who voted against the bill today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I said, wait a minute, they are there to honor all the \nwork Bob Dole had done on disability and Bob Dole was one of the \nstrongest supporters of the CRPD, as it is called. He came over here \ntoday in his wheelchair with his wife, former Senator Elizabeth Dole. \nYet people voted against it. I do not get it.\n  Veterans? There was a young veteran sitting in the gallery today. I \nmet him yesterday for the first time. Senator Kerry spoke at length \nabout him. His name is Dan Berschinski. I ask unanimous consent to have \nhis op-ed printed in the Record at the conclusion of my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I met him yesterday, a young man 25 years old. He said \nfor the first 25 years of my life I was an able-bodied American and \nplayed football and soccer, even ran a few marathons.\n  He graduated from West Point and went to Afghanistan and had both of \nhis legs blown off. He walks on prosthetic legs now and talks about \ngoing to South Africa on a trip and the fear gripped him because of the \nfact he couldn't get around. In the hotel they had curbs. He had the \nkind of problems he doesn't have here.\n  I saw him out here in the reception room after the vote. He had been \nsitting in the gallery. He came down. I went up to him and I said: Dan, \nwhat can I say? I am sorry. I am sorry. But, I said, we will come back \nagain. We are going to come back at this thing. But, I said, I am \nsorry.\n  You know what he said to me? He said: You know, Senator, watching \nthis\n\n[[Page S7395]]\n\nand seeing this makes me want to get just about as far away from \npolitics as I can.\n  Is that the message we send to young veterans, young heroes like \nthis?\n  I don't want to take any more time. Others want to speak. As I said, \nit is a shameful day. I do say we will be back. Senator Kerry will be \nback, Senator McCain. Again, I give them the highest plaudits for what \nthey did. Senator McCain and Senator Kerry did a magnificent job, and \nSenator Lugar, in carrying this bill forward. I know they do not want \nto give up either. I was hoping we would pass it before Senator Lugar \nleaves the Senate. It would have been wonderful that Senator Lugar did \nthis during his time here in the Senate. But I guess that is not to be.\n  We will be back in January or February. Senator Kerry is committed to \ndoing that, bringing it back to the committee, so we will be back \nagain. I hope over the Christmas break and New Year's those who did not \nvote to support this will search their conscience, search their soul, \nthink more about our being involved in this and having a seat at the \ntable, helping the rest of the world change their laws. I hope when we \ncome back we will have some reconsiderations and people recognize that \nmaybe the first vote was not the right vote and change their vote and \nmaybe we can get it passed then. That is my hope. I hope we can get to \nthat when we come back after the first of the year.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                             [Dec. 4, 2012]\n\n                Leading on Disability Beyond Our Borders\n\n                          (By Dan Berschinski)\n\n       For the first 25 years of my life I was as an able-bodied \n     American. I played football and soccer and even ran a few \n     marathons. All of that changed three years ago. Having \n     graduated from West Point, I was serving my country as an \n     Army infantry officer in Afghanistan when I was seriously \n     wounded: I stepped on the unseen trigger of an improvised \n     explosive device, and both my legs were instantly torn from \n     my body. From that moment on, my life has, been drastically \n     different.\n       Today, after three year's of hard effort, I'm proud, to be \n     able to walk using prosthetic legs. Yet obstacles that might \n     seem inconsequential to the fully able-bodied, like sidewalk \n     curbs and stairs, take on a whole new meaning for people like \n     me who struggle to walk, or who use a wheelchair. \n     Fortunately, the United States leads the world in \n     accessibility and equality of opportunity for the disabled. \n     Unfortunately, the advantages we take for granted here at \n     home--the policies that allow people like me to live \n     fulfilling, independent lives--don't exist in much of the \n     rest of the world.\n       Eight months after being wounded in combat, and while still \n     a patient at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, I joined a few \n     friends in a trip to South Africa to watch the World Cup. \n     There I found myself in a different country, with no legs, a \n     brand-new wheelchair and a lot of apprehension. While I \n     should have been enjoying this once-in-a-lifetime trip, I was \n     constantly worried about my ability to get around. South \n     Africa had done a fairly good job on accessibility, but there \n     were still plenty of curbs that had to be jumped, ditches \n     that had to be crossed, and flights of stairs that had to be, \n     well, hobbled up. As a disabled Anierican at home, I can \n     depend on accessible accommodations; as a disabled tourist \n     abroad, I had to hope for the best while preparing for the \n     worst.\n       Today, the United States has an opportunity to show \n     leadership and reduce the challenges that millions of \n     disabled people around the world face every day: The Senate \n     can vote to join the U.N. treaty on rights for people with \n     disabilities. By encouraging other nations to strengthen \n     their own accessibility laws, we can improve the lives of our \n     56.7 million disabled U.S. citizens, including 5.5 million \n     disabled veterans like me, when we travel and work abroad. \n     Many of those opposing this treaty claim to support military \n     veterans, but a vote against ratifying this treaty undercuts \n     that support.\n       I am honored to join fellow veterans, Republicans and \n     Democrats, including Sens. John Kerry and John McCain and \n     former Sen. Robert J. Dole, to say that the case is clear-\n     cut: Only by voting in favor of the Convention on the Rights \n     of Persons with Disabilities can the Senate truly honor the \n     sacrifice of those disabled while answering this nation's \n     call. I am proud to have served my country; I am proud of how \n     my country has taken care of me. And I will be proud when we \n     extend our leadership on disability issues beyond our \n     borders.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senator from Iowa is on the \nfloor--and I will be very brief because there are others waiting to \nspeak--I am so moved and touched by what he had to say. I had the \nprivilege of being in that room with the Senator from Iowa, Senator \nHarkin, and Senator Dole--both Senators Dole, Senator Bob Dole and \nSenator Elizabeth Dole.\n  The Senator referred to Justin Dart's widow and his hat was there. My \ncolleague and I saw him wearing that hat the day the disability \nlegislation was signed into law on the White House lawn. In fact I have \na photograph I took of the Senator standing there.\n\n\n                    Persons with Disabilities Treaty\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving in this \nbody every day that Tom Harkin has been here. Nobody has spoken more \neloquently for the needs of the disabled than Senator Harkin. He \nlearned sign language so he could communicate with his brother. I have \nseen him with members of the disabled community. He is loved and \nrespected.\n  This was not the Senate's finest day. It was not ``Profiles in \nCourage'' to see what happened. I am glad the Senator mentioned the \nveterans, as though any of them would stand for something that would \ntake over our country. Many of them lost limbs fighting for this \ncountry and fighting for the security of this country. They represent \npeople who died fighting for this country.\n  So this is one Senator who will be here next year. I pledge to the \nSenator from Iowa and to Senator Kerry, my seatmate--actually, I have \nboth Senators on either side of me--that I will be here, and I will \nsupport the Senators every step of the way.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and former chairman \nwith whom I have served all of these years in the Senate for his very \nkind remarks and kind words. More than that, I thank my friend for his \nmany kindnesses that he has shown me and for upholding the finest \ntraditions of the Senate.\n  I say to Pat Leahy, through the Chair, when we think about a Senator \nand what a Senator should do and how a Senator should conduct himself \nor herself, we have to think about Pat Leahy. He has just been a \nstalwart. He is always willing to work with people, always willing to \ngive someone the benefit of the doubt, always willing to help move \nlegislation through the Senate. That is the way the Senate used to be. \nIt used to be that way. Thank God, we still have people here like Pat \nLeahy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, tens of millions of middle-class \nfamilies face the distinct possibility of higher tax rates in January. \nWith so many Americans who are still struggling to find their economic \nfooting after the deepest recession of our lifetimes, these looming tax \nhikes would be hard for those middle-class families, and they are \ncompletely unnecessary.\n  Newspaper stories day after day on the so-called fiscal cliff often \nomit that the Senate has passed legislation to shield 98 percent of \nfamilies and 97 percent of small businesses from the income tax part of \nthis so-called fiscal cliff.\n  We passed the Middle Class Tax Cuts Act on July 25 of this year. We \nsent the measure to the House of Representatives. Did Speaker Boehner \nand the Republicans in the House promptly pass this popular bill and \nsend it to President Obama for his signature? Did they move to protect \n98 percent of middle-class families from this tax hike in January? No. \nThey decided to hold the middle-class tax cuts passed by the Senate \nhostage in an attempt to push for tax cuts for the folks they care \nabout the most, the top 2 percent of the highest earning households.\n  Republicans fighting for millionaires and billionaires is not a new \nstory. In 2001 President George W. Bush decided to spend a large \nportion of the surpluses he inherited from President Clinton to cut tax \nrates. Many Democrats opposed him then because the tax cuts were unfair \nby favoring the highest income Americans. To overcome that obstacle, \nthe Republicans resorted\n\n[[Page S7396]]\n\nto a parliamentary technique of budget reconciliation, a maneuver that \nallowed for passage of their tax cuts but forced them to expire after \n2010, at the end of the 10-year budget window.\n  So we scroll forward to 2010. As 2010 ended, President Obama and many \nDemocrats in Congress, including myself, wanted to extend the tax cuts \nfor middle-class families but let rates on income above $200,000 for an \nindividual and $250,000 for a family revert to the Clinton-era levels. \nOur Senate Republican friends filibustered that effort, refusing to \nallow the middle-class tax cut without a tax cut for the highest \nincomes as well. Their hostage strategy worked that time, and the \nPresident and Senate Democrats reluctantly agreed to extend the tax \ncuts for 2 more years.\n  Now the 2 years is up and these tax rates are again set to expire. \nThat is why Senate Democrats passed the Middle Class Tax Cut Act in \nJuly. This measure balanced our desire to keep tax rates low for \nmiddle-class families against the urgency of addressing our national \nbudget deficits. By keeping tax rates low for 98 percent of Americans \nand letting the tax rates go up very modestly for families earning over \n$250,000 a year, the Democrat plan would cut the deficit by as much as \n$1 trillion over the next decade. Now, that alone doesn't cure our \nbudget imbalance, but along with fair and sensible tax reforms and \nsmart cuts in spending, it is part of the solution.\n  Let's be clear about one thing: the Middle Class Tax Cut Act would \nstill benefit high-end taxpayers. Families making over $250,000 a year \nwould pay lower tax rates on their first $250,000. So if a family made \n$255,000, they would only see an increase on the top $5,000, and only \nto the Clinton-era rates that were in effect during the 1990s, when, as \nwe all recall, our economy was thriving. Under the Senate-passed plan, \na family earning $255,000 a year would pay an extra $150 in taxes.\n  In opposing the Middle Class Tax Cut Act, Republicans claim that it \nwould hurt the economy to raise tax rates on the top 2 percent of \nincome earners. Speaker Boehner reiterated that line last week saying: \nIt'll hurt small businesses. It'll hurt the economy.\n  Well, that is vintage Republican political theory, but it is just not \nsupported by the facts. In a recent report, the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office estimated that extending the middle-class \ntax cuts would boost our national GDP, gross domestic product, by 1.25 \npercent next year. It said the economic effects of extending only the \nmiddle-class rates are similar to those of extending all of the rates. \nWhy? Because upper income taxpayers are less likely to spend their tax \nsavings and put it back into the economy.\n  In other words, CBO reports we would get virtually no economic bang \nfor our Federal buck by extending the upper income tax cuts for which \nthe Republicans are fighting. CBO's analysis is confirmed by the \nexperience of real-world businesspeople.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks an op-ed by former Stride Rite CEO Arnold \nHiatt entitled ``Smite the myth that tax cuts create jobs.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, Arnold Hiatt founded a successful \nsmall business before selling it to Stride Rite and then becoming CEO. \nHe says:\n\n       As every good businessman knows . . . the soundness of a \n     company and its ability to create jobs do not rest on lower \n     taxes or tax avoidance--for the company or its senior \n     management.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       It is a fiction, pure and simple, that taxing so-called \n     ``job creators'' will have an adverse effect on the economy.\n\n  Mr. Hiatt goes on to explain:\n\n       In the years we were creating so many jobs, my federal \n     income taxes on the top slice of my income were sometimes as \n     high as 70 percent, but these rates never discouraged me or \n     anyone else from hiring workers or growing a company. Today \n     we're paying about half of that on the top portion of \n     salaries and fees, and a meager 15 percent on the big chunk \n     of our income that comes from investments. That's why I . . . \n     and many other millionaires pay a lower income-tax rate than \n     many working American families.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Many millionaires never create any jobs at all. Those who \n     do will create them regardless of the tax rate, and certainly \n     won't be dissuaded by the small increase of about 5 \n     percentage points that the president has proposed.\n\n  He concludes this way:\n\n       The myth of millionaires as job creators being turned off \n     by higher taxes is the creation of some members of the U.S. \n     House and U.S. Senate who are funded by these same \n     millionaires. They know little of what makes companies \n     successful.\n\n  That is the CEO of Stride Rite shoes.\n  If we extend the upper income tax cuts for another year, it would add \nover $49 billion to the deficit. Even in Washington, $49 billion is \nreal money, money that would have to be borrowed and would add to our \ndebt problem. Believe it or not, Republicans who voted to turn Medicare \ninto a voucher program in the name of deficit reduction support adding \nto the deficit with high-end tax cuts. In Rhode Island, at least, those \nare lousy priorities when it comes to deficit reduction. We should let \nthe tax cuts at the top expire for reasons also of fairness. Loopholes \nand special provisions allow many super-high income earners to pay \nlower tax rates than many middle-class families.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, 65 \npercent of individuals earning $1 million or more annually pay taxes at \na lower rate than median income taxpayers making $100,000 or less. \nSixty-five percent--nearly two-thirds--of individuals earning over $1 \nmillion a year actually pay a lower tax rate than median income \ntaxpayers. That is a tax system that is turned upside down and needs to \nbe fixed.\n  Earlier this year a majority of Senators voted to advance my Paying a \nFair Share Act, the Buffett rule bill to ensure that multimillion-\ndollar earners pay at least a 30-percent effective Federal tax rate. \nThe rate they are supposed to pay is 35 percent under the income tax \nlaws. But because of all these loopholes and special rates, IRS \nstatistics show the top 400 taxpayers in 2008 who earned, by the way, \nan average of $270 million each that year, paid the same 18.2 percent \neffective tax rate as paid by, for instance, a truckdriver in Rhode \nIsland. The single biggest factor driving this inequality is the \nspecial low rate for capital gains that allows, for instance, hedge \nfund billionaires, through the carried interest loophole, to pay taxes \nat lower rates than their secretaries and chauffeurs. If we let the tax \ncuts at the top expire, those rates revert to 20 percent instead of 15 \npercent. Twenty percent is still a low rate for someone making $100 \nmillion a year, but it is closer to what a middle-class family is \nexpected to pay.\n\n  In short, allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for income above \n$250,000 is the fiscally responsible thing to do and the fair and \nproper thing to do. Why, then, hasn't Speaker Boehner called a vote on \nthe Senate-passed Middle Class Tax Cuts Act? Because threatening \nmiddle-class families with higher taxes is their strategy, to push for \nbreaks for millionaires and billionaires--the hostage strategy--with \nthe middle class as the hostages as Republicans fight for whom they \ntruly care about.\n  If Speaker Boehner continues to ignore the Senate-passed bill, I urge \nPresident Obama to stand firm on his opposition to extending the upper \nincome tax cuts. The American people support that approach, and we \nshould not cave in to pressure.\n  I would also urge the President and congressional leaders to work to \ninclude the Buffett rule principles in any deficit deal. Letting the \nupper income tax cuts expire and ensuring multimillion-dollar earners \npay a fair share will assure the American people we are working for \nthem and not the special interests as we allocate the burden of \naddressing our deficits.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From the Providence Journal]\n\n                Smite the Myth That Tax Cuts Create Jobs\n\n                       Providence Journal Edition\n\n                           (by Arnold Hiatt)\n\n       As every good businessman knows--including former \n     Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, with whom I had been \n     associated as a limited partner at Bain Capital Ventures--the \n     soundness of a company and its ability to create jobs do not \n     rest on lower taxes or tax avoidance--for the company or its \n     senior management.\n       If the now defeated presidential candidate Romney and \n     congressional Republicans continue to insist on renewing the \n     special Bush\n\n[[Page S7397]]\n\n     tax cuts that go only to the wealthiest 2 percent of \n     Americans like me, it will do nothing to create jobs. It is a \n     fiction, pure and simple, that taxing so-called ``job \n     creators'' will have an adverse effect on the economy.\n       Just the reverse is true. Instead of spending nearly $1 \n     trillion on tax cuts to make millionaires even richer, those \n     tax dollars can be used more constructively to retain \n     teachers, police officers and firefighters, and repair roads \n     and bridges. These are all essential services that will \n     rebuild our economy and maintain a civil society. In \n     addition, these tax dollars will contribute to deficit \n     reduction.\n       The son of a Lithuanian immigrant to this land of now \n     diminishing equal opportunity, I had the good fortune to \n     start a small company that enjoyed a measure of success and \n     that was eventually acquired by Stride Rite Corp. Twelve \n     months later I was asked to become president of Stride Rite.\n       Throughout the last 10 years of my tenure, the company's \n     return on investment was in the top 1 percent of all \n     companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We created \n     thousands of new jobs. By the time I left, we had over 5,000 \n     employees. Our success rested on the quality of the product \n     and service provided to consumers. It was a reflection on the \n     quality of the workforce as well as the management. My \n     success could not have been possible without the people whom \n     we continued to hire and to train as we grew. I depended on \n     them as much as they depended upon me.\n       In the years we were creating so many jobs, my federal \n     income taxes on the top slice of my income were sometimes as \n     high as 70 percent, but these rates never discouraged me or \n     anyone else from hiring workers or growing a company. Today \n     we're paying about half that on the top portion of salaries \n     and fees, and a meager 15 percent on the big chunk of our \n     income that comes from investments. That's why Governor \n     Romney and I and many other millionaires pay a lower income-\n     tax rate than many working American families.\n       Many millionaires never create any jobs at all. Those who \n     do will create them regardless of the tax rate and certainly \n     won't be dissuaded by the small increase of about 5 \n     percentage points that the president has proposed.\n       The myth of millionaires as job creators being turned off \n     by higher taxes is the creation of some members of the U.S. \n     House and U.S. Senate who are funded by these same \n     millionaires. They know little of what makes companies \n     successful.\n       Romney knows better. It is a matter of record that during \n     the time tax rates, both corporate and personal, were so much \n     higher, our economy was booming. Conversely, the slowest job \n     growth since World War II took place between the Bush tax \n     cuts for millionaires and the 2008 economic meltdown.\n       A few months ago, every Republican in the House and Senate, \n     along with 19 House Democrats and two Senate Democrats, voted \n     against a bill ending the Bush tax breaks for the richest 2 \n     percent, but extend them for 98 percent of Americans and 97 \n     percent of small businesses. I hope they will take a fresh \n     look at the facts. That's why I joined with over 100 other \n     millionaires in signing a Voices for Progress letter to all \n     members of Congress, appealing to them not to renew these tax \n     breaks. Allowing the richest 2 percent to withhold tax \n     dollars robs children of health and education. It is not only \n     immoral, it is bad economics. They are the future of our \n     country, which has begun to fall behind our competitors. It \n     is also destroying the American Dream, which brought my \n     father to this country alone at the age of 15.\n       Both he and the Founding Fathers would agree that the \n     future of this nation should not be compromised by the \n     shortsightedness of those so well off in the present.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ngood friend the mayor of Paducah, KY, Mr. Bill Paxton. Mayor Paxton has \nbeen a vital partner of mine in our efforts to bring economic \ndevelopment to the Paducah region, improve the quality of life for its \nresidents, and represent their interests in public service. Paducah \ncould not ask for a finer mayor than Bill Paxton.\n  Now it's my sad duty to report to my colleagues that after 12 years \nin office, Mayor Paxton is retiring. And although Kentuckians will miss \nhis steady hand at the helm of leadership, no one can say Bill Paxton \nhas not given more than his share of dedication and commitment to the \npeople of his city. And we all certainly wish him the very best as he \nleaves the mayor's office and moves on to his next endeavors, where I \nam sure he will find much success just as he has in public service.\n  It would take too long for me to describe everything we've worked on \ntogether over the years, but I'll mention a few. For several years we \nworked together to bring economic growth to downtown Paducah with a new \nriverfront marina development. After a long road marked by the \noccasional setback, the Paducah Riverfront and Marina groundbreaking \nceremony took place last month. The new riverfront will spur job \ncreation and serve as a public space for all of Paducah's residents to \nenjoy.\n  For years, Mayor Paxton has been indispensable on a host of issues \naffecting the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant and its hard-working \nemployees.\n  Bill has also been crucial in efforts to create the Paducah River \nDiscovery Center, improve the Paducah Area Transit System, and upgrade \nlocal law-enforcement and safety resources such as the Public Safety \nMobile Data System, which allows police and other emergency personnel \nto share and coordinate information.\n  And I can't forget Bill's leading role in designating the National \nQuilt Museum, located two blocks from the Ohio River in downtown \nPaducah, as the National Quilt Museum of the United States. As one of \nthe most popular tourist attractions in the Bluegrass State, it \nregularly brings over 100,000 visitors yearly from all 50 States and 40 \ncountries.\n  One of Bill's biggest successes over the last 12 years is the Lower \nTown revitalization project. Lower Town, a Paducah neighborhood that is \nrich with history but had become dilapidated with neglect, became the \nfocus of renewal for city government under the mayor's vision.\n  Revitalization efforts focused on creating an awareness of Lower Town \nas a cultural center for the arts and an accessible retail environment \nfriendly to local businesses. Now, a decade later, this project has \nbeen successful, yielding much renovation of local historic buildings \nand new construction, luring more than 75 new artists and businesses to \nLower Town, and bringing over $30 million in private investment in the \narea.\n  Bill was born and raised in Paducah. Prior to serving three terms as \nmayor, he was elected to Paducah's city commission in 1998. It was a \nfamily tradition, as his father, William F. Paxton Jr., had also served \non the city commission. As a private citizen, Bill worked for 30 years \nin the banking industry. Bill is also one of the few mayors in Kentucky \nto serve two terms as head of the League of Cities, proving his talents \nare appreciated not just in Paducah but across Kentucky.\n  I have been pleased to get to know both Bill and his wife, Lucy, over \nthe years and am proud to call them close friends.

RUSSELL DOHNER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to recognize ``a wonderful \nlife.'' Much like the movie starring Jimmy Stewart, it is the story of \na small town boy who dreamed of big adventures in a big city, but who \ndiscovered his life's calling not far from home.\n  For nearly 60 years, Dr. Russell Dohner has dedicated his life to \nproviding affordable healthcare to residents of Rushville--a rural \ncommunity in western Illinois.\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\n  Dr. Dohner grew up on a farm, not far from Rushville, one of seven \nchildren. He experienced seizures as a small boy, and it was his family \ndoctor who stayed by his side and inspired him to enter the medical \nfield. After high school, Dr. Dohner served in the Army during World \nWar II, attended Western Illinois University, and then worked his way \nthrough Northwestern University Medical School.\n  Although he hoped to move to a big city and work as a cardiologist, \nhe knew Rushville, a city of just 3,200 people, needed a doctor. In \n1955 he opened an office there hoping to stay just a few years. That \nwas 57 years ago. Today, little has changed in his Rushville office--\nthe nurses, the furniture, and the price of a visit. He charges \npatients just $5 a visit.\n  He does not take health insurance, but at only $5 most of his \npatients can afford the visit. Even if someone cannot pay, he still \nhelps them.\n  Dr. Dohner barely makes enough money to pay his nurses, and he relies \non income from his family's farm to make ends meet. However, one thing \nthat helps keep the office overhead low is the lack of technology. \nThere is no computer, no fax machine, and no answering machines. Five \ndecades of records are kept on handwritten, 4-by-6 index cards.\n  Dr. Dohner keeps his office open 7 days a week. On Sundays he stops \nin before going to church. He starts his day making rounds at \nCulbertson Memorial Hospital in Rushville, he then takes patients at \nhis office, and he ends the day with another round at the hospital. He \nmay see as many as 120 patients a day. He works with patients on a \nfirst-come, first-serve basis. But, if it is an emergency Dr. Dohner \nlets them use the back door. And if patients are too sick to make the \ntrip in, he will make a house call.\n  Although he has no children of his own, he has delivered more than \n3,500 babies. This happens to be more people than the population of \nRushville.\n  Dr. Dohner puts patients before himself. He has never been on a \nvacation and cannot remember ever taking a day off. The only time he \nhas closed down his office was when he suffered a heart attack and he \nhimself needed medical care. Dr. Dohner has said, ``I have to take care \nof my patients first.''\n  At age 87 and after nearly 60 years on the job, Dr. Dohner continues \nto provide the rural area with selfless service, hard work, and \naffordable healthcare. He does not seem to be slowing down much, and \nfor that, the community is grateful.\n  Dr. Russell Dohner is as a wonderful example of how one person's life \ncan have a big impact on a small town.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7398-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

Madam President, as cochairs of the International \nConservation Caucus, Senator Tom Udall and I stand together on Wildlife \nConservation Day, December 4th, to emphasize the need for governments, \norganizations, and individuals to protect the world's endangered \nspecies, which face threats from poaching, illicit trade, pollution, \nand improper land use.\n  The International Conservation Caucus has focused attention this \nCongress on poaching and the illegal wildlife trade, a lucrative and \nillicit global market worth anywhere from $5 to $20 billion annually. \nThis trade threatens biodiversity, stability, and the rule of law.\n  New initiatives proposed by the U.S. State Department are needed to \nprotect wildlife, combat trafficking, and reduce demand. We applaud the \nState Department's commitment to strengthening a global system of \nwildlife enforcement and the work of the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment to strengthen regional antitrafficking networks.\n  In addition, we and our allies should investigate and prosecute \nwildlife crime more aggressively, but we should not see the seizure of \nivory, rhino horns, and other wildlife products as the sole measure of \nsuccess. We must also reduce demand, take down trafficking kingpins \nthrough international law enforcement efforts, and protect wildlife \npopulations to prevent environmental devastation. Advanced technologies \nand modern forensics can aid these efforts.\n  On the diplomatic front, our Ambassadors must increase the pressure \non countries to ensure members of their militaries and law enforcement \nagencies do not look the other way or participate in trafficking of \nwildlife and that enforcement is rigorous. Public education programs \nboth abroad and here in the United States must be expanded to reduce \ndemand for trafficked wildlife and products.\n  We look forward to continuing to promote policies that protect \nnatural resources and wildlife. Wildlife conservation is vital to \nmaintaining biodiversity, global stability, and economic vitality \nacross the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7398-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING JONATHAN MICKLE\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today I wish to honor the military \nservice of Jonathan Mickle. Jonathan died on October 30 in Rye, NH. He \nis remembered as a dedicated servicemember who served in the U.S. Army \nand deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from January \n2006 to February 2007.\n  Jonathan was born August 19, 1985 in Portsmouth, NH. He graduated \nfrom Portsmouth High School in 2003 and went on to attend Southern New \nHampshire University where he received high academic honors and made \nthe dean's list.\n  Jonathan joined the U.S. Army after graduating college. He became a \nFire Direction Specialist with Charlie Battery, 2nd Battalion, 3rd \nField Artillery Regiment. For his service during the war in Iraq, he \nwas awarded numerous medals, including the Army Commendation Medal, the \nArmy Achievement Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal.\n  Jonathan took pride in his service to his country. After returning \nfrom Iraq, he became a member of the Emerson Hovey Veterans of Foreign \nWars Post #168, supporting and being supported by fellow veterans and \ncontinuing to stay involved in the Army. He was also a dedicated New \nEngland Sports fan.\n  There are no words to adequately thank this brave New Hampshire son \nfor his commitment to our country. I hope that, during this hard time, \nJonathan's friends and family can find comfort knowing that Americans \neverywhere share a deep and profound appreciation for their Jonathan's \nwillingness to answer the call to defend America and our way of life.\n  Sadly, Jonathan's mother, Katie Mickle, passed away suddenly in 2000 \nfrom pancreatic cancer at the age of 39. Jonathan is survived by his \nfather Warren of Portsmouth, his brothers, Robert and Matthew and his \nwife, Kristy, of Kittery, ME; his sister Whitney Mickle and her fiance \nMichael Foley of Eliot; and niece Marlee Jane Mickle.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the life \nand service of this dedicated servicemember and brave young American, \nJonathan Mickle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7398-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7398-S7399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO FLIGHT 93\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to include the remarks made by \nMr. Gordon Felt, former President of the Families of Flight 93, for the \nRecord in honor of the Congressional tribute held earlier this morning. \nI want to extend my gratitude to Mr. Felt and the Families of Flight 93 \nfor their tireless commitment to honoring the heroic sacrifice of their \nloved ones.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Good morning. Mrs. Toomey, Mrs. Casey, the entire host \n     committee and members of the House and Senate joining us \n     today, to our partners at the National Park Service and \n     National Park Foundation and to those family members in \n     attendance, I stand before you with an overwhelming sense of \n     pride knowing that this building, this symbol of our nation's \n     great democracy, perhaps would have been destroyed were it \n     not for the selfless actions of 40 brave men and women\n\n[[Page S7399]]\n\n     aboard United Flight 93. For without their courageous stand \n     taken on September 11, 2001, our Capitol building and many of \n     those serving within, perhaps some of you, may have been \n     further victims of the terrorism that fundamentally changed \n     our lives and our country on that dark day. With each visit \n     to the Capitol I make time to pass through the Rotunda and \n     view the magnificent plaque dedicated to the actions of the \n     passengers and crew of United Flight 93. While the traumatic \n     repercussions of September 11, 2001 have been deeply felt by \n     each and every family member that lost a loved one that day, \n     and by the community of Somerset County whose lives and way \n     of life have been forever changed, I appreciate the conscious \n     awareness of those serving in this building of the fact, that \n     as tragic as that day was to our country, it could have been \n     significantly worse.\n       As family members that lost loved ones aboard United Flight \n     93, we struggle continually with our loss. Our lives over the \n     past eleven years have all taken differing paths with one \n     common factor that will forever bind us together. Our family \n     of Flight 93, forged in tragedy and thrust into the public \n     domain has provided an avenue by which we can advocate for \n     those family members that will forever remain alive in our \n     hearts and minds. This journey has not been easy for any and \n     more difficult for some.\n       For some families and individuals, withdrawal into their \n     personal lives at home, or fresh new starts beyond the reach \n     of the media and chaos of September 11th have been an avenue \n     of survival. Others have joined in community with family \n     members suffering similar loss and have found comfort with \n     the understanding that comes from shared tragedy. And there \n     are others that have continued to move forward masking their \n     grief as they approach life one day at a time . . . \n     surviving. Within our families there are others that have \n     made a conscious decision to serve as advocates, representing \n     the interests of the Families of Flight 93 through the Flight \n     93 National Memorial Partnership. No avenue of healing is \n     proper and correct for all, just as no closure will ever be \n     felt for those experiencing such great loss.\n       Our families are spread out across the globe and represent \n     a unique diversity in culture. Yet, when we gather together \n     each year on the anniversary of September 11th, we are one. \n     Somerset County, Pennsylvania has become an extension of our \n     homes and the community has welcomed us into their hearts \n     unconditionally even as they struggle daily with the impact \n     of events set in motion on September 11, 2001. Their lives \n     have been impacted in ways that they are still coming to \n     understand. Yet there is a strength and wholesomeness in the \n     people of Somerset County that provides great comfort to our \n     families. They proudly stand as Ambassadors working hand in \n     hand with the National Park Service ready to tell the story \n     of our loved ones to any and all that visit the memorial.\n       The Flight 93 National Memorial is more than a tribute to \n     40 heroes. Its existence serves our country in a far greater \n     capacity than just as a place marker for history. Over these \n     past 11 years we have come to realize that the Flight 93 \n     National Memorial has a quality within similar to that of \n     Gettysburg or Pearl Harbor. A strong sense of purpose, of \n     loss, yet triumph permeates the entire site and only becomes \n     more intense as visitors approach and gaze upon our Sacred \n     Ground. The memorial was designed to honor 40 heroes, but \n     also serves in the short term to help heal a generation of \n     Americans deeply affected by the traumatic effects of \n     September 11th and stands to preserve a piece of our cultural \n     heritage in order to educate and inspire future generations.\n       ``Do what is right, not what is easy.'' Since September \n     11th this mantra has guided so many within our Flight 93 \n     National Memorial partnership and our extended Flight 93 \n     National Memorial Family. Whether it is in the halls of \n     Congress, Harrisburg, Somerset, or Shanksville, Pennsylvania, \n     this project has been joined by all that appreciate the \n     personal, political, cultural and historical impact September \n     11th has had on our country and freedom loving peoples around \n     the world. On one of the bleakest days in our history, the \n     trial of 40 individuals helped us remember that we are strong \n     with an unquenched thirst for freedom and that no person or \n     ideology will ever cause us to waver from a course that was \n     set in motion by our forefathers.\n       In those defining 22 minutes when our loved ones \n     experienced a horror beyond comprehension, they collectively \n     chose to act. Not as individuals, but as a force ignited by \n     the love of family, love of freedom and a superiority in \n     spirit unwilling to sit back and allow an evil so incarnate \n     to suppress their dreams and desires. They were thrust \n     together by events not caused by individual existences, but \n     by social, political, and religious forces that sought to \n     break our spirit through terror. How can we not stand in awe? \n     How can we not celebrate their spirit? How can we not honor \n     those 40 individuals that have been woven into the fabric of \n     our nation's proud history? The Flight 93 National Memorial \n     will ensure that their efforts, their actions and their \n     spirit will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7399-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MAJOR D. LEIGH HASSON\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to recognize my 2012 defense \nlegislative fellow, MAJ D. Leigh Hasson. Major Hasson served my office \nwith distinction. From her first town hall in Fairbanks, AK, to her \nfinal days spent on the floor of the United States Senate as the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 was being \nconsidered, she demonstrated honor, integrity, leadership and \nprofessionalism.\n  Major Hasson received her commission from the United States Air Force \nOfficer Training School in January 2000. As a navigator with over 1,000 \ncombat flight hours, she has deployed in support of Operations Northern \nWatch, Southern Watch, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. She has \nexperience establishing and supporting major commands including the \nInternational Security Assistance Force Joint Command headquarters and \nJoint Forces Command. Major Hasson has been selfless in her service and \nsacrifice throughout her career.\n  Her family has supported her through these deployments and her tenure \nin the Air Force. Her husband David, son Samuel and daughter Alexis \nhave been by her side through it all. It is for them she serves our \nNation--to protect what they have and to protect their future. I would \nlike to thank David, Samuel and Alexis for their sacrifices in support \nof Major Hasson.\n  Hailing from Trapper Creek, AK, Leigh embodies Alaska values. She is \nindependent, inquisitive, a self-starter and actively involved in her \nwork and community. While in my office, Leigh completed the Truman \nNational Security Project Security Scholars program. She was the \noffice's liaison to the Alaska State Society, she taught Bible study at \nher church and somehow she still found the time to train and run the \nArmy Ten-Miler in support of our troops.\n  As a defense legislative fellow, she contributed greatly to the State \nof Alaska and the Nation. She led the charge on Arctic issues because \nshe recognized the increasing importance of the region. Due to her \nwork, I was successful in securing report language to accompany the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 on \nappropriately resourcing the Arctic. She staffed me at numerous \nhearings and provided vital insight on a number of pressing national \nsecurity issues.\n  As a member of my team, Leigh approached each day with a positive \nattitude. Despite working in an environment where one can easily become \ndiscouraged by politics, Leigh never failed to smile and press forward \nin the best interest of the Nation.\n  It has been a pleasure to host Major Hasson in my office. I wish her \nthe best in her future endeavors and thank her for her service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7399-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7399-S7400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CHIEF JUDGE ROBERT M. BELL\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize the \nHonorable Robert M. Bell, Chief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals, \nfor his outstanding contributions as a jurist, administrator, and \njustice advocate. His work on the bench has transformed the Maryland \njudicial system. His success in Maryland has provided leadership for \nnational initiatives. And Chief Judge Bell has secured his place in \nhistory as a civil rights leader, both in Maryland and nationally.\n  Chief Judge Bell has served as the Chief Judge of the Maryland Court \nof Appeals and the head of Maryland's Judiciary for the past 15 years. \nBut before Chief Judge Bell took the bench, I want to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues in the Senate that Chief Judge Bell was \nalready involved with our State's judicial system. As a high school \nstudent, he was a civil rights protestor who engaged in civil \ndisobedience in Baltimore, and his case ultimately reached the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  The Maryland State Archives has used the Bell v. Maryland case as \npart of its series on ``Teaching American History in Maryland''. \nAccording to the account by the Archives, in 1960, the majority of \nrestaurants in downtown Baltimore were still segregated and blacks were \nnot served at all-white dining establishments. Students from Dunbar \nHigh School and Morgan State\n\n[[Page S7400]]\n\nCollege were recruited by the Civic Interest Group to enter all-white \nrestaurants and demand service. On June 17, 1960, a group of students \nentered Hooper's Restaurant, located at Charles and Fayette Streets, \nand asked to be served. They were told to leave, but 12 of the \nstudents, including 16-year-old Robert Mack Bell from Dunbar High \nSchool, refused. They were each charged with trespassing, found guilty, \nand fined $10. The case was appealed, and one of the students' lawyers \nwas Thurgood Marshall from the National Association for the Advancement \nof Colored People, NAACP, who went on to become the first African-\nAmerican Justice on the United States Supreme Court. The students and \ntheir attorneys argued that the use of the State's trespassing laws to \nsupport segregation of public accommodations violated the Fourteenth \nAmendment, which guarantees the ``equal protection of the laws'' to all \npersons.\n  In 1962, the Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the students' \nconvictions and the decision of the lower court, and the case was \nappealed to the U.S Supreme Court. In the summer of 1964, the United \nStates Senate finally overcame a filibuster and passed the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, which prohibited segregation and discrimination in public \naccommodations. The State of Maryland also passed a public \naccommodations law. Shortly after this action by Congress, the Supreme \nCourt remanded the case back to the Maryland Court of Appeals. On April \n9, 1965, the convictions were reversed, the students were cleared of \nall charges, and the City of Baltimore was ordered to pay court costs \nto the students.\n  Robert Mack Bell went on to graduate from Morgan State in Baltimore \nand then Harvard Law School, and was admitted to the Maryland Bar in \n1969. After working in private practice for several years, he was \nappointed as a Baltimore City District Court judge, which handles \nmisdemeanors. In 1980, he was elevated to the Baltimore City Circuit \nCourt, which handles felony cases and jury trials. In 1984, he was \nelevated again to the Court of Special Appeals, our intermediate \nappellate court. In 1991, Judge Bell was appointed to the Maryland \nCourt of Appeals, our State's top court. Finally, he was appointed as \nChief Judge of the Maryland Court of Appeals in 1996, becoming the \nfirst African-American to serve in that capacity. He is one of the few \njudges to serve at all four levels of the Maryland judiciary during his \ncareer. And Chief Judge Bell also has the rare distinction of serving \non and then running a court that had previously ruled against him.\n  During his 2 decades on the bench, Chief Judge Bell has been a moving \nforce on committees and commissions that have looked at ways to provide \ngreater access to justice, to better incorporate the advantages of \ntechnology, and to enhance legal training and compensation.\n  In 2002, Chief Judge Bell appointed a Commission on Racial and Ethnic \nFairness in the Judicial Process to evaluate outcomes and recommend \nways to reduce or eliminate unequal access to or treatment by the court \nsystem. In 2008, he created the Access to Justice Commission to \ndevelop, consolidate, coordinate, and implement policy initiatives to \nexpand access to and enhance the quality of justice in civil legal \nmatters. He sought ways to find non-traditional methods to help solve \nthe problems of crime by promoting Alternative Dispute Resolution, ADR, \nprograms throughout Maryland. He promoted the growth of drug treatment \ncourts in Maryland and established the Standing Committee on Problem-\nSolving Courts to coordinate these efforts. He used technology to \nprovide more accurate and uniform data critical to the enforcement of \ndomestic violence and peace orders, and launched an ongoing effort to \nprepare Maryland judges to adjudicate cases involving science and \nbiotechnology. And when the housing crisis hit Maryland, he called \nMaryland's legal community together to provide pro bono assistance to \nhomeowners faced with foreclosure. As a result of those efforts, the \nMaryland General Assembly passed legislation to better protect \nhomeowners.\n  Time and time again, when Chief Judge Bell has faced challenges, he \nhas seized the opportunity to find solutions. He has done so with grace \nand intellect and compassion. He has rallied the legal community and \nexpanded opportunities for those with few options and no voice.\n  From Robert Bell's days as a high school student, long before he even \nwent to law school, he has strived to promote justice and equality for \nall Americans. The Preamble to the Constitution provides that ``We the \nPeople of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, \nestablish Justice do ordain and establish this Constitution for the \nUnited States of America.'' Just like Thurgood Marshall, a fellow \nBaltimorean and legal giant, Chief Judge Bell has played a large part \nin upholding and defending our Constitution in Maryland, and in helping \nour State and nation move toward ``establishing justice'' and creating \na ``more perfect union.'' I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking \nChief Judge Robert Bell for his civil rights leadership, contributions \nto the legal community, and inspirational life as he retires after an \noutstanding career of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7400-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO LEE SACHS\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to recognize the \ncontributions of Lee Norman Sachs, one of America's outstanding first-\nresponders and human beings whose contribution of time, talent, and \nleadership span over 3\\1/2\\ decades. Lee graduated from the University \nof Pennsylvania and the University Of Maryland School Of Law, and began \npracticing law in 1967, concentrating on family law and real estate \nmatters. But his desire to do more for his community led him to take \nEmergency Medical Technician, EMT, training and join the Pikesville \nVolunteer Fire Department. Over the years, Lee took more and more \ntraining, first to qualify as a paramedic and then as a firefighter, \nfire driver/operator and lastly a fire instructor.\n  Lee's dedication, training, and leadership skills have resulted in \nhis election to many volunteer fire positions, most notably as \npresident of the Pikesville Volunteer Fire Department, the Baltimore \nCounty Volunteer Firemen's Association, and the Maryland State \nFiremen's Association.

A bill to allow acceleration certificates awarded under the \nPatents for Humanity Program to be transferable; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our intellectual property system in the \nUnited States is the envy of the world and the engine of economic \ngrowth. By granting inventors exclusive rights in their discoveries for \na limited time, the patent system incentivizes research and development \nby independent inventors and large multinational companies. Consumers \nbenefit from new technologies, and our economy benefits from continued \ninvestment.\n  I am introducing legislation today that will encourage patent holders \nto apply their intellectual property to address global humanitarian \nneeds. This has long been an interest of mine. In 2006, I introduced \nlegislation that would have created a statutory license to manufacture \nand export life saving medicines to eligible, developing countries.\n  Today's legislation, rather than creating a statutory license, \nimproves on a program created by United States Patent and Trademark \nOffice, PTO, earlier this year. The PTO's ``Patents for Humanity'' \nProgram provides rewards to selected patent holders who apply their \ntechnology to a humanitarian issue that significantly affects the \npublic health or quality of life of an impoverished population. Those \nwho receive the award are given a certificate to accelerate certain PTO \nprocesses.\n\n[[Page S7403]]\n\n  Following a Judiciary Committee hearing in June, I asked Director \nKappos whether the program would be more effective, and more attractive \nto patent owners, if the acceleration certificate were transferable to \na third party.

Res. 608\n\n       Whereas the unique perspectives and insights of young \n     people, especially young people who have participated in a \n     public policy-related program, outreach initiative, \n     internship, fellowship, or congressionally sponsored youth \n     advisory council, are essential to ensure that investments \n     made by the Federal Government in youth services are \n     effective and efficient;\n       Whereas existing outreach and engagement mechanisms of the \n     Federal Government are often designed in ways that inhibit \n     participation by, and lead to the under-representation of, \n     young people in the policy-making process; and\n       Whereas numerous Members of Congress, Governors, State \n     legislatures, mayors, and city councils have created youth \n     councils that have proven to be an effective means of \n     receiving input from young people, which leads to more \n     effective and efficient investments in youth services: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the establishment with private funds of a \n     President's Youth Council to--\n       (A) advise the President and the executive branch on the \n     perspectives of young people;\n       (B) suggest ways to make investments by the Federal \n     Government in youth services more effective and efficient; \n     and\n       (C) provide recommendations on issues that will affect the \n     long-term future of the United States;\n       (2) recommends that the members of the President's Youth \n     Council be young people who--\n       (A) are appointed by the President, the majority leader and \n     minority leader of the Senate, and the Speaker and minority \n     leader of the House of Representatives;\n       (B) are between 16 and 24 years of age;\n       (C) have participated in a public policy-related program, \n     outreach initiative, internship, fellowship, or \n     congressionally sponsored youth advisory council;\n       (D) can constructively contribute to policy deliberations;\n       (E) can conduct outreach to solicit the views and \n     perspectives of peers; and\n       (F) have backgrounds that reflect the racial, \n     socioeconomic, and geographic diversity of the United States; \n     and\n       (3) recommends that the President's Youth Council as a \n     whole undertake activities to solicit the unique views and \n     perspectives of young people and bring those views and \n     perspectives to the attention of Congress and the head of \n     each department or agency of the Federal Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/04/senate-section/article/S7403-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3309.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 528, S. \nRes. 543.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 543) to express the sense of the \n     Senate on international parental child abduction.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution, which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, with amendments in the nature of a substitute to the \npreamble and the resolutions as follows:\n\n  [Strike the parts shown in boldface brackets and insert in lieu \nthereof the parts shown in italic.]\n\n                              S. Res. 543\n\n       Whereas international parental child abduction is a tragic \n     and common occurrence;\n       Whereas the abduction of a child by one parent is a \n     heartbreaking loss for the left-behind parent and deprives \n     the child of a relationship with 2 loving parents;\n       Whereas, according to the Report on Compliance with the \n     Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child \n     Abduction of the United States Department of State from April \n     2010, research shows that abducted children are at risk of \n     significant short- and long-term problems, including \n     ``anxiety, eating problems, nightmares, mood swings, sleep \n     disturbances, [and] aggressive behavior'';\n       Whereas, according to that report, left-behind parents may \n     also experience substantial psychological and emotional \n     issues, including feelings of ``betrayal, sadness over the \n     loss of their children or the end of their marriage, anger \n     toward the other parent, anxiety, sleeplessness, and severe \n     depression'', as well as financial strain while fighting for \n     the return of a child;\n       Whereas, since 1988, the United States, which has a treaty \n     relationship under the Convention on the Civil Aspects of \n     International Child Abduction, done at The Hague October 25, \n     1980 (TIAS 11670) (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Hague Abduction Convention'') with 69 other countries, has \n     agreed with its treaty partners to follow the terms of the \n     Hague Abduction Convention;\n\n[[Page S7404]]\n\n       Whereas the Hague Abduction Convention provides a legal \n     framework for securing the prompt return of wrongfully \n     removed or retained children to the countries of their \n     habitual residence where competent courts can make decisions \n     on issues of custody and the best interests of the children;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of \n     State, the number of new cases of international child \n     abduction from the United States increased from 579 in 2006 \n     to 941 in 2011;\n       Whereas, in 2011, those 941 cases involved 1,367 children \n     who were reported abducted from the United States by a parent \n     and taken to a foreign country;\n       Whereas, in 2011, more than 660 children who were abducted \n     from the United States and taken to a foreign country were \n     returned to the United States;\n       Whereas 7 of the top 10 countries to which children from \n     the United States were most frequently abducted in 2011 are \n     parties to the Hague Abduction Convention, including Mexico, \n     Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Ecuador, Brazil, and \n     Colombia;\n       Whereas Japan, India, and Egypt are not parties to the \n     Hague Abduction Convention and were also among the top 10 \n     countries to which children in the United States were most \n     frequently abducted in 2011;\n       Whereas, in many countries, such as Japan and India, \n     international parental child abduction is not considered a \n     crime, and custody rulings made by courts in the United \n     States are not typically recognized by courts in those \n     countries; and\n       Whereas Japan is the only member of the Group of 7 major \n     industrialized countries that has not yet become a party to \n     the Hague Abduction Convention: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n       That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) condemns the international abduction of all children;\n       (B) urges countries identified by the United States \n     Department of State as noncompliant or demonstrating patterns \n     of noncompliance with the Convention on the Civil Aspects of \n     International Child Abduction, done at The Hague October 25, \n     1980 (TIAS 11670) (referred to in this resolution as the \n     ``Hague Abduction Convention'') to fulfill their commitment \n     under international law to expeditiously implement the \n     provisions of the Hague Abduction Convention;\n       (C) calls on all countries to become a party to the Hague \n     Abduction Convention and to promptly institute measures to \n     equitably and transparently address cases of international \n     parental child abduction; and\n       (D) calls on all countries that have not become a party to \n     the Hague Abduction Convention to develop a mechanism for the \n     resolution of current and future cases of international \n     parental child abduction that occur before those countries \n     become a party to the Hague Abduction Convention in order to \n     facilitate the prompt return of children abducted to those \n     countries to the children's countries of habitual residence; \n     and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     should--\n       (A) vigorously pursue the return of each child abducted by \n     a parent from the United States to another country through \n     all appropriate means, facilitate access by the left-behind \n     parent if the child is not returned, and, where appropriate, \n     seek the extradition of the parent that abducted the child;\n       (B) take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child \n     abducted to a country that is a party to the Hague Abduction \n     Convention is returned to the country of habitual residence \n     of the child in compliance with the provisions of the Hague \n     Abduction Convention;\n       (C) continue to use diplomacy to encourage other countries \n     to become a party to the Hague Abduction Convention and to \n     take the necessary steps to effectively fulfill their \n     responsibilities under the Hague Abduction Convention;\n       (D) use diplomacy to encourage countries that have not \n     become a party to the Hague Abduction Convention to develop \n     an institutionalized mechanism to transparently and \n     expeditiously resolve current and future cases of \n     international child abduction that occur before those \n     countries become a party to the Hague Abduction Convention; \n     and\n       (E) review the advisory services made available to United \n     States citizens by the United States Department of State, the \n     United States Department of Justice, and other United States \n     Government agencies--\n       (i) to improve the prevention of international parental \n     child abduction from the United States; and\n       (ii) to ensure that effective and timely assistance is \n     provided to United States citizens who are parents of \n     children abducted from the United States and taken to foreign \n     countries.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nthe committee-reported amendment be agreed to and the Senate proceed to \na voice vote on adoption of the resolution, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
