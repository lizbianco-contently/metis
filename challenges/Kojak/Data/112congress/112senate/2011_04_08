Mr. President, I have been married for a long time--more \nthan 50 years. My wife and I have one daughter and nine grandchildren. \nI love these women very, very much. One day, though, I may not be able \nto help them, and one of them may need a cancer screening. It is not a \npleasant thought, but that is the reality of life--that I may not be \naround to help them when they need something.\n  Over their lives, they will be in need of other things, such as a \ncholesterol check, maybe a blood pressure screening--tests that are \nless serious but just as important to a woman's health. They should be \nable to get the test that can save their life. So should every single \nwoman in America. I believe that and, frankly, that is not so \ncontroversial. It is not so controversial a belief.\n  Some women, of course, have doctors. Others, including many of the \npoorest among us, don't. So where do they go to get a blood pressure, \ncholesterol, or cancer screening? Where do they go? Thankfully, there \nis a little-known part of a little-known law that saves many lives. It \nis called title X, and it is part of a public health law. It means \nwomen and girls can go to their\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\nlocal health department or community clinic and get these tests. More \nthan 5 million women use these centers for title X coverage every \nyear--5 million--and one of them could be my granddaughter or my \ndaughter.\n  Mr. President, some watching us today--and we know the whole world is \nwatching us today--may be asking why I am talking about women's health \nwhen the question before us is the budget of the biggest economy on the \nplanet Earth. Some may ask why we are talking about the smallest corner \nof planet Earth. With a government shutdown looming not weeks away or \ndays away but hours away, why are we talking about whether women can \nget something as simple and noncontroversial as a cancer screening? The \nanswer is that Republicans want to shut down our Nation's government \nbecause they want to make it harder for women to get the health \nservices they need.\n  By the way, title X does not include abortion. It is illegal to use \nFederal funds for abortion services. So anyone who says this debate is \nover abortion isn't being truthful. It is about simple and important \nhealth services. Republicans want to shut down the government because \nthey think there is nothing more important than keeping women from \ngetting cancer screenings. This is indefensible, and everyone should be \noutraged--men and women should be outraged. The Republican House \nleadership has only a few hours left to look in the mirror, snap out of \nit, and realize how positively shameful that would be.\n  For months, this conversation has been about billions and trillions \nof dollars. It has been about weighty issues and difficult decisions. \nThis debate is about saving money--or that is what we thought it was \nabout. But no longer. We have an agreement on the cuts and savings. I \nwas there at the White House last night. That agreement includes a \nhistoric level of cuts. We have always recognized we had to make cuts. \nThat is why we agreed at the White House last night to make significant \ncuts--hard but important.\n  But now the tea party--among others, although they are the biggest \npush--is trying to move its extreme social agenda on issues that have \nnothing to do with funding the government. They are willing, it \nappears, clearly, to throw women under the bus even if it means they \nwill shut down the government because that is where we are. That is the \none issue that was remaining last night. That agenda is an extreme \nagenda. I don't agree with their ideas on social policy, but in our \ndemocracy, those ideas, however radical or however you may disagree \nwith them, deserve a debate if they want one. That is fair. But that \ndebate doesn't belong in an urgent bill to keep the government running, \nand it especially doesn't belong here at this late hour.\n\n  The consequences of letting our country's funding expire will be \ndevastating. There are almost 1 million Federal employees. These are \npeople who work for the Bureau of Land Management, which doesn't have a \nbig presence in the Presiding Officer's State but has a huge presence \nin Nevada. The State of Nevada is 87 percent owned by the Federal \nGovernment. There are Forest Service employees, FBI employees, Internal \nRevenue Service employees, and the people who work in this great \ngovernment complex--almost 1 million of them--who are waiting on pins \nand needles.\n  Federal employees are like everybody else. They are working from \npaycheck to paycheck. They are wondering if they are going to be able \nto get that new car they have needed for 3 or 4 years. They are \nwondering, with summer coming, if they are going to be able to take \nthat vacation they have wanted to take for a long time. Federal \nemployees are like everybody else.\n  The consequences of letting our country's funding expire would be \ndevastating to people, individuals, and it would be devastating to our \ntroops, to our small businesses, and to Americans' everyday lives--\npeople who just want to get a home loan or get their tax refund or, I \nrepeat, get their paycheck. A government shutdown would damage our \nimage and credibility around the world. But Republicans are asking me \nto sacrifice my wife's health, my daughter's health, and my nine \ngranddaughters' health. They are asking me to sacrifice the health of \nwomen in Nevada and all across this country. But I am not going to be \npart of that. I won't do it. As a legislator, I am very frustrated. As \nan American, I am appalled. As a husband, a father, and a grandfather, \nI am personally offended.\n  Would the Chair announce morning business now, please.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2288-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, at this very critical time in our country's \nhistory--a time when we have over a $14 trillion debt and we are \ndesperately trying to find ways to reduce government spending and there \nlooms the possibility of a government shutdown--I think we would be \nbest served trying to provide some information to our constituents and, \nas politicians, resisting the temptation to throw rotten apples at each \nother. I also think it would be wise for the media to not hype or \noverhype a situation regarding a government shutdown but to try to put \nthings into perspective. So let me try to do that for a moment this \nmorning.\n  In the first place, obviously we are trying to reach agreement. I \ncompliment the majority leader, Senator Reid, who just spoke, and the \nSpeaker of the House, John Boehner, for their efforts to get together \nand bridge the differences between the two parties--the two bodies--and \nto reach an agreement. In the last 2 or 3 days, the President has also \nweighed in on the issue, and I think he too is trying very hard to help \nthe parties reach an agreement. Notwithstanding that fact, under the \nlaw, tonight at midnight, the funding for much of the government stops, \nand the question is, What can be done about that?\n  The House of Representatives has passed a bill. They passed it \nyesterday. The Senate could take up that bill and pass it. It would \nkeep the government running for another week. It would provide full \nfunding for the military, not just for another week but for the entire \nrest of the year. That is a reasonable measure to keep the government \nrunning. It also, by the way, reduces $12 billion in spending, and most \nof that spending, I am informed, has already been agreed to by the \nadministration and would be included in any longer range continuing \nresolution.\n  Well, what happened? The President said he would veto that bill. That \nis very puzzling because if we are all seeking to fund the government, \nat least until there can be an agreement on a long-term resolution, one \nwould think we would try to keep it going for another week and adopt \nwhat the House did, especially since it provides funding for the \nmilitary.\n  The President, in his veto message, said that the bill was a \ndistraction. I do have to take issue with that. It is not a \ndistraction, it is what is necessary to keep the government running. \nLet me get back to that in a moment.\n  What would happen if we were able to reach agreement by tonight? If \nwe are able to reach agreement before midnight then at least \ntheoretically both bodies, both House and Senate, could pass a very \nshort term, 2 or 3 days, stop-gap measure in order to have the time to \ncomplete the work on the full measure and then adopt that sometime next \nweek and that would avert a shutdown. It is possible also, because in \nthe Senate it would require unanimous consent; somebody might disagree \nwith that process and would object. In that case, it would take a few \ndays for us to do, in effect, the paperwork to get this done. That \nwould then result in a government shutdown during that time, at least \nover the course of the weekend.\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\nThat should be avoided if at all possible. But while there would be \nsome dislocations and inconveniences, I do think the media exaggerates \na little bit the result of a shutdown over the weekend.\n  The biggest problem from my perspective is that the military doesn't \nget paid during that period of time. They will get paid but it is a \ndisruptive thing when you have young military families trying to make \nends meet and sometimes living from paycheck to paycheck to have that \ndisrupted. That is why I think it makes so much sense to adopt what the \nHouse passed yesterday so we have the time, the week to complete the \nwork on the continuing resolution that would fund the government \nthrough the end of the fiscal year, that is to say through the end of \nSeptember, and then not have to worry about a government shutdown and \nespecially funding the military.\n  There is a question that has been raised that is very logical. Why \ncan't the parties get together? Why can't you split the difference? In \nordinary times it might be possible to reach an agreement that way, but \nthese are not ordinary times. We are talking about a country that is on \nthe verge of not being able to pay its debts. The President himself has \nasked us to raise the debt ceiling--I believe sometime next month. In \neffect, we run out not only of money but of the capacity to borrow. Our \ncredit card in effect, the government's credit card, is full up and we \ncannot get any more credit unless we go to the credit card company and \nsay: Would you extend the amount of money we can borrow? In that case, \nit is the Congress passing a bill.\n  We are in a very difficult position in this country and everyone \nknows we are passing a lot of our debts on to future generations. We \nneed to get a handle on that and I don't think anybody disagrees with \nthe proposition that means we need to cut spending. That is what this \nexercise is all about. So it is not the usual thing of splitting the \ndifference. We are talking about big spending cuts.\n  I was disappointed in the comments of the majority leader just now. \nHe said this debate is about saving money. Indeed it is. Yet it appears \nthe one thing--this is what he said. I do not tend to believe this is \ncorrect, but in effect what he was saying is it all boils down to a \n$300-and-some million subsidy for Planned Parenthood. I do not believe \nthat is what is keeping us from allowing the government to continue to \noperate. The majority leader has been in the negotiations. He is in a \nposition to say that. If that is the case, then it seems to me we are \nin a very untenable position here, at least the majority leader is, \nbecause Planned Parenthood is not the only entity that can provide \nmedical care in this country. It gets a subsidy of something like $300 \nmillion-and-some a year. To shut down the government over that would be \nabsolutely unthinkable.\n  The majority leader never said Planned Parenthood, you know, he said \ntitle X. Title X does not receive the subsidy, Planned Parenthood \nreceives the subsidy. Everybody goes to clinics and hospitals and \ndoctors. Some people go to Planned Parenthood. But you don't have to go \nto Planned Parenthood to get your cholesterol or blood pressure \nchecked. If you want an abortion you go to Planned Parenthood and that \nis what Planned Parenthood does. So this is a red herring. To say that \nsomehow the government is going to be shut down over the fact that \nPlanned Parenthood will not get a $300 million gift from the taxpayers \nof America would be absolutely irresponsible. If that is what the \nmajority leader is saying, it is irresponsible. I cannot believe that \nis the fact of what is holding up this agreement from being reached.\n  As I said, we have the bill before us which would provide for a week-\nlong continuation of the government with a $12 billion reduction in \nspending and a funding of the military through the end of the year. It \nseems to me that is a very reasonable proposition. We don't have to \nworry about shutting the government if we adopt that.\n  I said I would get back to the President's message. He said it would \nbe a distraction when he said he would veto that bill to keep the \ngovernment running, and to fully fund the military. He said it would be \na distraction. His exact words, ``this bill is a distraction from the \nreal work that would bring us close to a reasonable compromise.'' I \ndon't see how it is a distraction if it provides another week for us to \ncomplete the work to be done. It is obvious we are going to need time \nto get the work done because neither the House nor the Senate can get \neverything that would have to be done completed by midnight tonight. \nThe House has a requirement that they have any bill pending for 72 \nhours before it is adopted. This continuing resolution clearly would \nhave to be posted for 72 hours. Do we want to shut the government down \nduring that period of time because the President thinks the bill to do \nso is a distraction? I find that incomprehensible, frankly.\n  I also will make this final point. The discussion about reducing \ngovernment spending is not just because we are having trouble borrowing \nfrom borrowers now. Over half, about 42 cents on every dollar we spend \nnow, is borrowed from someone. About half of that is from foreign \nentities. It is also because, as the government spends more and more \nmoney, the private sector has less money to invest and spend. It is the \nprivate sector that creates jobs. What we need to do is spend less \ngovernment money, not only to get ourselves out from under this huge \ndebt burden but also to allow the private economy to have the resources \nto grow. Included in that, of course, is to hire more people.\n  On April 4, the Wall Street Journal had an op-ed by Dr. John Taylor, \na noted economist from Stanford, Gary Becker, a Nobel laureate in \neconomics, George Shultz--three different Secretaries, serving in two \ndifferent Cabinets--all experts in financial, fiscal matters. What they \nwrote in this, which they called ``Time for a Budget Game-Changer'' is \nthe following two sentences:\n\n       Credible actions that reduce the rapid rate of growth of \n     Federal spending and debt will raise economic growth and \n     lower the unemployment rate. Higher private investment, not \n     more government purchases, is the surest way to increase \n     prosperity.\n\n  What we are talking about here is not drastic cuts for austerity's \nsake, but rather sensible reductions to create prosperity in this \ncountry. That is what we are talking about doing here. That is why I \nsupport what Speaker Boehner has been trying to do. I urge my \ncolleagues, instead of, as I said, throwing rotten apples at each other \nhere and trying to preach a doom-and-gloom game, let's focus on what \nthis country can do in a positive and constructive way to get our \neconomy going again and get our people back to work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in shock and \nanger that, after weeks of negotiations, after pledges from Republicans \nto come to the table in good faith, after repeated assurances that they \nwant to talk about principles and budget numbers and not politics, \nafter all the hot rhetoric we have heard about concern for our troops \nand our workers and that the veterans will be hurt, Republicans have \ndecided to hold the Federal budget hostage to their extreme social \nagenda. It is now clear that this is not a debate in the last hours \nbefore this government shuts down about how much to cut. It is about \nwhether women in this country will have access to basic health care \nservices.\n  As a woman, as a mother, as a grandmother, I find that appalling. \nThey can say whatever they want to on the other side, but if they want \nto say this is about numbers, then I challenge them to say title X is \noff the table. For millions of women in this country, and men, their \nonly access to preventive health care services, pregnancy diagnosis, \ncounseling, preventive health services, cervical and breast cancer \nscreening, sexually transmitted disease and HIV transmission prevention \nand education, a broad range of access to contraceptive methods--that \nis what Republicans now, in the 11th hour, are holding hostage to a \ngovernment shutdown. I don't think anyone in America thought this \nelection was about that.\n  We heard the promises about the economy, about cutting budgets, about \nfiscal concerns, but we never heard from anyone that they would be \nwilling to shut down this government and put this country at risk over \nan ideological debate about women's health care.\n  I have three words for them: Women aren't pawns. We will not be pawns \nin\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nthis debate and we will not give in. The access to these critical \nservices is so important to so many young women in this country. I told \nthe story and I will tell it again. A few days ago I heard from a young \nwoman in my State who, at 18-years-old, had to leave an extremely \nabusive family situation, out on the street on her own. She had \ncervical cancer that runs in her family. The only way she was able to \nget the medication and care she needed was through title X Federal \nfunding through clinics in her State.\n  She and 5 million others in this country depend on that, and we are \ngoing to take this away at the 11th hour, in order to get an agreement? \nNot on my watch. Not on the watch of millions of American families in \nthis country who know that access to women's health care is basic to \nthem and their families and their communities. What kind of country are \nwe, that at the 11th hour on a debate like this, the issue remaining is \nabout women's health care? I find that stunning.\n  Families across my State are hurting. They have lost their jobs, they \nare worried about getting a pink slip, their home prices have dropped, \nthey are worried about making their mortgage, and this debate now has \ncome to this? An issue of access to title X funding for preventive \nhealth care for women? We need to focus on the economy. Yes, there are \ngoing to be some budget cuts in this that are going to be extremely \nhard for me and others who care about investing in education and jobs, \nbut we know we have to come to an agreement. But we will not let women \nbe used as pawns in this debate at this 11th hour. We are not going to \nallow this debate to end by cutting off funding for health clinics \nacross America that are often the only place for low-income women.\n  In my State of Washington over 100,000 patients depend on these \nclinics to provide prevention. Over 3 million Americans do nationwide. \nWe are not going to let the threat of a shutdown make us fade away. \nWomen are going to stand tall, and men with them, across the country, \nto say: Not on our watch. Women are not pawns.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2290-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the American people have heard a lot of \nexcuses over the past few days as to why it is that we are staring at a \npotential government shutdown here in Washington.\n  Democrats are saying the holdup is over social issues. This plays \nnicely into the political strategy they have decided on to distract \npeople from their own fiscal recklessness.\n  Republicans say the holdup is over the need to reduce Washington \nspending--that Democrats, including the President, would rather see the \ngovernment shut down than to allow a reduction in the size and scope of \nWashington that is perfectly reasonable by any objective standard.\n  Those are the competing messages. And generally speaking, people will \nprobably agree with the party they tend to vote for. But whichever side \nyou come down on, two things are not in dispute in this debate: First, \nthat the whole reason we are in this mess is that Democrats abdicated \ntheir responsibility to keep the government funded through this year. \nAnd second, that Democrats have rejected the only plan out there that \nkeeps the government open--the bipartisan troop funding bill--for no \napparent reason.\n  The President says he will veto it, but does not say why. And \nDemocrats in Congress would not vote for it, even though it funds the \nDefense Department and keeps the government operational and makes \nreasonable cuts in spending.\n  In other words, what Democrats are saying at this point is that they \nhad rather see the government shut down either because they would not \naccept a modest amount of spending cuts that fall well within the range \nof what Democrats previously described as reasonable, or because they \nwould not reinstate a longstanding policy related to one American city \nthat Members of both parties, including Presidents of both parties, \nhave approved repeatedly in the past.\n  The majority leader said yesterday that this particular provision \nrelates to an issue that we have been unable to reach agreement on for \n40 years. My response is that this is actually one of the few areas of \nagreement both parties have agreed about on this issue for years.\n  Let's be very clear about this: if the government shuts down, it is \neither because Democrats are pretending that a previously \nnoncontroversial provision is suddenly out of bounds. Or they refuse to \ntake another baby step in the direction of balancing the government \ncheckbook, something we know the American people want. Neither reason \nis worth a shutdown especially when neither side actually wants one. \nAnd that is why I believe there will be an agreement here shortly. I \nhave been in many negotiations over the years. I assure you, these are \nnot unresolvable issues.\n  So my suggestion this morning is that both sides sit back and give \nthe negotiators a few more hours to work this out.\n  Let Senator Reid talk with his conference. Let the Speaker talk to \nhis. And let's just hold off on the speculation and the back and forth \nfor a little while here. Both sides are working hard to reach the kind \nof resolution Americans want.\n  A resolution is within reach. The contours of a final agreement are \ncoming into focus. There is virtually nothing in the troop funding bill \nRepublicans in the House passed yesterday that will not be included in \na final package.\n  Let's not disrupt and derail that agreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let's make it clear where we are at this \nmoment in time. There is an agreement. There is agreement on the budget \nnumber. It was an agreement reached between the President with Speaker \nBoehner and with Senate Majority Leader Reid--an agreement on the \nspending cuts for the reminder of this year. It was reached last night \nat the White House.\n  Then it fell apart, not because of a change of heart when it came to \nthe number but, rather, because of the insistence of the House \nRepublicans that they would not let us keep this government \nfunctioning, they would not let us pass a budget resolution for the \nreminder of this year, unless we were prepared to virtually devastate \nthe title X family planning program.\n  Let me ask you something: In the big national debate in the last \nelection over the future of our country and what we would do with our \ndeficit, how many times do you remember that issue coming up? Exactly. \nNone. This issue over title X has been brought in by the House \nRepublicans at the last moment. It has virtually no impact on \ngovernment spending--virtually none.\n  Yet they insist on it. Why? It is because of some problems within the \nHouse Republican caucus. The Speaker of the House, John Boehner, whom I \nknow and respect and like, is surrounded by lean and hungry colleagues \nchallenging his value, his resolve, and his leadership.\n  This House power struggle has now reached a point where we face a \ngovernment shutdown and a slowdown on whether we are going to provide \nbasic health care access for women across America. First, understand, \nnot one penny, not a penny in title X funds can be spent on abortion, \nother than the strictly limited provisions of the Hyde amendment, which \nhave been the law of the land for decades, agreed to by virtually all \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  It is about access to cancer screening, it is about pap smears, \nbreast screening, it is about screening for infectious diseases. Here \nis what it means: If we cut off the funding, as the Republicans ask, \nfor women to have access to affordable health care for their basic \nhealth, it is not, as the Senator from Arizona says, just a matter of \nwhether they will knock on the next\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\ndoor down the street at a doctor's office, it is whether they will have \nany care at all.\n  This is the lowest priced health care for people who struggle to \nsurvive day by day. If we fail to provide that health care, we endanger \ntheir health and we run the risk that without access to family \nplanning, they will have unintended pregnancies and, sadly--sadly--even \nmore abortions in this country.\n  If you believe, as I do, personally, that we should try to reduce the \nnumber of abortions in America, how can you do what the House \nRepublicans are asking us to do and close down access to family \nplanning? In my State of Illinois, it is estimated that if title X were \neliminated, we would have a 24-percent increase in abortions in the \nState. I do not want to see that.\n  I consider myself a person who is personally opposed to abortion but \nbelieves it is up to a woman and her doctor and her family and her \nconscience. But for goodness' sake, should not women, rich and poor \nalike, have access to family planning? That is part of what this debate \ncomes down to.\n  I would say to my colleague over here, Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican leader, he blames us for not coming up with a spending bill \nfor this year and putting us in this mess. My memory is a little better \nthan his. I remember, in December, when we brought the spending bill to \nthe floor, he objected to it. He objected to it, even though the \nspending targets in that bill were exactly what he had asked for before \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee. That put us into this current \nshowdown.\n  Here is what I think we should do: Let's not close down this \ngovernment. Let's face this decision responsibly. Let's say to the \nmillions of committed Federal employees across America who are \nbasically keeping America safe, making sure our planes are safe in the \nair, tending to the business of this great Nation, that they can come \nto work because the government will not close at midnight.\n  Let's acknowledge that we have agreed on the amount of deficit \nreduction, the amount of spending cuts, and move forward. But let's \nalso agree, let's agree to save for another day all those other debates \nabout all those other issues, whether it is the EPA or title X.\n  There is plenty of time and opportunity for Senators and House \nMembers to give speeches until they are red in the face over these \nissues and to call for a vote. But let's not close down the government \nof the United States of America over the access to women's basic health \ncare. That is what the House Republicans are insisting on. It is the \nwrong fight at the wrong time.\n  It is important for us to step up and step forward and understand \nthat if we do not invest a modest amount in preventative health care so \nwomen can learn their health status before small problems become large \nproblems, so women can plan their family future, so people understand \nwhat their health status is, if we do not invest in that preventative \ncare, we will pay dearly for that not only in terms of dollars spent \nbut in terms of human suffering. That is something we should rise \nabove.\n  That is something we should care about enough to put aside and say \nkeep the government open. My plea now to Speaker Boehner is: You have \nfought the good fight. We are at the 11th hour. Do not let us reach the \ndepths of despair by closing down our government and sending a message \nacross the world that there is something wrong with this American form \nof government.\n  There is nothing wrong with it. There is nothing wrong with it that \npeople of good faith, responsibly stepping forward and accepting their \nduty in the House and Senate, cannot cure by agreeing today. Let's do \nit. In this hour of decision, let's get it done.\n  Senator Kerry spoke yesterday at our Senate Democratic caucus lunch. \nJohn, I still remember your words of what an embarrassment it will be \nto the United States if our government is shut down. In the eyes of the \nworld, so many people respect this great Nation and I am glad they do \nand I do too. But to allow a government shutdown at this moment in our \nhistory is a sad commentary. Let us not shut down the Government of the \nUnited States of America over the question of whether women will have \naccess to affordable health care and preventative health care across \nthe United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think that everyone--or virtually \neveryone in the Senate--does not believe we should shut down the \ngovernment. The question is, What are the negotiations? I am not privy \nto them and neither is anyone on this floor about what are still the \nsticking points.\n  We all believe it is our responsibility to assure that government \ndoes not shut down and to come to an agreement because this is a 6-\nmonth bill--this is to the end of the fiscal year--that we are trying \nto negotiate. It is a very small part of the big picture, which is, we \nmust get the deficit down, which is projected to be, under the current \nbudget that has been put forward, $1.5 trillion.\n  That is wrong. That is what we ought to be addressing. We ought to be \nlooking at the numbers we can bring down so we start getting this \nbudget deficit down so our debt starts coming down and we can see an \neconomy that is thriving through private sector job creation.\n  That is what we ought to be doing. But because there is so much \ndebate and because there is such disagreement about what is holding up \nthe agreement for that 6-month plan, there is something that is gaining \nmomentum in this country that I want to assure everyone knows about.\n  I was notified of it this morning through an e-mail into my Web site. \nIt was from a woman I do not know. She said: My husband is Active Duty \nin the Navy, and I just wanted to let you know there is a Facebook \ncampaign supporting S. 724. Please click the link below because there \nare 437,000 people who have signed on that they agree with us. This is \nwhat Americans think about military pay being cut.\n\n  Because S. 724, that was put forward by myself and Senator Casey who \ncame on board, which now has 58 sponsors, is about making sure no \nmatter what happens in the next 12 hours, no matter what happens with \nthe government shutdown, is that there be no question in the minds of \nour military and their families that they will be paid on time because \nthere is no question they are going to come to work. I do not want 1 \nday or 1 hour of delay in the payment for our military. We have about \n100,000 people in Afghanistan today putting their lives on the line, \nwherever they are in that country, and we have 47,000 in Iraq.\n  For the people back home--and I have already heard from one wife who \nhas a 1-year-old child whose husband is in Afghanistan, who says: Thank \nyou for remembering that we have mortgages to pay, and our husbands are \nnot here to help us or do anything about it.\n  So I wish to say we have now, in the hour since we got this note, we \nwent on the Web site. The Web site is called Ensure Pay for Our \nMilitary Act of 2011, which is also the name of our bill. It now has \n639,212 people who have signed on in support of this Web site.\n  The people of our country know there is one option we do not have; \nthat is, to pass a freestanding bill that will assure whatever the \nother disagreements are, that our military pay will be on time for the \nwork that is being performed. America understands that. I am asking the \nSenate to join.\n  I ask unanimous consent for cosponsors to be added to my bill: \nSenator Pryor, Senator Boozman, Senator Bennet, Senator Baucus, Senator \nIsakson, Senator Kirk, and Senator Johnson.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That brings the total to 58. Senator Casey has been a \nwonderful supporter in this. He is the lead cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, 58 Senators have stepped to the plate and said: This \nis not an option, for us to equivocate for 1 minute.\n  I am waiting to get two more cosponsors, which will show that we have \n60 and that we want to act as a Senate. I am hoping that Senator Casey \nand I can get the ability to bring up our bill and pass it. It is very \nsimple, very clear. Military pay for those who are serving our military \nin civilian capacities will not be delayed. They are going to report to \nwork, and they need to have peace of mind because the mortgages they \nhave may be on direct\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\nlines to the mortgage companies, that they are going to be covered. \nThat is the very least we can do as we are arguing about whose fault it \nis going to be if we have a shutdown. We need to say: It is our first \npriority not to have a shutdown, and we need to be able to come to \nagreement, and we need to take further action--I hope we can do it very \nquickly--of saying we are going to assure, with this simple bill, that \nour military will be paid.\n  If we send this to the House of Representatives, my guess is they, \ntoo, will pass it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, that makes 59.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Senator Warner is 60. We now have the \nability to pass this piece of legislation. Whatever happens on this \nfloor, we have 60 votes that commit us to supporting our troops and \nassuring them that there is no equivocation in this Senate for having \ntheir pay on time. They will be doing their duty in Iraq, and they will \nbe doing their duty in Afghanistan. It is my great hope that we also \nwill have the ability to assure their families so there is not 1 minute \nof stress added to what they already have in their lives.\n  I thank those who started this Facebook and the grassroots movement \nthat has brought us to over a half million people in a few hours. This \nis a true grassroots movement. I thank those who started it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the crisis we have. \nI guess I ask my Republican colleagues: Please, don't shut down our \ngovernment. A shutdown will hurt all Americans--our businesses, our \nmiddle-class families, our servicemembers who could see their paychecks \ndelayed. It will hurt this economy. Eight percent of mortgages are FHA \nguaranteed. None can be issued that are FHA guaranteed starting \ntomorrow. Housing is one of our largest industries, and it has been on \nits knees. This will put it on its back. IRS checks that are mailed, \nwhere the refund is mailed back, will stop. That is billions of dollars \nthat would be circulating in the economy that will not happen.\n  We Democrats have been listening to the people. We want to avoid a \nshutdown and have met all of the Republican demands on the spending \nside.\n  Last night at the White House Speaker Boehner said to the President: \nIf you go with me, it is $78 billion in cuts. That will satisfy me.\n  The President said: We will get to that number.\n  We have moved in every direction Speaker Boehner has asked. We \nbelieve there should be cuts. There is tremendous waste in government. \nI think any Democrat who ignores the lesson of those who voted, the \nlesson of the last election, makes a mistake. The people did want \ngovernment to cut out the waste and to shrink, but they didn't say cut \neverything. They didn't say use a meat ax. I didn't have a single \nperson tell me--and I met a whole lot of tea party people--to cut \ncancer research, cut loans to students who are going to college because \nthe American people have wisdom. Cut the things that are wasteful and \nhurt the middle class but grow the things that help the middle class \nachieve a better life. That is what the President has tried to do when \nhe said: We are going to out-educate, out-build, out-innovate. That is \nwhat we are trying to do.\n  There are a lot of tough cuts in our proposal, some that I don't \nlike. Every Member on this side will be able to find things they \nseriously don't like, but at the same time we have gone to a level, \nabout as high as we can go, that doesn't cut our seed corn, our future, \na growing economy for our people and their children.\n  On cuts, we are in a good place. So why didn't we come to an \nagreement? Why, after Speaker Boehner offered a number and the \nPresident accepted, why are we still here today worried about a \nshutdown that will hurt so many? The answer is simple: the so-called \nextraneous riders. These add-ons, which have nothing to do with deficit \nreduction, are standing in the way. Why are they standing in the way? \nBecause a minority of the House--perhaps even a minority although a \nlarge number of Republicans--insists that they be there. They are the \nhard right of the Republican Party. They are the same people who have \nsaid: We cannot give an inch on their H.R. 1 bill, which did cut our \nseed corn, did cut loans to colleges and cancer research. Now they say \nthey have to insert these extraneous riders dealing not with abortion--\nthe Federal Government can't fund abortion because of the Hyde \namendment--but rather about women's health, about who, not how much, \nshould get the payments to do chest screenings and blood tests and \ncancer tests for women. That battle has been raging for a long time, \ndecades. It has nothing to do with reducing the deficit.\n  So why is it there? Let me show why on this little chart, this little \npictorial representation. Speaker Boehner has said: ``No daylight \nbetween Tea Party and me.''\n  Let me repeat that because these are his words: ``No daylight between \nTea Party and me.''\n  Does he have the exact same views as the tea party? Obviously not, \nbut he is pulled by them. He has a choice. He can listen to the tea \nparty and shut down the government, or he can take the very difficult--\nand I admit it is difficult; I believe Speaker Boehner is a good man; I \nlike him; I think he is a decent, honorable man who is caught between a \nrock and a hard place--alternative which is to take the mantle of \nleadership and tell those on the hard right they cannot run the \ngovernment completely.\n  They will have influence--they already have--but they cannot run the \ngovernment completely. They certainly can't impose their social \nideological agenda on a budget process, frail enough as it is. These \nriders are the straw that breaks the camel's back and causes the \nshutdown.\n  Speaker Boehner is trying to say today it is not the riders, it is \nthe budget numbers; but that is belied by two facts: No. 1, he offered \na number to the President last night and the President accepted, $78 \nbillion in cuts. No. 2, if it isn't the riders, as my colleague from \nWashington State said, take them off the table. Tell the tea party and \nothers that this is not the time or place. There will be a debate on \nthis issue. We can guarantee that. Even if we didn't want it to happen, \nit would. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would make \nsure. But not here and not now; not when continuing the government with \nall the ramifications is at stake.\n\n  What we have is a flea wagging a tail wagging a dog. The flea is the \nminority of House Republicans who are hard right. The tail is the House \nRepublican caucus. The dog is the government. That flea is influencing \nwhat the dog does. More than influencing, right now it is determining. \nIt is sad.\n  Leadership is tough. Frankly, when either party goes to the extremes, \nthey don't do the right thing. When Republicans go to the hard right, \nwhen Democrats go to the hard left, my experience is they lose \npolitically. Much more importantly, they do what is wrong for the \ncountry substantively. We are a country that governs from the middle. \nWe are a country that believes in compromise. We are a country of what \nthe Founding Fathers profoundly weaved through the Constitution: checks \nand balances.\n  It says two things: When the people want change, a new group will \ncome in, and they will certainly have an effect. Our government, our \nstructure of government the Founding Fathers created, is not ossified. \nThey also said they won't control everything. That is the beauty of our \ngovernment.\n  We in the Senate are the cooling saucer. That is what we are doing \nhere. We are performing our function. It is a function that the \nFounding Fathers wished us to perform, some of whom, I might note, come \nfrom the State of Virginia. In any case, we have a serious issue ahead \nof us.\n  I say to Speaker Boehner: Please, tell the tea party folks they are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\nto get some of their way but not all their way. They will not get their \nway on these extraneous riders related to women's health. The battle \nfor whether the government shuts down goes on inside Speaker Boehner's \nhead.\n  When people ask me: Are we going to shut down?\n  I say: Look inside Speaker Boehner's brain and see what is going on \nthere. I am sure there is a lot of torment and tumult. I sympathize \nwith the situation.\n  This is a time for leadership, and if leadership emerges, this \ngovernment, on which so many people depend, will not shut down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the American credit card is maxed out. We \ncontinue to add about $1 trillion or $1.5 trillion to that credit card \nevery single year to where it is now at $14 trillion. The amazing thing \nis, right now it is about noon, and between now and midnight tonight \nwhen this continuing resolution expires, if nothing is done the \ngovernment would shut down. We will add more than $2 billion to that \ndebt. In a 12-hour time period between noon and midnight tonight, we \nwill add another more than $2 billion to that $14 trillion debt that is \ngrowing by the hour.\n  We have a crisis in this country. We have had experts tell us, such \nas the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, that \nthere is a 50-percent probability that we will see a debt crisis in the \nnext 2 to 3 years.\n  Interestingly enough, there was a story in the Wall Street Journal \nthis morning that says:\n\n       Europe's central bank became the first monetary authority \n     in a major developed economy to raise interest rates since \n     the global financial crisis struck, a sign that an era of \n     cheap credit is coming to a close.\n\n  It goes on to say the ECB increased its benchmark by a quarter point \nto 1.25 percent.\n  Now, if we started to see an upward tick in interest rates, it would \nhave a profound impact on the deficit and on the debt because the \nexperts also tell us--the Congressional Budget Office and others--that \nfor every 1 percentage point increase in interest rates, it would cost \nabout $140 billion every single year.\n  To put that into perspective, the interest on the debt in the year \n2015--if we stay on our current trajectory, will exceed the amount we \nspend for defense. So we will be spending more on interest on the debt \nthan we actually spend defending this country in 2015. That is assuming \nwe did not see any kind of an increase in interest rates. If we were to \nsee, as I said earlier, as much as a 1-percent increase in interest \nrates, that adds $140 billion every single year in interest costs to \nfinance the debt. This is a serious situation which requires serious \naction.\n  We have in front of us a continuing resolution to fund the government \nbecause we did not get the work done last year. The Democratic \nmajorities in the last year did not pass a budget, did not pass a \nsingle appropriations bill. So we are doing the unfinished work of last \nyear. We are in the now sixth continuing resolution which, as I said, \nexpires tonight at midnight. If nothing is done, the government would \nshut down, but there is an alternative. Of course, the best alternative \nwould be to pass legislation that passed the House of Representatives \nearlier this year--it was voted on in the Senate and was defeated--that \ncut $61 billion from discretionary spending and would take us back to \n2008 levels.\n  Just to remind my colleagues, in the last 2 years discretionary \nspending has increased 24 percent. That is if we do not include \nstimulus money. If we add stimulus money, it was 84 percent. We have \nseen discretionary spending increase in the last 2 years by 24 percent \nat a time when inflation in this country was 2 percent. So we were \nspending at a rate that was literally more than 10 times the rate of \ninflation.\n  I do not think the American people would think it is unreasonable--\nwhen we are running $1.5 trillion deficits every year, when we have a \n$14 trillion debt--that we ought to be able to go back to 2008 spending \nlevels. That is what the House bill did that failed in the Senate. So \nthat triggered a negotiation, which is ongoing.\n  My point very simply is, there is a solution in front of us now that \nwould prevent, at midnight tonight, the government from shutting down, \nand it would also fund our troops through the end of this fiscal year, \nwhich ends on September 30. So all we have to do in the Senate is--the \nmajority leader, all he has to do is call up that House-passed bill, we \nmove that, and it would fund the government for another week until the \nnegotiators can come to a final conclusion on a longer term funding \nresolution that would take us through to the end of the fiscal year.\n  There is a very simple answer to all this. So there is a big debate \nabout that particular short-term funding resolution. They say, well, \nmaybe it cuts too deeply. All the cuts that are in that short-term \nfunding resolution are cuts that have been agreed upon largely by both \nsides, by both Democrats and Republicans, and it is to the tune of \nabout $12 billion, which is significantly less than the number both \nsides have agreed we ought to cut from the budget this year.\n  As I said, it also would fund the military. It is important we fund \nour troops, that we not put our military at risk of not having the \nfunding that is necessary for them to conduct their very important \nduties when we are trying to fight two wars, and perhaps three. So it \nwould fund the military through the end of this fiscal year.\n  So why will it not be picked up and passed by the majority leader in \nthe Senate? Well, according to our colleagues on the other side, it is \nbecause of these ideological riders, this rigid partisanship, this \ninsisting upon things that just absolutely do not have any support in \nthe Congress.\n  Well, I want to point out something. In 2009 the other side was \nsinging a very different tune because at that time they were passing a \nbig spending bill, and at that time President Obama and then-Speaker \nPelosi loaded such riders onto a government funding bill similar to the \none now being negotiated. A senior Democratic aide is saying: Well, \nthey are not comparable. Well, many of the same provisions--in fact, \none of them was an abortion provision that was included in that \nparticular spending bill. It goes on to say--and this is quoting a \nDemocratic aide later on:\n\n       There is a difference between including riders on a bill \n     when they are supported by a majority of the Senate and just \n     need a vehicle and including riders on a bill because a \n     minority is trying to ram through something that would not \n     have support on its own.\n\n  Well, just to point out, the rider that was added by the House \nRepublicans on the short-term spending bill is a ban on taxpayer \nfunding of abortions in Washington, DC. It would affect one city in the \ncountry. Interestingly enough, it is a position that has been supported \nrepeatedly by the leadership on the other side. The majority leader, \nSenator Reid, has voted for this very ban 10 times since 1995. The \nmajority whip, Senator Durbin, has voted for this very ban 9 times \nsince 1995. Believe it or not, the President of the United States, when \nhe was a member of the Senate, voted for that ban twice, and he, as \nPresident, signed legislation that includes that ban.\n  So to suggest this is something that lacks majority support just does \nnot pass the smell test. You cannot make an argument that it is about \nideological riders that do not have majority support when you have \npeople on both sides, by large majorities, voting for these particular \nriders. I think you cannot argue that this is an ideological battle \nbecause these are things that have been passed before right here in the \nSenate.\n  I think most of these--a lot of legislative things, a lot of things \nthat get funded in government are an expression of someone's ideology. \nNow, there are some of us who happen to believe the taxpayers in this \ncountry should not be supporting abortion; that taxpayer funds should \nnot be going to support abortions.\n  The broader debate about funding for Planned Parenthood is not just \nideological, it is a funding issue because they have received somewhere \non the order of over $300 million a year in taxpayer funds. So when you \nare looking at ways to trim government, you are looking at every area \nof the government. You are by definition making decisions that in some \ncases may be based on someone's ideology. The fact is, you cannot argue \nwith a straight face on the floor of the Senate that\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\nthis short-term funding resolution ought to be held up over a couple of \nriders that have broad support by Members on both sides and have \ncountless previous votes in support of those.\n  So I would suggest to my colleagues in the Senate that a shutdown at \nmidnight tonight can be avoided very simply. All it requires is for the \nmajority leader to pick up the bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday; a bill that, as I said, funds the government \nfor another week until our negotiators can come to that final \nconclusion, that funds the military through the end of the fiscal year, \nand that includes a couple of provisions that have been supported \nnumerous times by Members on both sides in the Senate.\n  A shutdown is totally avoidable, but it is completely up to the \nmajority to pick up that legislation and pass it. We cannot afford to \nwait to deal with out-of-control spending and debt for the reasons I \njust mentioned. Over 40 cents of every dollar we spend at the Federal \nlevel is borrowed. As I said before, we have seen discretionary \nspending increase by 24 percent over the past 2 years. What the House \nRepublicans have proposed in terms of spending reductions, I think by \nany definition--I think the American people would find it to be very \nreasonable. It represents literally less than 2 percent of total \nFederal spending.\n  At a time when most Americans are tightening their belts, most small \nbusinesses are tightening their belts, families are having to make hard \nbudget decisions, at least in Washington we ought to be making \ndecisions in the best interest of getting this country back on track so \nwe do not spend money we do not have and we are living within our means \nand not saddling future generations with an enormous debt, which is not \nfair to them and which, by the way, also has a profound impact on the \neconomy.\n  Everybody makes the argument up here that somehow if we reduce \nFederal spending it is going to hurt the economy. Well, I would argue \nthe opposite. If we do not get Federal spending under control, it is \ngoing to hurt the economy because you are going to see these kinds of \nimpacts. You are going to see interest rates start going up. You are \ngoing to see inflation start going up. You are going to have people not \nmaking decisions about hiring out there in our economy because they do \nnot believe Washington, DC, has gotten the message about getting \nspending and debt under control.\n  So I would argue to my colleagues that we have a solution, a very \nsimple solution in front of us. It certainly does not necessitate at \nmidnight tonight the government shutting down. I do not think that is \nin anybody's best interests. I do not know of anyone on this side of \nthe aisle who wants to see that happen. All we are saying is, it is \nhigh time this government started to live within its means, started to \nstop spending money it does not have, started putting us on a fiscal \npath that will ensure that this country is around for future \ngenerations of Americans, and that we do not have young people in the \nfuture carrying around an $88,000 debt, which is what their debt will \nbe in a few short years if we do not take steps to get Federal spending \nand Federal debt under control.\n  So I urge my colleagues--the Senator from New York got up and said: \nPlease, Republicans, don't shut the government down. I would say to my \ncolleagues on the other side: It is very simple. If the majority leader \njust picks up the House-passed bill, passes it, this crisis is averted. \nThe negotiators can continue their discussions on a longer term \nsolution which it sounds like they are very close to coming to a \nconclusion on. That is all it would require. It is a very simple \nsolution.\n  I hope my colleagues will do it, and we can make sure the government \ncontinues to function, but that we start to get spending and debt under \ncontrol.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor to S. 724.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I do not \nintend to object--but I am just wondering if the Senator from \nMassachusetts would be willing to amend his request to allow subsequent \nRepublican speakers to also have 15 minutes to make their remarks. So \nif the Senator would agree to amend that request, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is a \ncritically important issue, and I think a lot of us all want to speak. \nI just want to make sure--I have been presiding and waiting for some \ntime as well. I hope we do not start rearranging all the rules here so \nwe all get a fair chance to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request from the \nSenator from Massachusetts?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I continue to reserve the right to object. \nIf the Senator is willing to amend his request, I will not object. But \nif he is not, then I agree with the Senator from Virginia. There is a \nlong list of Republicans and Democrats who would like to speak.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is sort of an indication of the kind \nof problem we have around here, which is the ability to accommodate a \nsimple request that used to be accommodated around here all the time.\n  Let me say very quickly, what the Senator from South Dakota just said \nis a massive oversimplification of what is happening. The President of \nthe United States made it very clear, we are not going to fund the \ngovernment week to week to week to week to week. It costs more money. \nIt is a completely incompetent way to fund the Government of the United \nStates of America. People need to make plans. People need to let \ncontracts. People need to be able to know how much they are going to be \nspending, how much can they hire, who can they hire. That is an \nincompetent way to manage the United States.\n  The President made it clear, we have already done two short-term \nfundings of the government, and he said we are not going to do it \nagain. It is time to reach an agreement. It is time to show the \nmaturity and the capacity to be able to do the business of our Nation. \nThey are just asking for another delay. But they are not just asking \nfor that, they have also put their ideological wish list into that \nparticular request.\n  This is a dangerous moment for our economy and for our country. \nFrankly, it is an embarrassing moment for the Congress of the United \nStates. It is an embarrassing moment, I think, for the American people, \nwho have to watch their Congress struggling to do what we were sent \nhere to compromise and find a way to do the business of our country.\n  There is a reason we are standing on the precipice of this argument. \nI believe we can still get an agreement in these next hours. I believe \nwe may well get that agreement in these next hours. But what a show to \nget there. How extraordinary it is that for the first time since the \n1990s, when, incidentally, the Republicans ran the House--does it ring \na bell? That is the last time we had a shutdown in the U.S. Congress, \nand here we are back again with the same threats, the same need to do \nbrinksmanship that puts an ideological wish list on the table, that you \ncannot pass any other way, to try to force it down the throats of \nAmericans at the last minute by threatening to shut down the \ngovernment.\n  I have to tell you, in China, they have to be laughing at us right \nnow. They have to be clapping. How terrific that the United States of \nAmerica cannot make a decision. Boy, does that send a wonderful message \nto businesses all around the world: They can't make a decision. They \ncan't decide an energy policy. They can't decide an infrastructure \npolicy. They can't fix their schools. They can't do anything, and now \nthey can't even get a budget. That is a hell of a message around the \nworld. While we are running the world preaching the virtues of \ndemocracy, people have to be scratching their heads and saying, That is \nwhat we are going to get?\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\n  This is not because both sides of the political aisle cannot agree \nabout a plan for cutting the deficit. This is not about the deficit. We \nonly have to listen to Speaker Boehner and to the President, the \nmajority leader and others, and add up the math. It is beyond dispute \nthat Democrats have agreed to make the largest budget cuts in American \nhistory in discretionary spending. It is also beyond dispute that we \nhave agreed to travel far more than halfway. We are at about 73 percent \nof what they requested in terms of spending reductions.\n  Last night, the President of the United States sat with Speaker \nBoehner and said, I agree to your number. This is not about the number. \nWe agree with the number, providing we can also look beyond \ndiscretionary spending and look to the larger budget, which is the way \nwe ought to be doing budgeting for the United States. We have \ncompromised. We have agreed to well more than what is reasonable with \nrespect to some of these reductions.\n  So this is not about making cuts to the deficit. That is not what it \nis about. America needs to understand that. In a negotiation, there is \nalways a back and forth. There is a give and a take. But we are at this \nextraordinary moment in American history where a small group of people \nseems to be intimidating their own leadership.\n  I keep hearing about what a tough position the Speaker is in. He is \nnot in a tough position. He is the Speaker of the House of the United \nStates of America. It is a job he always wanted. It is a job he wants \nto have. He asked for it. His position is no tougher than anybody else \nhere who has to make a cut on these kinds of issues. What are you for? \nBut he is allowing this small group, a minority within a group--maybe a \nminority of a minority, I don't know--to dictate and they are saying, \nOh, we have to do this. We have to take America right up to the brink, \nright up to the edge, and show the world we are not able to do our \nbusiness in a quiet and responsible and thoughtful way.\n  Rigid ideology is threatening to shut down the Federal Government of \nthe United States. Let's not play games and pretend with some short-\nterm stopgap measure when the President has said we are not going to do \nthat anymore. It is no way to run the government and it costs more \nmoney. They are doing this with impunity because all the voices of \nmoderation and common sense--all the voices on the other side of the \naisle who say we don't want to shut down the government--and they \nreally don't. I know some of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. They get it. They don't want to do this. But either they are not \nbeing listened to or something has happened over there where there is a \nlevel of anarchy within the institutional process of the Congress that \nis dictating where we are.\n  So why is it that 100 percent--100 percent--of the cuts we are being \nasked to make are coming from only 12 percent of the budget? There \nisn't an American who will sit there and say, What do you mean? You \nmean only 12 percent of the budget is up for grabs, and they are taking \n100 percent of their cuts from the 12 percent of the budget? That \ndoesn't make a lot of sense. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Defense \nspending at the Pentagon: Are you telling me that every system we are \nbuying over there, the procurement process of the Pentagon is so \nperfect that we can't make some cuts? But they are not trying to cut \ndefense. That is not on the table.\n  Everybody knows the big items of our budget deficit are Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security. Those aren't on the table. They are not \nbeing considered. How can they say this is not ideological when the \nonly things that are being cut in their proposals are the very things \nsome people have been trying to cut for 40 years? They have opposed \nthem as a matter of principle their entire political life and they \ncan't get them any other way, so now they are trying to jam them down \nthe American throat by saying we are threatening to shut down the \nGovernment of the United States.\n  This isn't about the budget deficit. If it were, we would have made \nthe largest cuts in American history because we have agreed to those \ncuts. Every single one of us understands why we are in the predicament \nwe are in. Yes, we have a huge budget deficit and huge debt. I can't \nget over how quickly my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nable to forget about how we got here. When President George Bush became \nPresident, we had a path toward a $5.6 trillion surplus. We had \nbalanced the budget. We did what we needed to do. Then they came in and \npassed two huge tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country that \nthey didn't ask for and didn't need, and all of a sudden we had a \ndeficit. Of course, it was because they gave tax cuts on the credit \ncard. Then we had two wars, one of which was a war we never had to \nhave--the war in Iraq at a cost of $1 trillion. That is our deficit. \nThen they had all their cronies guarding the financial system with the \nfoxes guarding the chicken coops. The result was Wall Street ran away \nwith American economic interests, and we had the housing crisis and the \nWall Street crash--the greatest loss of wealth in modern times. As a \nresult was the deficit and the debt went up. When President Obama came \ninto office we were losing 750,000 jobs a month. They forget that. They \nforget their complicity in that.\n  So we are where we are now. The fact is this fight--do my colleagues \nknow what they have been trying to do? They have been trying to shut \ndown the government if they don't get Environmental Protection Agency \nrestraints which they weren't able to win otherwise. They have about 65 \ndifferent ideological wish list items now being reduced, but that is \nwhat the fight has been about for these last weeks. Folks, we had that \ndebate. It is fresh in our minds.\n  This week the Senate debated Senator McConnell's amendment to cut off \nEPA's authority under the Clean Air Act. It lost. Three other \namendments with similar approaches had up-or-down votes. Each one of \nthem failed. The process worked. Amendments were debated and votes were \ncounted.\n  So now it is do it or we will shut down the government. I don't \nremember a lot of Americans voting for dirtier air or water they can't \ndrink or longer droughts for farmers but now they are saying the \ngovernment is going to be shut down if we don't handcuff the EPA.\n  We have been here before. In December 1995, one of the reasons that \nthe Federal Government shutdown was the Republican attempts to include \na ``. . . excessive number of anti-environmental riders.'' And here we \ngo again. The Budget Committee chairman, Senator Conrad, reports that \nlast night in the middle of the night, the other side put mountaintop \nmining riders on the table. What does that have to do with reducing the \ndeficit?\n  And that is just the start of this ideological excess. Planned \nParenthood, we are fighting over whether Planned Parenthood can get any \nmoney from the Federal Government for cancer screenings for low-income \nwomen.\n  We had that debate over here. We voted on the House budget to kill \nPlanned Parenthood. It lost. It lost overwhelmingly. Senate Republicans \nopposed it. So now the gang from the House say defund Planned \nParenthood or we shut down the government. Strip Planned Parenthood of \nmoney it uses to provide lifesaving, preventative care to millions of \nwomen each year or we shut down the government.\n  Is this about abortion? No. They want to prohibit Planned Parenthood \nfrom receiving any Federal funds, including Medicaid--a proposal that \nwould cut 1.4 million women off from their health care provider.\n  This isn't even good fiscal policy--the preventative care saves \ntaxpayers dollars in the long run. Every dollar ends up saving $3.74 of \nhealth-related costs to Federal and State governments.\n  We are talking about women like Jennifer, a woman from Boston who \ncredits Planned Parenthood with saving her life. She had little money \nand no doctor. She went to Planned Parenthood for a checkup, and the \ndoctors found a precancerous condition of the uterus. She says now, \n``Because of Planned Parenthood's early intervention, I was able to \nhave two children and a healthy life.'' But today, here we are--here is \nthe choice they are ramming down our throats: defund that care or shut \ndown the government.\n  Last year, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees did \ntheir job. However, in December 2010, the Republicans objected to even \nconsidering\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\nthis year's budget and forced us into this situation.\n  That is ideology that has nothing--nothing--to do with balancing the \nbudget.\n  So if a small ideological group shuts down the government over all \nthis, what happens? What happens?\n  Well, for all the talk here about jobs and the economy, you would \nthink somebody might be thinking hard about that, especially now that \nour economy is starting to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs \nevery month.\n  So just yesterday, one of our leading economists said: ``The economic \ndamage from a government shutdown would mount very quickly. And the \nlonger it drags on, the greater the odds of a renewed recession.''\n  Goldman Sachs analysts say a shutdown will cost the economy $8 \nbillion every week. The Business Roundtable, whose companies account \nfor $6 trillion in annual revenues, forecast increased sales and hiring \nby businesses over the next 6 months, but they say even a short \nshutdown would put that in jeopardy. ``I don't think any of the CEOs \nwould welcome a government shutdown,'' said Ivan Seidenberg. Even \nSpeaker Boehner says, ``if you shut the government down, it'll end up \ncosting more than you'll save.'' The Republican economist Mark Zandi, \nsays a shutdown would not only ``disrupt a wide range of government \noperations and significantly cut the output of government workers, but \nthe hit to confidence could be serious . . . it could easily undermine \nconfidence as questions grow about policymakers' ability to govern. \nThis would be fodder for a new recession.''\n  A new recession because ideologues continue to object to the \ncompromises necessary to pass a budget? But here we are hours away from \nshutting down the government over abortion.\n  And folks, that is the big danger--that the actions of these \nideologues will stop the recovery.\n  But it has a human face too.\n  Just yesterday I read an e-mail from a constituent of mine named Tim. \nHe lives in Norwood, MA, and he is a Federal employee at Homeland \nSecurity working in Boston. On March 26, he and his wife moved into \ntheir first home. Now, if the government shuts down, he will be \nfurloughed. He is worried that he won't be able to pay his mortgage and \nhe is terrified about the consequences this will have on his credit \nrating.\n  I have no idea whether Tim is a Democrat or Republican, but I know he \ndidn't vote in November to not be able to do his job or pay his \nmortgage.\n  But that is what he is worried about this morning. He is one of \n800,000 families that will not be able to go to work and do their jobs. \nI heard one of them asked yesterday about it and about all the talk \nthat after the shutdown she will get paid, and she said, ``Tell my two-\nyear-old he can eat retroactively.''\n  But why isn't the job getting done? Because of issues wholly \nunrelated to the deficit.\n  And what does it mean to the country?\n  Well, the last time we had a government shutdown, they told us that \nat the NIH the scientists doing the research on cancer and cures had to \ngo home. They couldn't work. The only person deemed essential was the \nguy who came in to feed the lab rats so they would still be alive when \nthe government came to its senses.\n  Did anyone vote last November for us to stop researching cures to \ndiseases? I don't remember that being a part of the tea party platform. \nBu here we are.\n  At the height of filing season, IRS processing of tax refunds for \nreturns could be suspended. So families who have been waiting for their \nrefund checks won't get them.\n  During the spring home-buying season, 15,000 homeowners could be \nprevented from getting a new home loan every week.\n  We talk about honoring our men and women in uniform and those who \nhave served our country, but we know that during the last shutdown more \nthan 400,000 veterans saw their disability, pension or educational \nbenefits delayed.\n  We talk about honoring our seniors, but more than 100,000 new Social \nSecurity claims were delayed in 1995.\n  We say we care about the disabled, but during the last shutdown \nservices to 1.2 million people with disabilities were interrupted.\n  And that is just the immediate consequences of a shutdown. But what \nabout the long term? What happens when the world watches a small group \nof ideologues making it impossible to pass a budget for 1 year? We are \npreaching democracy all over the world and we can't make our own work. \nOur economic competitors are going to take advantage of this \nopportunity to strengthen their economy at our expense.\n  Does it make businesses more likely to invest here, or go invest in \nChina and in Latin America where governments are racing ahead investing \nin infrastructure and energy to own the markets of the future? They are \ngoing to laugh all the way to the bank.\n  But instead here we are, about to shut down the government--and \nwilling to slam the brakes on the investments and the research and \ndevelopment we need to make so America doesn't fall behind other \ncountries. While we have these ideological fights, we eat America's \nseed corn today, even if it means going hungry tomorrow.\n  This is about ideology. This is the takeover of our national dialogue \nby people who actually want to shut down the government--for them, it \nis a goal not an unintended consequence.\n  Don't take my word for it. Just listen to them.\n  Representative Ron Paul of Texas said: ``I don't think it would hurt \none bit'': and that ``life would go on without the Federal \ngovernment.''\n  Representative Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia said the Republicans are \nsimply ``listening to the American people'' and doing what they want.\n  Now, I will grant you that Congress needs a ``jolt'' but it should \nnot be a jolt that causes a government shutdown. It should be a \n``jolt'' to do the job that we were elected to do.\n  There is a better way. We can balance our budget and we can grow our \neconomy to benefit everyone and we can do both at the same time. How do \nI know? Because many of us were there when we did it before. We tackled \na budget deficit and created jobs at the same time. And we didn't do it \nby cutting our budget to the bone.\n  In the 1990s we grew our way to a stronger economy under the Clinton \neconomic plan. We invested in the workforce, in research, in \ndevelopment, in new industries. As a result, we saw the longest \neconomic expansion in history, creating more than 22 million jobs and \ngenerating unprecedented wealth in America, with every income bracket \nrising. And working with Republicans, we came up with a budget \nframework that put our Nation on track to be debt free by 2012 for the \nfirst time since Andrew Jackson's administration. Of course, it didn't \nwork out quite that way, what with huge tax cuts, two wars and the \nworst economic downturn since the Great Depression in the 8 years that \ncame before these last 2 difficult and divisive years.\n\n  We can do it again. But it is going to take a serious dialogue within \nthe Congress about our fiscal situation, discretionary spending, \nentitlements, and revenues--a dialogue that is long overdue. We need to \nwork towards a long-term solution to reduce both our current budget \ndeficit and our staggering debt. We will need to reduce Federal \nspending and make appropriate changes to our entitlement programs to \nmeet the fiscal challenges facing our country.\n  But that is not what is being debated here today. That is not what \nthe House ideologues are doing. And it is not what the Senate is \nsupposed to be doing. I have been here 27 years. I know that the \nworld's greatest deliberative body can still be a decisive one. But we \nare not today.\n  Before we entered into this show-down with the clock ticking towards \na shut-down, Senator Inouye and I were going to be in Boston for the \ngroundbreaking of the Edward Kennedy Institute dedicated to the study \nof how to make the Senate work as an institution.\n  Ted Kennedy knew what the Senate could do when we made this place \nwork. He understood the differences of 100 Senators from States as \ndifferent as Alaska and Hawaii, California and South Carolina, Ohio and \nOregon. He embraced different accents and different world views even as \nhe was proud of his own. He became living, legislating proof that a \nmost fiercely independent, plain-talking, direct and determined \npartisan could resolve the hardest issues, staking out common\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\nground with those they disagreed with on almost everything else.\n  Ted knew that the historic breakthroughs in American politics have \nbeen brokered not by a mushy middle or by splitting the difference, but \nby people who had a pretty healthy sense of ideology. Ted Kennedy and \nOrrin Hatch were a powerful team precisely because they spent a lot of \ntime opposing each other. But he knew that they were opponents, never \nenemies; that they could be friends in life even as they were foes in \npolitics. And again and again, over and over, when this ultimate odd \ncouple found things they were willing to fight for together, arm in \narm, all of us in the Senate leaned in and listened--and followed them.\n  Make no mistake. Were Ted Kennedy serving in the Senate today he \nwould be down on the Senate floor--red faced, fists pounding the bully \npulpit--exhorting his colleagues that it is wrong to balance the budget \non the backs of working people, that Senators should stop the political \ngamesmanship, and that we need to get back to doing the business of the \nAmerican people.\n  But he would be doing something else, too. He would be working the \ncloakroom quietly pulling aside Democrats and Republicans. He would be \nreading the rhythms of the institution. He would be appealing to the \nbetter angels of the Senate's nature--because as deeply as he believed \nin the issues, Ted believed just as deeply in the capacity of his \ncolleagues, at critical times, to put country ahead of party.\n  Ted Kennedy would be proud of today's groundbreaking for the Kennedy \nInstitute for the Senate. But I know he would be insistent too that we \nhave to break new and common ground in the institution that is the U.S. \nSenate itself.\n  Generations of young Americans to come will come to the Kennedy \nInstitute and learn to understand what the U.S. Senate was intended to \nbe.\n  But 100 Senators don't need to wait that long. We can do what Ted \nKennedy and Bob Dole and so many other Senators of both parties used to \nknow how to do--which is find common ground and insist on common sense.\n  We don't have to shut down the government. We don't have to continue \nthe ideological bloodletting. We can do better than we are doing. The \nquestion is whether we are going to get back to work and ensure that \nthe great center of American politics holds once again. Our country \ndeserves that--and nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Massachusetts in \nsaying also we don't have more time on this. We all want more time. \nEach of us would like to spend more time on this important issue, but \nwe want to give everyone the chance to speak and this is why we have \nthe limitation.\n  I think it is important to put this whole issue in perspective. \nPeople are saying, Well, the clock is ticking and we are 12 hours or \nless away from having to shut the government down. Well, yes, the clock \nis ticking. But the clock that has been ticking year after year on the \nmounting debt and fiscal crisis that is going to take this country into \nbankruptcy if we don't do something about it. That clock is ticking a \nlot faster than the clock is ticking on this debate.\n  Let's put this debate into the perspective of the larger picture. In \nthe last 3 years we have added over $4 trillion to our debt--$4 \ntrillion plus in the last 3 years. This country is on an unsustainable \nspending binge. People throughout the year in 2010 expressed their \nviews about the egregious, reckless spending of this Congress, and they \nsent a new Congress here to do something about it.\n  Because the other party that was in control in 2010 didn't pass a \nbudget, didn't do anything about it when the time ran out on September \n30 at the end of the fiscal year--we are at this point today because we \nhave had to have these continuing extensions which we are trying to do \nsomething about, and I hope we can resolve this. I don't want a \nshutdown any more than anybody else does. But people have to put this \nin perspective. What we are dealing with here is a request put out by \nthe Republicans--because there is no request from the President of the \nUnited States and there has been no request from the other party as to \nwhat the package should be to deal with this--and that request requires \nand asks for a reduction of 1.6 percent of the total amount of spending \nthat is going to take place in 2011--1.6 percent.\n  If you are the head of a family or an individual making $50,000 a \nyear and you find out you are running yourself into bankruptcy, that \namount you would have to come up with to save, to start the process of \ngetting your financial situation back in order is $800. If you are \nmaking $100,000 a year, what we are asking for is a $1,600 equivalent \ncut in the spending. If you are a business making $1 million a year and \nthe boss comes and says we are spending way more than we take in in our \nrevenues and this company is going to go bust and everybody is going to \nget released from employment as a result of that unless we make a start \nin moving forward in dealing with our fiscal crisis, and we are going \nto start by cutting $16,000 out of the $1 million, that is the \nequivalent of what we are doing here. Yet, we are talking as if this is \ndoomsday, this is cataclysmic: These are the greatest cuts in the \nhistory of the Senate.\n  We have a timebomb, a debt bomb, ticking away out there that is going \nto take the country down into second tier or third tier status, at \nbest, or we are going to have the bond markets do it for us if we don't \nstart. This isn't just a Republican plea. Democrats, the President's \nown commission, headed by Erskine Bowles, who was the President's Chief \nof Staff, has said there has been no more predictable collapse facing \nAmerica than this one and we need to do something about it now.\n  What we are trying to do about it now is simply do something that \nwasn't done for 2011, for the 2011 budget, with a modest 1.6-percent \ncut so we can move to what we need to do, and what we need to do is \naddress the whole picture. As the Senator from Massachusetts said, we \nhave to deal with more than this 12 percent of the discretionary \nspending for 2011.\n  We have to put mandatory spending on the table, defense spending on \nthe table; we have to look at tax reform as a way to grow our economy. \nThere are a whole range of things we have to do. We have one plan in \nplace that has been put there for us to at least begin to start the \ndebate on what we need to do--get this thing out of the way so we can \nstart that debate, and that is the Republican plan put forward by House \nMember Paul Ryan, the head of the House Budget Committee. That is the \ncomprehensive plan we ought to be working on. We can't get to that plan \nbecause we are dealing with this 1.6-percent fix to the problem that \nexists for 2011. It is 2012 and 10 years beyond that needs to be \naddressed and needs to be addressed now.\n  This country is facing as serious a debt crisis as we have ever had. \nLeading economists, Republicans and Democrats, liberals and \nconservatives, those from Harvard and those from Stanford and every \ncollege in between and every institution and entity that has studied \nthis problem, say we have to do something and we have to do it now or \nit is going to be done for us, and the results of that will be a lot \nworse than if we start to address it now.\n  Governors and heads of businesses and heads of families all across \nAmerica know exactly what we are talking about because they have \nalready had to make these tough decisions. They are already \nimplementing what is necessary to get their fiscal house back in order. \nIt is not just Republican Governors; it is Republican and Democratic \nGovernors. Why aren't we listening to Andrew Cuomo? Why aren't we \nlistening to Jerry Brown? Why aren't we listening to Mitch Daniels and \nother Governors, including Governor Walker from Wisconsin and Governor \nKasich from Ohio? Why are we not looking at what they are doing? At \nleast they are stepping up and doing it.\n  Here we are, arguing over the extreme nature of a 1.6-percent \nreduction out of a $3.7 trillion budget. Revenues are coming in at $2.2 \nbillion for a $1.5 trillion deficit and we are talking about a 1.6-\npercent cut out of all that, as if this is doomsday if we don't raise--\neven come halfway, or a little more than halfway to this.\n  Putting this in perspective I think is necessary for us. We have all \nthe focus on this little, small grass fire happening over here when \nthere is a five alarmer across the street. That is the\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\nfiscal house of America. Are we doing this because we are green \neyeshade people and we don't like the way government functions and we \nwant to take things away from people? No. We are doing this to save \nthis country--to save the benefits available to those who are under \nMedicare, to save the benefits available to those under Medicaid, and \nother provisions. We are trying to keep these programs from collapsing \nand we are trying to keep this country's fiscal house from collapsing \nor burning up. Instead of fighting a little grass fire, we have a five \nalarmer over here and we have a little truck with a hose trying to put \nout that grass fire. Let us reconcile this and pass this now so we can \nget to the issue we have to get to.\n  This whole thing about riders and about the largest tax cut in \nAmerican history is a pebble in a pond of what is necessary for us to \ngo forward and deal with the crisis that is before us. It is going to \nrest on all of our shoulders. It is going to reflect on all of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, if we stand here \nand fiddle while our fiscal house burns to the ground and collapses.\n  As I said, one way or another, this will happen. It may happen sooner \nor later. If you listen to Erskine Bowles and a former colleague, \nSenator Simpson, and to the President's own commission, and if you \nlisten to any analyst who has looked at this, they say it is totally \nunsustainable. If you don't do it and start the process, the bond \nmarket and the interest rates will do it for you. It will fall on all \nof us for not stepping up to the plate and getting it done.\n  We have 11 hours to get this done. Let's pass this now and make the \ndecision to go forward and let our yeas and nays be recorded. Let the \nAmerican people decide which side they want to be on on this particular \nissue.\n  I think, given the results of the last election and the awareness of \nthe American people, clearly they have come to the conclusion that the \ngovernment is too big, it is growing too fast, it is spending too much \nmoney--money it doesn't have--and it is borrowing money at a rate that \nis putting us into severe jeopardy in terms of our creditors and what \ntheir demands will be in the future. When 40 cents of every dollar is \nborrowed, you cannot continue on that course without dire consequences.\n  I believe the challenge before us today is to wrap up this \nnegotiation and wrap up the issue that deals with the remaining months \nof 2011 so that we can immediately begin--and whether it means \ncanceling the recess or whatever, I am more than happy to participate \nin that--to work on the necessary decisions and changes and debate that \nhave to take place regarding our long-term future. If we fail to do \nthat, we are going to reap the negative consequences.\n  My time is about to expire. I simply plead with my colleagues, let's \nget past this little nothing of a skirmish here and keep this \ngovernment functioning and get to work on what we have to do. We hope \nto have competing plans, but if not, let's go forward with the Ryan \nplan and get a yea or nay on it and let the American people decide \nwhether it is the right way to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish I could say I was rising today to \njust debate some of the normal issues we talk about. Like most of my \ncolleagues, probably, I rise today a bit embarrassed--not a bit but \nreally embarrassed that we are here under these circumstances.\n  People across Virginia cannot understand why we can't get this done. \nI had the honor of serving as the Governor of Virginia. I am a \nDemocrat, and I had a two-to-one Republican legislature. We got things \ndone. We compromised. We found that common ground that now seems to be \nviewed as a bad place to be.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Indiana that whatever \nnumber we agree on today, that doesn't take us very far when you have a \n$1.6 trillion deficit and a $14 trillion debt. If this debate is \nshowing anything, it is that there is not going to be a way to get \nthere unless we can frame this in a bipartisan way. I agree with the \nSenator from Indiana that we ought to take the framework of the \nSimpson-Bowles plan and put it forward. There are a group of Democrats \nand Republicans who are trying to do that, and a lot of other Members \nwould like to be part of that as well.\n  We ought to take one lesson from this debate--that we are not going \nto solve the bigger problem unless we can start on a bipartisan basis. \nWe have heard this morning back-and-forth about what is holding this \nup. I am not in the negotiating room. I wish I were. I don't know what \nis holding it up. I know, as somebody who has followed this debate \npretty closely, that for the weeks of this discussion, it seems to have \nbeen focused on, can we at least take some small step toward attacking \nthat deficit and cutting spending.\n  It seems to me from every bit of the press reports I have read--I \nwould like to say I have an insider's view, and many of the Senators \nare trying to figure out what is going on, but from all the press \nreports, it seems that, until the last day or two, this has been about \ncuts, and there has actually been agreement on the number and size of \nthis first step of cuts. But now we have these other issues. I think, \nas some of my colleagues have said, there will be time to debate those \nissues, but why in the heck would we roll the dice with not just \n800,000 Federal employees but millions of Americans who rely on some \nlevel of continuity to have these extra social issue divisions right \nnow?\n  I heard some of my colleagues say earlier that, well, we have to shut \nit down for a weekend, and that won't be too much of a problem. Well, \nyou don't have to worry about the Federal employees.\n  Lord knows, anybody who puts a red herring--I appreciate Senators \nHutchison and Casey making sure our troops are going to get paid. I am \nproud of that. Regardless, I think Senators and Congressmen should not \nbe paid, either, if we shut down, and I promise not to take any salary \nif we are shut down. But just even for a weekend, what do you tell the \nmotel owners, the restaurant workers, the private sector folks who are \nrelying this weekend on people coming to Washington to see the cherry \nblossoms? You may say that is small ball, but that is people's lives--\nnot Federal workers but the private sector workers. What about the \ndefense contractor who says that if we shut this down, he is going to \nlay off 70 folks starting next week? What about the shipbuilder in \nNorfolk who is living paycheck to paycheck and says they don't know \nwhether they are going to see private sector dollars from their private \nsector employment, whether they are going to get paid or not? What do \nyou say to our soldiers who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan to try \nto spread democratic government if the greatest democracy in the world \nis going to shut down not over trillions of dollars' worth of \ndifferences but over some issue that may or may not have been \nintroduced at the eleventh hour? I don't get it.\n  The notion somehow that this will send a good signal of fiscal \ndiscipline--I am proud, as my friend the Senator from Tennessee said, \nthat we have spent more time in business careers than we have in our \npolitical lives. But what business hates the most is uncertainty. The \nmarkets hate uncertainty the most.\n  Portugal, yesterday or the day before, said they need a bailout from \nthe European Central Bank. The notion that we are out of the woods in \nterms of a macrofinancial crisis is not true. The situation in Europe \nis very uncertain. The situation in the Middle East is obviously very \nuncertain. It would be the height of irresponsibility if we were to \nkind of once again rock the bond markets with the fact that the \nAmerican Government would shut down over some extraneous issue. I don't \nget it.\n  The economists whom we have talked to have said that you can see up \nto a .2 percent decline in economic growth if we even shut down for a \nfew hours. Frankly, it would end up costing us more than we save \nbecause shutting down operations and starting up operations, as any \nbusiness leader or any government person who actually runs something \nknows, costs more money. People may say two-tenths of 1 percent, and we \nstruggle for half a percent of growth here and there with all of these \npolicies we try to promote--that is billions and hundreds of billions \nof dollars to our economy.\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\n  Just as we started to see a little bit of good news with the job \nnumbers last month, just as we started to see the beginnings of an \neconomic recovery, are we going to show that we can't even continue to \noperate the government for the next 6 months, and are we going to shut \nit down, at least based on press reports, on extraneous issues that \ndon't have to do with deficit reduction?\n  If we can't get through this challenge, what happens when we move \nfrom the small-ball issues to the issues Senator Coats and my \ncolleagues and friends, Senators Carper and Corker, all want to be part \nof--and the Presiding Officer--and how will we take on that $14 \ntrillion debt, to which we add $4 billion every day that we fail to \nact, if we can't solve this problem in a way that focuses on making the \ncuts and letting the government continue to operate, not simply for the \nsake of 800,000 Federal workers but for countless millions in the \nprivate sector who depend upon that certainty, and move on to the \nquestion of how we find, I believe, the bipartisan solution that I hope \nand pray is at least around the framework of the Simpson-Bowles \napproach, which puts everything on the table--revenues and cuts--and \nrecognize that we need to put the country back on the path of economic \nprosperity.\n  I hope the negotiators realize this is bigger than the small issues--\nbigger than 73, 78, or whatever number they finally determine. We will \nsend a signal by our actions today whether we are willing to then move \nforward to take on the much bigger issue, which is where we have to \nstart.\n  I will close with this. If there is anything we have learned from \nthis effort, it is that if we start with guns ablazing at each other, \nwe are not going to be able to take on the real issue that confronts \nus--the national security crisis that Chairman Mullen has said is the \nsingle biggest threat to our long-term economic stability based upon \nthe rising debt.\n  I yield the floor and hope and pray we will come to a solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if the Chair will please let me know when \nthere is a minute left, I would appreciate it.\n  I rise to speak about the current issue. I am always glad to speak \nafter my friend from Virginia, whom I have enjoyed working with on so \nmany issues. I appreciate the work he is doing now to try to deal with \nthe bigger issue we have to deal with.\n  I will not waste a lot of emotion or say things that might--look, we \nare involved in a powder puff right now. We are dealing with a small \namount of dollars. We add $4.1 billion a day to the deficit--$4.1 \nbillion a day. So probably, with the negotiations we are involved in \ntoday, maybe we are separated by 1 day of deficit spending.\n  I know there has been a lot of talk about what might happen with the \ngovernment shutdown. I don't believe that is going to happen. I believe \nthat when we come in on Monday morning, an agreement will have been \nreached. I am not going to waste time on the Senate floor talking about \nall the bad that might happen in this country because I cannot believe \nthat, over the small ball we are dealing with right now, we are going \nto have a government shutdown. I think we will resolve this over the \nnext few hours or maybe sometime over the weekend possibly. Maybe there \nwill be a minor disruption this weekend. I have faith that this will be \nworked out.\n  What I want to spend time talking about is the fact that we do have a \ncrisis that is looming. I don't think it is this weekend, and I don't \nthink it is over a continuing resolution that goes for the rest of this \nyear. I hope we are actually able to move beyond majoring in the \nminors, which is what is happening now, to majoring in the majors; that \nis, talking about trillions of dollars in less expenditures, not \nbillions of dollars. Each day that goes by, with the $1.5 trillion \ndeficit we have, we are spending $4.1 billion that we don't have.\n  I am convinced that negotiators on both sides of the aisle very soon \nwill work out their differences, and when Monday morning rolls along, \nthe government will be operating.\n  To me, the big picture is this: We have a debt ceiling vote that I \nthink will be coming up sometime between Memorial Day weekend and the \nJuly Fourth recess. To me, that is the opportunity we have to really do \nsomething great for our country.\n  I know Senator Warner alluded to the Gang of 6. I know there are a \nnumber of people on both sides of the aisle who are working toward a \nlong-term solution.\n  Claire McCaskill and I have offered the Cap Act, which is gaining \nmomentum and has a number of Republican cosponsors. We picked up \nanother Democratic cosponsor yesterday. It is very simple. It would \nkeep us from doing the kind of thing that is happening right now.\n  One of the things that is most fascinating is today--and I know you \njust came from State government, Mr. President--today we are dealing \nwith last year's business. The thing that is most frustrating for those \nof us who come from the business world or who come from State \ngovernment or who have been a mayor, in this body, we never know where \nwe are going. We are always debating issues that should have been \nresolved a long time ago.\n  What we need to do in this body for this country is to figure out \nwhere we are going over the longer haul and then both sides of the \naisle need to sit down together and figure out how we get there. We \nneed to somehow create a fiscal straitjacket where we know--we know we \nare at an all-time high with spending today relative to our economic \noutput. We had the same thing back in 1945 and, candidly, even in the \neighties. We got up to levels that were higher than they should have \nbeen. We have the ability to get back to the norm. We know that. We \nhave to make some tough decisions to do that.\n  The CAP Act is a 10-page bill. Basically, it says we will go from \nwhere we are today in spending over a 10-year period to our 40-year \nhistorical average of 20.6 percent of our GDP. There are a lot of \npeople in this body--and I am not going to point fingers--who use the \nword ``extreme.'' There is nothing extreme about this. It is common \nsense. It puts everything on the table.\n  What is fascinating to me is that today we are debating minor amounts \nof cuts in discretionary spending. Everybody in this body knows that if \nwe cut all discretionary spending--discretionary spending, by the way, \nincludes defense--if we cut all discretionary spending, including \ndefense, we still could not balance our budget. What we need to do as a \nbody is look at everything--all the entitlements, all the mandatory \nspending, and we need to cap Federal spending relative to our economy \nand take it down to the 40-year average over the next 10 years.\n  I think everybody in this body is aware that would save our country \nper projected policy $7.6 trillion. By the way, I think it would force \nus as a body to have the discipline to take up many of the issues on \nwhich the gang of six is working. We already had Paul Ryan from the \nHouse show us that it can be done, and there are people who criticize \nthat, and that is fine. There are multiple ways of solving this \nproblem.\n  The problem we have is politicians in Washington do everything they \ncan to avoid making a tough decision. Back home, what we want to do is \nget the pain out of the way. Let's make the tough decisions so we can \nhave blue sky in front of us. Here everybody wants to wait until the \nnext election and hopefully move beyond their own election to deal with \nthe tough issues with which we have to deal. That is just the way this \nbody is.\n  It is amazing, here we are in April dealing with last year's \nbusiness. Again, both sides are involved in that. I am not pointing \nfingers. But if we had a plan that we adopted, a statutory bill where \nwe agreed we were going to go from where we are to where we need to be, \nour 40-year average--not extreme, over a 10-year period--it would force \nus to sit down and in a bipartisan way look at the big picture.\n  Everybody knows cutting discretionary spending is small ball. Let me \nsay, that is powder puff. It is powder puff. We have our Nation at \nstake, and we are sitting here yelling at each other, saying things we \nshould not be saying to each other that take us nowhere over powder \npuff. It takes us no place. I feel as though here our Nation is getting \nready to have a fiscal crisis at some point--in a year or two--and we \nare all here trying to score points with each other over something that \nat\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\nthe end of the day and in the scope of things are important, certainly, \nbut there is no question that today we are majoring in the minors.\n  I hope we can get by this and move beyond this without creating even \nfurther divides between the two sides and people saying silly things \nabout who is to blame and who is not to blame. It is silly. It is \nbeneath us. The American people have to be watching us with \nembarrassment. I am embarrassed.\n  This is the most dysfunctional place I have ever been a part of in my \nlife because, again, we never know where we are going. It is a \nprivilege to serve, do not get me wrong. It is a privilege to represent \nand get involved, but it is dysfunctional because we major in the \nminors. We can cut all the discretionary spending and not get where we \nneed to go.\n  Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, a State very different from \nTennessee, agreed that we have to deal with mandatory spending. We have \nto deal with entitlements. We want those programs to exist for our \nseniors down the road. We want them to exist for these pages, and we \nknow on today's course, it cannot happen. We know without dealing with \nthem, we cannot solve our country's fiscal issues.\n  Let's move beyond this episode that is beneath us, that is silly, \nthat is small ball, that is powder puff. Let's move beyond this over \nthis weekend and reach an agreement. The cuts we are making are the \nbiggest cuts that have been made, and I applaud people on both sides of \nthe aisle who are trying to get us there. No doubt it will pass through \nthe budget for a decade. It could be $300 billion or $400 billion in \nsavings. That is great. But we all know we need to be dealing with $7 \ntrillion or $8 trillion over that decade. If we do not do that, we know \nthat our country's fiscal future is in great jeopardy, and we lose in \nthat the ability to display American exceptionalism that all of us want \nto see us do.\n  I hope we will stop talking about Republicans and Democrats. \nCandidly, I hope we will talk about the future or something else \nbecause this debate is almost beneath us.\n  I see my time is up.\n  I yield the floor to my great friend from Delaware who has been a \nsensible advocate on so many issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, first, I say a special thanks to Senator \nCorker, not just for what he said about the issues we are facing on the \npath forward but the nice words he said about his friend from Delaware. \nIt is a pleasure to serve with him. I thank him for introducing the \nconcept of tele-townhall meetings. We do that a lot in Delaware. I \nlearned that from him.\n  The President has been likening the squabble going on here to a \nfamily squabble between a husband and wife. He said what husbands and \nwives usually do is figure out their differences, find middle ground, \ncompromise, and work them out.\n  One of the things I love to do when I go up and down my State is to \ntalk with people who have been married a long time--I am sure this \nhappens to the Presiding Officer--50 years, 60 years, 70 years. I like \nto ask them what is the key to being married 50, 60, 70 years. I get \nsome funny answers and some great answers as well. I am sure the \nPresiding Officer does too.\n  One of my favorite answers is a couple said to me: Two Cs.\n  I said: What is that?\n  They said: Communicate and compromise.\n  There is a little theme going on here with a former Governor of \nVirginia, Senator Warner, a former mayor of Chattanooga, Senator \nCorker, and a former Governor of Delaware. I want to continue with that \ntheme.\n  I go home at night to Delaware. I take the train home, and I come \nback the next morning. This morning, I was walking on the platform to \ncatch my train. One person said to me: You all are acting like a State \nlegislature in the Senate.\n  I said: No, that is not the way we act in Dover, DE. When I was \nGovernor, we had a Democratic senate, as we have here, we had a \nRepublican house, as we have here, and we had a Democratic Governor for \nthose 8 years. Yet we managed to work out our differences, to \ncommunicate and compromise and to be able to balance our budget 8 years \nin a row, cutting taxes 7 out of those 8 years, adding tens of \nthousands of jobs, which was no mean feat in our State, and to get \nourselves a triple A credit rating for the first time in the history of \nour State. That is what you can do when you communicate and compromise \nin good faith.\n  At the end of these negotiations--I think largely taken in good \nfaith. I have a lot of respect certainly for our own leaders and a \nhealthy respect for the Speaker of the House, with whom I served \nbriefly. I think he is an honorable person and a guy who tries to do \nwhat is right.\n  The President said--and I heard this from pretty good sources--the \nPresident said to the Speaker of the House: We will take your number. \nWe will agree on the spending cuts. We may think it is a little too \nmuch focus on domestic discretionary spending, not enough on defense, \nnot anything on entitlements, nothing on the revenue side. It is not a \nbalanced package, but we will take your number. This ended up not so \nmuch a discussion over how we are going to further reduce spending in \nthis fiscal year. The discussion is over things I think we addressed \nalready in this body this week on whether the Environmental Protection \nAgency should be allowed to comply with the Clean Air Act, as ordered \nby the Supreme Court, to reduce pollution or are we going to tie their \nhands with some kind of a special rider on what should be a continuing \nresolution to fund the government?\n  We have had four bites out of the apple this week. None of the \namendments to tie the hands of EPA and their ability to enforce the \nClean Air Act has been adopted. What we are now trying to do with our \nfriends in the other body is somehow put in the legislation as a rider \nlanguage that would fly in the face of what we already decided here.\n  A second point. As a former Governor, I was active in the National \nGovernors Association. One issue I worked hard on with George Voinovich \nfrom Ohio when he was Governor was legislation that said we do not like \nFederal mandates. States do not like Federal mandates that say you have \nto spend money on something or you cannot spend money on something or \nyou have to raise revenues this way or raise them in that way. We did \nnot like that.\n  Congress actually passed and President Clinton signed legislation on \nunfunded mandates. We do not do it nearly as much as we used to. One of \nthe riders is to tell the District of Columbia what they can and cannot \ndo with their money--not with Federal money but what they can and \ncannot do with their money. In my mind it is a violation of the \nunfunded mandate law, certainly in spirit if not in truth.\n  One of the issues we appear to be divided on is whether Federal money \nshould be used for family planning. I think we all agree we should work \ntoward having fewer abortions. I think almost everybody agrees we would \nlike to have fewer abortions. One way to make sure we have more \nabortions is to reduce the money set aside for family planning. It is \ncounterintuitive. If you want fewer abortions, cut funding for family \nplanning. That makes no sense to me. I hope we will walk away from \nmaking that bad decision.\n  Again, I go back to the comments of our friends from Virginia and \nTennessee who preceded me. This is a speed bump ahead of us. We are \ntalking about how to come up with $4 billion, $5 billion, $6 billion in \nsavings for the rest of this fiscal year. How about when we are looking \nfor $4 trillion of savings over the next 10 years? That is the tough \nnegotiation. It all has to be on the table. It cannot just be \ndiscretionary spending on the domestic side. We can eliminate it \nentirely, but we will still have a big budget deficit. Defense has to \nbe on the table. Last year, there were $402 billion in cost overruns on \nmajor weapons systems. That is up $42 billion from 10 years ago. \nDefense and entitlements have to be on the table. Revenues have to be \non the table.\n  We have been given a roadmap--not a perfect roadmap, but a roadmap--\nby the deficit commission, chaired by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson.\n  The last thing I want to say is, coming down on the train today, I \nread the business section of the New York Times. There is actually some \npretty\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\ninteresting stuff in there. One of the things they reported on was the \nretail numbers for last month. Most analysts thought they would be \ndown, but they are up.\n  I was at an auto dealership this past weekend in Milford, DE, talking \nabout car sales. They are not flat. They are up. It was not just that \ndealership but throughout my State and the Nation. Two years ago, 9 \nmillion trucks and vans; last year, up to 11 million; next year, 13 \nmillion. Credit is available again and things are moving in the right \ndirection.\n  Every Thursday, as the Presiding Officer knows, we have a number from \nthe Department of Labor. It is new unemployment filings, how many \npeople have filed a new claim for unemployment. We get it every \nThursday. If we go back to the end of 2008, I think the top number in 1 \nweek was 660,000 filings, people filing for unemployment, new claims at \nthe end of 2008. Yesterday, for last week, we are down to 380,000 to \n390,000. We saw jobs numbers created, new jobs for March, 220,000 \nprivate-sector jobs being created. We are going the right way.\n  Finally, the economic recovery is beginning and we need to strengthen \nit. One of the best ways to undermine it--one of the worst things we \ncan do--is to add uncertainty, add unpredictability. I am not sure who \nsaid this. Maybe it was John Ensign who said this before. One of the \nthings businesses need and want, that markets need and want is \ncertainty and predictability.\n  One of the reasons big companies are sitting on the sidelines--a \nbunch of them still are--and not hiring people, even though they are \nsitting on cash--is unpredictability. What are we going to do with the \nbudget, not just short-term runup, but for the 10-year plan, the $3 \ntrillion, $4 trillion, $5 trillion in savings? What is the Supreme \nCourt going to do with health care? Are they going to throw it out or \nfix it and make it even better? What are we going to do about energy \npolicy? What are we going to do about tax policy? What are we going to \ndo about transportation policy? All those are uncertainties.\n  We can begin to resolve the budgetary uncertainty by agreeing on a \nreasonable spending reduction plan for the balance of this fiscal year \nand go to work on the much tougher problem, and that is how to take $4 \ntrillion out of our debt in the years to come.\n  Last thing I want to say is that a couple of us have been working on \nthis in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. What \nwe are beginning to do is to use our committee's jurisdiction to look \ninto every nook and cranny of this government to ask this question: How \ndo we get better results for less money? How do we get better results \nin domestic spending, how do we get better results in defense spending, \nand how do we get better results for less money in entitlement \nprograms? And frankly, with the tax expenditures as well. How do we get \nbetter results?\n  I call it getting rid of a culture of spendthrift and replacing it \nwith a culture of thrift. Above and beyond all the other stuff we are \ndoing, we need to do that as well. Because everything I do, I know I \ncan do better. I think the same is true of all of us. Everything we do, \nwe can do better, and the same is true of Federal programs. The \nquestion we have to ask as we look to every one, as we look in every \nnook and cranny of the Federal Government, is to ask this question: Can \nwe get better results for less money or at least better results for the \nsame amount of money or not much more money? For a lot of them, the \nanswer is: Yes, we can. For us, the challenge is to do that.\n  With that being said, I yield back my time. I see my friend from \nNevada is here, and I am sure he is anxious to agree with everything I \nhave said, and I welcome that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I say hello to my good friend from \nDelaware. He made some very good comments. I want to follow up and talk \nabout this debate we are having.\n  The Senator from Tennessee, Senator Corker, talked about the need to \nforget about whether you are a Republican or a Democrat and think about \nwhat is best for the country, and that is what we should be doing right \nnow.\n  People around the country understand we have a serious debt problem. \nSpending has been run up under Republicans and Democrats. People can \nblame whichever party they want, but the reality is we now have a $14 \ntrillion national debt. This year alone, $1.6 trillion is how much more \nwe are going to spend than we take in. That is 40 cents, or a little \nover 40 cents, out of every dollar we are spending this year we are \nborrowing from countries like China. That is such a dangerous thing to \ndo, because we are now dependent on other countries and our economy is \non very shaky ground. Everyone in this body understands this is \ncompletely unsustainable.\n  Let's look at the path the President has set us on as far as his \nbudget is concerned. If we took up his budget, this year alone we will \nspend about $250 billion in interest on our national debt. That is kind \nof like having a credit card and you are spending $250 billion in \ninterest on that credit card. If we follow the President's plan over \nthe next 10 years, that $250 billion will go to almost $900 billion a \nyear. That is more than Social Security, more than Medicare, and more \nthan national defense. That is why this is completely unsustainable.\n  So now we are in a debate over a few billion dollars compared to \ntrillions of dollars? It is a drop in the bucket. That is why I believe \nit is important for both sides to get this behind us so we can focus on \nthe much larger issues.\n  I have a 100-percent pro-life voting record. I believe very strongly \nthat life is precious; that God created each of us in his image, and \nthat life should be protected. But we have to face reality. The \nDemocrats are in control of the Senate and in control of the White \nHouse. There is no way they are going to allow Planned Parenthood, \nwhich is the largest abortion provider in the United States--and I \ndisagree with what they do--the Democrats will never allow us to defund \nPlanned Parenthood while they are in charge. So we have to look at what \nwe can do. What is achievable?\n  Right now, I think one of the biggest moral issues we face in this \ncountry is the debt. What we are doing to our children and \ngrandchildren is handing them a country they cannot afford. The taxes \nwill have to be too high. We could default on our debt and end in a \ndepression which is worse than the Great Depression simply because this \nbody, the body on the other side of the Capitol, and the White House \nhave spent too much money for too long. We have spent money we do not \nhave.\n  Next year's budget and the debt ceiling are much bigger issues than \nwe are dealing with here. We don't need to shut down the government. We \njust need to sit down, make the compromises necessary so we can move \nthis process forward and get to the much larger issues on spending and \ndebt.\n  We have seen in the news that Portugal, Greece, and Ireland have had \nserious problems. They have actually had their debt downgraded to \nalmost junk status. One of the countries is actually considered junk \nbond status. The others have now had their bonds seriously downgraded. \nWhat does that mean? That means they are paying higher interest rates.\n  Yesterday, the EU raised their interest rates. The European Union \nraised their interest rates because of fears of inflation. Here in the \nUnited States, our Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates low. But \nwe know inflation is coming, and eventually they are going to have to \nraise interest rates because of inflation and overspending by the \nUnited States. What does a rise in interest rates mean to the average \nAmerican? It means that the home mortgage is going to go up.\n  Remember, a lot of Americans have these adjustable rate mortgages. So \nthe next time they refinance those mortgages, their payments will be \nhigher. They are already having trouble meeting these payments.\n  What does that mean for job creation? The small business owner who \nwants to get a loan will have to pay higher interest rates. That \naffects the cost of capital and whether they may be able to even start \na business in the first place. It will hurt job creation right in the \nmiddle of this very little, very delicate bit of job recovery that we \nare having in the United States.\n  This spending and the debt is not some esoteric argument. It is real \nand it affects real people's lives. It isn't\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\nsomething we can put off for another 3, 4, 5 years. We must deal with \nit now. We know that entitlements are the biggest part of the budget. \nYes, discretionary is important. We have to deal with discretionary and \nwe have to deal with defense. We overspend in defense in so many \nwasteful programs, but the big issue is going to be entitlement \nspending.\n  Congressman Ryan put out a very bold budget the other day--the first \nperson to come forward with a bold proposal to deal with entitlement \nspending in this country. The President's debt commission put out a \nproposal, but the President, unfortunately, ignored his own debt \ncommission and didn't put any of their recommendations in his budget. \nBut both Republicans and Democrats are going to have to deal with this \nspending problem--this spending binge we have been on--otherwise we are \nnot going to have the same United States of America we have all been \nenjoying our entire lives. We are literally going to become an economy \nthat cannot exist the way we exist today because we cannot afford it. \nOur debt will literally collapse the economy of the United States.\n  A recent study came out, done by two incredible economists named \nRogoff and Reinhart. These are viewed by both sides of the aisle as \nwell-respected studies. They studied sovereign debt over the last 200 \nyears of about 64 countries. What they found is any time the debt \nreaches 90 percent of the economy, or 90 percent of the GDP, it causes \na net decrease of about 30 percent of economic growth going forward.\n  Those are numbers. But what does it mean? It means a loss of jobs. In \nthe United States, we have over a million jobs that will be lost, that \nwould otherwise be created. So this is real stuff. Where are we in the \nUnited States? Currently, we are about 94 percent of GDP. So we are \nalready there, and it is going to get worse and worse.\n  That is why this debate we are having over spending is so critical, \nand critical that we get it under control. We need to forget about \nwhich party is going to have a political advantage. I am one of those \nSenators--and there are quite a few of us--who is not running for \nreelection. Everybody in this body needs to forget about whether they \nget reelected and do what is right for the country. It is so critical \nright now that we put our country first.\n  House Republicans have sent over a proposal that would do a couple of \nthings. One, it would fund the troops. Let's not let our military come \nto work and not get paid. That would be ridiculous. Let's at least fund \nthe troops and pass this 1-week spending proposal that would fund the \ngovernment. It does cut $12 billion out. The only significant rider in \nthere is the DC abortion rider that says DC can have funds to provide \nabortions. This is something that was in law and that President Obama \nsigned, in a bill that many Democrats on the other side have signed, so \nit should not be that controversial.\n  In the meantime, since we have agreed on the spending number, we can \nwork out some of these other controversial things in the next week. I \nbelieve that is the right thing to do to keep the government open, so \npeople can continue to get their paychecks, so people can continue to \nvisit national parks, and on and on and on. I think we all know the \nproblems if the government shuts down.\n  I think it is critical that we start doing what is right for the \ncountry instead of what is right for somebody's reelection. Let's sit \ndown and make the serious and tough choices so we can put this country \non the right path.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2302-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding we are now in \nmorning business. I ask if there is a time constraint when making \nspeeches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators are limited, under morning business, \nto 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. We are facing a moment in \nthe issue that all Americans are looking at and wondering: What is \nhappening here? What is going to come about? What are we going to do?\n  But I wish to remind everyone, in 1773, a tea party was held in \nBoston Harbor. It was to protest a yoke of oppression that hobbled the \nstart of freedom in our new Nation and that new Americans wanted \nremoved. Those here then wanted the liberty to choose their own customs \nand their way of life.\n  While that was 238 years ago, we again struggle to keep a fringe \ngroup from taking away the rights of a majority of American citizens \nwho treasure choices they are free to make in our democracy. Although \nthese attacks are marked in the cloak of fiscal responsibility, it is \nvery clear that this group, unlike our forebears, is determined to \nrestrict the freedoms most Americans choose to protect.\n  So while we are not latter-day Paul Reveres, we sound the alarm for \nthe American people to beware. I come to the floor to warn every parent \nand grandparent to beware for the well-being of your loved ones. If you \nwant your children and your grandchildren to have the best health care \nAmerican research can produce, beware.\n  If your chest swells with pride when your 2-year-old repeats numbers \nor words learned at a Federal Head Start schoolhouse, beware.\n  If your child suffers when toxic air overwhelms them and they are \ngasping for a breath of fresh air, beware. Look at your family, and if \nyou have a son or a daughter anxious, ready, and able to go to college \nand you cannot afford to help, beware.\n  If you are a woman dependent on Planned Parenthood, where every year \nwomen receive tests for breast or cervical cancer that could endanger \ntheir health and maybe their lives, beware.\n  If you are a retiree who believes Medicare is freely available to \nhelp you live longer or function better, beware. Watch out. Tea party \nRepublicans have seized control of the House of Representatives and \nwill use their power to eliminate current services to children, adults, \nand retirees from the government, as promised.\n  They are continuing to brew a toxic tea, a sleight of hand trick to \npush pain on America's most vulnerable citizens, as we look at this \nplacard: ``House GOP Brewing a Toxic Tea for Americans.''\n  Across our country, millions are worried sick about losing jobs, \nlosing homes, and losing an established way of life for their \nchildren's futures. What do the tea party Republicans propose? Cut \ntheir programs to protect the wealth of the richest among us. But tea \nparty Republicans do not want to solve problems. Instead, they are \ntrying to use the budget process to push an extreme ideology that they \nbelieve is the only way others should live their lives. Do it their way \nor no way.\n  They are willing to shut down the government to prove a point, to \nchange the condition we have operated so well under for many years. \nThey are willing to sacrifice America's financial standing to impose \ntheir extreme views on millions who do not agree with these radical \nextremists.\n  They refuse to step up, compromise, and move ahead, so America can \ncontinue leading the world as it has been. The President and the Senate \nDemocrats have come to the negotiating table with a responsible plan \nthat protects our country's fragile economy, economic recovery, and \ninvests in our future.\n  But the toxic tea Republicans in the House would rather recklessly \nshut down the government than budge off their foul scheme. Last week, \nthey stood outside the Capitol and chanted: ``Shut it down. Shut it \ndown.'' That was their mantra, shut down the government.\n  When Speaker Boehner told them to prepare for a shutdown, they gave \nhim\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\nan ovation. That is where they stand: Cut it off. Cut off the health \nAmerica needs to maintain some financial leadership. These are elected \nlawmakers who are supposed to guard our government, not kill it.\n  They want to deceive our people, talking about arithmetic and \naccounting, but that is not their real aim. Their aim is to have the \ngovernment decide what is right or wrong in people's homes and families \nso they can govern others' behavior. Make no mistake. They do not care \nif their cuts hurt children. They have shown that all along. They want \nto chase more than 200,000 children out of Head Start, where children \nlearn how to learn, and modest-income families have no other way to \nprovide that education.\n  We see it on this placard: ``House Republicans Hold Back 218,000 Head \nStart Kids.'' That is not going to help our country in the future. Tea \nparty Republicans ignore the fact that children who attend Head Start \nhave higher test scores and are more likely to graduate from high \nschool and go on to college.\n  They should visit Head Start classrooms to see those little ones. \nMaybe their tough hearts will mellow instead of just saying: No. Sorry. \nWith American wealth, we cannot help you.\n  But Head Start is only a beginning. Look at what tea party \nRepublicans want to do to higher education. They want to reduce Pell \ngrants, which help millions of Americans go to college. Do they not \nunderstand they are not just saying no to hard-working young students, \nthey are also saying no to American employers, telling them: Too bad \nour country does not have the skilled workers. Ship those jobs overseas \nor bring foreigners here. They will work for much less anyway.\n  They are saying no to the millions of hard-working parents who dream \nof seeing their kids living better than their parents because they \nreceived a college education. This chart tells a tragic story about the \nopportunities for smart kids who depend on Pell grants to afford \ncollege. Look at what it says: ``As College Costs Rise, House GOP Slash \nPell Grants.'' We can see it here. Rising tuition and less help is the \nway they would like to see America go.\n  Do we want to force students to take on more debt in order to attend \ncollege or kick them off our country's campuses altogether?\n  I learned the value of a government investment in college education \nfirsthand. I attended Columbia University on the GI bill after serving \nin the Army during 1944 and 1945. Later, I cofounded ADP. That is one \nof America's most successful companies, now employing 45,000 people. \nAmerica built the ``Greatest Generation'' by enabling 8 million \nveterans to attend college free for their service in wartime.\n  Even as we currently continue losing lives in wars that have also \ninjured thousands, they are willing to shut down the government, no \nmatter what, if it takes away a payday for soldiers on the battlefield.\n  The assault on our children's future does not end there. The tea \nparty Republicans want to cripple our ability to provide the clean air \nour people need to breathe without fear by eliminating the Clean Air \nAct, putting polluter's profits ahead of our children's health.\n  It is an outrageous assault on a landmark law that the Supreme Court \nruled on in 2007, that it is the government's responsibility to protect \nchildren from toxic chemicals in the air and illnesses such as asthma, \nlung cancer, among other life-threatening diseases.\n  I wish our GOP colleagues would be straight with the millions of \nparents who are concerned about their children's health and explain why \ntea partiers are asking families to be patient and maybe their children \nwill outgrow asthma.\n  One of my grandsons suffers from this disease. He is an athletic \nchild, and every time he goes to a soccer game, my daughter first \nchecks to see where the closest emergency room is. No parent should \nhave to worry about their children playing outside.\n  Look at this picture. Soot is ugly when it is pouring from a \nsmokestack, but it is even uglier inside a child's lungs.\n  Tea party Republicans say you can not restrict polluters with \nregulations because it is too cumbersome.\n  By their logic, we should rid ourselves of traffic signals, too. \nThose red lights are a real inconvenience.\n  And while we are at it, maybe our Republican colleagues would like us \nto get government bureaucrats out of the air traffic control towers.\n  Can anyone believe the Republicans are going after medical research, \nat the same time?\n  The National Institutes of Health are making strides in fighting \nchildhood diseases. But the Republicans want to reduce NIH's ability to \ndo research by taking $1 billion of their budget.\n  That is funding that could find a cure for childhood cancer or just \nmaybe identify the cause of autism or other autoimmune diseases.\n  If the government shuts down, NIH will have to stop admitting new \npatients for 640 clinical trials, 60 of which involve children with \ncancer.\n  And what about the toxic tea Republicans are trying to serve to \nwomen? Willing to put women at risk with their health.\n  They want to wipe out Planned Parenthood, one of the Nation's leading \nproviders of health services for women.\n  Disadvantaged women turn to Planned Parenthood for family planning \nservices, breast exams and cervical cancer screenings.\n  And make no mistake: Cancer screenings save lives.\n  Since the 1950s, cervical cancer screenings have cut mortality rates \nby more than 70 percent.\n  So why would we want to take cancer screenings away from women?\n  But it is not just women's health at risk, health care for America's \nseniors and retirees is also on the tea party Republicans' chopping \nblock.\n  They just revealed a scheme to end Medicare as we know it by turning \nit into a voucher program.\n  The problem is, when your voucher runs out, you will have to dig into \nyour own pocket to pay for health care.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office could not have been \nclearer this week when it reported ``Under [this] proposal, most \nelderly people would pay more for their health care than they would pay \nunder the current Medicare system.''\n  Is this what America wants, forcing seniors to spend more on medicine \nand treatment, and get less in return?\n  The bottom line is the Republican leaders in the House should stop \nthe toxic tea lawmakers from hijacking the deficit debate.\n  We cannot allow them to ``ransom'' Head Start, the Clean Air Act, \nPlanned Parenthood and Medicare.\n  We cannot negotiate away the health and well-being of America's \nchildren, women and seniors.\n  This is not how we solve our financial problems.\n  I was a CEO for many years, and I know that you cannot run a company, \nor a country, without sufficient revenues.\n  I voted last year to end the Bush tax cuts for the top 2 percent of \nwage earners because I know windfalls for the wealthy will not \nguarantee jobs, reduce the deficit or help us invest in our future.\n  I am one of the most fortunate people on Earth, and it is time for \nthose of us who have been fortunate to pay our fair share.\n  So I call on every Member of Congress to reject the toxic tea that \nthe House Republicans want to serve America's most vulnerable citizens.\n  Let's protect the future of our country, not poison it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, as the Federal Government \nis on the verge of a government shutdown, in the hope that both sides \nwill come together and pass a resolution which not only keeps the \ngovernment functioning but also fully funds our troops for the \nremainder of the fiscal year and enables the troops to have the support \nthey deserve. It is not sensible--it is not practical; it is not \nmorally defensible--to send our troops to fight for us in Afghanistan \nand Iraq and now in Libya without giving them the resources they \ndeserve. They should not have to worry about their loved ones back \nhome, whether they will be able to meet their rent payments, make their \nmortgage payments, put food on their tables, while they are fighting \nfor our country.\n  I find it extraordinary that our President, the Commander in Chief, \nhas issued a veto threat on the troop funding bill passed in the House \nyesterday\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\nand on the calendar in the Senate today. Looking at the Statement of \nAdministration Policy, the President doesn't talk about concerns over \nthe legislation, doesn't talk about concerns over the spending or the \nriders, he simply says:\n\n       This bill is a distraction from the real work that would \n     bring us closer to a reasonable compromise.\n\n  I am not quite sure what that means except by not stating any \nobjections to the legislation other than saying it is a distraction, it \nis not responsible for our troops and our military. To be honest, I am \nfar less concerned that passing this bill will be a distraction to the \nCongress and to the President than I am concerned that not passing the \nbill will be a distraction to those troops who are putting their lives \non the line for us overseas every day.\n  As we all know, we should not be having this discussion. We are \ntalking about funding for this fiscal year only because the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives last year didn't get their work done. In \nfact, for the first time since 1974, when the Budget Act was made law, \nthe Congress did not pass a budget in either House. That is why we are \nhere. That is why the continuing resolutions are necessary, these so-\ncalled short-term measures. It is too bad, because Congress not getting \ntheir work done last year means we have to clean up the mess this year \nwhen we should be focused on a much bigger issue.\n  My colleague just talked about some of his concerns about the \nspending reductions in H.R. 1. I remind us that not having gotten our \nwork done last year, we are also facing the biggest deficit in the \nhistory of the country and a debt that is unprecedented, over $14 \ntrillion. If we are truly worried about our kids and grandkids and the \nnext generation, we have to focus on that.\n  For today, what we are talking about is something very simple. It is \njust to pass a short-term measure to keep government in operation and \nto provide funding for the troops. I hope we can do that today. We are \ntalking about actually a relatively small part of the bigger problem. \nEven adding up all of the spending reductions in H.R. 1, it is less \nthan 2 percent of our Federal budget at a time when our Federal budget \ndeficit is over 40 percent.\n  So what we are debating today in the Senate and what is being \nnegotiated behind closed doors in the Congress and at the White House \nis such a small part of the issue.\n  But here we are. So what do we do to make things better, not make \nthem worse? The short-term measure the House has already passed \nyesterday is unfortunately the only thing we can agree on today \nbecause, given the process of this place, the House and the Senate, it \nis the only option we have to move things forward. We need to send it \nto the President while we are working on longer term legislation. \nAgain, it does provide for our troops, which is incredibly important to \nus at this time with three wars and so much concern and anxiety among \nthe military. This measure would reduce nondefense discretionary budget \nauthority by about $13 billion, again while funding the military fully \nfor the rest of the year.\n  Many of these reductions were included in the President's budget and \nare not particularly controversial. In terms of actual outlays, it \nreduces nondefense spending by $3.9 billion. In the context of our \noverall Federal budget, that is .1 percent. So we are talking about a \n.1-percent spending adjustment for the rest of the fiscal year. Yet we \nstill can't seem to get together to fund our troops and keep the \ngovernment open. Some call that .1 percent extreme. We just heard some \nof that. I don't think it is extreme. I think it is only a very small \nstep we have to take, if we are truly concerned about the future for \nthe next generation and concerned about our economy. If we don't get \nthis record deficit and this debt that is growing out of control under \ncontrol, it will continue to harm the economy today and our prospects \nfor getting this economy back on track in the future.\n  Let's allow these negotiations to continue. In the meantime, let's \nfund the troops and avoid the unnecessary disruption of a government \nshutdown. We can do that right now as a body by passing the legislation \nthe House passed yesterday, send it to the President for signature, and \ntake care of our fighting men and women for the rest of this year and \nkeep the government from shutting down.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I have long believed we have to be \nserious about the deficit, and I was 1 of about 14 Senators who held \nback their vote on the debt ceiling last year to make sure we actually \ncreated the fiscal commission, which did very good work this year. That \nwork is being taken by a small group of Democratic and Republican \nSenators to come up with long-term solutions for the debt. I strongly \nbelieve that is what we have to do. I also believe we have a \nresponsibility to govern.\n  Allowing a shutdown when we are this close in negotiations, when a \nnumber has been agreed upon and all it comes down to is a disagreement \non politics, is just wrong. What makes this situation so troubling is \nthat we have reached this standstill not over dollars at its essence \nbut over politics that I don't believe have a place in the debate.\n  With a bipartisan deal within reach, it would be irresponsible to \nshut down the government and punish our constituents solely to score \npolitical points. This impending shutdown has broad consequences. While \nwe have now seen 13 straight months of private sector job growth, \nadding 1.8 million jobs in that time, the economy is still fragile. \nEveryone knows that in their own States. Too many Americans continue to \nstruggle.\n  According to an analysis from Goldman Sachs, a government shutdown \nwill cost the economy around $8 billion per year or nearly .2 percent \nof GDP for each week of the shutdown, all because of a disagreement \nover social issues not over dollars--because last night there was \nactually agreement on the dollars.\n  Economists and business leaders agree that a government shutdown at \nthis time will hurt our recovery, hurt businesses, and slow economic \ngrowth. Even Speaker Boehner has admitted it will cost more than it \nsaves.\n  If a shutdown were to occur, the Small Business Administration would \ncease to process applications for business loan guarantees, curtailing \nlending to small businesses already squeezed by tight credit markets. \nLast year the Small Business Administration supported more than $212 \nbillion in lending to small businesses through its two largest loan \nprograms. At these levels we would see over $400 million a week in \nsmall business lending put on hold because of a shutdown.\n  Our government also provides vital support for businesses seeking to \nexport their products and services and conducting business abroad. The \nU.S. Commercial Service, a part of the Department of Commerce's \nInternational Trade Administration, has offices and embassies and \nconsulates in over 80 countries worldwide and utilizes its global \nnetwork of trade professionals to connect U.S. companies with \ninternational buyers. Every year they help thousands of U.S. companies \nexport goods and services worth billions of dollars.\n  If the Federal Government shuts down, these services will end and \nsales and contracts will be lost. If we look at the shutdown in 1995, \nwe can see evidence of how damaging a disruption of services like these \ncan be. During that shutdown, approximately $2.2 billion in U.S. \nexports couldn't leave the country because the Department of State and \nthe Bureau of Export Administration were unable to issue export \nlicenses.\n  Finally, I wish to make a point about visas since I chair the \nSubcommittee on Export Promotion, Competitiveness and Innovation, which \nincludes tourism. During the last shutdown, approximately 20,000 to \n30,000 applications by foreigners for foreign tourist visas were \nunprocessed each day, and the U.S. tourist industries and airlines \nreportedly sustained millions of dollars in losses. With the average \nforeign visitor spending over $4,000 per visit, it is easy to see how \nfast these losses add up for businesses. These are just a few examples, \nbut the sum total will be much greater.\n  I am on a bill with Senator Casey and Senator Hutchison to continue \nfunding our troops. Of course, we will do that; of course, they should \nget their paychecks. But let's look at what this shutdown would do on a \nday-to-day basis to provide some perspective.\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\n  In northwestern Minnesota, volunteers are taking time off from their \njobs and from school to help fill sand bags and build temporary levees \nas we watch the Red River of the north rise to its eventual crest. The \nflood fight takes all hands on deck in North Dakota and Minnesota, with \nlocal, State, and Federal Government working together to protect these \ncommunities. Earlier this week, to help in this fight, Governor Dayton \ndeclared a state of emergency for 46 Minnesota counties. North Dakota \nhas also been declared a state of emergency.\n  FEMA has said it will have all the resources it would need to \nmaintain its capabilities during a shutdown. However, if the Federal \nGovernment closes its doors, FEMA will not be able to process in a \ntimely manner paperwork and applications that Minnesotans will be \nsubmitting for assistance once the waters recede. I have been through \nthese flood fights before. The whole community comes together. The \nwhole community fights that flood. They take days and days and days. \nSome of them have lost their houses, and they are still out there \nhelping their fellow citizens. I see that and I wonder to myself: And \nwe in this body and in this Congress can't come together when we are \nthis close, when there actually was agreement on a number last night. \nWe can't come together while these volunteers across the Red River are \ncoming together on a flood fight? That is absurd.\n  I urge my colleagues who are holding this up to reconsider their all-\nor-nothing stance so we can move forward with the real work that must \nbe done. A setback now would simply prevent the growth needed to \naddress our country's long-term fiscal imbalances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add 4 \nadditional minutes to my 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2305-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2305-S2308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIBYA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am aware that most of my colleagues are \ntaking the floor today to speak about the potential shutdown of the \ngovernment, and very appropriately so. I am strongly opposed to a \ngovernment shutdown, as we all are. I especially want to note its \nadverse effects on our men and women in uniform.\n  Of course, I have joined so many of my colleagues in cosponsoring the \nEnsuring Pay for Our Military Act of 2011. The last thing our men and \nwomen and their families need to worry about is how to make ends meet \nwhile they are taking up arms to defend the Nation's interests.\n  I rise to talk about the deteriorating situation in Libya which could \nhave more profound effects than the crisis we are in. It is a very \nserious, very deteriorating situation and one which is fraught with \nsevere implications for America's national security interests.\n  I remain a strong supporter of the President's decision to take \nmilitary action in Libya. It averted what was an imminent slaughter in \nBenghazi and has given us a chance to achieve the goal of U.S. policy \nas stated correctly by the President: to force Qadhafi to leave power. \nI am also grateful we have capable friends, our Arab partners, and NATO \nallies, who are making critical contributions. But that is not a \nsubstitute for U.S. leadership. Right now that is the main missing \ningredient in the coalition's efforts in Libya--the willingness of the \nadministration to take decisive actions, together with our partners, so \nthat we can accomplish our goal as quickly as possible rather than look \nto our allies to do it all themselves, which I fear the evidence is \nmounting they cannot do.\n  The administration has chosen to stop flying strike missions against \nQadhafi's forces, even though they continue to threaten Libyan \ncivilians and even though our NATO allies cannot match our unique \ncapabilities in this regard. The administration correctly declared that \nforcing Qadhafi from power is a goal of U.S. policy, but our military \nmission is not working toward that goal by actively seeking to degrade \nQadhafi's forces, thereby increasing the pressure on him to leave \npower.\n  At a time when Qadhafi's forces are adapting to NATO's tactics and \ncapabilities and concealing themselves in populated civilian areas, the \nadministration has grounded our most effective aircraft, the A-10 and \nthe AC-130, which are the only planes--the only planes--that are \ncapable of conducting the kinds of precise air-to-ground operations now \nrequired to protect civilians under the current circumstances. Not \nsurprisingly, Qadhafi's forces are now regaining the momentum on the \nground.\n\n  We cannot succeed with half-measures. Right now, our actions are not \nadding up to a strategy that appears capable of achieving our goals. To \nthe contrary, we seem to be failing to prevent the situation on the \nground in Libya from sliding into a stalemate.\n  Just yesterday, GEN Carter Hamm, the commander of U.S. Africa \nCommand, who led Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya, told the Armed \nServices Committee that a stalemate in Libya, where Qadhafi remains in \npower to pose an even greater threat to the world and to the Libyan \npeople, is not in America's interest or in anyone's interest. But in \nthe same hearing yesterday, General Hamm also conceded that the \nsituation on the ground in Libya is ``more likely'' of becoming a \nstalemate now then when this intervention began. I am afraid I agree \nwith the general.\n  I would like to highlight some of the news my colleagues may have \nmissed.\n  Yesterday, there was an airstrike that, unfortunately--the Washington \nPost: ``NATO's credibility takes a hit in Libya.''\n\n       Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi went back on \n     the offensive . . . as questions continued to mount about the \n     credibility and effectiveness of NATO's no-fly zone and \n     campaign of airstrikes.\n       A senior U.S. general described the situation in Libya as a \n     stalemate, while Turkey said it was talking to both sides \n     working on a ``road map'' for a cease-fire. In the meantime, \n     Gaddafi is seeking what military advantage he can get and \n     probing for gaps in NATO's resolve. . . .\n       The day also ignited new confusion and outrage among rebels \n     in Ajdabiya after warplanes strafed rebel forces and killed \n     at least five people, including two doctors. Rebels first \n     accused NATO of targeting them. . . . By Thursday night, it \n     was still unclear who attacked. . . .\n       Abdul Fattah Younis, the rebel's commander, told reporters \n     that if NATO had attacked their tanks, it was a mistake, and \n     if Gaddafi's airplanes had been allowed to strike them, it \n     was an ``even bigger mistake.''\n\n  Quoting the New York Times:\n\n       As for the current air war, NATO is especially sensitive to \n     the criticism that came most scathingly from the leader of \n     the Libyan opposition forces, Gen. Abdul Fattah Younes. He \n     said in Benghazi late Tuesday that ``NATO blesses us every \n     now and then with a bombardment here and there, and is \n     letting the people of Misurata die every day.''\n\n  So we relieved a humanitarian--let's get this straight, my friends--\nwe relieved a humanitarian disaster in Benghazi, and now, because of \neither ineptitude or lack of resolve or lack of capability or all of \nthe above, we are now watching a massacre--certainly human suffering of \nenormous proportions in Misurata.\n  There is another article from the Guardian: ``NATO lacking strike \naircraft for Libya campaign.''\n  There is a New York Times editorial today. Interestingly, the New \nYork Times says:\n\n       There is a much better option: the American A-10 and AC-130 \n     aircraft used earlier in the Libya fighting and still on \n     standby status. President Obama should authorize these planes \n     to fly again under NATO command. Unlike the highflying \n     supersonic French and British jets now carrying the main \n     burden of the air war, these American planes can fly slow \n     enough and low enough to let them see and target Colonel \n     Qaddafi's weapons without unduly endangering nearby \n     populations.\n\n  Facts are stubborn things. The fact is that now the situation is \ndeteriorating. The suffering goes on, and America and our allies appear \nto be showing that we are incapable or unwilling to address a third-\nrate military power, ruled by a man who has the blood of 190 Americans \non his hands, who has been involved in terrorist activities throughout \nthe world, who went outside of Benghazi and said: We will go house to \nhouse and kill every one of you. And the situation is deteriorating \ninto stalemate.\n  So what do we need to do?\n  First, we need to get U.S. Armed Forces, especially our A-10s and AC-\n130s, back in the business of flying strike missions against Qadhafi's\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\nforces--not just as part of our effort to protect civilians but to work \ntoward the goal of our actual policy, which is to impose enough \npressure on the regime to compel Qadhafi and his family to leave power.\n  Second, the United States should work with our friends and allies to \nhelp the opposition government in Benghazi, the Transitional National \nCouncil, to gain access to some of the tens of billions of dollars \nworth of funds that have been frozen from the Qadhafi regime.\n  Third, we need to help the opposition to Qadhafi communicate more \neffectively, while shutting down Qadhafi's ability to broadcast his \npropaganda. Qadhafi has cut off land lines, mobile networks, and the \nInternet. While top opposition leaders have satellite phones, we have \nboth humanitarian and strategic interests in restoring the ability of \npeople in liberated parts of Libya to communicate with each other and \nthe rest of the world. We should take steps to get Qadhafi's satellite, \ntelevision, and radio broadcasts off the air. U.S. diplomacy is \nurgently needed to get those countries that have satellite providers \nbroadcasting Qadhafi's propaganda to drop those communications \nimmediately.\n  Fourth, the United States should follow France, Qatar, and Italy in \nrecognizing the opposition government, the Transitional National \nCouncil, as the sole legitimate government of Libya.\n  I hear again and again: We don't know who these people are. Well, I \nwill tell you who they are. They are people who rose up against an \noppressive and brutal dictator and wanted to assert their rights for \nfreedom and democracy. That is who they are.\n  Any allegation that they are dominated by al-Qaida is patently false. \nWe did not know who was going to come after Hitler, but we wanted him \ngone. So this continuous stream that somehow this is al-Qaida--it is \nnot al-Qaida; it is people who want freedom and democracy. They rose up \npeacefully, as the Tunisians did and the Egyptians did and as others \nacross the Middle East and north Africa are now doing for greater \npolitical freedom, economic opportunity, and justice. That is why this \nregional awakening, which some are calling the Arab spring, rather than \nhelping al-Qaida, is, in fact, the greatest repudiation of al-Qaida the \nworld has ever seen.\n  Fifth, we need to facilitate the provision of weapons to the Libyan \nopposition, as well as command and control technology, training, \nbattlefield intelligence, and other capabilities that can strengthen \ntheir ability to increase the pressure on Qadhafi to leave power.\n  I want to reiterate that I do not support nor do I believe is \nnecessary American ground troops under any circumstances. We should be \nable to, with a combination of the robust implementation of these five \nmeasures, drive Qadhafi from power and give the Libyan people their \nGod-given rights.\n  I want to say again that I see on cable time after time that we do \nnot know who these people are and they may be al-Qaida. I will tell you \nwho they are. They are people who do not want to live under oppressive, \nrepressive brutal regimes. And the more of a stalemate, the more likely \nal-Qaida forces will infiltrate and gain power. The quicker Qadhafi \nleaves power, the more likely it is we will see a dramatic transition.\n  We cannot say--we cannot say--we intervened in Libya to prevent a \nslaughter in Benghazi only to see one in Misurata or some other city. \nIf we stay our present course, that is what will likely happen. We need \ndecisive actions, not half-measures. We need to be leading. America \nmust lead. NATO is America. We need to be leading in a strong and \nsustained way, not sitting on the side lines or playing a supporting \nrole. We have the right goal in Libya. The President was right to \nintervene in the first place, but now we need to take the necessary \nsteps to finish the job.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the articles I referred \nto be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 8, 2011]\n\n                NATO's Credibility Takes a Hit in Libya\n\n                   (By Leila Fadel and Simon Denyer)\n\n       Ajdabiya, Libya.--Forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar \n     Gaddafi went back on the offensive Thursday, as questions \n     continued to mount about the credibility and effectiveness of \n     NATO's no-fly zone and campaign of airstrikes.\n       A senior U.S. general described the situation in Libya as a \n     stalemate, while Turkey said it was talking to both sides and \n     working on a ``road map'' for a cease-fire. In the meantime, \n     Gaddafi is seeking what military advantage he can get and \n     probing for gaps in NATO's resolve.\n       At the organization's headquarters in Brussels, NATO \n     ambassadors held an unscheduled meeting Thursday to follow up \n     on complaints from French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe that \n     the Libya campaign risks getting bogged down unless the pace \n     and efficiency of air support for rebel forces picks up.\n       The inability of either side to score a decisive victory \n     has left the Obama administration and NATO in a quandary, \n     facing decisions about whether to continue the mission of \n     trying to protect civilians or to increase assistance to the \n     opposition, aid that is currently limited to strikes from air \n     and sea.\n       Attacks by Gaddafi's forces began with strikes on desert \n     oil installations that serve as the rebels' economic \n     lifeline, and they intensified Thursday with the fresh \n     artillery bombardment of rebel positions in the eastern port \n     of Ajdabiya, which sent many fighters fleeing.\n       The day also ignited new confusion and outrage among rebels \n     in Ajdabiya after warplanes strafed rebel forces and killed \n     at least five people, including two doctors. Rebels first \n     accused NATO of targeting them but later said the attack \n     probably came from Gaddafi's forces. By Thursday night, it \n     was still unclear who attacked the rebels from the sky.\n       Abdul Fattah Younis, the rebels' commander, told reporters \n     that if NATO had attacked their tanks, it was a mistake, and \n     if Gaddafi's airplanes had been allowed to strike them, it \n     was an ``even bigger mistake.''\n       Either way, NATO's credibility among rebel forces, already \n     battered since the United States took a back-seat role, \n     appears to have sustained another blow. Rebels are \n     questioning NATO's resolve to help them.\n       The government attacks on oil installations in the remote \n     southern desert appeared intended to take advantage of the \n     limits of NATO's involvement. Even as the rebels made their \n     first oil shipment, a series of attacks on oil installations \n     shut down production at the country's main oil field of \n     Sarir. An oil company official in rebel-held territory joined \n     the calls Thursday for better protection from NATO.\n       Rebel fighters in Ajdabiya have grown accustomed to the \n     Western alliance controlling the skies, so they were taken \n     off guard Thursday when low-flying planes fired upon several \n     tanks and a passenger bus loaded with fighters. Younis, the \n     rebel commander, denounced what he called ``a vicious \n     attack'' and said that the precision of the strikes led him \n     to believe that NATO was responsible.\n       Outraged rebel fighters called the attack a repeat of an \n     incident last Friday in which NATO bombs mistakenly killed 13 \n     rebels and injured seven others. That incident was triggered \n     when the rebels fired their weapons into the air in \n     celebration--an act that NATO forces mistook for hostile \n     fire.\n       This time, Younis said, the rebel army had informed NATO of \n     its plan to move tanks and other forces into new positions \n     outside Ajdabiya. The tanks and bus were parked, other \n     fighters said, and were marked with the green, black and red \n     rebel flag.\n       Rebel forces, meanwhile, came under fire from government \n     loyalists at Ajdabiya's western gate and rapidly retreated. \n     Many fighters, and some of the few families who had not yet \n     fled the city after weeks of fighting, drove north and east \n     toward Benghazi, the rebel capital, their pickup trucks and \n     cars filled with everything from mattresses to suitcases to \n     automatic weapons.\n       The main hospital in Ajdabiya was evacuated, with its \n     patients and staff also headed to Benghazi. But Gaddafi's \n     forces appeared not to have entered the city proper, and some \n     rebel fighters remained.\n       In Washington, Gen. Carter F. Ham, who commanded the \n     coalition operation until it was taken over by NATO last \n     week, responded affirmatively when asked during congressional \n     testimony Thursday whether the conflict had reached a \n     stalemate. He said that ``debate is occurring within the U.S. \n     government'' about how best to respond.\n       In response to a question from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), \n     Ham said he agreed that a stalemate seemed ``more likely'' \n     than it had been when the United States and its allies began \n     their military strikes last month.\n       The NATO meeting in Brussels was convened in response to \n     complaints from France, which, along with Britain, has \n     carried out the largest number of sorties over Libya since \n     U.S. forces turned over operational command March 31.\n       NATO officials said bad weather had reduced visibility and \n     not made it easy to supply the sustained, close air support \n     demanded by rebel commanders. They also accused Gaddafi's \n     forces of dispersing troops, tanks and artillery among \n     civilian populations in several cities.\n       The alliance said it was investigating the initial rebel \n     version of what happened near Ajdabiya, but it did not reveal \n     whether coalition warplanes were in the area at the time.\n       The alliance said that fighting there had been ``fierce'' \n     for several days and that the battlefield remains confused \n     and disorganized.\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\n       ``The situation is unclear and fluid, with mechanized \n     weapons traveling in all directions,'' said a statement from \n     NATO facilities in Naples.\n       With a quick military solution looking less likely by the \n     day, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his \n     country was holding talks with both sides in Libya and \n     working on a ``road map'' to achieve a cease-fire.\n       In any prolonged stalemate, the rebels' ability to shore up \n     their region's tattered economy with oil revenue will be \n     critical. Rebels have about 2 million barrels of crude oil in \n     Tobruk that can be exported, but production at the Sarir and \n     Misla fields has halted after a series of attacks.\n       Two employees of Arabian Gulf Oil Co. are still missing \n     after Gaddafi forces attacked the Misla field with rockets, \n     setting fire to at least one oil tank, a company spokesman, \n     Abdeljalil Mayuf, told the Reuters news agency on Thursday.\n       Gaddafi's government has routinely denied attacking oil \n     facilities and has blamed rebels or NATO for the attacks.\n       ``If we get Gaddafi's forces out of these areas, we can try \n     to reopen Sarir field, but it's not safe now,'' Mayuf said, \n     appealing for air support from NATO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 7, 2011]\n\n             Changing Libyan Tactics Pose Problems for NATO\n\n                          (By Steven Erlanger)\n\n       Paris.--Angry charges by Libyan rebels that NATO has failed \n     to come to their aid point up a question that has haunted the \n     Western air campaign from the start: how to avoid a stalemate \n     and defeat the Libyan leader without putting foreign troops \n     on the ground.\n       NATO officials and the French foreign minister, Alain \n     Juppe, rejected the opposition criticism on Wednesday, saying \n     that bad weather and evolving tactics by forces loyal to Col. \n     Muammar el-Qaddafi were limiting the air war, which is \n     supposed to be protecting Libyan civilians and driving the \n     colonel's troops to retreat to their barracks. In recent \n     days, Qaddafi forces have stepped up their shelling of \n     Misurata, in the west, and pushed rebels back from some \n     eastern oil towns.\n       The rebels, of course, are a largely untrained, \n     disorganized fighting force. But the nature of the battle has \n     also changed since a United Nations resolution authorized \n     ``all necessary measures'' to protect civilians.\n       In the early stages of the air campaign, allied warplanes \n     blistered Qaddafi tanks, artillery and transport trucks in \n     the desert outside the rebel capital, Benghazi. But American \n     intelligence reports from Libya say that the Qaddafi forces \n     are now hiding their troops and weaponry among urban \n     populations and traveling in pickup trucks and S.U.V.'s \n     rather than military vehicles, making them extremely \n     difficult targets.\n       ``The military capabilities available to Qaddafi remain \n     quite substantial,'' said a senior Pentagon official who \n     watches Libya. ``What this shows is that you cannot guarantee \n     tipping the balance of ground operations only with bombs and \n     missiles from the air.''\n       NATO officials, who just took over responsibility for the \n     air campaign from the United States, deny that their \n     bureaucracy is somehow limiting the campaign. ``No country is \n     vetoing this target or that one; it's not like Kosovo,'' \n     where in 1999 some countries objected to certain bombing \n     targets, said a senior NATO official, asking anonymity in \n     accordance with diplomatic practice.\n       ``The military command is doing what it wants to do,'' he \n     said.\n       NATO officials said on Wednesday that NATO was flying more \n     missions every day, and that defending Misurata was a \n     priority. Carmen Romero, a NATO spokeswoman, said that the \n     alliance flew 137 missions on Monday and 186 on Tuesday, and \n     planned 198 on Wednesday. ``We have a clear mandate, and we \n     will do everything to protect the citizens of Misurata.''\n       A rebel spokesman in Misurata said Wednesday that NATO had \n     delivered two airstrikes that pushed the Qaddafi forces away \n     from the port, opening it for vital supply ships. ``We have \n     renewed momentum, and our friends are helping us big time,'' \n     said Mohamed, a rebel spokesman whose name was withheld for \n     the protection of his family.\n       ``NATO is not the problem,'' the senior NATO official said. \n     ``The Qaddafi forces have learned and have adapted. They're \n     using human shields, so it's difficult to attack them from \n     the air.'' While many Western officials have accused the \n     Qaddafi forces of using human shields, they have yet to \n     produce explicit evidence. But they generally mean that the \n     troops take shelter, with their armor, in civilian areas.\n       The harder question is how NATO will respond to the changed \n     tactics of the Qaddafi forces, which now seem to have \n     achieved a stalemate against the combination of Western air \n     power and the ragtag opposition army.\n       First, there is a question of whether without the \n     participation of the United States, the rest of the \n     coalition--France, Britain, Italy, Spain, Norway, Qatar and a \n     few others--have the right mix of weapons or enough of them. \n     In particular, the United States uses a jet called the A-10, \n     or Warthog--which flies lower and slower than other airplanes \n     but has cannon that can destroy armored vehicles--as well as \n     the AC-130, both of which are effective in more built-up \n     areas. The Europeans have nothing similar.\n       The United States has had C.I.A. agents on the ground with \n     the rebels in eastern Libya for some time, and there are \n     unconfirmed reports that they may be helping to train the \n     rebel army's raw recruits. Even so, forming a real army that \n     can oust Colonel Qaddafi may take many months, and the \n     coalition is unlikely to be that patient.\n       That is one reason that allied governments, including the \n     United States and Britain, are urging defections from the \n     Qaddafi circle and hoping that he will be removed from \n     inside. No official, of course, is willing to talk about any \n     covert mission to remove the colonel, except to say that \n     ``regime change'' is not authorized by the United Nations.\n       And that is why Britain, Turkey and the United States are \n     all exploring the possibilities of a negotiated solution to \n     the conflict, provided Colonel Qaddafi and his sons \n     relinquish power.\n       Francois Heisbourg, a military policy expert at the \n     Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, said, ``Given \n     where we are, any deal that removes Colonel Qaddafi from the \n     scene is a deal we should take.''\n       As for the current air war, NATO is especially sensitive to \n     the criticism that came most scathingly from the leader of \n     the Libyan opposition forces, Gen. Abdul Fattah Younes. He \n     said in Benghazi late Tuesday that ``NATO blesses us every \n     now and then with a bombardment here and there, and is \n     letting the people of Misurata die every day.''\n       Mr. Juppe, whose country has been the most aggressive in \n     defense of the Libyan opposition, said on Wednesday that the \n     situation in Misurata was difficult, but it was complicated \n     by the need to protect civilian lives.\n       ``Misurata is in a situation that cannot carry on,'' Mr. \n     Juppe told France Info radio. ``But I want to make clear that \n     we categorically asked that there is no collateral damage on \n     the civilian population, so it makes the military \n     interventions more difficult, because Qaddafi's troops \n     understood it very well and are getting closer to the \n     civilian population.''\n       He said he would bring up the difficulties of Misurata to \n     the NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen.\n       Rebel leaders have rejected the idea that the Qaddafi \n     forces in Misurata cannot be attacked from the air, saying \n     that the neighborhoods where the troops are concentrated were \n     long ago abandoned by civilians.\n       Another option is to increase the pressure on Colonel \n     Qaddafi and his sons, although openly changing the objective \n     in Libya from protecting civilians to ousting the Qaddafi \n     family from power would probably shatter the international \n     coalition that is enforcing the United Nations resolution, \n     said Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and \n     International Studies in Washington.\n       ``Nevertheless,'' he added, ``the U.S. and its allies need \n     to make hard--if somewhat covert--choices, and make them \n     quickly,'' he said in an e-mailed commentary. ``The last \n     thing anyone needs at a time when there is near-turmoil from \n     Pakistan to Morocco is a long-lasting open wound of political \n     division and extended conflict in Libya as the worst-of-the-\n     worst authoritarian leaders elsewhere in the region struggle \n     to survive.''\n       NATO needs to take the rebels' side more forcefully, he \n     said, despite the neutrality of the United Nations \n     resolution. That could take several forms, he said, among \n     them ``killing Qaddafi forces the moment they move or \n     concentrate, rather than waiting for them to attack; striking \n     Qaddafi's military and security facilities; and finding \n     excuses to strike his compound.''\n       For Libya, Mr. Cordesman wrote, ``a long political and \n     economic crisis and an extended low-level conflict that \n     devastates populated areas'' would represent a ``net \n     humanitarian cost'' that would be ``higher than fully backing \n     the rebels, with air power and covert arms and training.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Guardian, Apr. 5, 2011]\n\n            Nato Lacking Strike Aircraft for Libya Campaign\n\n               (By Ian Traynor and Richard Norton-Taylor)\n\n       Nato is running short of attack aircraft for its bombing \n     campaign against Muammar Gaddafi only days after taking \n     command of the Libyan mission from a coalition led by the US, \n     France and Britain.\n       David Cameron has pledged four more British Tornado jets on \n     top of eight already being used for the air strikes. But \n     pressure is growing for other European countries, especially \n     France, to offer more after the Americans withdrew their \n     attack aircraft from the campaign on Monday.\n       ``We will need more strike capability,'' a Nato official \n     said.\n       Since the French launched the first raids on Libya 16 days \n     ago, the coalition and Nato have destroyed around 30% of \n     Gaddafi's military capacity, Lieutenant General Charles \n     Bouchard, the Canadian officer leading the air campaign, told \n     Nato ambassadors.\n       But attempts to ``degrade'' the Libyan leader's firepower \n     further were being complicated by a shift in tactics by \n     Gaddafi, said Brigadier General Marc van Uhm, a senior Nato \n     military planner.\n       ``They are using light vehicles and trucks to transport,'' \n     while hiding tanks and heavy weapons, he said.\n       ``We try to identify where those heavy assets are, because \n     we have seen they have\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\n     chosen to hide themselves into urban areas to prevent being \n     targeted, even using human shields.''\n       Nato officials insisted the pace of the air operations was \n     being maintained. But it has emerged that the US and the \n     French, who have been the two biggest military players until \n     now, are retaining national control over substantial military \n     forces in the Mediterranean and refusing to submit them to \n     Nato authority.\n       The French have the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, two \n     escorting frigates and 16 fighter aircraft, none of which are \n     under the Nato command and control which was announced last \n     Thursday.\n       Until last week, President Nicolas Sarkozy was the loudest \n     opponent of handing over the operations to Nato control. \n     Nonetheless, the French are not only taking part in the Nato \n     campaign, but are the biggest non-US contributors, with 33 \n     aircraft, double Britain's 17. Not all of these are strike \n     aircraft.\n       Until Monday, the Americans had performed most of the \n     attacks on ground targets, with the French executing around a \n     quarter and the British around a 10th. Given the US retreat, \n     Nato is seeking to fill the gap, but only the British have \n     pledged more.\n       ``We're very happy that one country decided to bring in \n     more assets,'' said Van Uhm.\n       When Nato took over from the coalition it was stressed that \n     it had assumed ``sole command and control'' of all air \n     operations.\n       However, countries are dipping in and out of Nato command, \n     withdrawing ``air assets'' for national operations before \n     returning them to alliance control.\n       ``It's pretty clear that Nato is in command. Nato is in the \n     lead,'' said Van Uhm. ``There are assets under national \n     control in the area. But General Bouchard is commanding what \n     Nato does . . . You could say nothing is happening without \n     Nato knowing.''\n       The general stressed that no air strikes on ground targets \n     in Libya had taken place outside Nato's command.\n       Six countries are believed to be engaged in the bombing \n     campaign--France, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Belgium, and \n     Norway--with many others involved in policing an arms embargo \n     and enforcing a no-fly zone.\n       Gaddafi's air force had been grounded, Van Uhm said.\n       In London, the Ministry of Defence said RAF aircraft had \n     struck targets in Libya on each of the past three days.\n       Tornado GR4 ground attack planes, flying from the Italian \n     airbase of Gioia del Colle, hit a battle tank and two \n     surface-to-air missile launchers near Sirte on Monday when \n     they launched three anti-armour Brimstone missiles. The \n     previous day, they dropped Paveway IV bombs and fired \n     Brimstone missiles to target a group of 10 armoured vehicles \n     south of Sirte.\n       On Saturday, they dropped Paveway IV bombs on two tanks in \n     Sirte and also hit ``several small ground attack aircraft'' \n     on an airfield near Misrata, the MoD said.\n       Two of the Eurofighter/Typhoons based in Italy have \n     returned to the UK. The Typhoons are not equipped to conduct \n     ground attack operations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 8, 2011]\n\n                        Keeping Ahead of Qaddafi\n\n       Wars are messy business, and the international effort to \n     keep Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's forces from slaughtering \n     Libyan rebels and civilians is proving no exception. In \n     recent days, the colonel has thwarted NATO airstrikes by \n     regrouping his forces into densely populated areas. That has \n     left NATO with a seemingly impossible choice: leave some of \n     the regime's most deadly weapons unmolested, or target them \n     and risk possibly heavy civilian casualties.\n       There is a much better option: the American A-10 and AC-130 \n     aircraft used earlier in the Libya fighting and still on \n     standby status. President Obama should authorize these planes \n     to fly again under NATO command. Unlike the highflying \n     supersonic French and British jets now carrying the main \n     burden of the air war, these American planes can fly slow \n     enough and low enough to let them see and target Colonel \n     Qaddafi's weapons without unduly endangering nearby \n     populations.\n       Mr. Obama was right to insist that other participating \n     nations should step up and that the operation be quickly \n     transferred to non-American NATO command. United States \n     forces are already overstretched--and bearing much of the \n     burden in Iraq and Afghanistan--and Libya's uprising is \n     unfolding on Europe's doorstep.\n       European commanders are fully capable of running the show, \n     and European jet fighters can certainly destroy military \n     targets on desert roads and sparsely populated areas. But no \n     other country has aircraft comparable to America's A-10, \n     which is known as the Warthog, designed to attack tanks and \n     other armored vehicles, or to the AC-130 ground-attack \n     gunship, which is ideally suited for carefully sorting out \n     targets in populated areas.\n       In a war where rebel ground forces are struggling to train \n     and organize themselves, and foreign ground forces are out of \n     the question, these specialized American planes provide a \n     unique and needed asset. Mr. Obama should make them available \n     to NATO commanders now.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2308-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2308-S2314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise again today to urge my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the Capitol to move \nbeyond the unnecessary and distracting partisan bickering and come \ntogether to fund our government through the remainder of the current \nfiscal year, including our military, our early-childhood programs, and \nour essential health services for our seniors and children.\n  Six months into the 2011 fiscal year and less than 12 hours before a \ngovernment shutdown would close off many of the important services to \nmillions of Americans, Congress has yet to fulfill its most basic \nresponsibility and pass a budget.\n  I know the people of North Carolina or any State did not send us to \nWashington to point fingers or blame other people for the challenges \nour country faces. They sent us here to work with our colleagues on \ncommonsense solutions. During my time as budget cochair in the North \nCarolina State Senate, I learned two things: First, it is never easy to \ncraft a budget, there are always tough choices to make; and second, our \nfiscal challenges can only be met if Republicans and Democrats have \nthat commitment to work together.\n  Despite the impression the American people may have based on what \nthey have seen in recent weeks, I know we can work this out. We have to \nwork together because after we come to an agreement on this year's \nbudget, we must buckle down and chart out a comprehensive bipartisan \npath to rein in our nearly $14 trillion national debt.\n  I believe we all share the common goal of reducing this year's \ndeficit, but the national debt will not disappear with one bill or in 1 \nyear alone. It will take a comprehensive and long-term approach that \nmoves beyond a singular focus on domestic discretionary spending.\n  That is why I remain concerned by some of the cuts passed by the \nHouse and especially by the dozens of divisive policy riders that are \ndisrupting our ability to chart a pragmatic and responsible fiscal \ncourse for our country.\n  It is why I remain concerned that we are holding up government \nfunding with threats to take away vital health care to millions of \nAmerican women who could not otherwise afford it. These health services \ninclude Pap tests, breast cancer screenings, birth control, and STD \ntesting and treatment. These services, which are funded through title \nX, were signed into law by President Nixon and supported by George H.W. \nBush. According to independent, nonpartisan studies, every $1 spent on \nthese family planning services saves $4. Is that not what we are \nsupposed to be working on--reducing the amount of our government \nspending?\n  These proposals are the only things standing between a reasonable, \nbipartisan compromise and an irresponsible government shutdown. If such \na shutdown does occur, we risk delivering a crippling blow now to our \nalready fragile economic recovery.\n  More than 1,000 American small business owners, who were already \nfacing difficulties securing the borrowing they need to expand and add \njobs, could see their SBA-backed loans delayed.\n  We have 368 national parks in our country. Millions of dollars will \nbe lost to the businesses surrounding those parks if we shut down the \ngovernment. In April of 2010 alone, in North Carolina, more than 1.3 \nmillion people visited the national parks and spent millions of \ndollars. These parks include the Great Smoky Mountains, the Blue Ridge \nParkway, and Cape Hatteras National Seashore and others. Tourism in \nNorth Carolina is one of our State's largest industries. In 2010, \ntourists spent $17 billion across our State, and the tourism industry \nsupports 185,000 jobs for North Carolinians. More than 40,000 \nbusinesses in North Carolina provide direct services to travelers. If \nwe close our national parks, these small businesses are at risk of \nlosing customers, losing money, which will make it much more difficult \nfor my State to recover from this tough economy.\n  We risk putting even more pressure on our already shaky mortgage \nmarket by preventing thousands of homeowners from receiving a loan to \nbuy a new house.\n  As for North Carolina, I am particularly alarmed about the impact a \ngovernment shutdown would have on our courageous military personnel and\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\ntheir families who have dedicated their lives to this country. Two \nweeks ago marines from North Carolina rescued with amazing speed and \nskill the American F-15 pilot who went down east of Benghazi in Libya. \nLast week, I spoke with Marine Corps Commandant General Amos on the \namazing work of these North Carolina marines. He told me it took only \n90 minutes from start to finish to rescue the F-15 pilot.\n  These warriors are heroes, as are the 120,000 active-duty troops in \nNorth Carolina and the approximately 400,000 American troops who are \ndeployed overseas, including 90,000 troops in Afghanistan and 45,000 \ntroops in Iraq. These heroes and their families do not deserve to have \npartisan bickering jeopardize their financial stability.\n  More than a third of the people in my State are either in the \nmilitary, a veteran, or have an immediate family member who is in the \nmilitary or a veteran. So if the government shuts down and we delay \npaychecks to our military personnel, it is not just our courageous \nservice men and women whose lives are affected but those of their \nspouses and their children. I know nobody in this body wants to see \nthat happen. Whether you represent a State with a large military \npopulation or not, we are all incredibly grateful for the sacrifices \nour military personnel and their families give this country every day.\n  Earlier this week, I cosponsored the bipartisan Ensuring Pay for Our \nMilitary, sponsored by my Republican colleague from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, which would prevent an interruption in the pay for members \nof the military if there is a government shutdown. This is an important \nbill--a must-do bill--but I sincerely hope it is an unnecessary bill.\n  The American people want Members of Congress to work across party \nlines, avoid an irresponsible government shutdown, and move forward on \na sound, comprehensive, and bipartisan plan to put our fiscal house in \norder. The American people don't care if it is a Republican plan or a \nDemocratic plan, they just want it to be a good plan for our country. \nThat is why this week I signed on to the biennial budgeting bill which \nis being led by my Republican colleague, Senator Isakson, and my \nDemocratic colleague, Senator Shaheen. This bill, which will move the \nFederal budget from an every year to every two-year funding process, is \na commonsense, bipartisan approach which will hopefully improve the \npartisan political bickering.\n  I urge my colleagues to come together now and fund our service men \nand women, our VA doctors, our Head Start Programs, and our women's \nhealth care so we can move on to the Nation's No. 1 priority, which is \ntackling our unsustainable national debt.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rose yesterday to talk about the \nconsequences of a budget shutdown, and I rise again today--hours away \nfrom facing that reality.\n  What I cannot understand for the life of me is after having agreed to \n$78 billion in cuts, more than almost 80 percent of the way of where \nour Republican colleagues originally stated they wanted to be--the last \ntime I checked on a negotiation, when someone comes 80 percent of the \nway to where you are, you have done rather well. Yet, even in the face \nof having made those very deep cuts--some of which will clearly affect \nmajor services delivered to individuals in this country, but coming \ntogether for the understanding of what is necessary to both get this \nbudget year done and being able to begin to significantly reduce the \ndeficit--it is still not enough. Why? Because of a driving force in the \nHouse of Representatives on the Republican side that insists on social \nissues that have nothing to do with the budget and keeping the Nation's \nbusiness open and making sure this economy stays on track, and growing \njobs, and putting families back to work.\n  I will talk about that issue in a minute. But, again, I wish to \nrevisit that this isn't about some museums closing on The Mall, even \nthough that in and of itself has a tourism and dollar effect on our \neconomy to all those places throughout the country that would be closed \ndown. This is about businesses here in America.\n  Today the New York Times gave examples of that. It talked about the \nmanufacturing executive whose company supplies goods to Federal \nagencies; the bank loan officers who make mortgages guaranteed by the \nFHA, which is one of the single greatest block drivers of mortgages to \nbe done for middle-class working families; the Wall Street analyst who \ndepends on a steady flow of government data. The Federal Government is \nin and of itself a major driver of the economy and a ripple effect to \nbusinesses across the spectrum in our country, and pulls the plug on \nthe other businesses in America that at the end of the day means jobs \nand at the end of the jobs means a consequence to this fragile economic \nrecovery.\n  That is why the Chamber of Commerce has come out against a shutdown. \nThat is why the Business Roundtable has talked about it. These are \nvoices of those entities that clearly speak with a one-vision business \nsense, and they say a shutdown does not make good business sense for \nAmerica--all, however, risked for some social issues. When the \ngovernment shut down in 1995, the last time Republicans shut down the \nU.S. Government--let's not forget that. I was there in the House of \nRepresentatives when that happened. The last time Republicans shut the \ngovernment down for their ideological views, the Nation's economic \ngrowth was slowed by as much as 1 percent in that quarter--a full \npercent.\n  In an economy that is in recovery--and a recovery, I would remind \npeople, from where we were to where we are--I think there is a little \nhistory we need to remember. I remember in the Clinton years when \nDemocrats balanced the budget for the first time in a generation and \ncreated record surpluses, lower unemployment, low interest rates, and \nthe greatest peacetime economy in over a generation. We had surpluses. \nThe CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, said, We are looking at a 10-\nyear outlook that is bright. We were actually years ahead for not only \nbalancing the budget but from ending debt. And here we are. What \nhappened in between? Tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country \nunder President Bush, two wars unpaid for, a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit unpaid for, Wall Street allowed to run wild, and we went from a \nsurplus with projections of $5.6 trillion in 2011 to the challenges we \nhave today. So I know people want to forget the past, but the past is, \nin part, the reality of our present challenges.\n  At a time in this fragile economic recovery, where we are ultimately \nmeeting the challenges of global events that also affect us here at \nhome--the unrest in the Middle East, the driving up of oil prices which \ndrives up gasoline prices which drives up commodity prices which drives \nup food prices, and, therefore, has a consequence not only to every \nAmerican at the pump but also at the supermarket and in their lives--it \nhas a collective consequence to our economy. What is happening in Japan \nand whether they will be able to send supplies for some of the most \ncritical elements of our economy in the technology field; the millions \nof Americans still looking for work, and we are going to give a \ndomestic body blow, all because of social issues--all because of social \nissues, that doesn't make sense, and it is not necessary. We could have \nconsequences to the markets, the Asian markets. If we close down this \ngovernment, don't open, the Asian markets on Sunday will begin and that \nbegins setting a trend throughout the globe. This has real consequence \nto our economy here at home.\n  It is amazing to me that we have those who wear the uniform of the \nUnited States fighting halfway around the globe and they will continue \nto fight for their country, but they would not be paid. They will earn \nthe pay and eventually they will get it, but while they are in the \nfield they wouldn't get the pay. How about their families here at home \nwho are already suffering not having them with them? All because we are \ndriven by the Republican voices in the House of Representatives over a \nprogram called title X. What is title X? Title X is a law signed by \nPresident Nixon and ultimately had, as one of its strongest supporters \nwhen he was in\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\nthe House of Representatives former President Bush, to provide \nlifesaving health care services for women.\n  Some voices continue to falsely say this is about abortion. The \nFederal law is very clear: No Federal dollars can go for abortion \nservices. No Federal dollars can go for abortion services. This is \nabout an array of confidential preventive health services from \npregnancy testing to screening for cervical and breast cancer, to \nscreening for high blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, screening for \nSTDs, including HIV, basic infertility services, health education. This \nis about the very essence of a woman's ability to get health care if \nshe does not have the wherewithal on her own financial condition to be \nable to go to a doctor. There are many institutions--by the way, \nincluding Catholic and religious institutions--that receive title X \nmoney. I am sure no one would claim they are providing abortion \nservices.\n  Why, when we are looking at the very essence of whether it be my \ndaughter or anyone else's daughter in America, or anybody's wife or \nmother, why is it we must have an ideologically driven issue in the \nmidst of a budget debate? A budget debate is about numbers and it is \nabout making sure services are continued, and it is about making sure \nthe economy continues to prosper and it is about getting people back to \nwork, but it certainly isn't about using an ideological view that this \nprogram which ultimately helps women have preventive health care \nservices is somehow an abortion issue when the law clearly says it \ncannot be under any circumstances. Why would we deny women in this \ncountry the ability to have the health care they need so they can be \nhealthy, so they can continue to prosper, so their families can \ncontinue to have that mother, that breadwinner, the person who holds \nthat family together, be healthy? I cannot imagine for the life of me \nthat we will shut the government down based on those issues. But that \nis, in fact, where we are.\n  When I look at that and when I look at the other elements of what has \nrecently been discussed as a prelude--this is just the opening salvo of \na debate that will continue on. Hopefully, we will have a vote. I am \nready to vote to keep this government open. I am ready to vote to make \nsure those who wear the uniform of the United States are paid when they \nare committing the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of their country. But, \nmore importantly, I wish to be able to vote to have $78 billion worth \nof cuts and, at the same time, make sure this economy continues to move \nforward, continues to grow, continues to put people back to work.\n  I hope cooler minds can prevail in the House and that the ideological \nviews can be told it is not for a budget debate; have that debate some \nother time--have those votes, if you want, another time. That is fine. \nBut do not hold the Nation hostage to that issue. But I see that as \nonly the beginning of what is a broader plan, and that broader plan is \nanother reason why we need to get this budget done so we can move to \nthat other plan in the next fiscal year.\n\n  I commend to my colleagues, as we look at that plan, the column \nwritten today by Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize recipient, entitled \n``Ludicrous and Cruel.'' Basically, he talks about the Ryan plan that \nprivatizes Medicare, that has large tax cuts for the wealthiest people \nin the country, that ultimately doesn't do either one of the things \nthat they suggest, in this column, which I commend to my colleagues. He \nsays:\n\n       In past, Mr. Ryan has talked a good game about taking care \n     of those in need, like Medicare and seniors and Medicaid for \n     children, but as the Center on Budget and Policy priorities \n     points out, of the $4 trillion in spending cuts he proposes \n     over the next decade, two-thirds involve cutting programs \n     that mainly serve low-income Americans.\n\n  Then he goes on to say that it is a continuation of the voodoo \neconomics of the tax cuts for the wealthiest people in the country that \nsupposedly are going to create prosperity, and we saw that simply \nwasn't the case. What it did do is a big part of unraveling the \nsurpluses that Democrats helped to create and drive an enormous amount \nof the debt that we are realizing and debating today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that column be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 7, 2011]\n\n                          Ludicrous and Cruel\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       Many commentators swooned earlier this week after House \n     Republicans, led by the Budget Committee chairman, Paul Ryan, \n     unveiled their budget proposals. They lavished praise on Mr. \n     Ryan, asserting that his plan set a new standard of fiscal \n     seriousness.\n       Well, they should have waited until people who know how to \n     read budget numbers had a chance to study the proposal. For \n     the G.O.P. plan turns out not to be serious at all. Instead, \n     it's simultaneously ridiculous and heartless.\n       How ridiculous is it? Let me count the ways--or rather a \n     few of the ways, because there are more howlers in the plan \n     than I can cover in one column.\n       First, Republicans have once again gone all in for voodoo \n     economics--the claim, refuted by experience, that tax cuts \n     pay for themselves.\n       Specifically, the Ryan proposal trumpets the results of an \n     economic projection from the Heritage Foundation, which \n     claims that the plan's tax cuts would set off a gigantic \n     boom. Indeed, the foundation initially predicted that the \n     G.O.P. plan would bring the unemployment rate down to 2.8 \n     percent--a number we haven't achieved since the Korean War. \n     After widespread jeering, the unemployment projection \n     vanished from the Heritage Foundation's Web site, but voodoo \n     still permeates the rest of the analysis.\n       In particular, the original voodoo proposition--the claim \n     that lower taxes mean higher revenue--is still very much \n     there. The Heritage Foundation projection has large tax cuts \n     actually increasing revenue by almost $600 billion over the \n     next 10 years.\n       A more sober assessment from the nonpartisan Congressional \n     Budget Office tells a different story. It finds that a large \n     part of the supposed savings from spending cuts would go, not \n     to reduce the deficit, but to pay for tax cuts. In fact, the \n     budget office finds that over the next decade the plan would \n     lead to bigger deficits and more debt than current law.\n       And about those spending cuts: leave health care on one \n     side for a moment and focus on the rest of the proposal. It \n     turns out that Mr. Ryan and his colleagues are assuming \n     drastic cuts in nonhealth spending without explaining how \n     that is supposed to happen.\n       How drastic? According to the budget office, which analyzed \n     the plan using assumptions dictated by House Republicans, the \n     proposal calls for spending on items other than Social \n     Security, Medicare and Medicaid--but including defense--to \n     fall from 12 percent of G.D.P. last year to 6 percent of \n     G.D.P. in 2022, and just 3.5 percent of G.D.P. in the long \n     run.\n       That last number is less than we currently spend on defense \n     alone; it's not much bigger than federal spending when Calvin \n     Coolidge was president, and the United States, among other \n     things, had only a tiny military establishment. How could \n     such a drastic shrinking of government take place without \n     crippling essential public functions? The plan doesn't say.\n       And then there's the much-ballyhooed proposal to abolish \n     Medicare and replace it with vouchers that can be used to buy \n     private health insurance.\n       The point here is that privatizing Medicare does nothing, \n     in itself, to limit health-care costs. In fact, it almost \n     surely raises them by adding a layer of middlemen. Yet the \n     House plan assumes that we can cut health-care spending as a \n     percentage of G.D.P. despite an aging population and rising \n     health care costs.\n       The only way that can happen is if those vouchers are worth \n     much less than the cost of health insurance. In fact, the \n     Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2030 the value \n     of a voucher would cover only a third of the cost of a \n     private insurance policy equivalent to Medicare as we know \n     it. So the plan would deprive many and probably most seniors \n     of adequate health care.\n       And that neither should nor will happen. Mr. Ryan and his \n     colleagues can write down whatever numbers they like, but \n     seniors vote. And when they find that their health-care \n     vouchers are grossly inadequate, they'll demand and get \n     bigger vouchers--wiping out the plan's supposed savings.\n       In short, this plan isn't remotely serious; on the \n     contrary, it's ludicrous.\n       And it's also cruel.\n       In the past, Mr. Ryan has talked a good game about taking \n     care of those in need. But as the Center on Budget and Policy \n     Priorities points out, of the $4 trillion in spending cuts he \n     proposes over the next decade, two-thirds involve cutting \n     programs that mainly serve low-income Americans. And by \n     repealing last year's health reform, without any replacement, \n     the plan would also deprive an estimated 34 million \n     nonelderly Americans of health insurance.\n       So the pundits who praised this proposal when it was \n     released were punked. The G.O.P. budget plan isn't a good-\n     faith effort to put America's fiscal house in order; it's \n     voodoo economics, with an extra dose of fantasy, and a large \n     helping of mean-spiritedness.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this is a time to make sure there is a \nvote\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\non this Senate floor on a budget that ends the fiscal year, that \nencapsulates the $78 billion in cuts, that strips out social riders \nthat have nothing to do with the budget, that preserves a woman's \npreventive health care services and moves the country forward in terms \nof its economic advancement, creating jobs and making sure we don't get \nthrust back into a recession.\n  That is what this debate is about. That is what the vote should be \nabout today. I and other members of the Democratic Caucus stand ready \nto do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I can only imagine that the American \npeople who are watching this drama unfold in Washington, DC, are \nscratching their heads and are confused, and are wondering why it is \nthat Congress can't perform one of its most basic functions, which is \nto make sure that the government continues to operate.\n  I am reminded of an adage from the days I practiced law, and then \npresided as a judge in the courtroom: If you can't convince them, \nconfuse them.\n  Whether it is inadvertently or intentionally or by mistake, I think \nthere is a lot of confusion being encouraged and propagated on the \nfloor. The fact of the matter is, there are three things we are talking \nabout. One is the continuing resolution that the House of \nRepresentatives passed and sent over here some time ago, which would \nfund the Federal Government through the end of the fiscal year. That is \none thing.\n  There is a second thing, which is a bill sent over yesterday that \nwould fund the government for 1 more week and the Department of Defense \nfor the remainder of the fiscal year, which the majority leader has the \npower to bring to the floor today and have us vote on this afternoon or \ntonight. But the President of the United States has sent out a veto \nmessage saying he would veto it.\n  Then, the third thing that is being discussed--and it may be the most \nconfusing of all--is when Speaker Boehner says it is all about the \nmoney, and Majority Leader Reid says, no, it is about the policy \nriders--well, I submit that it is about the money. It is not about \nobjections to policy, which 49 of our Democratic friends have voted for \nin the past, which has been signed into law by President Clinton and \nsigned into law by President Obama himself.\n  The real casualties of this dysfunction here, and the inability of \nCongress to get its work done, unfortunately, fall on men and women in \nuniform. In my State, a large Army installation, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, is located in Killeen, TX, at Fort Hood. On November 5, \n2009, a tragedy hit Fort Hood when Major Hassan killed 13 people in \nwhat could only be described as a domestic act of terrorism. Shortly \nafter that, a number of our military who were deployed to Iraq and \nAfghanistan are now in the process of returning. The three corps \nsoldiers are finally returning from Iraq and individuals such as SPC \nKevin Gallagher of Tiger Squadron Calvary Regiment, who is a Purple \nHeart recipient, is just coming back from Iraq. Soldiers of the 20th \nEngineer Battalion and the 36th Engineer Brigade are returning to Fort \nHood from Afghanistan.\n  I wonder what they are thinking now, along with their families, when, \nas a result of the Federal Government dealing with its most basic \nresponsibilities, they are not going to get paid--starting tomorrow--\nunless the majority leader takes up the temporary bill that was passed \nyesterday in the House and sent over here and we vote on it today to \nmake sure our troops and their families continue to get funded, and get \nthe pay they so richly have earned and deserve.\n  We have heard, as I said, a lot of talk about riders. The only thing \nthat is contained in this bill that could be called a policy rider, \nabout which there appears to be confusion, is one that 49 Senate \nDemocrats have voted on in the past--a spending bill with regard to \nabortion funding in the District of Columbia. President Obama has \nsigned it into law, President Clinton signed that into law, and 49 \nSenate Democrats voted for it in the past. Yet this becomes somehow the \nobstacle to paying our troops what they have earned.\n  The argument sounds as if we will not fund our troops like we can't \nfund abortions in the District of Columbia. I think it is a terrible \nshame and I think it galvanizes public opinion about everyone in \nWashington.\n  I think the President and his advisers are wrong if they think a \ngovernment shutdown will help Democrats and help him get reelected and \nhurt Republicans. I think people are saying: a pox on all your houses. \nYou need to work together to solve problems, to cut spending, to cut \nthe deficit, deal with the unsustainable debt, and you need to get on \nwith it now.\n  The fact of the matter is, we continue to spend 40 cents out of every \ndollar in Washington as borrowed money. We know that the debt held by \nthe public--and this is under the President's own budget proposal--\nwould double in 5 years, and it would triple in 10 years, because the \nPresident himself, who is obligated under the Budget Act to send over \nhis requested budget, does nothing to deal with the debt crisis that is \nthreatening our Nation, threatening our prosperity and our freedom.\n  As China continues to loan us money, we are subject to the tender \nmercies of a country that I submit we do not want to be subject to the \ntender mercies of. We need to deal with this.\n  Unfortunately, the President and some of my friends across the aisle \nhave been very critical of the proposed budget of Paul Ryan in the \nHouse. At least he tries to deal with the reality of the hand we have \nbeen dealt, or which some of us have created. The President himself \nignores his own fiscal commission report that came out in December of \n2010.\n  On this chart, here is what the wall of debt looks like, unless we \ndeal with this problem. According to the President's own budget, it \ngets worse and worse. In 1997, it was roughly $5 trillion. Now we are \nlooking at about a $14 trillion debt. If we don't do anything about it, \nif we continue business as usual in Washington and don't cut spending \nand deal with the structural and systemic problems facing us and our \ndebt crisis, it will continue to get worse and worse.\n  This is another sobering chart. This shows when we borrow the money, \nwe have to pay interest to the people who buy that debt. This chart \nshows that the interest paid by 2021--the last year of the President's \nproposed budget--that the amount of money paid in interest, at assumed \nrates, which are now very low, is $931 billion, which is more than \ntransportation, more than defense, and more than Medicare.\n  We have been told by the experts that if interest rates were to go \nup--if, for example, we incur a period of inflation, this number could \nexplode into multiples of this figure, putting us into a death spiral--\neconomically speaking--and we could end up like Greece or Portugal. The \nonly problem is that there is nobody out there to bail out the United \nStates of America. The only one that can stop this is us.\n  Secretary Geithner said the debt limit ceiling has to be raised \nsometime in the period between middle May and July. That is the big \nevent. What we are talking about now is a preliminary skirmish, albeit \nvery important. I will tell you, I do not intend to vote to increase \nthe credit card limit of the Federal Government, unless we can get \nsystemic reform that will deal with this very real problem.\n  One of those ways to do that would be to pass a balanced budget \namendment. All 47 Senators on our side have now agreed to a \nconstitutional amendment provision that would require a balanced \nbudget. We hope our friends across the aisle will join us in passing \nit. The last time this was considered, we came within one vote--in \n1997--of passing a balanced budget amendment. The deficit was $107 \nbillion. Now it is $1.5 trillion. The debt was around $5 trillion and \nnow it is $14 trillion. So if it was compelling enough that it came \nthat close to passage in 1997, how much more compelling now is the \nevidence that we need to pass a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution?\n  In closing, I hope cooler heads will prevail tonight, that those who \nseek political advantage via the game of ``gotcha''--a world class \nsport in Washington, DC--will forbear and allow us to get on with the \nbig fights, which are dealing with this unsustainable debt, these huge \ndeficits, and not threaten the paycheck of the men and women who wear \nthe uniform of the United States, who are fighting three wars\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\naround the world, and whose families are calling my office.\n  Mr. President, I guess they are calling your office and that of the \nSenator from Michigan and New York also, saying: What are you doing, \nand why can't you get this taken care of so that we don't have to add \nthis to our list of burdens while our loved ones are away fighting \nAmerica's wars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 \np.m. the majority leader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague and friend \nfrom Texas about the fact that people are scratching their heads. \nPeople in Michigan are wondering what in the world is going on right \nnow. We are still trying to recover from a recession and we have a long \nway to go for most Americans--even though the unemployment rate has \ncome down substantially in Michigan. At one point, we were at 15.7 \npercent, and that is just what you count, in terms of unemployment. Now \nit is 10.7 percent and going down. Still, it is way too high. Families \nare under water, their houses are under water, and they are trying to \nrecover in terms of their incomes and hold it together and look for new \nwork or job training. And what about the kids in college and all that \ncomes with that? Some in the middle class may be struggling to stay in \nthe middle class, or just get into the middle class.\n  Small businesses are wondering what the heck is going on around here \nwhen they are trying to, hopefully--folks who held on through the \nrecession and trying to come back, trying to invest, keep the doors \nopen, hire more people--they are wondering what in the world is going \non here.\n  We are in a situation where these negotiations have now just become \nso political and the discussion so unrelated to what the budget is \nabout and, most importantly, to what people care about. The political \npiece of this now, about pulling in issues around women's health care, \nis distracting us from getting a 6-month budget done, which is \ndistracting us from what we ought to be talking about, which is jobs \nand the economy and putting people back to work and supporting small \nbusinesses to get the capital they need to grow. We are in a situation \nnow where the whole process has been politicized to the point where it \nis extremely disappointing to me and extremely concerning.\n  What the bottom line ends up being is that middle-class families, \nveterans concerned about their disability claims, or seniors concerned \nabout their Social Security or Medicare claims, or small businesses \nthat are putting together loan applications or somebody trying to close \non their house with FHA is being held hostage to politics that have \nnothing to do with the budget.\n  This latest distraction over breast cancer screenings and cervical \ncancer screenings for women and girls is just another in a long list of \ndistractions from the budget crisis and, most importantly, from the \nfocus that we need to have on creating jobs.\n  We have all agreed that Washington, just like every family, has to \nchange the way it does business, has to focus on cutting the items that \nare not important, to focus on what is important. Every dollar that is \nbeing paid, every taxpayer giving a dollar has found it is a lot harder \nto earn that dollar than to give that dollar. We better be taking care \nof that dollar, stretching it as far as possible and focusing it on the \nthings that are most important because those dollars are hard to come \nby these days. That is the reality.\n  We have come together. It has been a long time in coming, but we have \ncome together. We have agreed on significant spending cuts, changes, \nwhile keeping a focus on education, innovation, and growth of the \nfuture. Now, at the eleventh hour, all of a sudden what was agreed to \nin terms of significant spending cuts to allow us to bring the budget \ntogether and focus on deficit reduction, somehow that is gone and we \nare now talking about whether women's health care will be funded in \nthis country, whether women are going to be able to receive blood \npressure checks, cancer screenings, and other preventive care efforts.\n  Is that really what this is about? Are we really going to hold \nmiddle-class families, small businesses, and veterans hostage over \nblood pressure checks for women and cancer screenings for women? \nReally? Is that what this is about? Stunning. This is absolutely \nstunning.\n  In the great State of Michigan, women's health clinics that at this \npoint are proposed for elimination provided 55,000 cancer screenings \nlast year, and there were 3,800 abnormal results. Women who found out \nthose results early were able to detect their cancers early and get the \ntreatment they needed to save their lives. It could be your mom, your \ngrandmother, your daughter, your friend, your neighbor, somebody at \nchurch.\n  Is this really about telling women in communities across Michigan--in \nMarquette, Muskegon, Burton, Owosso, Three Rivers--that they cannot get \ntheir breast cancer screenings; telling women in Flint, Grand Rapids, \nYpsilanti, and Sturgis that they cannot get their cervical cancer \nscreenings; telling women in Warren, Brighton, Big Rapids, and Battle \nCreek that they cannot get their blood pressure checked or their \ncholesterol tested? Are Republicans really planning to shut down the \ngovernment and hold middle-class families and veterans hostage in order \nto stop breast cancer screenings and cholesterol checks? Unbelievable. \nI think it is shameful.\n  It is time to come together and get this budget done. As I understand \nit, there was an agreement last night on the level of spending cuts. We \nneed to get this done and move on to the real focus and debate we need \nto be having about how we grow the economy and compete in a global \neconomy.\n  There could be a lesson learned from what people in my State have \ngone through and done in the last couple of years. We did not give up \non the American automobile industry. With the support and help of our \nPresident and Members here, despite some incredibly tough times and \ndifficulties in terms of cutting back that had to take place, we did \nnot give up. Workers sacrificed cutting starting pay in half; retirees, \nthe companies, the shareholders, communities, everybody got together \nand said: We know there is a big problem, and we are going to get this \nfixed, and we are going to sacrifice together.\n  Then we did an important thing with the support of people here, and I \nam very grateful for it. We said: We are going to invest like crazy in \ninnovation. Because we did that, that combination of resetting the \nbudget and the finances for the auto industry and then investing in \ninnovation with the great help of our wonderful engineers and skilled \nlabor force and a whole lot of smart people who came together with \nbattery investments and retooling loans and are bringing jobs back from \nMexico now and investments in new advanced manufacturing, we are not \nonly growing and for the first time since 1999 the American companies \nare making a profit, but we are winning the awards. We are winning all \nthe awards for top quality, the great vehicles of the future.\n  I suggest that would be a good model for us: Come together on what we \nneed to do, push the reset button, come together and get our arms \naround spending, balance the budget, tackle the deficit, and then \ninvest like crazy in the future, in innovation and education and \nrebuilding America.\n  Where we are today is extremely concerning to me because instead of \ntalking about how we compete in a global economy, instead of talking \nabout the United States vs. China, which is what we should be talking \nabout, or Germany, India, or Korea, we are at a place where we are \ntalking about whether the Federal budget and middle-class families will \nbe held hostage in order to stop cancer screenings and research for \nwomen in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I urge we come together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the budget issues we \nare facing, the continuing resolution--all the issues that have been \ntalked about over the last week or so. Oftentimes when I speak on the \nSenate floor, I talk about what it is like back home in\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\nNebraska. I do so because I am enormously proud of my State. It just \nseems our State does so many things right. Again today I am going to \ntake a moment or two to get started and talk a little bit about that \nand my experience in dealing with budget issues.\n  I had the great honor at one point to serve a couple terms as mayor \nof a great city, the community of Lincoln, NE. It was a strong mayoral \nform of government. Each year I would have the responsibility of \npreparing a budget and submitting it to a seven-person city council \nthat would take it apart and put it back together. I would work with \nthem to get a budget done.\n  It never occurred to me that as mayor of that city I had the ability \nnot to do a budget. I cannot imagine walking into a state of the city \naddress and saying to the good people of Lincoln that after giving it \nsome thought, I decided that it was going to be a situation where I \nwould not be submitting a budget for consideration of the city council. \nIt just never occurred to me.\n  I look at that community today led by a mayor who is very capable. It \nhappens to be of the other political party than I am. That community \nhas the lowest unemployment rate of any community in the United States. \nWhy? Because people take a pretty conservative view of things. In fact, \nin preparing that budget, we would literally go item by item, police \ncars, police salaries, fire engines, whatever, and literally list them \nitem by item and then the amount. At some point there would be a line \ndrawn through the page where we had spent all of the money we had, all \nof the money available that year was spent. Everything below that line \nwas not funded. If I went below that line or a council member did and \nsaid: We want more done here, we want to fund that item, then we had to \ngo above the line and find the money in another program or we had to \nraise taxes. Those were the choices we had.\n  After that, I had the great honor of serving the State of Nebraska as \nits Governor for two terms. Actually, the budget process did not differ \nthat much. Each year as Governor I would submit at the start of the \nyear a budget to our Nebraska unicameral. I would deliver a state of \nthe State address where I would talk about priorities or budget issues, \nwhatever I chose to talk about as Governor.\n  There were three things I could guarantee the citizens each year: No. \n1, that a budget would be submitted and it would be approved; No. 2, we \nwould not borrow any money--any money--to balance that budget because \nour constitution essentially prohibits elected officials at the State \nlevel from borrowing money; and No. 3 was that the budget would, in \nfact, be balanced.\n  We did not have the option of going out to the bond market and \nissuing debt to mask the lack of discipline to get the spending under \ncontrol. We, again, had just a few choices: Choice No. 1 was we could \ncut spending; choice No. 2 was we could raise taxes; and choice No. 3 \nwas we could do some of both. I always favored the cut spending piece \nbecause if revenues were down, it told me that people were earning less \nand they were spending less, and because of that, less money was coming \ninto the State treasury. Why should I as Governor go out and beat them \nup some more by raising their taxes?\n  I, as you know, spent a 3-year period of time as Secretary of \nAgriculture. I was given a budget by the Congress, and it never \noccurred to me I should spend more than what was allocated to me. I \nwould always tell my subcabinet and my cabinet, when I was Governor: \nLook, this isn't magic, it is math. If the math doesn't work, then we \nhave to come to grips with this.\n\n  With all due respect to my colleagues who have come to the floor \nthroughout the day and have talked about what this process is or isn't, \nand whether funding is going to be done for this program or what rider \nis there, all I want to say is this: What we are finally focused on in \nthis great Nation is what we should have been focused on decades ago; \nthat is, we are spending more than is coming in. Every dollar overspent \nis put on a credit card, and it doesn't go away. It won't be canceled \nat my death.\n  I have been going across our State with charts and graphs to try to \nillustrate this point. I turned 60 this year. When I was a 20-year-old \nman, our government owed $380 billion. Now, I am sure at that point in \ntime many argued that was way too much debt. The projections now are--\nunder President Obama's plan--by the end of this decade, on my 65th \nbirthday, we will owe $20 trillion. So in the span of one lifetime--one \nlifetime--we have gone from $380 billion to $20 trillion.\n  Mr. President, that has consequences. Now, maybe that doesn't have \nconsequences for a man who is 60 years old--maybe it does; I believe it \ndoes--but beyond the shadow of a doubt, no matter which side you want \nto be on, it has consequences for our children and grandchildren.\n  So you see, it isn't about an individual rider, an individual \nprogram. It is about the fact that we are spending this great Nation \ninto an absolutely hopeless abyss. If we don't come to grips with that, \nif we don't come to grips with this, this won't turn out, and it won't \nturn out for anybody.\n  When I came here 2 years ago, I was stuck. Every conversation was, \nhow do we spend more? I thought there would be a stimulus package when \nI was elected to the Senate. I thought maybe it would even be a package \nthat I would support. Then somebody said it had to be a $500 billion \npackage, all borrowed money, and I started getting real squeamish about \nthat. Then somebody outbid them and said: No, I think it has to be a \n$750 billion package. Then I really got squeamish, and I knew I \ncouldn't support that. Then someone raised the ante, and by the time \nthis was all done, with interest, we borrowed from China and other \nplaces $1 trillion. And I thought, my goodness, will we take a breather \nat some point? But there was no breather. There was a health care bill \nwith more gimmicks and scoring than you can possibly imagine.\n  So here we are today, fighting over whether this continuing \nresolution should be $30 billion in cuts or $60 billion in cuts. Quite \nhonestly, in the grand scheme of what our Nation is facing, that is \npitiful. It is almost tragic. If we don't come to grips with this soon, \nthe big picture, this absolutely is going to destroy any future that \nour kids and grandkids might have hoped for in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  But hope springs eternal. I look at the glass as half full all the \ntime. I think we are going to get through this. I think we will deal \nwith the issues before us--maybe in ways some like, some dislike--but \nif we don't come together somehow, some way, and deal with what the \nreal issue is--that we are spending a great nation into the Stone Age--\nwe are going to be a lesser nation than any of us could have ever \nimagined, and that affects every priority. That affects Medicaid, \nSocial Security, education, national defense, homeland security--you \nname your priority, it affects it all.\n  So today I count myself as one who wants to come down to the floor at \nsome point before the day is out and vote to solve this problem, but \nthen I want to do all I can to work with my colleagues to deal with \nwhat is really facing us, which is debt that is out of control, \nspending that is out of control, with a situation where no budget was \nsubmitted and not a single appropriations bill. That is where we find \nourselves today, trying to patch this together because we didn't come \nto grips with the budget process last year. Mr. President, that doesn't \nseem right to me.\n  With that, Mr. President, I conclude my remarks, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to ask a simple question: \nWhat are we doing here? What are we doing jeopardizing our economic \nrecovery to score political points?\n  I happen to agree with my friend and colleague from Nebraska. I am \noptimistic also in that we have agreed on a $78 billion reduction in \nthe 2011 budget. The glass isn't half full, it is more than three-\nquarters full. They are grandstanding over the Federal budget when we \nshould be focusing on making sure American families can make their \nmonthly budgets and get back to work.\n  I am here to downplay the need to cut the Federal deficit. I agree \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--we need to make real \ncuts now. We have already committed to the deepest cuts in \ndiscretionary spending since World War II. Given that we are already \nhalfway through the fiscal year,\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\nthese cuts are a good downpayment on even more progress in our fiscal \n2012 budget and beyond.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I am already putting \nforth concrete recommendations for more cuts in future budget years, \nsuch as eliminating the ``orphan earmarks,'' saving upwards of $1 \nbillion; cutting subsidies for millionaire farmers, saving, again, \nbillions of dollars; cutting tax loopholes, saving tens of billions of \ndollars.\n  Shutting down the government is not going to get us any closer to the \nreal goal of reducing the deficit. We didn't save a single dime during \nthe last shutdown. In fact, it cost the American taxpayers $1.4 \nbillion.\n  The economic costs will be even more. Dozens of military construction \nprojects are stalled right now, putting at risk hundreds of jobs this \nsummer and needed improvements to Alaska's military bases. I have \ntalked to these contractors, these individuals who are waiting for us \nto get our work done to provide the certainty they need to get their \nwork done. There is over $\\1/4\\ billion pending and waiting for the \nwork to be done.\n  Military families are also caught in the middle. The military will \nget paid, but the uncertainty of when they will get paid, because they \nwill be waiting on us to pass a bill, is unfair. We should push harder \nto work out a compromise for them.\n  At the same time, civilian construction projects and the jobs created \nby them for docks, housing, and facilities are also at risk. Critical \ncontracts to move forward on the land transfers to the State of Alaska \nand Alaska Native Corporations will not get done in time for the summer \nwork.\n  Alaska businesses looking to start new operations won't be able to \nget the SBA loans, families won't get the FHA or the USDA home loans, \nand the tax refunds for people who have sent in their taxes by mail \nwon't be processed.\n  Also, key permits to onshore oil and gas development, which have been \npainfully slow to move forward, will be stalled even further.\n  When I was home during this past week, I heard from some of the more \nthan 17,000 Federal workers in Alaska about their concerns. It might be \neasy for some to criticize public employees, but in Alaska these \nworkers are members of our communities. They contribute to our economy, \npay taxes, and they provide critical services all across my State. Many \nare getting by paycheck to paycheck. A shutdown could mean their rent \ndoesn't get paid, their mortgages are put at risk, and their bank \naccounts won't balance. We cannot and should not play politics with \ntheir jobs just because we are not doing our job.\n  Americans--Alaskans--are frustrated. They are wondering what the heck \nwe are doing here, and I agree with them. It has only been 3 months \nsince the new Congress convened. Not much to report back home to \nAlaskans who work every day making progress in our State.\n  It is past time to get back to work, to roll up our sleeves, finish \nthis budget, and put the 2012 budget on the table and focus on the \neconomy and creating jobs. Our economy is starting to turn the corner. \nFrankly, the many steps Congress took over the last 2 years to rebuild \nthis economy are working. Unemployment dipped to 8.8 percent, 216,000 \njobs were created last month--the largest increase since last May--and \nTARP, which we all had mixed feelings about, is not only being paid \nback. It is returning a profit to the Federal Government.\n  Let's not put a wrench in our economic recovery. These are good data \npoints, but we are far from getting the job done. The economy is still \nfragile. Rising gas prices make it harder. We need to show voters and \nthe folks back home we can work together on deficit reduction but also \ntackle energy legislation, tax reform, small business support, and \neducation investment.\n  I know it will not be easy to get all this done, but this is what \nfolks in my State sent me here to do--to get the work done, balance the \nbudget, reduce spending, and continue to invest in growing our economy. \nI always tell Alaskans when I get back home that all the easy issues \nare done. Only the hard ones are left. That is why we are here.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to get back to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2314-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2314-S2319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a period for \nmorning business for debate only be extended until 6 p.m., with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the \nmajority leader to be recognized at 6 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as so many of \nmy colleagues have, to discuss the situation we find ourselves in. Many \nask: What has happened? Why are we here? Why is there so much coverage \nand concern about a potential shutdown of the United States Government?\n  I was on a radio station report from Washington by phone to Wyoming \nearlier this morning with a friend of mine, and he was asking how we \ngot into this situation and what we can do about it.\n  Well, there are two different situations we are in. One is, we are in \nthis situation because a budget, a responsible budget, that should have \nbeen passed 7 months ago--when the Democrats were in charge of the \nHouse, in charge of the Senate, and in the White House--was never \npassed. That is what we are dealing with today in one part.\n  The bigger part of how we got into this situation is that we are a \nnation in significant debt. We owe a remarkably large amount of money--\n$14 trillion is the number that is consistently discussed. Very few \npeople have a concept of exactly how much money that is. Yet we owe \nthat amount of money. People say: Who do we owe it to? I visited with a \ngroup of high school students from Douglas, WY, earlier this week, and \nI asked them: Do you know who we owe the money to? They said: Yeah, we \nowe a lot of it to China.\n  That is of great concern to the people of America, people concerned \nabout national security, our financial security, and how we as a nation \nare viewed in the world, as well as how we view ourselves.\n  As families across this country, we live within our means. We balance \nour budgets every year. I am from Wyoming, where, according to our \nconstitution, we must balance our budget every year, and we do. That is \nwhy we have money available for scholarships and other opportunities \nfor young people, as we invest the money that we have saved from year \nto year in our people, in our future, in our communities, and in our \nland. Yet Washington doesn't seem to learn that lesson, even today.\n  So here we are with this situation where we are looking at a \npotential shutdown of the government because this government has maxed \nout its credit card. Others may decide to no longer extend credit to \nus, and it has come down to the final hour.\n  Every day this government spends $4 billion more than it takes in. \nLast month, Washington spent eight times as much money as it took in. \nEvery American child is now born owing $45,000. This is a travesty. \nWhen I take a look at this and say, we know now how we got into this \nsituation: We have overspent. Our problem is not that we are taxed too \nlittle, it is that we spend too much. The American people understand \nthat. So what we need to do is get the spending under control. We need \nto spend less.\n  We are in a situation where you say, what can we do about it right \nnow, today? Well, for those same high school students who are here from \nDouglas, WY, they know a bill starts in the House and then goes to the \nSenate, and is passed by one body, passed by another body, goes to the \nPresident for his signature. So here we are. We do have a bill that has \nbeen passed by the House of Representatives to keep the government \nopen, to keep the government functioning. I am ready right now to vote \nfor that bill.\n  What has the President of the United States said about that? The \nPresident has threatened to veto that bill. He said he would veto a \nbill that would temporarily extend and keep the government open for 1 \nweek. So apparently the President is not interested in keeping this \ngovernment open for the next week through tonight at midnight.\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\n  I would wish he would take a different tack and say, let's continue \nto work on the overall problem but keep the government functioning. You \nknow, families all around this country--and I talk to people every \nweekend in Wyoming--are worried about the cost and the quality of their \nown lives. When they look at this incredible debt coming out of \nWashington, they say, how is this going to continue to impact us? The \nfamilies all around Wyoming and around the country and the States are \nfinding they are going to pay about $700 more for fuel this year than \nthey did last year because of the pain at the pump.\n  Of course, I believe that is made worse by the policies of this \nadministration. But for families who have kids and with bills and a \nmortgage, $700 increased gasoline prices impacts them in the money they \nhave available for other things. So it is a direct impact on the \nquality of their lives. They are looking back here to Washington \nsaying, what are those people doing?\n  I had a call yesterday in my office from a man in the military. He \nsaid, why are they not going to continue to fund the military? Well, \nthat is part of the bill that has passed the House that will continue \nto keep the military funded, functioning. He said, you know, I am not \nworried about me. He said, I am worried about these younger guys, the \nnewer ones in the military, the men and woman who may have a young \nfamily. I want to make sure they are taken care of. He said, do not \nworry about me. Worry about them. Think about each and every one of \nthose young men and women who are in uniform defending our country.\n  Why would the President say: If you pass what the House has passed--\nwhich does cut some spending and keeps the military functioning--I will \nveto it? That is what the President of the United States said, he would \nveto it. Rather than keep everything functioning and fund the military, \nthe President has said he would veto it because it was only a 1-week \nextension, so that all of the other issues could be worked out.\n  Remember, all we are talking about is this year's budget. We are now \nat 7 months into the fiscal year. This is something that should have \nbeen done last year. But the Democrats have absolutely failed to live \nup to their obligations of passing a budget. Certainly failed the \nobligations of living within the budget. But there is a proposal today \nto keep the government open, to fund the troops, and yet I hear the \nPresident of the United States say no.\n  There has been discussion on this floor about things that are called \npolicy riders. It was interesting because today in Politico, there is a \nheadline: ``Dems Embraced Policy Riders in the Past.''\n  What sort of policy riders? When I hear on the floor: Oh, no, policy \nriders are all bad. Well, the repeal of a school voucher program in the \nDistrict of Colombia. That was a policy rider in the past. Travel to \nCuba, that was a policy that Democrats put in in the past. And it \nmentions a project--they call it a pet project--of the majority leader. \nIt says: Delaying the development of Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste \nstorage site, as part of a policy rider on a budget bill issue.\n  So this is something that, to me is not new, to this body is not new. \nWhat is new is that the President of the United States has threatened \nto veto and to shut down the government of this country because he will \nnot deal with a bill that will fund our troops, and will make cuts in \nspending because it is for a time-limited issue, and at a time when we \nought to say, let's keep the government open and let us fund the \nmilitary.\n  Who, in fact, would be wanting for there to be a shutdown? I am not \nlooking for that sort of thing. And then I see there is someone who has \nactually been rooting for a shutdown. It is the former chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee, Howard Dean. These are the things that \nhe said about a shutdown. He said: ``If I was head of the Democratic \nNational Committee, I would be quietly rooting for it.''\n  He went on to say: ``From a partisan point of view, I think it would \nbe best thing in the world to have a shutdown.'' Is that what we need, \na partisan point of view? What we need are solutions for America.\n  I see that there are colleagues on the floor ready to speak. So with \nthat, I ask that we come to a solution, deal with the issues of the \nincredible amount of debt, keep the government going, pass what has \npassed the House, fund the troops, cut the spending and get this to the \nPresident to sign.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wanted to take the floor for a few \nminutes to talk about where I was supposed to be today, which is \nDenver, CO, not on this floor, because we were hosting a townhall \nmeeting in Denver, Mark Udall and I were, to discuss our long-term \ndeficit and debt problems.\n  We had invited Senator Simpson from Wyoming--my colleague from \nWyoming just spoke--a great Republican Senator, the co-chair of the \nPresident's Deficit and Debt Commission, to Denver for this session. He \nagreed to come.\n  The former head of the Office and Management and Budget got on a \nplane, flew to Denver, they agreed to come, and some others. More \nimportant than that, we put this out to the public, and it was almost \nimmediately oversubscribed so many people wanted to get in, to have a \nreal conversation, an authentic conversation, about what we were going \nto do finally to dig out from underneath this incredible deficit and \ndebt we face.\n  I inconvenienced a lot of people inviting them to Denver. But they \nare happy to do it anyway because they are so committed to this set of \nissues, and they think having a conversation in the center of our \ncountry, in our Rocky Mountain West about these issues may allow some \ncommon sense to prevail.\n  But the inconvenience they suffered by traveling to Denver is \nnothing, nothing compared to the inconvenience, to say the least, that \nthe American people are going to suffer if this government shuts down. \nIt is not just 850,000 Federal employees. The fact that we have got \ntroops deployed all across the globe, small businesses trying to get \nloans from the SBA, homeowners, or people who hope to become \nhomeowners, trying to get a mortgage through the FHA, all of that will \nshut down if this government shuts down. Not to mention the fact we \nhave been told that the shutdown will cost our economy at least $8 \nbillion a week, if this government is shut down, and .2 percent of GDP \ngrowth for every week this government is shut down, just at a time when \nour economy is starting to show some sign of life.\n  I have said on the floor over the last couple of days that no local \ngovernment official in my State, none, zero, Republican or Democrat, \nwould ever say, we are going to close the government. We have decided \nthat we cannot get along, we cannot agree, we cannot figure it out, so \nthe city and County of Denver is going to close, the city of Grand \nJunction will close, or the school district is going to close. No one \nin Colorado would think to say that to their constituents and we should \nnot think about it either. But some people say, wow, there must be some \nincredibly significant disagreement that is keeping the House and the \nSenate from working together to get this done, Republicans and \nDemocrats from working together, to get this done.\n  Last night I brought a slide to show what that disagreement looks \nlike. This was yesterday. I have heard some people say that there is \nagreement on the number of cuts we are going to make today and last \nnight. But yesterday, the parties were several billion dollars apart. \nThat is what was said. So I made a chart that showed the American \npeople what that meant, and $7 billion is what I assigned to the \ndifference. That is probably more than the difference was. It is \ncertainly more than it is today. That is a lot of money, by the way. \nBut we have a $3.5 trillion operating budget, and a $1.6 trillion \ndeficit.\n\n  I wanted to show what the dispute looked like compared to our \ndeficit, and compared to our operating budget. And, sorry, but I could \nnot fit it on one chart. It actually is on two charts. I could not get \nit enough charts or hold them together, because this is the operating \nbudget over here. I would need two more of these posters on top of this \nto be able to show you the relationship between the so-called dispute \nand our operating budget.\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\n  I have spent half my life in business and half my life working in \nlocal government. I can tell you that this is a meaningless dispute, \nutterly meaningless. Look at it. It has nothing to do with our long-\nterm deficit and debt problem. It has nothing to do with what the good \npeople in Colorado are talking about today at the forum that I am not \ngoing to be able to attend.\n  So in view of that, it seems to me that taking the risk of closing \nour government down, charging our economy an $8 billion note every \nweek, and concerning our troops, who should not be worried about \nwhether they are going to get a paycheck, makes no sense at all.\n  My hope is this--I see other colleagues on the floor--that the \nleadership of both parties in the Senate and the House and our \nPresident, in the next several hours, will seal a deal that makes sure \nour government stays open.\n  But beyond that, to all of my colleagues in this body, looking \nforward to the negotiation we are going to have on the debt ceiling, \nlooking forward to the negotiation we are going to have on our deficit \nand our debt, I hope we can come together and agree on a process and a \nstructure that actually leads us to agreement rather than one that \nleads us in the direction we have been in over the last 2 or 3 weeks.\n  Our country simply cannot afford for us not to get our job done and \nbe distracted by disagreements that are meaningless to people in their \ndaily lives. I know we can do better. I know we can do better as \nDemocrats and Republicans. And once we get through this, I want to say, \nI will do absolutely everything I can to build bipartisan support for a \nsolution to our fiscal problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if the differences are meaningless maybe \nour Democratic colleague would agree and we would have an agreement if \nit is so insignificant. But it is not totally insignificant.\n  If you take $61 billion in spending down from the baseline as the \nHouse legislation that they have passed and sent here does, it reduces \nspending by $61 billion. If you do that, it reduces the baseline $61 \nbillion. My staff on the Budget Committee has calculated that would \nsave $860 billion over 10 years. Those numbers have not been disputed.\n  In fact, it does make a difference. We are on the wrong trajectory. \nWe need to get on the right trajectory. Our Democratic colleagues, it \nseems, have to be dragged, kicking and screaming out of denial and into \nthe reality that we are spending too much. We are running up too much \ndebt.\n  I am pleased to see they have agreed to consider these proposals and \nhave passed a couple of continuing resolutions to fund the government \nat a slightly lower level. That is progress.\n  We have avoided shutdowns to this date. Hopefully we can avoid \nanother one. But if we have another short-term agreement today, it is \nnowhere close to what is needed to put our country on a sound financial \ncourse. We have been warned we are facing another recessions if we do \nnot change. That is what we have got to do. This spasm has come about \nbecause our Democratic colleagues' failed to pass a budget last year. \nThey did not even bring a budget to the floor.\n  They passed not a single appropriations bill last year on the floor \nof the Senate and still have not brought to the floor any legislation \nto even begin to form a budget for this year and to propose any funding \nfor the last 6 months of this fiscal year. We haven't seen legislation \nabout that. They want to meet in secret and talk and negotiate.\n  The House has passed legislation that funds the government, that \nfunds the military through the end of the year, reduces $61 billion. \nThey have also sent legislation over that says: OK, we will do 1 more \nweek with a small reduction of $12 billion, and we will fund the \nmilitary. And let's do that if you don't want to agree to the full \nagreement for the rest of the year.\n  The lack of action is only in one Chamber; that is, this Chamber. Has \nthe Senate proposed any new legislation? No. I am saying this really \nnot quite as critically as it probably sounds; our colleagues just have \nnot comprehended the plain fact that business as usual is over. They \nthink this country can continue to spend the way we have been doing. \nThey think these huge deficits can be funded out of thin air without \nconsequence, that we can borrow unlimited amounts--$1.6 trillion to \nfund the government this year, borrow that without consequence. They \nthink the American people will not support and will defeat Members of \nCongress who tell the truth about the condition we are in and who have \nthe gumption to take real steps to reduce spending. They think it is \ninconceivable that our government spending levels can actually be \nreduced. They think if they plan a 3-percent increase in spending and \nit gets increased only 1 percent, the government has suffered a 2-\npercent cut. That is the way they talk about it. That is why we are \nbroke, that kind of accounting. They think the government can create \nmoney, create wealth out of nothing. We can just pass a law, and it \nbecomes so. They ignore the fact that debts must be paid and interest \non our debt has to be paid.\n  Expert after expert has told the Congress, has written papers and \narticles and op-eds, that we are on an unsustainable path. There is not \none expert I know of who would deny that the budget submitted to the \nCongress just a few weeks ago by the President is sound. Indeed, \nPresident Obama's choice to head the debt commission, Erskine Bowles, \nwhen the budget was first announced, said it is nowhere close to what \nis needed to avoid our fiscal nightmare. This is a man he appointed to \nhead the debt commission who has spent weeks and months taking \ntestimony about the financial condition of America, the man he asked to \nsum up the kind of problem we have and how to get out of it.\n  The American people understand it. They have been shocked by the \nirresponsibility shown by Congress. They have been shocked by what we \nhave been doing. Four years ago, our deficit was $162 billion. It \njumped to 450. Then the next year it was $1.3 trillion; the next year, \n$1.2 trillion. The next year, this year, on September 30, it is \nprojected to be $1.5 or $1.6 trillion. We are on a completely \nunsustainable course. President Obama's budget, as scored by the CBO, \nshows that in the 10th year the projected deficit would be $1.2 \ntrillion. This year, we take in $2.2 trillion and we spend $3.7 \ntrillion. Forty percent of what we are spending this year is borrowed. \nThat is why this is an unsustainable course. There is no other \nalternative than to acknowledge that.\n  The American people have sent letters, e-mails, telegrams, phone \ncalls, attended town meetings, had conferences to try to save this \ncountry we love from the fiscal nightmare Chairman Bowles said awaits \nus if we don't take real action. Is there something wrong with that? \nShould they not be upset with Congress going down a path without any \nattempt to get off it, with the most reckless debts we have ever seen \nin the history of America and with no end in sight?\n  These concerned Americans, many of whom have not been active \npolitically before, did one more thing: They went to the polls and \nvoted. They voted for new candidates they felt would take the action \nnecessary to protect America from financial disaster and to defend the \nbedrock of our legal system--the Constitution. The result was a \ncolossal and historic shellacking from the big spenders.\n  Those who said: Things are fine. We in Washington will take care of \nyou. Don't question us. We will pass a Federal takeover of health care. \nI know you don't want it, but we know better. Isn't that what they \nsaid? We are progressives. We are smart. We are educated, more than \nyou. We know deficits don't really matter. Countries have deficits all \nthe time. While you don't understand, we know we have to bail out these \nbankers and these financiers, these Wall Street big shots, because \nprinciples of responsibility and accountability don't really apply \nbecause we know better. We are smarter. Your old principles are fuddy-\nduddy. Following the rules is not important. Rules don't have fixed \nmeanings. The Constitution doesn't really apply. It is old. It is out \nof date. Just leave us alone with your money and the power to borrow, \nand we will take care of you. Trust us. That didn't sit well with the \nAmerican people this last election.\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\nThey sent a message, in my opinion, that was crystal clear.\n  So should anybody be surprised, should there be any surprise that 64 \nnew Members of Congress who had run and won elections promising to do \nsomething about reckless spending didn't rubberstamp the Senate and the \nPresident's proposal to fund increased funding for the rest of the \nfiscal year, that they insisted that reductions occur and sent over a \n$61 billion reduction, which, out of a $3,700 billion budget, is not \nmuch, about 1 percent? States are reducing spending far more than that.\n  We have a choice, don't we? What is the choice? Business as usual or \ntaking the tough steps like Governors, mayors, counties commissioners, \nand families are making this very moment. Our Governor in Alabama \nannounced a 15-percent reduction in spending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This $61 billion doesn't come close to that. It is 1 or \n2 percent of total government spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about decisions we need to \nmake about cutting spending, decisions we need to make now.\n  The Congress and the White House have not agreed on how much spending \nneeds to be cut or where the cuts need to come from, but at least we \ncan all agree that spending does need to be cut. Republican and \nDemocratic administrations and Congresses for decades have continually \nincreased Federal spending. Change is hard. It can be painful. That is \nbecause we have lots of ideas for great programs that would really help \npeople out. But it is absolutely essential that our spending habits \ntake a 180-degree turn starting right now.\n  Tonight at midnight, the government will shut down if Congress does \nnot pass a continuing resolution. This situation can be avoided if \ndecisions are made in the next several hours.\n  The House approved a temporary plan yesterday to fund the government \nfor another week while a longer term deal was worked out. That plan \nalso funds our military through September. It includes language the \nDemocrats have approved in the past and the President has signed. But \nthe full Senate--all Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike--has not \nbeen allowed a chance to vote on it.\n  In the Senate, we don't always agree on every line included in a \ngiven bill, and we don't get a chance to vote on every line included in \na given bill, but I will venture to say most of us can agree on some of \nthem. We can all agree that a government shutdown is not an outcome \nanyone wants.\n  The bottom line is that talk is cheap, and it is time to stop talking \nabout passing a continuing resolution and take action. Actually, it is \naction that should have happened last September. Then we could be \nworking on the next year instead of the last year. The House-passed \nbill gives us such an opportunity. It is the only bill that provides \nfunding for the troops, funds the government, and continues the \npractice of cutting spending.\n  We are in this position because we do not have a budget from last \nyear, and we do not have completed funding bills for the current fiscal \nyear. The current fiscal year started last October 1--not January 1, \nlast October 1. We were supposed to get that finished up in September \nso that agencies know what they are going to be spending for the next \nfiscal year beginning October 1. Without action, the agencies get to \nspend a proportionate amount of what they spent the previous year.\n  This year, we haven't had nearly the pressure to get a budget done \nthat we have had in previous years. But it is easy to know why. The \nprevious year, the spending increased by 18 percent. So agencies get to \ncontinue spending at 18 percent above previous levels until we do \nsomething about it.\n  It is far too late to do what we should have done last September, \nwhich is make drastic cuts. We have already had 6 months of additional \nspending, which makes it a little tougher at this time of year because \nany spending cuts have to be taken out of the total year's revenue \nbeginning now. So a 50-percent decrease in an overall budget now is \ntough because it is taken from funding for the remainder of the fiscal \nyear. I am an accountant, so I like to explain how funding cuts work.\n  I am especially concerned about our men and women in uniform who are \nputting their lives on the line for this country. They will be paid \ndespite the shutdown, but their compensation should not have to be \ndelayed. They don't hesitate to defend this country, and we should not \nhesitate to return that loyalty. I strongly support efforts to make \nsure military personnel and their families are paid without delay if \nthe government shuts down.\n  I am hearing from servicemembers and their families in Wyoming. They \nare worried about paying the rent, paying the bills, feeding their \nchildren. Some have recently been transferred and are dealing with the \nexpense of moving their families across country or, in some cases, back \nto the United States. They do not know where the backpay will come from \nand are not sure what to tell their landlords or their banks. They want \nand deserve answers.\n\n  For some time, we have been talking about reining in spending and \nmaking sure our grandchildren are not saddled with the enormous debt \nthis country is facing. What we need to do in Washington is live within \nour means. We have not been doing that, and it shows. We have a $14 \ntrillion debt, and it is growing daily. Does anybody know what 1 \ntrillion is? I will tell you a good start: Write the number ``14'' and \nput 12 zeros after it. It is a whole different number than 1,000 or 1 \nmillion or 1 billion. I saw a kid with a T-shirt that said: Please \ndon't tell them what comes after a trillion. They are worried about it, \nand they should be. We should all be worried about it.\n  This year we are going to take in $2.2 trillion. That is a lot of \nmoney. Unfortunately, we are going to spend $3.7 trillion. Imagine if \nyou are a person who makes about $67,000 a year, and you spend $100,000 \na year, each and every year. Where are you going to get the money? \nWell, for a while you could probably borrow it. That is what we have \nbeen doing. We are borrowing 40 cents of every $1 we spend. That is the \nonly way we can stay afloat--by borrowing 40 cents of every $1.\n  That means the interest on what we owe is $616 million a day--a day. \nWe are haggling over $61 billion in cuts. That would fund the \ngovernment's interest for 100 days--a drop in the bucket. But we have \nto start sometime, and the best time to start is now.\n  Yesterday, Britain raised their interest rates one-quarter of a \npercent. That is not much. Do you know what happens if our bonds go up \none-quarter of a percent? We are spending $240 billion--with a B--a \nyear on interest. If it goes up by 1 percent, we are going to spend \nanother $140 billion a year on interest. Interest payments do not buy \nmilitary equipment. They do not build schools. Interest payments go to \nother parts of the world, some of which are not our friends. If our \ninterest rates increased by one quarter of one percent, that would be \nan additional $35 billion owed--$35 billion just in increased interest. \nIf it goes up a whole percent, it is $140 billion.\n  So what we have been talking about is going back to 2008 levels of \nspending, plus inflation. I have been talking to Wyoming folks who have \ncome out here. March is a big month for people to come to Washington \nbecause they all come out for their special programs to make sure we \nknow how important they are. Of course, one disappointment I always \nhave is they think each one of those programs gets a vote. They do not. \nBy the time it gets here, what we get to do is vote for a package that \ncuts spending or sometimes a package that increases spending. We do not \neven get to vote on one that keeps spending neutral. In the condition \nwe are in, we have to be voting for the one that cuts spending--\nwhatever one it is that happens to get to us. Yes, cutting spending is \ngoing to inflict some pain on some programs that each of us feels is \nextremely important.\n  It will affect families. It will affect people. But that is what \nhappens when you get so delayed in outlining what you are going to pay \nthat you are 6 months late. If you were paying your own bills and you \nwere 6 months late paying them, what would your creditors say? They \nwould be a little upset. That is where we are. We are that far behind. \nIt is a dilemma, how to fund\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\nthe government so it spends within its means. But we are going to have \nto do that.\n  When I explain where we are and what we have to do and talk about \ngoing back to 2008 levels, I have been real pleased that the Wyoming \npeople say: Well, we can live with that. Hopefully, we don't have to go \nbelow the 2008 levels. Well, if we were being serious about it, we \nwould. But that is where we are talking about going, the 2008 levels. \nSo that is what we are facing today. The budget forecast for the future \nis troubling if we make changes now and dire if we do not. With \nAmericans across the county tightening their belts, it is time for the \nFederal Government to do the same.\n  Folks in Wyoming do understand this concept. Our State is required--\nand many States are required--to operate under a balanced budget, and \nthat does not mean borrowing money in order to balance the budget. That \nmeans spending less than the revenues you get in any given year. \nWyoming is one of the few States that are still operating in the black.\n  We noticed there was a problem, and I want to congratulate Senator \nConrad and Senator Gregg for getting together the deficit commission \nbill. We got a lot of cosponsors on it, and we had a vote on it. We did \nnot have the 60 votes that were necessary to do it. But I applaud the \nPresident for picking that up and appointing a deficit commission. I \nthink he had two great cochairs. He had Alan Simpson, a former Senator, \nand Erskine Bowles, who was the Chief of Staff for President Clinton. \nThey joined with 16 other people to figure out how to get out of this \nmorass. They came up with a plan, a good plan.\n  Their 18-member Commission had to have 14 members in favor of it \nbefore they could actually put it into a forced vote for us. They did \nnot get that. They came close, but they did not get that. Of course, I \nwould have liked them to have broken that down, promised they would do \nall six parts but break it down into six different parts because \ndifferent people objected to different parts, and there would have been \nenough support to pass each part. We may have to do that in order to \nget the same thing done on the Senate floor. I hope we will pursue \nthat. We need to pursue that. It is an absolute must.\n  The President did the right thing appointing the Commission. But we \nhad the State of the Union speech this year, and I thought he would \ntake what the Commission said and make it clear to the United States \nthat we must follow the Commission's recommendations. The President is \nvery good at making things clear, and they gave him a blueprint to make \nclear. I think everybody in the United States would have understood. In \nfact, I think a lot of people in the United States understand, even \nwithout the explanation. They know if you spend more than you take in, \nyou are going broke. We have been doing it so long we are $14.6 \ntrillion broke.\n  President Obama had another opportunity, which was the budget, and I \nhoped his budget would reflect what the deficit commission said. One of \nthe things I found was he took some of the savings in tax expenditures \nthat could have resulted in some lower tax rates to increase our \ninternational competitiveness and he spent it on new programs. As I \nmentioned before, everybody has ideas for new programs, and a lot of \nthem are good ideas, and they would have an impact. But we are not even \nable to afford the programs we already have.\n  I wish to laud Senator Coburn for joining me in asking for a review \nof duplicative programs. In one department, we found $10 billion worth \nof duplicative programs. That is not fraud, waste, and abuse. That is \npeople doing the same things as everybody else. I know from working on \neducation that in preschool we have 69 different preschool programs \nthat receive almost as much money as all of kindergarten through high \nschool from the Federal Government. There is a review on which ones are \neffective and which ones are not, but we do not ever do anything with \nthe ones that are not. We are going to have to start eliminating \nineffective programs.\n  Several of my colleagues and I have suggested going back to funding \nlevels enacted in 2008 before the economic stimulus bill became the \nbaseline for government spending.\n  It is time to start making tough choices. If we do not make cuts now, \nall the scenarios down the road are worse than what we are facing \ntoday.\n  Let's stop the partisan banter and concentrate on the job we are here \nto do. The current discussions between the Congress and the White House \nare the beginning of America's journey back from the brink of financial \nruin. This is the first of many budget engagements. Democrats and \nRepublicans are playing chicken and neither is swerving. There may be a \ncollision tonight, but in the end, amongst the wreckage, smoke, and \nscattered debris, I know America has to be the one left standing.\n  We can make it easy or we can make it hard. We do need to focus on \ngetting a long-term funding bill passed for the remainder of the fiscal \nyear--not just the next 5 days, the remainder of the fiscal year. Time \nis running out in that year.\n  If we can get this done, we can start doing the real work; that is, \nfocusing on the Nation's solvency for future generations. Senator \nConrad, who is the chairman of the Budget Committee, has said he is not \ngoing to start on the next year's budget until we finish this year's \nappropriations. I think that probably makes sense so you know how much \nmoney there is left over. But, wait a minute, there is not any money \nleft over. We are overspending.\n  As a grandpa, I do want to get this done so my grandchildren and \nother children across the State of Wyoming and across the Nation are \nnot stuck with the consequences of our inaction. I hope everyone here \nhopes they never have to answer to any of their grandchildren why they \nhad a chance to fix the problem and they did not. I do not think that \nwill happen. I think we will reach an agreement. I hope it is done \ntonight.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will share a few thoughts, and if any \nof my colleagues come to the floor, I would be pleased to yield to \nthem.\n  I indicated earlier, pretty firmly, that I thought our Democratic \ncolleagues did not recognize the severity of the crisis we are facing \nand were unwilling to confront the reality that we have to change what \nwe are doing. We do not have the money. When you are spending $3.7 \ntrillion and taking in $2.2 trillion and there is no real prospect of \nany alteration of that trajectory, something has to change, just like \neverybody in the States are doing.\n  But one of the things that is galling to me is that not only are they \nresisting taking any action to change the trajectory in any significant \nway, they are going about to savage, criticize good and decent people \nwho are calling for change, people who pay their salaries. They are \nlabeling the millions of Americans who took to the streets during the \nlast election, went door to door, or had town meetings or rallies or \nprotests, who wrote letters to Congress, wrote letters to the \nnewspaper, called in to radio programs and said, We don't like what is \ngoing on in Washington--they are labeling those people who \nparticipated, many of them in politics for the first time in their \nlives because they were worried about America, as extremists, radicals, \nblind ideologues, basically with no common sense. I don't think that is \naccurate. I don't think that is fair. I think every expert we have had \ntestify before the Budget Committee has said the same thing: You are \nspending this country into oblivion. Mr. President, you need to submit \na budget that gets us off this path. It needs short-term spending \nreductions and long-term plans to deal with the surging instability in \nour large entitlement programs. You need to get busy now, and if you \ndon't get busy now, things will be worse.\n\n  Chairman Bernanke of the Federal Reserve said to the Budget \nCommittee, regarding the debts over 10 years from now: Don't worry, it \nis not going to get there, because you are going to have a debt crisis \nbefore you get there, and you are going to have to make changes\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\nin the midst of a financial crisis--the worst possible time to make \nthose choices.\n  These men and women who expressed their concerns about America are \ngood people. They have been using the phrase I thought was interesting, \nthat Pete Domenici, the former Senator from New Mexico and former \nchairman of the Budget Committee said: ``I have never been more afraid \nfor my country.'' I have never been more afraid for my country. That is \nthe heart and soul of the people who stood up in this last election who \nare concerned about their country. It is the establishment--the go-\nalong, the no-change, the people in denial, we can't cut spending, it \nwill never work, no matter what we do it won't make any difference.\n  I thank the Chair. I see my colleagues here. I will be pleased to \nyield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those who \nhave spoken on this Chamber floor this afternoon to express frustration \nand concern about where we are as our Federal Government seems to be \nmoving inexorably toward a shutdown this evening.\n  As I have worked hard with my staff here in Washington and at home to \nhelp them prepare for and explain to the people whom I represent what \nis going on here and why, I have struggled. I have genuinely struggled \nto understand why this impasse is leading, I think now inevitably, \ntoward a government shutdown. I still remain hopeful we will be able to \nfind some resolution in these last few hours. But I think it is \ncritical the people of the United States understand the consequences of \na government shutdown.\n  This isn't just about sending home Federal employees. This is going \nto have a significant impact on our economy, on our recovery, on \nworking families all over this country, and I think on our reputation \naround the world. At a time when many of us are standing up and saying \nthe United States and our system of democratic capitalism is a model \nother nations should follow, our inability as a Congress--the House and \nSenate working together--to reach a responsible consensus on what we \nall agree is one of our top priorities is profoundly frustrating to me.\n  I was elected by the people of Delaware and sent here to deal with \nthree things: to try and get our private sector going again, creating \nhigh-quality, good jobs for the people of Delaware and our country; to \ndeal with our significant deficit and our dramatic national debt and \nthe very real challenge to our future posed by them; and to try and do \nit in a responsible and balanced and bipartisan way. In my view, at \nthis point in this budget fight, from everything I have been able to \nhear from the press and from the leadership of my party here in this \nbody, it has stopped being about cutting the deficit and has instead \nturned into a fight about ideology. If I understand correctly, as of \nlast night at the end of the negotiations, they moved from having 60 \nriders, so-called, on the bill that would fund the Federal Government \nfor the rest of the year, to down to just 1 or 2.\n  I thought one of the good things that came out of the 2010 election \nwas a broad-based focus--particularly by some of the tea party, but \nlots of folks in our country who were upset with how Washington works--\na broad-based focus to stop having bills that were loaded up with lots \nof riders and lots of extraneous things and to try and have commonsense \nlegislation that is easy to understand and that does what it is meant \nto do. This, as I understand it, is no longer about the deficit and \nabout the budget. We are not being asked to consider whether we should \ncut $70 billion or $72 billion or $78 billion; we are instead being \nasked to agree to defunding title X.\n  Title X, a program that goes back to 1970, was enacted and signed \ninto law by President Nixon and provides a remarkable range of health \nservices to women all across this country. In my State of Delaware, \nthere are 26 community health centers that are funded by title X. Just \nfive of them are affiliated in some way with Planned Parenthood.\n  I wanted to come to the floor and take a moment to focus on what \ntitle X funds: preventive health services, contraceptive services, \npregnancy testing, but also screening for cervical and breast cancer, \nscreening for blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, basic infertility, \nhealth education, and referrals for other health and social services. I \nknow and have visited several of these health centers in my State. They \nprovide services to folks who otherwise have no access to basic health \ncare. If I understand correctly, what has happened in this body is that \nwe have come down to being willing to shut down the entire Federal \nGovernment over this one issue of ideology. I am embarrassed and \nashamed on some level that we can't get this resolved.\n  As I understand it, the folks who came to Washington seeking \naggressive deficit reduction and spending cuts in this fiscal year have \nachieved virtually all of their objectives. I think the initial goal \nwas $100 billion. My understanding, as the Presiding Officer heard as \nwell in our caucus lunch, is that we have agreed to up to $78 billion \nin cuts in this fiscal year across the board in lots of different \nsources of discretionary as well as other programs that can be cut this \nyear. That is a hard concession for folks who support government action \nin our community and in our society to accept.\n  But I think one of our challenges is for the folks who may be on the \nother side of this debate to hear ``yes,'' to accept that we have come \nalmost 80 percent of the way to meeting their initial goal, and to \ninstead recognize that I think this has long since turned into a fight \nover ideology--over the narrow issue of women's health.\n  Let me give one last example, if I can, of what this means in my \nhometown. My Senate office in Delaware and I have been working hard for \nseveral months to follow on the example of my predecessor in this seat, \nSenator Ted Kaufman of Delaware, and host a job fair on Monday, from 9 \nto 4, at the single biggest public space in Delaware, the Riverfront \nArts Center. We are going to host a job fair. We have 50 employers \nlined up ready to interview people. We expect more than 1,000 out-of-\nwork Delawareans to show up, resumes in hand, ready to interview and, \nhopefully, to be hired. If I understand the rules right, if the Federal \nGovernment shuts down tonight, my staff can't carry out this job fair \non Monday.\n  Job one for me, and I think job one for all of us in this Chamber, is \nhelping our private sector, helping small businesses, helping our \ncommunities connect good jobs with the folks who are out of work and \nseeking employment. Fortunately, in our case, we have scrambled and \nworked hard the last few days. The Governor of Delaware, our Department \nof Labor, the Delaware economic office, and other volunteers have \nworked hard and stepped up to make sure this job fair comes off on \nMonday just fine without interruption.\n  We need to be focused on reining in the deficit and the debt, dealing \nwith our long-term budget, and getting folks back to work.\n  In conclusion, it is my hope that as a body we can come together in a \ncommonsense way. If we need to have a vote on the floor, if we need to \nhave a fight about access to health care for women in title X, let's \nhave that debate, but this should be a discussion today about the \ndeficit and about funding the operations of the Federal Government for \nthe year ahead. I look forward and hope we can turn back to that very \nreal work and not instead have a fight about ideology and access to \nwomen's health.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, I wish to compliment my good \nfriend, Senator Coons from Delaware, for something he has done recently \nalong with Senator Isakson as the chairman and the ranking member of \nthe African Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nThey have responded to my request to have a hearing on the tragedies \nand\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\nwhat is taking place right now in Cote d'Ivoire.\n  Let me mention, there is only one thing I take issue with in the \nletter that has gone out to make the request. One sentence says:\n\n       Mr. Gbagbo has sought to forcefully thwart the will of the \n     Ouattaran people and his forces, reportedly, including \n     mercenaries, who have targeted innocent civilians, including \n     women, as well as United Nations missions.\n\n  I only want to get into the Record--I have already done this. I have \ngiven three very lengthy speeches about what is happening over there. I \nhave been there, I am sure, more than any other Member of the Senate. I \nwould say that if you read the Guardian, the British Guardian, in \ntheir--I am quoting now--two big slaughters have taken place, one in a \nsmall western town called Duekoue and another in Abidjan, the capital. \nThe article says:\n\n       The UN mission said traditional hunters, known as Dozos, \n     fought alongside Ouattara's forces.\n\n  Let's keep in mind who we are talking about here. The President, who \nhas been now for the last 10 years, has been President Gbagbo, Laurent \nGbagbo, and the person who had run against him 10 years ago, and then \nthis time, and who was declared to be winning the election, is Alassane \nOuattara. Anyway, they are talking about Ouattara in this case.\n\n       The UN mission said traditional hunters, known as Dozos, \n     fought alongside Ouattara's forces and took part in killing \n     330 people in the western town of Duekoue.\n\n  Then the Red Cross weighed in and they came in with a new count. They \nsaid they are responsible for 800 who have been killed. Recently--and I \ncertainly want my friend from Delaware to know this--I have talked to \nclose friends of mine who are in Abidjan now. Abidjan is where the bad \nthings are happening. I hope anyone who questions the fact that it is \nOuattara's forces that are creating the problems in Abidjan access my \nWeb site and pull up the YouTube video that was taken of what happened \non what I call ``Black Monday,'' Monday night, when they went out with \nhelicopters and they mowed down thousands of people. We don't have a \ndeath count of how many people have been murdered in the last 5 days.\n  This could not have been the former President--or maybe he is still \nthe President--in fact, he is, since he has not been replaced, \nPresident Gbagbo. It is factual that he had no one in the field, so as \nof an hour ago, I have had reports that these forces, Ouattara's \nforces, are going around knocking on doors and murdering people, \nstealing everything in the houses and then burning them down. Yet no \none can go out and even move bodies out of the streets because they \nwill get shot by snipers. Are those President Gbagbo's people? No. He \ndoesn't have anybody. He is hunkered down in the basement trying to \nsave the lives of himself and I think 15 of his relatives along with \nhis wife Simone.\n  I only want to say while I am very happy we are going to have the \nhearings, it is going to be necessary--I have witnesses. I have one \nwitness whose name is Mel Phiodore. Mel is actually the head of the \nopposing party to Gbagbo.\n  He is the one who actually ran against him for President one time and \nlost. He is currently a Parliament member. Yet he is defending him, \nsaying he is the one who is right in this case and they stole the \nelection. This needs to come out.\n  I will make one comment. I am equally troubled. I tried to explain to \npeople in Oklahoma how all these billions and trillions of dollars we \ntalk about really affects the people who pay the taxes. Back during the \ntime we spent on the floor trying to defeat the efforts of the EPA in \ntheir cap-and-trade efforts, the costs put on there were between $300 \nbillion and $400 billion. I recommend particularly to some of the new \nSenators to count the number of tax returns the families file in their \nStates, and then do the math. In that case, that would have cost--if \nthey had been able to continue, and right now they are trying to \ncontinue, or if any of the legislation had passed cap and trade, that \nwould have cost each family who files a tax return in Oklahoma $3,100 a \nyear.\n  When we start equating that to some of the numbers floating around, \nit is just--I remember so well coming here and standing at this podium \nin 1995 when Bill Clinton was President. He came out with his budget \nfor fiscal year 1996, I think. It was a $1.5 trillion budget. I was \noutraged and said we can't do that, it is not sustainable. Yet this \nlast budget from the Obama administration has deficits that are higher \nthan $1.5 trillion. In other words, the deficits are higher than the \namount it took to run the entire country of the United States of \nAmerica in 1996.\n  It is something that everybody knows is not sustainable. We looked at \nthese large numbers, and we know it will be difficult. My major \nconcern, as second ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, is \nour troops. We have an opportunity to do something right now with our \ntroops, help them to be funded. I think this offer from the House is \ngood. I opposed the last three that came over. This one I am \nsupporting. Why? Because not only does it have cuts--and it is also \nonly 7 days, and I understand that--but it takes the innocent defense \nand all of our troops there in harm's way out from under all this \nfoolishness going on on the floor of the Senate now and funds them \nthrough the rest of the fiscal year. It funds them at a low level.\n  With all the high spending coming out of the Obama administration, \nDOD funding has remained level, while the rest of the funding has \naveraged an increase of 25 percent. So they have already taken a hit. \nLet's at least make sure we can make the payroll, that we can support \nour troops and, to do that, we can take up the House bill and pass it. \nIt is only for 7 days. If somebody doesn't like it, they can try \nsomething else. It takes care of our military.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2320-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2320-S2326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Oklahoma. \nI don't think there is a single Senator in this Chamber who doesn't \nrecognize that we have to deal with the debt and the deficit this \ncountry is facing. But the reality is that we are not going to deal \nwith that on the 12 percent of the budget that is nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. We have to look at mandatory spending and tax \nreform, and we need to do it in a thoughtful way that recognizes that \nwe need to invest in our future and make the cuts where we can do it, \nwithout harming the future of this country.\n  Mr. President, I am really sad that we are here at the eleventh hour \non the floor of the Senate looking at a probable government shutdown at \nmidnight tonight. It didn't have to be this way. I was disappointed to \nread accounts of some of our colleagues in the other Chamber, on the \nother side of the Capitol, who were literally applauding when they were \ntold that a government shutdown was coming. The people of my State of \nNew Hampshire are not applauding. They don't want a shutdown because \nthey know that a shutdown of the Federal Government is bad for the \ncountry, bad for the economy, and it is bad for the people of New \nHampshire.\n  Let me begin by going over some of what is going to happen in New \nHampshire if the government shuts down. I have spoken before about \ncompanies in my home State of New Hampshire who are affected by our \ninability to get a budget done--companies such as Velcro USA. I think \nwe all know what Velcro is. I am proud to say it is produced in New \nHampshire, and it was invented there. The United States military is a \nmajor customer for Velcro. It is a major customer of the company, \nVelcro USA, because Velcro is used in soldiers' uniforms and equipment. \nNormally, the government is a steady customer of Velcro USA, but now \nthey have been waiting for months for us in Congress to pass a full-\nyear funding bill for the government. A shutdown will mean increased \nuncertainty for the company and for the hundreds of employees who work \nthere.\n  We heard from another company in my home State, a small, innovative, \nhigh-tech company which has said even the smallest shutdown is going to \nhave dire effects. They said they would lose 95 percent of their \nrevenue if we have a shutdown. This is a small business that has about \n45 employees, but it is a\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\nbusiness that has a lot of growth potential. It is exactly the kind of \ninnovative company that will keep America's economy competitive. They \nwere planning to hire 16 people this year--increasing their workforce \nby about one-third. But that will be put on hold if we have a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  Then there is the housing market. In New Hampshire and across the \ncountry, it is still very fragile, probably the slowest to recover \nsector of our economy. In New Hampshire foreclosure rates are down 12 \npercent from a year ago, but they are still at historic highs. FHA home \nloan guarantees have been critical to the recovery in the housing \nmarket.\n  Again, all of that is going to stop in a shutdown. No new FHA loans \ncould be approved. If there is a closing scheduled or someone is trying \nto buy a foreclosed home or any home, with FHA help, the deal is off--\nor at least it will be on hold.\n  With all of the problems that have been caused by the housing crisis, \nwe should not be hamstringing one of the most effective programs we \nhave for assisting homeowners; and that is what we are going to do if \nthere is a government shutdown.\n  A shutdown would also close the Small Business Administration's \nlending programs. We all know how important working capital is for \nsmall businesses, which is still a problem.\n  Then, of course, there are the 7,400 Federal workers in New \nHampshire. That makes the Federal Government one of our State's largest \nemployers. They don't know when paychecks are going to start again or \nif they are going to get backpay. Their salary just isn't important for \nthem and their families, but these 7,400 hard-working New Hampshire \ncitizens are critical to their local economy. When their pay stops, \nthey stop making their mortgage payments, they stop paying their \nutility bills, they stop shopping at local stores. These are just some \nof the effects of a shutdown on the economy in my State of New \nHampshire.\n  New Hampshire is a small State, but if we multiply these economic \nimpacts across our entire country, this shutdown carries the real risk \nof undermining our fragile economic recovery. Why is this happening? We \nhave an agreement, pretty much, on how much we are going to cut in \nspending. In fact, the Senate has gone more than 50 percent toward \nmeeting the House in the cuts they want to make in the budget.\n  This is not about how much money we are going to cut from the budget; \nthis is happening because we have a small minority in Congress who \nwants to use the Federal budget to prevent women from having access to \nfamily planning and other reproductive health care services.\n  My colleague, Senator Coons, talked very eloquently about what title \nX does. Title X funding provides reproductive health services to women \nwho otherwise could not access those services. That includes \ncontraceptives, screening for sexually transmitted diseases, screening \nfor breast and cervical cancer. It provides preventive care for women \nwho, in so many cases, in New Hampshire and across the country would \nnot be able to get access to that health care.\n  In New Hampshire we have 28 clinics that receive title X funds, \nincluding community health centers, health department clinics and \nhospitals, outpatient clinics, as well as Planned Parenthood.\n  This fight is not about reducing our debt. It is time now to put \nideology aside, to work together in a bipartisan way, to get this \nbudget back on track and passed so the people of this country can be \nconfident that we are going to continue the economic recovery that has \nstarted and make sure we can put people back to work and support the \nsmall businesses and the people of this country who depend on the work \nwe do in Washington.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire leaves the floor, I want to commend her on a number of \nthings, but most important is her hard work with me and many others on \nthe biennial budget bill, which we hope will come to the floor in the \nfuture.\n  I want to comment, because this potential shutdown, which I hope \ndoesn't happen--we have been speculating or asking the agencies to \nspeculate on what this means. If you read yesterday's Washington Post, \nyou saw that the only agency of the government that will work \nseamlessly through a shutdown, without any shortcoming or deficiencies, \nis veterans health care. That is because we biennially appropriate for \nthat. The one thing that will be open during the shutdown is the one \nthing we do in the 2-year process rather than a hit-or-miss process \nlike the current appropriations act.\n  So the distinguished Senator, who was Governor of her State that has \na biennial appropriations process and has worked with it, knows what I \nknow. If you can plan and make things predictable, you will save money \nand improve the quality of your service. I hope we can get this country \nto a position where we do biennially appropriate and can spend 1 of \nevery 2 years doing oversight and find waste and find ways to do things \nbetter and less expensively.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Yes.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I appreciate the Senator's kind remarks. Doesn't the \nSenator think if we had that biennial budget process in place now, we \nwould not be on the floor debating whether we are going to have a \nshutdown, and that we would have a budget process that was going \nforward? As he points out, we have next year to provide oversight and \naccountability on that budget, and we would have the dependability and \ncertainty that businesses and the people of this country are looking \nfor; isn't that right?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. There is no question that the Senator is correct. We are \npredictably unpredictable here. We need to be predictably predictable \nwhen it comes to the efficiencies we can bring about and how we spend \nour money. We need to do what people do, which is sit around their \nkitchen tables and prioritize what comes in and what goes out. And they \nbalance their budgets. They have to. It is about time we have the same \ndiscipline the American people have.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in the South we have an old saying: If \nyou find yourself at the bottom of a hole, stop digging.\n  We are at that point. We accomplished some amazing things in the last \n3, 4 weeks. I commend the House on the cuts that have taken place, but \nwe ought to remember we are focusing on the minnow, when the big fish \nis on the horizon. There is only so much we can cut when 50 percent of \na fiscal year is gone. People are talking about how little we are \ncutting out of small areas. That is because it is all there is to cut \nfrom. The cuts have demonstrated that we can begin to get our house in \norder. The big enchilada is coming up with the big 2012 budget.\n  I did a little research on what we have done in the last 3, 4 years. \nIn the last 3 years, we spent all our money on omnibus appropriations, \nexcept one Defense appropriations act. In doing the research, we spent \non average 4 days of debate on those three bills. We have had the small \nbusiness bill on the floor for 12 days, and we haven't finished it yet. \nWe spent 12 days on the small business reform bill, and we only spent \nan average of 4 days on spending over $10 trillion. It is time that we \ngot the current agreement--and I understand there is one--on how much \nwe cut done. If we have differences on policy, we can reserve them for \ndebates on the 2012 appropriations act.\n  Let's get moving. Everybody here knows we have two big votes on the \nhorizon. One is the pending debt ceiling vote at some time in May or \nJune, and the other is the fiscal year 2012 appropriations. We will not \nget a second chance on those. The world markets are not going to give \nus another year to spend our money in a helter-skelter manner. We have \nthe ability and the brain power, and we need the commitment in this \nbody to spend money like the American people have to spend theirs. That \nis all they ask of us. We don't need to be extravagant, frivolous, and \nwasteful.\n  Another thing on the current, pending, looming possible shutdown is \nthat it is absolutely crazy, when we have committed our sons and \ndaughters to\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\nharm's way--right now, they are in three countries: Libya by the Air \nForce, Iraq, and Afghanistan. To put them in a position of accruing \ntheir income because we have shut down the government is just not \nright. It is not the right thing to do. We ought to debate these \nmatters on the Senate floor with the government functioning.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will recognize that we are about to take \ndefeat from the jaws of victory. We have won the battle on the short \nterm with the cuts we needed. Let's get this short-term cut done, let's \nget the CR done, and then let's get to the kitchen table of the \nAmerican people and get it done for fiscal year 2012 and the years \nahead. We have to find out how to pay back over time $14 trillion. That \nis going to take a lot of commitment, work, and time. Let's get to it. \nLet's get the CR done. Let's come back next week and finish dotting the \ni's and crossing the t's and commit ourselves that the rest of the year \nis about America's future, it is about our children and grandchildren; \nit is about beginning to rein in expenses and spend our money \naccountably and predictably so the American people can expect of us \nwhat we always demand of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nthose very moving and powerful remarks. I differ with him only in \nrecognizing that the saying about digging a hole is not only a southern \nsaying, but I think by now it is a national saying, thanks to my \nsouthern colleagues and others.\n  Let me just say about this debate that it has been very eloquent on \nboth sides, but there is an unreality to it. In the real world, \nAmericans are struggling to find jobs or keep them, striving to stay in \ntheir homes, working hard to keep their families together. In the real \nworld, economic growth has to be a priority.\n  We are on the verge of a failure of action that threatens the fragile \neconomic recovery that right now is a priority for most Americans, and \nit is unnecessary. We are truly in danger of distracting ourselves from \nwhat should be the main task and the central reason we should be \nseeking a budget, which is to fund the Federal Government for the \nremainder of this year and ensure that we continue economic growth and \nprovide more jobs for the American people.\n  There is agreement on the numbers, on the dollars, on the figures for \nspending the remainder of this year. My colleague from Georgia has just \nconfirmed what others have said on this floor repeatedly, what the \nmajority leader said this morning. There is agreement on the cuts and \nthe savings. The distraction is on an ideological war on women's \nhealth. A small minority--a very small minority--is holding this budget \nand this Nation hostage in this ideological war on women's health. That \nis a disservice to the American people who want us to go back to \nbasics: jobs and the economy, get a budget done, avoid a shutdown that \nthreatens that fragile recovery.\n  Again and again on this floor, my colleagues have made the point that \nuncertainty and unpredictability are enemies to small businesses and \nlarge in this country and elsewhere in the globe that count on American \nleadership, count on our leadership in achieving a budget.\n  This war on women's health care cannot be allowed to succeed. I have \nspoken about it, along with other Senators who have spoken on this \nfloor, most recently the Senator from New Hampshire, who has been a \nleader on this issue, along with the Senator from California, Barbara \nBoxer, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Franken, Senator Lautenberg, Senator \nMikulski, and others who have spoken out in favor of title X and \nPlanned Parenthood funding.\n  The unreality of this debate reflects a failure to appreciate what \nthese dollars mean to the women who depend on these services. They are \nwomen who cannot afford the kinds of screenings for cancer and \ncholesterol and other problems that are so vital to preventing those \nproblems that cost us all larger dollars if they go untreated. These \nservices are vital to the testing for other kinds of problems that may \nbe more expensive to treat if they are not dealt with and, of course, \ncontraception that prevents exactly the kinds of problems or issues on \nwhich many in this body have focused. In Connecticut alone, we are \ntalking about more than 60,000 patients served by Planned Parenthood, \nincluding 30,000 title X patients, 18 health centers that are imperiled \nby this rider or the conditions that would be attached, and almost \n100,000 preventive screenings that are vitally important to low-income \nwomen and men who need access--the key is access--to contraceptive \nservices and preventive screenings, vital health care.\n  There is a silver lining to this cloud. This moment is teaching us \nsomething. In reality, it is a teaching moment. I think it will alert a \nlot of Americans to the importance of preventive services--testing, \nscreening. If it draws one more woman or man to seek these kinds of \ntesting services, it will have accomplished something.\n  The debate over these social issues will not be resolved in this \nbudget and should not be resolved in the remaining few hours we have \nleft. There will be other occasions when we can debate and resolve \nthese social issues, the ideological divides that have been with us for \ndecades and will remain after this budget, hopefully, is resolved in \nthe next few hours.\n  My hope is that there will be other teaching moments but, most \nimportantly, not only about health care but about the way the \ndemocratic process works.\n  In the short months I have been privileged--and I deeply mean \nprivileged--to be part of this body and sometimes to preside in the \nvery chair where the Presiding Officer is now, I have often looked \naround this Chamber and have seen the students and others who come to \nvisit us and thought of the millions of Americans who are watching us \nand who hope that we will recognize we have more in common than in \nconflict as Americans; recognize that a shutdown of this government \ncannot happen consistent with our duties to seek what we have in common \nover what we have in conflict; that it would be devastating not only to \nAmerican leadership around the globe but to the military men and women \nwho are depending on our judgment and leadership, to the veterans, to \nthe folks out there searching for jobs, trying to stay in their homes, \nkeep their families together; recognize that the reason they sent us \nhere is to do what is right for this economy now and to reach agreement \nand to do the kinds of things Americans do in their homes over that \nkitchen table when they disagree. They come together. They see what \nthey have in common. They do not walk out of the house. They do not \nshut off the lights. They stay together, and they do what they think \nwill best serve the common interest, which for us is to recognize that \nwe have an agreement on the budget numbers, that we cannot be \ndistracted by the ideological war on women's health, and that we should \nstay true to our principles.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise because obviously we are \ntalking a lot today about--and really the eyes of our Nation are \nlooking at what Congress is doing because there is so much negotiating \ngoing on. I am one who wants to have a long-term continuing resolution \nto the end of our fiscal year that makes the responsible budget cuts, \nthat funds our troops and gets us on to the next item of business, \nwhich is the one we really must address; that is, the huge debt that is \nfacing our country. That is what we should be doing.\n  We are now in the throes--and I am told there are serious \nnegotiations going on that we hope still will have a result before the \nmidnight deadline. But if everything breaks down, I have a bill that \nnow has 74 cosponsors in the Senate out of 100. That bill is very \nsimple. It says that if everything else falls through, even though \neveryone I am talking to wants us to have that agreement that will not \nshut down the government, that does fund our Army, our Navy, our Air \nForce, our Marines, our Coast Guard, all of those in the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, all of those personnel who are waiting to see \nif their financial lives are going to be disrupted--I want to make the \ndeadline so it will not be.\n  However, I do have a simple bill because there are some people who \nare\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\nnot in the United States right now, who are overseas protecting our \nfreedom. They are serving in Iraq. They are serving in Afghanistan. \nTheir loved ones are mostly at home watching what is going on.\n  I have been looking at the comments of the wives of the personnel, \nwho are worried about what effect this is going to have on them because \nthey have actually gotten notices that their pay is going to be cut, \nthat it is going to be less than their full pay on the 15th because \nthey are accommodating a potential government shutdown. We cannot let \nthat happen.\n  I have introduced S. 724. I have 74 cosponsors. Senator Inhofe and \nSenator Casey stepped up right from the beginning, and now we have 74 \nSenators ready to ensure that if things break down, we will fix this \nproblem.\n  I am very moved by a Web site that was created by one individual \ntoday--early this morning, I think--and her name is Hope Gwen Bradley. \nI did not know her name earlier today when I spoke. She said: I am \ngoing to do something. I am one person, and I am going to do something.\n  I do not know Ms. Bradley. I do not know if she has a connection to \nthe military, but she opened a Facebook with the name of my bill, \n``Ensuring Pay for Our Military Act of 2011.'' As of when I left the \noffice to come to the floor, there were 906,412 people on this Web site \nwho agreed with her that we must at all costs alleviate any fears of \nour military families when they are doing so much for our country and \nfighting for what we are trying to do right here.\n  I commend Hope Gwen Bradley--and I surely hope I can meet her some \nday--for this kind of grassroots groundswell to support our troops with \na simple bill that says if there is a government shutdown, our troops \nwill be paid on time, full pay. That is what the bill does. It has 74 \ncosponsors.\n  I will say that Senator Rockefeller, my esteemed colleague, the \nchairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, is on \nthe floor, and I am going to stop in just a minute because I am sure he \nis here for his time in morning business.\n  We now have the support of the Military Officers Association, which \nhas 377,000 members who sent me a letter supporting S. 724. We have the \nletter from the National Association for Uniformed Services, with \n180,000 members and supporters, signed by Richard Jones, their \nlegislative director, in support of this bill. We have just received \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America letter saying they \nstrongly support S. 724.\n\n  Here is what they say in the letter:\n\n       This bill ensures that all members of the Armed Forces will \n     continue to receive the pay and allowances they have earned \n     despite any lack of interim or full-year appropriations. Our \n     men and women in uniform protect our Nation and continue to \n     do so despite budget disagreements in Washington. The members \n     of our Armed Forces are essential to the defense of our \n     Nation and must be treated as such. Many young servicemembers \n     and their families--\n\n  Remember, so many of those over there are young. They are in their \ntwenties. So they are not in the high levels of compensation. \nContinuing with what this letter says, and this is the Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America, so they know what they are talking \nabout; they have been there--\n\n       Many young servicemembers and their families are dealing \n     with multiple deployments and often live paycheck to \n     paycheck. Military families should not be asked to bear \n     further financial stress in addition to fighting the war on \n     terrorism. This legislation protects the men and women who \n     protect us.\n\n  The letter is signed by Paul Rieckhoff, the executive director of \nIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. They are the ones who have \nmost recently come back, and they are too coming forward and saying we \nmust do this.\n  I am for the bills that would come through. I think the House bill is \na good bill. The 1-week continuing resolution does take care of the \nmilitary. But the chances of it passing here are probably nil. I think \nif the other body was to have a clean continuing resolution, I would \nsupport that too. But I don't think that is going to have a chance \neither. So the only thing that is going to have a chance is if we get a \nreal agreement between Senator Reid, Speaker Boehner, and the White \nHouse that we can do a long-term continuing resolution that will truly \nfund our troops and that will have the necessary cuts to show we are \nserious about this budget deficit and we are going to correct the \ncourse of our country financially. That is what we all hope for.\n  But if we don't get that, my bill, 724, has 73 cosponsors, our \nMembers speaking in large numbers, saying this is the right thing to \ndo. I hope we can pass this bill as soon as it is clear we are not \ngoing to have a real agreement. We can do no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Feinstein to \nour bill as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is quite an honor to speak while \nthe Presiding Officer is in the Chair. I think I have not seen him \nthere before, so I will have to give a good speech. I will probably \nhave to give a little longer speech simply by virtue of his presence.\n  I think most people who choose a career in public life do so because \nthey have a genuine, huge feeling in their heart that they want to help \npeople. It is kind of simple. I know I have spent the better part of my \ncareer in West Virginia and in Congress looking for any way I possibly \ncould--succeeding in some cases, failing in some cases--in trying \nalways to make life better for West Virginians and for the American \npeople as a whole. Perhaps it is a simple idea, but I can say with some \npride that over the years we have made a lot of strides.\n  It is popular, these days, I know, to beat up on the government. It \nalways has been. That goes back to George Washington's time. But the \ntruth is, the government does an incredible amount to help people in \ntheir lives every single day. The benefits of government are not always \nvisible. They do not usually make the evening news, but they are \nenormously important and specific and make a large difference.\n  This government looks after veterans; otherwise, they wouldn't be \nlooked after. The private sector wouldn't do it. The private sector is \nsometimes very reluctant, actually, to participate in helping them. But \nwhen they come home from battle, the government is there with an \nexpanded Veterans' Administration system and superb medical health care \nto take care of them.\n  The government takes care of seniors with Medicare and our Social \nSecurity programs. We also have Medicaid and the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, which is vastly important in a State such as my own \nor anybody's State because it provides comprehensive health coverage to \nour most vulnerable populations, including children. We passed this \nbecause it is morally right. It is the right thing to do and in the \nbest interest of our Nation to be sure children get a decent start in \nlife--in health care, maybe even before education, because the health \ncare part starts very early with early tests.\n  The government builds the roads, the bridges, and other \ninfrastructure that connects small towns and communities and helps make \nus a larger community. It is the fabric that links families and \nbusinesses all across this country.\n  Federal agencies also make sure the food we eat is safe and the water \nwe drink is clean. They help communities pay for public safety and all \nkinds of law enforcement to help keep our streets safe.\n  People don't generally know where money comes from. That is pretty \nunderstandable. They just need to know, if they are sitting out in the \nevening on a summer's night, that the streets they live on are being \npatrolled or being watched, et cetera. I could go on and on. There are \nliterally thousands of things government has done over the years to \nimprove the quality of life for every single man, woman, and child in \nthis country. It is indisputable, and there is a glorious tale in all \nthat.\n  But in recent weeks, we have seen the discussion about the role and \nthe purpose of government take what seems to be a very nasty turn. Some \nof my colleagues on the other side have lately taken up the call to \narms to do whatever it takes to slash, to close or to shut down the \ngovernment. We are faced with that, and we may get that. They want to \nhold the American people\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\nhostage with a ransom note that keeps getting higher and higher every \ntime negotiations go on.\n  There is no question we must get our growing deficit under control, \nand Democrats have taken responsible steps to do that. In fact, in the \nlarger scheme of things, we have gone 75 to 80 percent toward the \nRepublican position. But at every turn, Republicans have blocked \nreasonable attempts to rein in government spending. They say they want \nit to happen, but if there are reasonable attempts to do that, they \nstop it. Instead, they make unreasonable demands and they change the \ngoalposts on a repeated basis.\n  Last December, Democrats produced an Omnibus appropriations bill to \nfund the government for 2011 that would have reduced spending by $20 \nbillion, a level endorsed by a bipartisan group of Senators. Incoming \nSpeaker John Boehner, however, launched a campaign to oppose that bill. \nRepublicans ramped up their opposition to the bill and, instead, all we \nwere able to pass was a short-term extension of funding to 2011, which \nwas very frustrating.\n  In February, Republicans offered a long-term proposal to fund the \ngovernment through the end of fiscal year 2011 with $32 billion in \ncuts. But tea party Republicans, who are in control, rejected the $32 \nbillion and, instead, insisted on deeper cuts of $61 billion that \nRepublicans knew and openly admitted were both dangerous to the economy \nand totally unlikely to pass the Senate.\n  In the meantime, Democrats have fought to keep our government \noperating. We have passed $10 billion in cuts since March. It is harder \nfor Democrats to make cuts than Republicans because we believe in doing \nthings that help people directly, that keep them safe--such as the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission. Who knows about that? Senator Boxer \ndoes and I do. They make sure our toys and other products people use \nare safe. Somebody has to always be watching over what goes on.\n\n  We have passed $10 billion in cuts since March and offered another \n$20 billion in cuts to the Republicans so we can end this standoff and \nnot shut down government. Just when we thought we had finally reached \nan agreement on $33 billion in additional cuts below the 2010 enacted \nlevels--which is $73 billion below the President's 2011 budget \nproposal--not interesting, all these statistics but profoundly \nimportant in the function and the possibilities of government. So this \nwas at the end of March. But Republicans then changed the rules again. \nThey demanded $40 billion in cuts to appease the far right--the tea \npartiers.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side have lately taken up a call \nto arms to do whatever it takes to close the government. Despite a \nprevious commitment from the Speaker, middle-ground funding cuts of $33 \nbillion are no longer good enough.\n  Then, as the final bomb, they passed the seventh short-term spending \nmeasure that is loaded with $12 billion in spending cuts--which, by the \nway, is six times more than the agreed-upon rate of $2 billion a week, \nwhich includes the Department of Defense appropriations bill and all \nthose 66 riders that have absolutely no place on any appropriations \nbill.\n  What is required is less concern about the tea party messaging and \ntotal attention to the well-being of the American people and the health \nof our Nation. The tea party cry--delivered in gleeful shouts and rants \non the floor of the House, in the Senate, and frequently in rallies \noutside these buildings--is nothing like I have ever seen before. I \nhave been here 25 years--something like that--and I have never seen \nanything like it. But they want to close the government down, and they \nlove the theater of it.\n  Recently, we watched as an extremist crowd, standing on the lawn \noutside, waved flags with snakes on them and shouted: Shut it down, \nshut it down, shut it down, as if this is a sporting event--you know, \nthe Roman Coliseum. Let the gladiators compete, the heck with the \npeople. Let the Roman Senate take care of that. Even the leadership on \nthe other side has joined in--with one Republican Member telling the \ncrowds and people everywhere, therefore, because it was televised, that \nhe wants to see the government shut down. He flatout said that.\n  I believe they want that. I believe they want that. So really? You \nhave such disdain for our constitutional government, you so disrespect \nour fellow citizens--the people who sent us and who count on us to help \nand protect them--that you want a government shutdown? That is the \ndeal, I guess.\n  Has anyone else noticed that in many parts of the world today there \nare protests in the streets about basic freedoms? Here, where we are \nprivileged already to enjoy these freedoms, we are stuck in the middle \nof a political debate with extreme positions and Members of Congress \nwho seem not to care what happens as long as they win or score points \nfor the next election--a cynical thing to say, but it happens to be \ntrue.\n  Frankly, this cynical posturing from the other side has not only \nbrought us to the brink of a government shutdown--only a few hours from \nnow, perhaps, though I hope not--it has taken us to a point where we \nare forgetting what it is we are arguing about in the first place. What \nshould be a serious, thoughtful debate about finding reasonable ways to \ncut the budget and scale back our deficit has, for some, instead, \nturned into a game. I say that because what we are hearing from the \nother side is that they want mostly to move in an extreme agenda. They \ncare about that. They have their markers. They have to meet those \nmarkers; no matter the effect on the people, they have to meet the \nmarkers.\n\n  They ran, some of them without any intention--many of them without \nany intention of running again so they can't be held accountable, so \nthey can work on shutting down government which they do not like for \nvarious reasons. So it is no longer on agreeing on a dollar figure to \ncuts from the budget. It is about turning the government into a \nboogeyman and closing its doors.\n  Let me tell you why I think that is unacceptable. It is because this \nis not a game at all, this is real life and the decisions we make here \nhave real world implications for the people of West Virginia and every \nother State and all over the world.\n  Let's consider what would happen if the extremist wing of the \nRepublican party gets its way and the government does in fact shut \ndown. Soldiers would not get their paychecks if there is a shutdown, if \nwe cannot pass something. That is right, the service men and women who \nrisk their lives so we may live in freedom might not get paid. You can \ntalk, maybe someday they will be repaid, but in the meantime they are \nliving week to week, and their families are, and they don't get paid. \nThat doesn't sound like a sane policy.\n  In my State of West Virginia there are more than 6,500 people serving \nin the National Guard. Nationally, about half of the young men and \nwomen in the military are 25 years old or younger, and about 40 percent \nof them have children. Many of the families are on one income and some \nare living paycheck to paycheck. They don't know what they are going to \ndo. That is one more thing they should not be thinking about. They \nshould be thinking about surviving and carrying out their mission.\n  The chair has indicated that I have gone on a little bit too long so \nI am going to beg for 1\\1/2\\ more pages. That being granted, I will \nproceed.\n  There is so much more on the chopping block if the extremists in \nCongress get their way. The Federal Housing Administration wouldn't be \nable to process mortgage loans. Social Security claims would freeze. I \nam not sure that Medicare could take in any new members, several \nthousand people every day who qualify for Medicare. I am not sure they \ncould be taken in.\n  We remember that during the 4 days of the 1995 shutdown, 112,000 \nclaims for Social Security retirement and disability benefits were not \ntaken, they were not received, they were not processed, they were not \ndealt with, and 800,000 callers were denied service on the Social \nSecurity Administration's phone.\n  I am going to stop with that. I think you get the drift of my \nfeeling, and what I feel. But I do not consider it a game if the IRS \ncould, would, stop refund checks. More than 235,000 West Virginians \nwill file their taxes using paper forms this year. Computers are not \nall the rage in all parts of West Virginia. So they will wait longer \nfor their returns to be completed.\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\n  I could go on with small business and the National Institutes of \nHealth and all the rest of it. Federal mine safety inspection will shut \ndown. The mines will continue to run but there will be no Federal \ninspectors. I respect the State inspectors but I have a lot more \nrespect for Federal inspectors. Mines operating with nobody inspecting? \nIt is a horrifying thought.\n  I hope somehow this will come out to be a good result. There are \nreasons why it could be, and there are reasons both to be pessimistic \nand to be a little bit optimistic. I cannot at this time call it either \nway.\n  We would turn the lights off on the NIH--and tell scientists working \non developing life-saving treatments or finding a cure for cancer, that \ntheir work will have to wait. And they will have to turn away patients \nwhose best or only hope is to join a clinical trial for new treatments \nor medicines.\n  We would shutter the agency responsible for regular Federal mine \nsafety and health inspections--should I remind my colleagues here that \nthis month marks 1 year since the worst mining accident in recent \nhistory at Upper Big Branch?\n  Inspections of stock brokers and routine oversight of financial \nmarkets by Federal agencies would cease. Enforcement actions would be \npostponed. Do we need to review where that might get us?\n  West Virginia is set to receive $416,590 in Low Income Heating and \nEnergy Assistance Program--LIHEAP. But that stops in a shutdown.\n  Some of the FEMA flood mitigation and flood insurance operations \nwould stop. Have we forgotten the lessons of Katrina so quickly? In \nWest Virginia, spring storms often brings torrential and devastating \nfloods that can wipe out entire communities.\n  Most veterans' benefits services would stop; we know the last time \nthat extremists on the other side closed the government more than \n400,000 veterans saw their disability, pension or educational benefits \ndelayed.\n  I could go on.\n  What is more ridiculous is that even the leaders on the other side \nhave conceded that the vast ``shutdown'' movement is not even sound \nfiscal policy.\n  The Speaker of the House, who is not as extreme as others in his \nparty, said recently that if you shut the government down, it will end \nup costing more than you will save.\n  A new study from Goldman Sachs said that a Federal shutdown would \ncost $8 billion a week. And the economist Mark Zandi predicted that a \nshutdown would have a detrimental impact on our recovery.\n  Why? Because many of the contracts and other services that are \ninterrupted do not go away--they just get delayed. So you often end up \npaying more in the long run.\n  It is tempting to wonder if the other side is interested in anything \nmore than finding clever new ways to attack the White House and score \npolitical points. We started this debate earlier in the year with a \nmutual agreement that we need to find ways to pay down the deficit and \nmake some cuts and somewhere along the way we went off the rails.\n  During the last couple of weeks, as extremists on the other side have \nprevented us from arriving at a deal, Congress has resorted to short \nstop-gap funding measures that cut billions of dollars from Federal \nprograms as part of a deal to buy more time.\n  Instead of just tossing out a claim that we must cut $33 billion more \nfrom the budget without any distinction on what is valuable, wouldn't \nwe be better off having a conversation about reforming the Tax Code to \nend the disgraceful tax breaks for the rich at the expense of the \nmiddle class?\n  I have tried for years to work towards a tax policy that would do \nless for corporate America and more for Main Street America; less for \noffshore operations and more for seniors and families; and less for big \noil companies and more for investment, infrastructure and innovation.\n  Does the other side realize that at a certain point we are mocking \nthe American people, we are mocking the legislative process and we are \nmocking the entire Congress by turning this issue into a game of \nchicken where the other side just doesn't care about consequences?\n  To the cynics who recklessly argue that the government should ``shut \ndown'' I ask: Do you realize the impact of your words? Do you see what \nwould happen to the people of West Virginia or any other State in this \ngreat Nation, if we just tell everyone that the government can't \nfunction right now?\n  I want to make a point here. The other side likes to go on and on \nabout how important it is for us to get the economy back on track and \nkeep the recovery going.\n  Have any of them who keep crying that we should ``shut it down'' \nstopped and thought about the economic impact on families of sending \nhome thousands of hard working Americans without a pay check?\n  During the two government shutdowns in 1995-1996, about 800,000 \nFederal employees were unable to work. Is cheering for a repeat a good \npath towards prosperity?\n  Is the best way to curb spending really to just tell people go home \nand sit? To tell them that they may have a job at some point but for \nnow we are closing programs, parks, grants, inspectors and everything \nelse they can think of?\n  With workers facing frozen wages struggling to pay their mortgages, \ncoping with trade deficits, and closed factories--is this really the \nbest we can do for them?\n  Shutting down the government is a simple and easy way to pander to \nthe tea party and the extremist elements of the far right. By insisting \non their way or no way, the tea partiers are squandering precious time \nand resources. The best part of what we do here is working together. \nFinding the best ideas and working until we have a solution.\n  This squabble should be settled by a reasoned discussion and a \nthoughtful exchange of ideas between Democrats and Republicans.\n  I call upon the other side to show some leadership and bring us back \nfrom the brink.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the important issue of \nthe day. Sometimes complex challenges present clear and compelling \nchoices. That is the case for the fiscal challenge before us today. We \nhave a choice between delay and disruption or progress and accord. The \nNation's eyes are upon us. We need to vote to keep our government \nrunning, to pay our military, and at the same time take essential steps \nto tame our uncontrolled spending and deficit. Most important, we need \nto ensure that our men and women in uniform continue to receive their \nwell-earned pay while we undertake the work of balancing America's \nbooks and they undertake the vital work of defending our Nation, both \nhere at home and abroad.\n  In that regard, I am proud to be one of the sponsors of a bill \nintroduced by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison that will make sure that \nhappens, even after the work of the 111th Congress is finished. I am \nalso pleased to report that we are now up to 74 cosponsors.\n  But in the final analysis we need to reduce our overall spending, \nwhich Americans recognize is necessary, necessary because every day we \ndelay we are spending ourselves $4 billion deeper into debt. Right now, \nthis fiscal year, we are on a path to spend $3.7 trillion, but we are \ntaking in only $2.2 trillion in revenue, leaving a deficit of more than \n$1.5 trillion. To make up for that shortfall the Federal Government is \nborrowing 40 cents out of every dollar that we spend, with a national \ndebt of more than $14 trillion. Our largest lender is China, which now \nholds more than $1 trillion in American bonds.\n  No American family would practice that kind of fiscal management, and \nneither should our country. Reducing our debt and deficit is something \nthe American people understand and support because the American people \nare the ones suffering the impacts. Nearly 14 million of our country \nmen and women are out of work and another 8 million are underemployed \nbecause they have had their hours cut back or they cannot find a full-\ntime job. Sadly, 1 million more have stopped looking.\n  As private investment has plummeted, unemployment has climbed sharply \nto levels we have not seen in decades. For those who are fortunate \nenough to be working, the American dream is getting more and more \ndifficult to achieve. In response to growing inflationary pressure, the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\nReserve Bank now says that interest rates are likely to rise at the end \nof the year to tighten our money supply. Every percent increase in \ninterest rates adds $140 billion to our debt. Higher interest rates \nwill erode the income of every American and make it harder to buy a \nhome, a car, or a college education. Spending more will not help them. \nIn fact, spending more will prolong the problem.\n  In the 1990s, when government spending as a share of GDP shrank, \nemployment grew. Despite the surge in government spending over the past \n2 years, unemployment still hovers stubbornly at about 9 percent. We do \nnot need more public spending. What we need is more private investment. \nWhen private investment grows, unemployment shrinks. The American \npeople understand all of this and that is why they want us to arrive at \na plan that keeps our government running, that respects the sacrifices \nof our military in real terms, and puts us back on the road to fiscal \nhealth.\n  We owe it to these hard-working men and women to bring the 2011 \nbudget to a reasonable and realistic conclusion and then move on to the \nimportant matters that still lie before us, including the 2012 budget. \nThat is where we can address all of the substantive and urgent issues \nthat we must resolve to get America's financial house in order; issues \nsuch as making sure we have a prudent level of spending, reforming our \nTax Code, and making entitlement programs such as Social Security and \nMedicare solvent and more secure for our seniors, both now and long \ninto the future. We owe that not just to our current constituents but \nto future generations of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2326-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2326-S2334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent the period for morning business \nfor debate only be extended until 8 p.m., with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each, and the majority leader to be \nrecognized at 8 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I came over here at this very precarious \nmoment, hours away from a possible shutdown, to basically say there is \nabsolutely no reason to shut this government down, absolutely no \nreason. Why? Because both sides agree that we need to cut the budget. \nBoth sides agree that we need to reduce the deficit. When the debate \ngot started, the Republicans put out a number and, guess what. We came \nto their number. We came all the way to their number.\n  Then they said, whoops, no, we don't like that, we are going to go to \na bigger number. We said we are worried because, as my friend from \nNorth Dakota said, we care about job creation, and Mark Zandi, the key \neconomic adviser to John McCain's campaign, said if you do what the \nRepublicans want to do, that is the Republicans in the House on H.R. 1, \nthat will cost 700,000 jobs. Can you believe that? After we are finally \ncoming out of this recession--thank the Lord God we had a quarter of a \nmillion new jobs last month--and here they are going to take a meat axe \nto this budget and according to outside experts going to destroy the \neconomic recovery and set us right back into a recession.\n  So we said hold off here, we believe we need to be wise about this. \nWe went to your number that you originally put out there. Why do you \nkeep moving the goal posts?\n  They said: Well, that is the way it is. We moved the goal posts. Take \nit or leave it.\n  We said all right, we are going to go back and we are going to go as \nfar in your direction as we possibly can do and not jeopardize jobs. We \nwent back and here is where we are. We went 78 percent of the way to \nthe Republican new number.\n  Here is the deal. I want the American people to be the judge of this. \nThere was an election in 2010. The Republicans won big in the House and \nthey took it over, so they run the House. The Democrats retained \ncontrol of the Senate. I know very much about it because I was one of \nthose seats that was being watched. We kept control of the Senate and \nof course the President is a Democrat and he is there for a couple of \nyears. Of course some of us hope for a lot longer, but here is the \ndeal: Out of the three parties to the negotiations, Republicans control \none-third of the government and Democrats two-thirds. We did not look \nat our Republican friends and say we control much more than you do, so \nwe will only go a third of the way to you. We were willing to give and \ngive and to look at expenditures that we believe are key, and we said \nwe are willing to give some of this up, and we marched over to their \nside 78 percent of the way.\n  If I stopped someone in the street, a person who maybe did not have \nmuch experience about beltway politics, and I said if you were \nnegotiating with two of your friends and they saw something their way \nand you saw it your way and they came 78 percent of the way to what you \nwanted, what would you do? I think the average person would say: \nHurray, let's get this done.\n  Well, that is what I say tonight. Let's get this done. There is no \nreason to shut down the Federal Government when we have come--the \nDemocrats have come, by way of cuts, 78 percent of the way to our \nRepublican friends.\n  But let me tell you the bad news. It turns out this is not what the \nfight is about at all. At the eleventh hour, our Republican friends are \nholding this country hostage to an agenda which is about cutting \nwomen's health care.\n  Now, you may say: Could you say that again, Senator Boxer. What?\n  Yes, this debate over the budget, where we have come 78 percent of \nthe way and made painful cuts, is not about budget cutting; it is about \nwomen's health. Let me tell you specifically what it is about. It is \nabout a women's health care program known as title X.\n  I am sure people are saying: What is that?\n  It is very simple. In 1970, a Republican President named Richard \nNixon signed this bill. And do you know who voted for it in the House? \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush. We are talking about a bipartisan \nbill to give women the health care they need. And the Republicans, to \ndate, have moved so far away from their own legacy, from their own \nhistory, that they are off the charts in extreme land somewhere.\n  I want to share one reason women use these title X clinics as their \nfirst line of health. And by the way, millions of women do--and men--\nbecause they get help for high blood pressure, diabetes checks, they \nget help for breast cancer screening, they get help for pelvic exams, \nthey get help for sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS testing, \nreferrals for additional medical screening and diagnostic testing, \nblood screening, smoking cessation, cholesterol screening, infertility \ncounseling, and, if asked for, birth control, which, when it is \ncounseled in the right way, birth control will prevent unwanted \npregnancies and therefore bring down the number of abortions.\n  Somebody explain to me how our country is better off when our \nAmerican families are shut out of health care, health care that is so \ncost-effective, that for every dollar that is spent through the title X \nhealth care program, which goes to local clinics--and 75 percent of the \nfunding does not go to Planned Parenthood. Can we be clear here? \nPlanned Parenthood gets 25 percent and does a fabulous job. But the \nfact is, not one penny can ever be used for abortion or people could go \nto jail. There is no money in here for abortion, period, end of quote. \nIt is because of the Hyde amendment--I know this because I was in the \nHouse of Representatives when we dealt with the Hyde amendment. We said \nthere ought to be an exception for rape and incest, OK? So I personally \nknow the Hyde amendment is the law of the land. So if anyone tells you \nthey are closing down the government because of abortion, it has \nnothing to do with abortion. It has to do with mainstream health care \nfor women and their families.\n  So here we are. We have come 78 percent of the way to them on cuts. \nBy the way, they announced last night that was it. We agreed that was \nfine. But now we don't have an agreement.\n  I have my fingers crossed that at 8 o'clock, the majority leader will \nsay that we have overcome our problems; that he will say we go back to \nagreeing on the number that was agreed to last night. It is well above \n$70 billion. Remember, we cut that out in just the\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\nnext 5 months or so. That is a big bite, but we all know we have to \nreduce the deficit. But I hope our Republican friends have backed off \nfrom this, backed off of them completely shutting down and eliminating \na women's health care program used by their families, and men, 5 \nmillion of them. It is cost-effective. It provides $4 of benefits for \nevery dollar invested. Mr. President, 4,500 clinics, 75 percent of them \nnon-Planned Parenthood, 25 percent of them Planned Parenthood; none \nused for abortion, all used for health care. I hope they will back off \nand say: You know what, we have reflected on this. We have read this. \nWe know the health care our people are getting at home. We checked it \nout. We called our district. We called our State. And we have decided \nto come off of this crazy idea, and we will stand with Richard Nixon \nand we will stand with George Herbert Walker Bush, who supported title \nX.\n  I can't imagine how our Republican friends would rather shut down the \ngovernment than to continue this health care program. I cannot imagine \nwhy they would rather take paychecks away from our hard-working men and \nwomen in uniform and others who are cleaning up Superfund sites, who \nare working to deliver veterans' benefits, who are working to keep our \nparks open. Why would they take paychecks away from those people \nbecause they do not want to continue breast cancer screening to women?\n  Speaking of paychecks, you have to know that the Senate unanimously \npassed a bill that said that if we fail to keep the government open, we \ndo not get paid because, guess what, Members of Congress get paid by a \nspecial statute. Everybody else does not get their paycheck, but we get \nour paycheck. We sent this offer to Speaker Boehner. Do you know what \nhappened to it? I do not know what happened to it. I do not know what \nhappened to it. It would take him 2 minutes right now to bring it up. \nSo if he is watching this--I guess he is not, but if he were, I would \nsay: Just take 5 minutes and go to your Rules Committee and bring this \nbill up and let America know that you, Mr. Boehner, and your colleagues \nwho are ready to shut this government down will not get a paycheck.\n  I am so tired of the hypocrisy around this place. I really am. One of \nthe comments from a Congressman over there--he was complaining. He \nsaid: I do not make enough. Mr. President, $174,000. He does not make \nenough. I cried for him. But I have to say this: Where are his tears \nfor his staffers? Where are his tears for the military who are not \ngoing to get paid? Where are his tears for his people cleaning up \nSuperfund sites and for the guy out here on the Mall?\n  There is the biggest day for our national park, the biggest week, the \nbiggest month--April. Some 800,000 people come from all over the world \nto go to our national park, many for the Cherry Blossom Festival. Some \npeople already may be here for that--kids, families. These hotels are \nbooked. The restaurants are booked. Where are this Congressman's tears \nfor the people whose family vacations were destroyed? Maybe they can't \nget back their airfare. Neighborhood restaurants here may lose money \nthis week, and the hotels.\n  In my State, we have Yosemite National Park. If you go there, you \nwill be transformed into another world and another place. I tell you, \nthe first time I ever stepped out there in that valley, my heart almost \ndropped from the beauty from what God has given us. That experience \ncould be shut down in this shutdown.\n  I am not making a choice between Yosemite and the 46 clinics in the \nCentral Valley who get title X funding, 46 clinics that see hundreds \nand hundreds of patients in need of health care. I am not going to \nchoose. I am going to say: Keep this government open. What is your \nproblem with women? What is your problem with giving women the health \ncare they deserve? What happened in your life that you do not \nunderstand that a woman who gets an early breast cancer screening can \nhave her life saved? What is wrong with you over there? A Pap smear. I \nam sure that if it were your daughter, if it were your wife, oh my God, \nyou would do anything to get them to the doctor to make sure they were \nhealthy. Where is your voice for these 5 million women? I have to say \nthat I am baffled on this one. This is not about abortion. I already \nsaid that. Not one dollar goes to abortion.\n  I have to say that the Republicans would rather close all of our \nnational parks and they would rather suspend tax refunds for hard-\nworking Americans than give cervical screenings to women and provide \nHIV and STD testing for men and women.\n  You know, they are going to close the Small Business Administration, \nand that hurts our small businesses and that hurts jobs.\n  They are going to close down the mortgages from FHA, which backs \nabout a third of new mortgages. So if you are finally coming out of \nthis mess and you have bought a house, about a third of new mortgages \nare backed by them, so you are stuck in your tracks. If you are trying \nto sell a house and you thought you had it done, you now have to put it \noff. I have to say that to do this at any time is ridiculous, but to do \nthis because you do not want women to get health care is a sin. To do \nthis in a time of three wars makes no sense at all.\n  Food and drug inspections. We know what happens when particularly our \nkids get sick because there is some kind of foodborne illness. No more \ninspections. Closed down.\n  So I am saying once again, to sum it up in the best way I can, yes, \nno question, we had an election, and the Republicans won the House. And \nthere are three parties to this agreement: the Senate, controlled by \nDemocrats; the White House, controlled by Democrats; and a Republican \nHouse. So the Republicans control one-third of the government that is \nmaking this decision. We have come 78 percent their way because we know \nwe have to make painful cuts. We are mindful of that. We are not \nstanding in our corner with our blankie and our teddy bear with our \nfinger in our mouth saying: Please, leave us alone. We are willing. We \nare willing to go their way. And they have not--well, they have moved \nthe other way. In other words, we met their number, and then they made \na new number. We met that number, and then they made a new number. Now \nwe are 78 percent to the new number.\n  Please, we do not have to shut down this government. What a waste. \nWhat a ridiculous waste. In my State, I would urge my Republican \nfriends who want to shut down the title X women's health program, visit \nthe St. Johns Well Child and Family Center in Los Angeles. Find out \nabout their work. Find out about the good work they do for the people \nthere. Call Our Savior Center in El Monte, CA. They receive title X \nfunds too. Find out about the work they do. Call the Good Samaritan \nFamily Resources Center in San Francisco. Find out about the good work \nthey do with title X funding.\n  Think about your legacy as a Republican--Richard Nixon signing this \nproudly, George H.W. Bush voting for it in the House. This is a \nbipartisan women's health care program. There is no need to shut down \nthe government because you want to stop funding a program that helps \nour people, that is cost-effective, that stops the spread of disease. \nHow they could do this is beyond me.\n  I ask the people of America who may be watching this debate and \nhearing about these issues--it is time now. There are a few hours. \nLet's flood Speaker Boehner's phones. Let's e-mail all the leaders, \nDemocratic and Republican, and say: OK. It is time to end this \nstandoff.\n  The last thing I want to bring up is this: I have been in politics a \nlong time. I love public service. It is in my bones. I have watched \nsometimes what I call an overreach. It sometimes happens by Republicans \nand sometimes by Democrats. What I am seeing across this country is an \noverreach by the far right of the Republican Party which is driving the \nRepublican Party agenda. We saw it in Wisconsin. There we had a \nGovernor who came to the microphone with tremendous support, newly \nelected. He said: We have a budget problem, and we are going to have to \nmake some tough decisions.\n  Everyone nodded and said: Yes.\n  He said: These unions that represent the workers, they better come to \nthe table because if they don't, I am going to have to take some steps \nto reduce their salaries and all the rest.\n  The unions said: OK. We will come to the table.\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\n  The unions came to the table. Guess what they said. We will give up \non every dollar you have asked us to do.\n  The Governor said: Really? Really? Then he said: Fine. I will make \nthose cuts, and I am taking away your bargaining rights forever.\n  That was an overreach. What we are doing is responding to Republicans \nwho said: We have a deficit problem, and we need your help.\n  We said: Yes. And we came to the table. We met them at their number. \nThen they increased their number. We said: OK, we will come a little \nmore. As of last night, we came 78 percent of the way. They agreed last \nnight. Now it turns out, just like in Wisconsin, it wasn't about the \nnumbers. It was about some kind of an agenda that would throw women \nunder the bus.\n  I am here to say that isn't going to happen. There isn't one Democrat \nin our Democratic caucus, male or female, from one side of our party to \nthe other--and, believe me, we have a big range of philosophies--not \none of them is willing to say this program ought to go because they \nknow it is saving women's lives.\n  As Harry Reid, our leader, said today at a press conference: Someday \nI may not be around to help my kids and my grandkids. I will not be \nhere forever to help them. What if things go wrong and they have to go \nto a clinic and they have to get that mammogram. There is only one \nclinic that does it, though, and that is the one in Texas. But they \nhave screenings. What if you have to have that Pap smear. What if you \nneed that referral for further testing? What if you need to get help \nbecause you have diabetes and you don't have health insurance and you \ngo to that clinic and they help you.\n  Harry Reid said: We are here today not only about today but about \ntomorrow.\n  Here is a program that has lasted since 1970. Count the decades, \nfolks. We are not going to end a program that has its roots in \nbipartisanship, that has its roots in caring about our fellow human \nbeings. It isn't necessary. A budget is about a budget is about a \nbudget. It isn't about somebody's political vendetta.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 12 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, still at this late date, I want to remain \noptimistic that we will reach a final deal on Federal spending. At \nleast the dueling press conferences are continuing as I speak. I hope \nthe negotiations are continuing by someone somewhere. Hope springs \neternal. Under the banner of hope and change, I would hope the majority \nleader would change his mind and at the very least bring the House-\npassed measure to the floor for a vote to fund the military through the \nend of the fiscal year and avert a shutdown of the federal government, \nand make a significant reduction in spending. Anything less is \nirresponsible.\n  Kansans are now calling my office. They have been all day, all week, \nall year. Their message is clear. It is time to stop spending money we \ndon't have. The House-passed measure is but a small step in this \ndirection and would keep the government from shutting down, a goal I \nthink everybody would like to see happen.\n  Let's clarify the facts. The national debt is over $14 trillion and \ngrowing daily. Some now say it is $14.6 trillion. We are fast \napproaching the debt ceiling and another very serious decision. I know \nthe majority leadership remembers the last time the debt ceiling was \nraised. It was four times in the last 2 years.\n  By the way, the majority spent twice as much in 2 years as was spent \nthe last 4 years of the previous administration. If this continues, \nthen by the year 2014 interest payments on the debt alone will be \ngreater than all discretionary spending outside of defense. The debate \nor fuss about which programs must not be cut will not be debated on the \nfloor of this distinguished body because they will all be cut. There \nwon't be any money. The money will go to pay interest on the debt.\n  The House of Representatives is doing what its majority pledged to \ndo, what it was elected to do--reduce Washington spending.\n  As a logical consequence--and it should not be a surprise to any \nmember of the majority of this body or the minority in the other--the \nHouse passed a bill to bring government spending back down to 2008 \nlevels. That is what they said they would do, and that is what they are \ndoing.\n  In March the majority in this Chamber rejected these modest cuts in \nspending, and we have been operating under a series of short-term \ncontinuing resolutions ever since. All of us know that government by CR \nis no way to govern. The leadership of the previous Congress failed to \npass a budget last year, failed to pass even a single appropriations \nbill. We are still dealing with that abdication of responsibility.\n  But we are where we are. The House passed another measure to keep the \nFederal Government open for another week, funded our military men and \nwomen and their families for the next 6 months, and cut government \nspending by $12 billion while we negotiate a long-term solution. \nHopefully, we could continue to negotiate a long-term solution.\n  I know tempers are frayed. What is bothersome is that the leadership \nrefuses to bring this measure to a vote. They have the votes to defeat \nit. They also refuse to put forth an alternative proposal to cut \nspending. It is one thing to blame the majority in the other body and \nsay you simply can't support it. If that is the case, bring it to the \nfloor. Let's vote on it, and let's see what kind of an alternative the \nleadership here offers.\n  The media is referring to this impasse as a shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment, but we need to be careful before we call this a government \nshutdown. The people of Kansas and all of America are rightly outraged \nthat funding for our troops and their families is at risk, funding for \nmost customer service support at the VA is at risk, and that funding \nfor a wide range of economic development and agriculture programs is at \nrisk. But that is not true with regard to one segment of our \ngovernment. Just as the Army sings ``as these caissons keep rolling \nalong,'' so does the perpetual motion machine of Federal regulation. \nThe Federal regulation machine is such that even a government shutdown \ncan't stop it.\n  Earlier this week, I came to the floor to talk about the concerns I \nam hearing from our community bankers in Kansas. According to a summary \nof the Dodd-Frank act by Davis Polk, the act mandates that 11 different \nagencies create at least 243 more regulations, issue 67 one-time \nreports or studies, and 22 new periodic reports. Financial regulators \nhave already issued more than 1,400 pages of regulatory proposals, and \n5,000 pages of regulations are expected. These will create additional \nand significant compliance costs that will impact the ability of every \nbank to serve its community. They come on top of existing regulation, \nincluding 1,700 pages of consumer regulations and hundreds of pages of \nregulations regarding lending practices and operations that banks are \nalready required to comply with, and they do in good faith.\n  Some folks might think--and naturally so--if the government is shut \ndown, regulators won't be on the job either. Wrong. Apparently nothing, \nabsolutely nothing can or will stop regulators from regulating. In the \ncase of some financial regulators, agencies not funded by taxpayer \ndollars, they will be on the job, and we can anticipate that the \nburdensome regulations will continue.\n\n  Well, what about implementing the costly and controversial health \ncare reform bill? Will a government shutdown slow this hugely unpopular \nprogram chock-full of regulations? Well, the answer, of course, is no.\n  In the Secretary's contingency plans for HHS, under a list of what \nwill remain open during this shutdown, she believes that ``operations \nof the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight''--its a \nmouthful, Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, the \nregulating agency under the Department of Health and Human Services \nthat is working to issue regulations to implement health care reform--\n``could continue as funding was provided through the Affordable Care \nAct.''\n  Well, this is just another example of full steam ahead with \nObamaCare, just\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\nlike during the health care reform debate. The regulatory overreach \nthat has become a hallmark of this administration is not stopped by \neven a shutdown of the Federal Government. For example, regulations \nlike the one issued just recently, days ago, by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services on something called accountable care \norganizations, also known as ACOs--ACOs used to be HMOs; didn't like \nHMOs too much, so we have something like HMOs, but now we call them \nACOs--turned 6 pages of ObamaCare into 429 pages of regulations--429 \npages in just 1 regulation. These new regulations empower Dr. Berwick, \nthe man in charge, and CMS, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices, to make decisions about how medical care will be delivered in \nthis country.\n  So a government shutdown or not, under a cowering business community, \nthe incredible Federal regulation machine goes on like a giant creature \nfrom a video game, belching fire, smoke, fines, and regulations. \nNothing, not even a shutdown of the Federal Government, can slay the \nregulating dragon.\n  This debate should not be about party politics. It should not even be \nabout regulation, except I discovered the regulation is going on \ndespite the government shutdown, which I think is most unusual, to say \nthe least. This is really about reducing spending and finally trying to \ntighten our Federal belt. We are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we \nspend. I said that by 2014 all discretionary funds would be used to pay \noff the interest on the national debt.\n  The House has now passed a bill to keep our military families whole \nand the government running at 2008 levels while we try to work out a \nlong-term solution. A Federal shutdown does not benefit anyone except \nregulators who under a shutdown will continue to regulate, now \nunchecked.\n  I urge the majority leader to at least bring the House-passed bill to \nthe floor for a vote. I thank all the people who have worked so \nterribly hard on the negotiations. I hope they are successful, even \nthough ``tempus is fugiting''--time is running out.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, well, we are less than 6 hours away from a \npotential government shutdown. I take this time to sort of bring people \nup to date in Maryland as to where we are. I say that because in \nMaryland we have about 150,000 civilian active Federal employees. \nObviously, they are directly affected if we have a government shutdown. \nThey will not get a paycheck. Whether they work or not, they will not \nbe getting their paychecks. I just want everyone to think about what \nthat means. If you have a car payment that is due and you do not have a \npaycheck or a full paycheck, you still have to make that car payment. \nYou might not have the money to do it. If you have certain \nresponsibilities on a student loan, you may not be able to come up with \nthe money to deal with it. So it is going to cause real problems for \nthose Federal workers who had nothing at all to do with the problems we \nare confronting in passing a budget. They are not at fault. But yet \nthey will be the first ones who will be suffering as a result of a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  But it does not end with the Federal workforce because the Federal \nworkforce, with their salaries, buys goods and services. Literally \nthousands of small businesses in Maryland are going to be adversely \naffected, and many around the country, because of the impact of the \nFederal workforce being on furlough, not getting their checks, the \nimpact that is going to have on our businesses and on our economy.\n  But it does not end there. Federal contractors who depend upon the \nFederal contracts, whether to help us with national security or \nhomeland security or to deal with health care issues, are going to be \naffected also because these contracts are not going to go forward.\n  So I really want to continue to underscore that a government shutdown \nwill have a major negative impact, not just on our Federal workforce, \nnot just on the businesses that are going to be hurt as a result of it, \nbut on our entire economy. All of us will suffer.\n  But I really take this time to try to bring people up to date on \nwhere we are on the negotiations because I have heard many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle say: Gee, if we could only \nbalance the budget, if we could only bring up a short-term CR. That is \nnot the problem. It is not the problem we are confronting right now \nbecause, quite frankly, the negotiators have agreed on the dollar \namount of a budget from now to the end of the year. That number has \nbeen agreed to. So this is not about the Federal deficit any longer. It \nis about whether we can reach an agreement on a budget for the \nremainder of this year--not the dollar amount.\n  We are now tied up on what we call the policy riders. But we are not \neven talking about all the policy riders; we are talking about one \npolicy rider which my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, I think \noutlined very clearly.\n  I wish to take this time on behalf of my wife, on behalf of my \ndaughter, on behalf of my two little granddaughters, because it is \nabout women's health care issues. That is what we are talking about, \nand we are talking about whether we are going to be able to allow those \nprograms to move forward during the next 6 months. It does not affect \nthe dollars, the types of programs that we allow. So to make it clear, \nwe are talking about women's health care issues that deal principally \nwith preventive health care--the cancer screenings to keep women \nhealthy. Not one dollar of those funds can be used for abortions. So \nlet's make that clear from the beginning. This is not part of the \nabortion debate. This is talking about whether we should allow this \ntype of policy rider to be on this bill. It is not appropriate. I think \nall of us understand it is not appropriate.\n  But I even go further than that. I am not even sure it is about that. \nIt appears to many of us that you have an element in the House of \nRepresentatives on the Republican side that really wants to see a \ngovernment shutdown. They have said that. They applauded the Speaker \nwhen the Speaker said: Let's get prepared for a government shutdown. \nThey gave him a standing ovation. They said, over and over again, maybe \na government shutdown will be good. Well, a government shutdown will \nnot be good. I think we all can agree on that. If this is about the \nbudget, as it should be, a government shutdown costs more money.\n  Then I hear a lot of my colleagues come to the floor and say: Look, \nwe have to get rid of all this red ink and all these deficits. We could \ngo back to the fact that we did balance the budget in the 1990s. We did \nit without a single Republican vote. We took a deficit and we balanced \nthe budget.\n  When George W. Bush became President, he had a large surplus--only to \nsee the policies of that administration, which went to war and did not \npay for it, and we ended up with large deficits and an economy that was \nlosing 700,000 jobs a month when Barack Obama became President.\n  We could go back and start talking about how we got here, but the \nquestion is, How are we going to get the budget back into balance? \nThere, I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We \nneed to do that. But remember, the debate tonight on preventing the \ngovernment from shutting down has nothing to do with that. The dollar \namounts are in agreement. It is the policy issues concerning women's \nhealth care or whether, in fact, there is a group on the other side \nthat represents the tea party that does not want to enter into an \nagreement. Remember, they said: Don't compromise at all. ``No \ncompromise'' was their position, where they controlled the day.\n\n  But I must tell you, we have to come together and deal with the \nbudget deficit. There are 64 of us--32 Democrats, 32 Republicans--who \nhave signed a letter saying we are prepared to consider all the issues \nof balancing the budget, whether it is domestic spending, military \nspending, mandatory spending, or revenues. That is what we are going to \nhave to do. We are going to have to get together and put the Nation's \ninterests first. I believe we can do that. I believe we can get this \nbudget into balance.\n  But it starts with a little good-faith effort here tonight, a good-\nfaith effort. When we have already reached the agreement on the dollar \namount, let's not let a minority in the House of Representatives \nprevent us from keeping the government operating--that is\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\nwhat it comes down to--so the Federal worker in Maryland or that person \nwho happens to be in Rhode Island tonight, and tomorrow recognizes he \nneeds his passport renewed in order to take a trip, can find the \npassport office open or whether it is that potential homeowner who is \ngoing to need an FHA loan and is told that if there is a government \nshutdown, that loan cannot go forward or whether it is that family who \nwas planning to come to the Nation's Capital and enjoy the Smithsonian \nand is going to be told the Smithsonian is now going to be closed. \nLet's not use those individuals as a target for the extreme actions in \nthe other body.\n  I am convinced we still have time to get this done. We know offers \nhave been made in good faith. We know we have the dollar amounts. So I \nhope that within the next couple hours we can prevent a government \nshutdown because it absolutely makes no sense.\n  My constituents are angry about this, and so am I. I hope we will see \nreason prevail, and then we can move on and deal with the real budget \nproblems of this country. We cannot deal with it in only 12 percent of \nthe budget, and that is all we are talking about here in this budget \nfor the rest of this year. Hopefully, we will be able to get together \nand figure out how we can move forward. But it starts with keeping \ngovernment functioning. It starts with honoring the types of \ncommitments we have all talked about here to negotiate in good faith.\n  I have said this many times: It is not going to be the budget the \nDemocrats want. It will not be the budget the Republicans want. That is \nwhat negotiations are about. But when you have some on the other side \nwho say: Look, it is going to be our way or no way, that is not the way \nthe process works.\n  I hope the majority in the House of Representatives is listening to \nthis debate and listening to the American people and will act in the \nbest interests of the American people and allow the process to move \nforward so we can keep government functioning.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President we have come to the end of a long \nprocess that has had some signal moments to it. Clearly, one signal \nmoment was a few days ago when the tea party activists came to the \nCapitol--came to this building--gathered outside, and were led by \nRepublican House Members in chanting about the U.S. Government: ``Shut \nit down! Shut it down! Shut it down!'' Shortly after that, there was a \ndiscussion between the Republican Speaker and the Members of the \nRepublican caucus in which the Speaker indicated that they were to \nprepare for a government shutdown, and the response was a standing \novation, as reported by the Washington Post.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Maryland knows, we sit through our \ncaucus meetings, and there has never been anything like an ovation on \nour side for the concept of a government shutdown. There is silence, \nmaybe an occasional groan of disappointment, when we have heard about \nhow the goal posts have been moved yet again to keep an agreement from \nbeing reached.\n  Recent polling shows there is a reason for this difference between \nthe parties here, or the different attitudes and desires with respect \nto a government shutdown. Democratic voters prefer compromise to a \nshutdown by better than 3 to 1. By better than 3 to 1, Democratic \nvoters would prefer us to work this out than to shut down the U.S. \nGovernment. On the other side, Republican voters actually favor \nshutting down the government. So it should come as no surprise that \nthese public demonstrations demanding ``shut it down'' take place; that \nthe Republican caucus on the House side gives standing ovations to the \nnotion of shutting down the U.S. Government, and that we are now at the \nbrink of a U.S. Government shutdown as a result.\n  There was a time when this appeared to be about the deficit. Clearly, \nwe have had to make progress on the deficit, and we have made \nsignificant progress on the deficit, as was announced from last night's \nmeeting between the Senate leaders, the President of the United States, \nand the House leaders that they had agreed on a $78 billion number out \nof the $100 billion number that had been the Republican goal. It is \nhard to say that we have not gone the extra mile when we are settling \non a point of $78 billion out of the $100 billion that was requested.\n  As we have looked at the actual cuts that the other side has pushed \nfor, there has appeared to be a pretty strong overlay between the cuts \nthemselves and the political agenda of the other party. Things such as \nfocusing 100 percent of their cost-cutting energy on only the spending \nside of the budget and only 12 percent of the pie. A slice of the pie \nthat is only 12 percent was where they focused 100 percent of their \nattention. A tax on programs such as Head Start that help poor children \nget a head start in life and prove exceptional outcomes, to the point \nwhere the mayor of our capital city, Providence, RI, is a child who got \nhis start in life in a Head Start Program. From there he went through \nthe public school system and ended up at Harvard University. He became \na lawyer, and he is now the mayor of Rhode Island's capital city. That \nis the kind of story that Head Start starts. Yet it was the focus of \nterrible cuts.\n  City Year and Teach For America--programs that take bright young \nAmericans and put them into our schools to help younger kids learn to \nbe better students and have more productive futures--catastrophic \nwipeout cuts were driven at those programs.\n  National Public Radio: Catastrophic wipeout cuts.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency was singled out for the worst \ntreatment of all, reflecting the long relationship that has existed \nbetween the other party and corporate interests that do considerable \ndamage to our air and water.\n  So if we look at what they are doing there, there were a number of \npeople who became suspicious and concerned that the Republican cost-\ncutting agenda was a Trojan horse. We remember the Trojan horse. Troy \nwas in its walls, the Greeks were outside. They couldn't get through \nthe walls of Troy, so they built a horse. The Trojans thought it was a \ngift and they allowed it in, but the Trojan horse contained within it \nGreek soldiers who came out in the night and were able to open the \ngates and the attack came on Troy. That is the legend of the Trojan \nhorse.\n  So there is a pretty good case I think some of us could make that a \nlot of what these cuts were was a Trojan horse to bring in, through the \ndeficit-cutting agenda that we all agree on, a different ideological \nagenda that has long been associated with the Republican Party and that \nis not very popular. Indeed, at this stage, the tea party has less than \none-third public support. So the notion of driving their agenda through \nisn't fair play. But if you know you are that unpopular, you want to \nattach yourself to something essential. You want to force your \nideological agenda. I think that is where we are right now. It has been \nmade clear by what has happened. Because once a number has been agreed \nto in a budget, clearly, the fight is no longer about the budget. A \nnumber has been agreed to: $78 billion. Yet, the fight persists and the \nfight persists over women's health care.\n  I wish to share a few stories from Rhode Island, first about the \ntitle X family planning program, which is the target here. It was \nsigned into law in 1970 by President Richard Milhous Nixon, a \nRepublican. He said at the time that ``no American woman should be \ndenied access to family planning assistance because of her economic \ncondition.'' Representative George H.W. Bush strongly supported the \nenactment of the program.\n  Title X clinics provide reproductive health services to low-income \nwomen and young adults. It is an essential element in our American \nstrategy to reduce unintended pregnancies. Notably, Federal law \nprohibits any title X funds under the Hyde amendment from being used \nfor abortion services--none, zero, not permitted.\n  So the effort to zero out funding for title X is not about Federal \nfunding\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\nbeing used to support abortion services. It just isn't. Instead, it is \nabout denying access to health care programs that serve over 5 million \nlow-income individuals every year, and it is available to them because \nno one can be refused service based on the fact that they don't have \nthe ability to pay.\n  We have a medical student who wrote in from Rhode Island who works at \na community health center. He said he has been able to perform cervical \ncancer screenings and prescribe birth control for hundreds of women who \nwould otherwise not have had access to these services, all thanks to \ntitle X. He described his patients: ``Most of my patients worked hard \nat low-wage jobs that did not provide adequate health coverage.'' \nIndeed, they may not have provided any benefits at all. He concluded: \n``These women would not have been able to afford such vital health care \nwithout the support of Title X.''\n  In Rhode Island, title X goes to 17 different community health \ncenters and clinics, from the Northwest Community Health Center up in \nPascoag, RI, to the Chaffee Health Center in Providence, to the Tri-\nTown Community Health Center in the Johnston area. It is across the \nState. One of those recipients is Planned Parenthood. Planned \nParenthood would appear to be the real reason--although they take the \nwhole program out, it is probably because Planned Parenthood is in it. \nThey have overtargeted here.\n  The proposed budget would also prohibit Planned Parenthood from \nreceiving any Federal funding. It is remarkable, because Planned \nParenthood provides primary and preventive health care to 3 million \nAmericans each year, and in rural or medically underserved areas, \nPlanned Parenthood health care providers are often the only source of \nhealth care in the community. They are often the only source of health \ncare for women in the community. Ninety percent of the care that is \nprovided at Planned Parenthood health centers is primary and preventive \nhealth care: cancer screenings, Pap tests to identify women at risk of \ndeveloping cervical cancer, mammograms to help detect breast cancer, \nroutine gynecological exams and annual physicals, immunizations, and \ntests and treatments for STDs. They are cost effective and accessible.\n  Let me read some of the things that have come in from Rhode Island. \nHere is Rebecca from Cranston, RI, telling her story:\n\n       After I graduated college, I found myself without health \n     insurance for the first time in my life. While uninsured and \n     job hunting, I had no doctor or gynecologist, and I turned \n     to Planned Parenthood for my basic health care needs.\n       This lasted for almost 4 years because I couldn't get a job \n     with health insurance. If Planned Parenthood had not been \n     there while I was getting on my feet, I would not have \n     received cancer screening, breast exams, or have had a health \n     care professional to answer my questions.\n       My mother had breast cancer twice and Planned Parenthood \n     providers gave me peace of mind. If the Federal funding is \n     cut from Planned Parenthood, other young women will find \n     themselves with nowhere to go and put off lifesaving tests. I \n     plan on doing everything I can for this amazing, caring \n     facility that stood by me when I needed them.\n\n  This is Nora who wrote to me from Warwick, RI:\n\n       Please do not let the loss of funding happen to Planned \n     Parenthood. This health care agency has been a boon to myself \n     and my two daughters for decades. If not for the availability \n     of low-cost health care screenings through Planned \n     Parenthood, we would not be able to afford regular checkups \n     or things like cervical cancer and HPV because we cannot \n     afford health insurance. Planned Parenthood provides us the \n     opportunity to have these tests done at a price we can \n     afford. I hope you will take my message to heart and vote to \n     keep the funding in place for this wonderful organization.\n\n  Yes, Nora, I will take your message to heart.\n  Saren from Coventry, RI, wrote in to tell her story:\n\n       In 2004, I went to Planned Parenthood for a pap smear test. \n     I didn't have a regular gynecologist or even a primary care \n     doctor. Further testing revealed I had the beginnings of \n     cervical cancer. I was stunned. Never in a million years did \n     I ever expect to be told I had cancer, especially at the age \n     of 24. The doctors at Planned Parenthood told me that the \n     cancer was found early and formulated a course of action, but \n     I was always worried that my chances of having children were \n     low because of the surgery to remove the cancer.\n       Seven years later, I am happy to say I have not had an \n     abnormal pap smear and I have two beautiful, healthy \n     children. I can only wonder where I would be had I not gone \n     to Planned Parenthood and had that pap smear. Those doctors \n     saved my life and gave me the chance to become a mother.\n\n  It is getting rid of that, that is what is motivating our Republican \ncolleagues to push this country into a government shutdown, and the \nprice of that government shutdown is going to be high.\n  We are just in the beginning of our recovery. We are still deep in \nunemployment. In my State of Rhode Island, we are at 12 percent in the \nProvidence metropolitan area, over 11 percent statewide. We are just \nbeginning to recover. A government shutdown would cut off funding for \nFederal employees; it would stop their paychecks, it would shut down \ngovernment projects as their funding ran out and they ground to a halt; \nit would shut down the private businesses, the corporations, the \nconsultants who are working on government contracts as that funding ran \nout and their work ground to a halt; around the country, 800,000 people \nwill be off the payroll.\n  That is not good for America. If we pass H.R. 1, the folks at Goldman \nSachs--and we can say a lot of things about them, but I don't think \nanybody in this room will say they are not good with numbers about the \neconomy--they have said it will drastically knock down our recovery 2 \nfull percentage points out of the 3-percentage point growth we are \npredicting. That is about the same number of jobs. If we were to pass \nH.R. 1, our recovery is basically gone at that point. We will be back \nto where we started when President Obama took office and turned around \nthe 700,000 job-a-month crash we were in--losing 700,000 jobs every \nmonth. So it will slowly go back in a painful way.\n  We don't want to knock that down with H.R. 1--the extreme House \nbill--and with a government shutdown that takes all that money out of \nthe economy. Even more, we don't want to do it over a dispute that is \nnow no longer about the budget, about the deficit, but only about \ntrying to punish the program that allowed Saren from Coventry to \ndiscover her cervical cancer in time to be treated so she could survive \nthat dangerous illness and have her dream of becoming a mother come \ntrue and have two beautiful children.\n  I urge us to get through this moment. I hope my colleagues will, \nfrankly, declare victory, gloat a little, and say: We wanted $100 \nbillion and we got $78 billion. We got way more than halfway.\n  But don't knock this country down, don't knock our government into a \nshutdown in order to score a political point about an organization that \nis so important to women's health care.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I have been carefully listening to the \nspeeches of my colleagues, including the statements of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle. I feel compelled to come to the floor to \nspeak about what I believe is a red herring and a political ploy.\n  This debate is not about women. As the mother of two children, one of \nthem being my 6-year-old daughter, I believe it is unfair and \ninaccurate to say this is about women and their health.\n  Let's be clear on how we got to this point. Last year, even though \nthey had majorities in both Houses, the Democrats failed to pass a \nbudget for 2011 or even a single appropriations bill. Now the House has \npassed full funding for our military for the rest of this fiscal year \nand funding for the rest of our government for 1 week to allow us to \nresolve the remaining issues. That proposal does not even cut title X \nfunding. Yet we have heard from speaker after speaker from the other \nside come to this floor and mischaracterize the potential shutdown of \nour government as being about women's health.\n  Let's talk about what we know to be true. We can end this potential \ngovernment shutdown right now if the majority allows us to vote on the \nproposal that the House has already passed that\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\nfully funds our military for the rest of this fiscal year and gives us \na week to resolve the remaining issues and to resolve this once and for \nall. Then we can move on to the bigger issues we face in addressing the \n$14 trillion debt that threatens our economic strength, threatens our \nnational security, as our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has \ntold us.\n  As a military spouse, I think we owe it to our men and women in \nuniform and their families who are right now making sacrifices for us \noverseas and around the world to immediately pass funding for our \nmilitary for the remainder of this fiscal year, to pass the proposal \nthe House has made. Our military deserves better than political ploys \nand red herrings.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I speak, is there a time limit in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, usually by this time on a Friday, or \neven a little earlier, I have had the pleasure of going back to Iowa on \nthe weekend. I would much rather be doing that. Obviously, we have \nproblems that have to be worked out, and there is reason for staying \naround this weekend, particularly for those of us who do not miss \nvotes, and we do not want to miss a vote, hopefully, to keep government \nfunctioning.\n  There is one advantage of not being on an airplane going back to Iowa \non a Friday when I do not have committee meetings and constituent \nmeetings: I have been able to listen to a lot of the speeches today. We \ndo not get that opportunity Monday through Thursday very often. It is \nquite a pleasure to be able to hear my colleagues speak, as they have \non both sides of the aisle, so strongly about differently held views in \nthis body about the budget issues and subsidiary issues that are being \ndiscussed at this time.\n  Listening to the debate, I have come to the conclusion that it was \none big mistake that we did not get appropriations bills passed last \nyear. I hope people on the other side of the aisle realize if those \nappropriations bills had been passed, we would not be here today \nworrying about shutting down government and reaching some gigantic \ncompromise.\n  I suppose on the other side of the aisle there is a lot of ill \nfeeling about not taking advantage of the fact that last year there \nwere 59 Democrats and only 41 Republicans in this body. The majority \nparty could do just about anything it wanted to do. Of course, in the \nHouse of Representatives it was overwhelmingly controlled by the other \npolitical party, and that control particularly where appropriations \nbills pass.\n  Looking back now, I realize there was not any attempt to bring up any \nappropriations bills, which obviously is not a good way to run the \ngovernment. I did listen to some excuses from the other side of the \naisle when people were asked: How come no appropriations bills were \npassed? The answer from one Senator: We only had 59 votes, and \nRepublicans would not let us bring it up.\n  Then I was in a quandary. There was not anything stopping the \noverwhelming majority of the Democratic Party in the other body from \npassing almost anything they wanted to because it is just a political \nfact of life, whether you have a Republican majority in the House of \nRepresentatives or a Democratic majority in the House of \nRepresentatives, as long as they stick together they can get anything \ndone they want to get done. They can ignore the minority. They may not \nhave been able to ignore the minority in the Senate, if 41 Republicans \nwould stick together, but they hardly ever do. What a mistake it now \nmust be for the Democratic Party not to have passed appropriations \nbills last year so we wouldn't be going through this. But it wasn't \ndone.\n\n  I think, now, looking back, it was probably because they didn't want \ndiscussion of budget issues before the election. They didn't want the \npublic being reminded about the $1.5 trillion deficit. In other words, \nwe borrow about 42 cents out of every $1 we spend, and we take in about \n$2.2 trillion and spend $3.7 trillion. That is in the neighborhood of a \n$1.5 trillion deficit. They probably didn't want that talked about. So \ncome October 1, they passed a continuing resolution until December to \nget through the election, and then, when they got through the election, \nthey would take care of it when we got back here.\n  But the elections are supposed to have consequences, and they do have \nconsequences. If they do not have consequences, representative \ngovernment and democracy doesn't mean much. So as the President himself \nsaid, he took a shellacking and they couldn't get it passed before \nChristmas. So the new people came in and took over--and it was the \nbiggest turnover in Congress since 1938--and with a lot of new people \nthere were a lot of new things to learn and it didn't get done by March \n4. It was extended before Christmas until March 4, then 2 weeks, until \nMarch 18, and then 3 weeks, until this very day.\n  But what a mistake, with overwhelming majorities, this didn't get \ndone in the usual time when we pass 12 appropriations bills to get \nthings funded. It was very clear in the election that people wanted to \nstop this deficit spending, get the spending down, and get the size of \ngovernment down. With the biggest turnover in Congress since 1938, they \nare going to expect some changes to be made, and that is what is going \non right now with the level of expenditures.\n  We are led to believe by people on the other side that money is not \nthe issue; that it is some social policy that is being debated and \nholding this up from happening. But I know this. The only possibility \nof not shutting down government, at least that is partly through the \nCongress, the Republicans are the only ones who have put forward \nlegislation to reduce spending and to keep government open. It is kind \nof a commonsense approach that is used by the other body in sending us \na bill that will fund Defense through the end of the year, and it will \ngive more time for negotiation on the rest of the budget.\n  In funding Defense through the end of the year, we can't fight a war \nfrom week to week with how much money we have to spend. When we voted \nto put our men and women in danger in fighting this war on terror--with \nour men and women in danger, we should give them as much certainty as \nwe can. Even now, with the possibility of not being paid--or the \npossibility their families are not going to get the support they are \nentitled to--it is just a terrible sin, when we have asked people to \ndefend the country.\n  So that is the bill we ought to be taking up. But here we are, and \nthere isn't any desire here to take it up, and the President says he is \ngoing to veto the bill. Why would the President be vetoing a bill that \nis going to give certainty to the military, the Defense Department, and \nwhat they can have to spend to do the job they are supposed to do, \nwhich is the No. 1 function of the Federal Government, our national \nsecurity, and particularly for the families who are standing behind \nthem?\n  So here we are trying to preempt, as far as domestic expenditures are \nconcerned, the 22-percent increase that took place in 2009 and 2010. \nWhen we only have economic growth of 2\\1/2\\ to 3 percent, we can't be \nspending money at 22 percent increases, and that is on top of the $814 \nbillion stimulus bill that was passed that was supposed to keep \nunemployment under 8 percent--and which, obviously, hasn't kept \nunemployment under 8 percent. So preempt that and go back to the 2008 \nlevel of expenditures.\n  I never heard people complaining in 2008 that there wasn't enough \nmoney appropriated to perform the functions of government. It is very \nnecessary that we do that. But we can't incorporate that 22 percent up \nhere and build that into the base over a 10-year budget window. There \nare hundreds of billions of dollars in difference between the 2008 \nlevel of expenditures and the 2010 levels of expenditures, and that is \nwhat it is going to take. We have to be\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\nlooking ahead for the next 60 years, not just the next 6 months.\n  We need to take this gradual step toward the reduction of spending so \ngovernment stops spending money it does not have. We have to start \nmaking decisions that are necessary about the future of our country. To \na great extent, Washington is responsible for some of this. We have to \nreduce wasteful government spending. We have to tighten our belt in \nWashington, as families do at home. When you have dug yourself into a \nhole, the No. 1 rule is, stop digging. This bill, sent over from the \nHouse, will be the first step toward doing that. But for sure the \npublic has a right to know the facts. They do not want us, with the \nfacts they know, leaving our children in a bankrupt situation, which is \nwhat we will do if we don't immediately intervene and do something \nabout it.\n  Also, this discussion about getting government spending down has \nsomething to do with simply creating an environment of certainty for \nour private sector. We have uncertainty in taxes, we have uncertainty \nin EPA regulations, and we have uncertainty from the standpoint of \nfiscal policy of the Federal Government--how much money are we going to \ncontinue to borrow and take away from the private sector. All these \nthings lead to a reluctance of employers, large and small, in this \ncountry to hire people. So this debate is about creating jobs and \nputting in place a fiscal policy, along with a lot of other sensible \npolicies.\n  But when we use the words ``sensible policy''--people back home might \nnot know this--we have to remember this city is an island surrounded by \nreality, and the only business in this town is government. People in \ngovernment, including those of us who are elected, are in the wagon \nwith somebody else pulling the wagon. So we have to go home to our \ndistricts and bring back some common sense. That common sense says \ngovernment ought to live as families live--within their means.\n  Those are the President's words, not mine. When we put his budget out \nin early February, he said: Government has to live within its means. \nThen what sort of a budget does he put out? A 10-year budget window \nthat increases the national debt from $14 trillion to $26 trillion.\n  I hope we get something agreed to tonight. I hope government does not \nshut down. It doesn't save money, like people think it should. It \nactually costs money, and it costs people the services they are \nentitled to. But if you don't remember anything else this Senator has \nsaid tonight, remember this: Elections have consequences, and there \nwere great messages sent in this last election. The people expect us to \nlet them know that we get it and that there aren't any excuses in the \nprocess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Troop Pay \nProtection Act. It is one of the bipartisan pieces of a very partisan \npuzzle, and it is common sense.\n  We owe it to our Nation's troops to avoid their suffering from the \nconsequences if the House of Representatives shuts down this \ngovernment. If we don't pass this measure, while we still have time, \nour troops will continue to serve us overseas--they will always be \nessential to the United States--but they won't get paid. That is \nunacceptable.\n  America's troops are America's heroes. They are serving us in \ndifficult, dirty, dangerous conditions. They are away from their \nfamilies, they are away from their homes and their communities, and \nthey are risking their lives to answer the call of duty. Yet they still \nhave the same financial responsibilities we all have here at home. They \nhave mortgages to pay and car payments to make. They have families to \ntake care of. We do our service men and women right by passing this \nbill.\n  The bill simply says: If there is a shutdown, don't make our troops \npay the price for the failures of a few extremists in Washington, DC.\n  Make sure their paychecks come in on time. Delayed pay is the last \nthing the members of our military and their families should be burdened \nwith.\n  I know there is talk that the House is trying to push through \nsomething similar, in an effort to cover some bases, but their plan \nisn't as straightforward as this bipartisan bill. Their plan to hold \nour troops harmless is part of a week-long spending measure loaded with \na bunch of extreme provisions this country cannot afford. Because it is \npart of a temporary bill, if it is passed, we will be right back here \nmaking the same arguments next week.\n  I am always amazed at how dysfunctional this process can be. I have \nbeen reminded of that a lot this week. Here is an opportunity to throw \nsome common sense back into the mix. I ask my colleagues to pass this \nmeasure and pass it now.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, one thing I would like to say is that I \ndon't want a shutdown, and I don't like where we are tonight--the fact \nthat we are here and our backs are against the wall on a shutdown. I \nthink we, collectively, have done a great disservice to the American \npeople. I think they deserve better than what they are getting right \nnow from Congress.\n  I know the people I represent are hardworking. They are very \nsensible, kind of like the hard-working folks from the State of the \nPresiding Officer. But they are also very patriotic and they believe in \nthis country. They believe in the values and the things that make this \ncountry great. They understand, the people of Arkansas, that right now \nwe have 90,000 troops in Afghanistan and we have more than 45,000 in \nIraq. They are there to serve this country and to serve the interests \nof this country.\n  I can take something local such as the Little Rock Air Force Base, \nand I can say we have more than 5,600 airmen and about 640 civilian \nemployees who could be affected in one way or another by this shutdown. \nAbout 2,000 employees of the Arkansas National Guard will be affected. \nThere are 956 guardsmen on Active Duty who would continue to work \nwithout pay; 233 Arkansas Army Reservists are deployed overseas, \nincluding 23 who are designated for Libya. The people in my State do \nnot want to see the military affected in any way by the partisan \ngamesmanship that you see in Washington.\n  In fact, I would add a note to that. It is unconscionable that we \nshould add stress to our military families right now, especially for \nthose who are deployed. It is just unconscionable that we would do that \nunder the circumstances we find ourselves in tonight.\n  Let me talk about two leaders who stepped up to try to solve this \nproblem and tried to cut through all the mess that we see in \nWashington, tried to cut through the politics as usual. That would be \nSenator Hutchison from Texas and Senator Casey from Pennsylvania. As my \ncolleague from Montana said a moment ago, both of them worked in a very \nbipartisan way to craft legislation that would make sure, one way or \nthe other, our troops get paid on time without any disruptions.\n  We have all heard the phrase ``hard-earned pay.'' How does it get any \nharder earned than by serving in combat for your country? Again, it is \nhard for me to understand how we are here talking about this tonight, \nthat we have not already addressed it.\n  I hope whatever bill is offered is a bipartisan bill. I am not quite \nsure at the moment who is going to be the lead sponsor. As I said, I \nlooked at the legislation offered by the two Senators I mentioned \nbefore. In the Senate things can change for various reasons, but \nhowever it comes down I hope we will not only consider but that we will \npass legislation that will protect our Active-Duty men and women and \nour Reserve Component and the Coast Guard. We cannot forget the Coast \nGuard. A lot of times they are an afterthought, but certainly they do \ngreat things and they serve our country just like everybody else and \nthey deserve to be included in this.\n  Also, we need to give the Secretary of Defense the discretion so he \ncan run his department in a way that will not weaken us. He needs that \ndiscretion, whatever that may mean. Again, we may have some differences \non the details. One Senator may think one thing and another think \nanother, but on the bottom line we need to give him\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\nenough discretion to make sure nothing in that shutdown ends up \nweakening our ability to perform the missions we need performed or puts \nour troops in any additional danger.\n  In conclusion, let me offer an observation. In the last few weeks, on \nmore occasions than I can count, I have witnessed Senators and \nCongressmen, even those in the blogosphere--the commentators, the \ntalking heads, the so-called experts--doing exactly what, in my view, \nis wrong with Washington; that is, they are playing the blame game. \nThey are holding a press conference and pointing fingers at everybody \nbut themselves. It is going on all over the place. I am not singling \nout one person or one party, but we have seen that way too much. The \ntruth is, the folks it is hurting are the American people.\n  Our democracy is designed in such a way and has a track record where \nwe all know it will work, and it will work great, and it will get the \njob done. We represent people and we can get in here and debate hard \nand fight hard and have our differences, but at the end of the process \nwe have votes, we make decisions, and then we move on.\n  Right now, for whatever reason, this is a problem in both Chambers. \nIt is not just in the Senate. Not just one party is at fault. But for \nwhatever reason we are seeing a breakdown in the system. That is not \ngood for the country. Tonight we are talking about our troops, and \ncertainly it is not good for them.\n  I could easily spend the next 10 minutes at my desk blaming the \nRepublicans for where we are tonight. I know they have said we had not \npassed anything. That is not true. We passed extensions six times to \nkeep the government running. But I don't want to get into all that \nbecause I could spend 10 minutes talking about how awful and terrible \nthe Republicans are, and then I could turn right back around and spend \nthe next 10 minutes talking about how terrible the Democrats are.\n  If we would be honest with the American people, both are to blame. I \ncannot stand here in good conscience and blame just one person or one \nparty. The fault lies with all of us.\n  Right now, because of the partisan bickering, because of the \nbreakdown, we are using our military as a pawn in this budget fight. \nThat is something we should never do. We are not helping anyone. This \nis not good government. We are not doing our citizens and our people \nany favors by doing this.\n  I hope tonight, before we go out of here, we would pass something--\nagain, whatever bill it is. I am not hung up on who has to be the lead \nsponsor or what the number of that bill has to be. I hope we will pass \nsomething that will make sure our troops get paid on time and that \ntakes care of our Active Duty, the Reserve and the Coast Guard, and it \nalso gives the Secretary of Defense enough discretion to run his \ndepartment as it needs to be run. Under the circumstances, I think that \nis not even close to too much to ask. I think that is perfectly within \nthe bounds of reason. I hope and pray tonight before we leave we could \nall agree to do that.\n  By the way, if we did put that on the Senate floor and didn't load it \nup with lots of agenda items, if we put that on the Senate floor in a \nclean fashion, I think it would sail out of here probably unanimously. \nI cannot speak for the House, but my guess is we would see the same \nresult down there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2334-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2334-S2338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. My understanding is we have other Senators who may be on \nthe way to speak, so I ask unanimous consent the period for morning \nbusiness, for debate only, be extended until 9 p.m., with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the majority leader \nto be recognized at 9 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, while we are awaiting other Senators, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, throughout this day a lot of our constituents \nback home have been watching the debate. I wonder maybe if they are a \nlittle frustrated. I talked earlier this morning about throwing rotten \napples at each other. There has been a lot of that today. I am not \ngoing to do that tonight. I suggested this morning one of the things we \ncould do while we are waiting to see whether an agreement can be \nreached to fund the government over this fiscal year is to try to shed \nsome light on the process which undoubtedly is a bit confusing to \npeople: What exactly is it that we are arguing about, how did we get \nhere, and what do we have in the future.\n  We talked a little bit this morning, and what we are talking about \ntoday, and what we are hoping to achieve tonight, is an agreement that \nwould determine how much we will spend to fund the Federal Government \nfor the next approximately 6 months through the end of September, which \nis the end of the fiscal year that begins each October 1.\n  That is an important proposition. It is important enough that there \nhas been a lot of very difficult debate about that, as people have seen \nover the last several days, and certainly today. It appears there is \nstill a bit of a deadlock over exactly how much money should be saved \nin the last 6 months of this fiscal year.\n  But when we have concluded this particular debate and determined how \nmuch we are going to spend to fund the government through the end of \nSeptember, we are going to turn to some even more important issues, and \nthey are going to require our concentration, our reaching across the \naisle to talk to each other, to the other body, and both bodies of the \nCongress to speak to the President. We are going to have to listen to \nthe American people and try to reach important understandings because \nthen we are talking about funding the government for the entire fiscal \nyear for 2012 and also trying to figure out what to do with the \nPresident's request to extend the debt ceiling.\n  As I mentioned this morning briefly, extending the debt ceiling is a \nlittle bit like going to your credit card company and saying: All \nright, I have used up all of my available credit, but I want to buy \nsomething else. Will you let me spend a little more on the credit card? \nThat is what the President has asked Congress to do, to extend the debt \nceiling. We will have a robust debate about that.\n  Let me see if I can put what we are doing here in this context. At \nleast for the year 2011, which we are halfway through, we will have \nreduced spending by a pretty dramatic amount, somewhere in the \nneighborhood of $40 and $50 billion. I don't know exactly how much \nuntil we are done, but when we add that to what we call around here the \nbaseline, and multiply it by 10 years, we get substantial savings. Just \non the $10 billion we saved earlier this morning, over 10 years that \n$10 billion equates to $140 billion saved over the 10-year period. So \nwe are talking about substantial money.\n  But that probably pales in comparison to what we are going to need to \nsave in the entire budget for the fiscal year 2012. There is no \nshortage of problems that have attracted our attention--for example, \nthe trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities coming from the \nmandatory spending side of our ledger, in addition to the way that we \nare trying to save money just to keep the government running. By \nmandatory we mean the programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity, some veterans spending, and so on.\n  I talked about the estimate of hitting our debt limit. The Treasury \nSecretary estimates we will hit that debt limit--in other words, the \namount we borrowed on our credit card and cannot exceed; that is the \ntotal amount of the U.S. legal debt--no later than May 16 of this year. \nSo May 16, the President says we need to address the debt ceiling. If \nyou are not keeping track, the current debt limit is about $14.3 \ntrillion. So we are going to be pressing up against $14.3, in other \nwords, and we are going to have to borrow more money if we are going to \nspend more in the next year.\n  Republicans have offered a variety of ideas. I want to alert my \ncolleagues to what some of these ideas are so we can begin thinking \nabout them and hopefully acting on them in the runup to\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\nthe debate about what to do about the debt ceiling.\n  There is very little enthusiasm around here for increasing the debt \nceiling if we do not also do something to constrain future spending, \nbecause we do not want to come up against the debt ceiling every few \nyears or months. We need to decide this is going to be it, we are not \ngoing to incur any more debt. In fact, we are going to begin to lower \nthe debt. But to do that, we will have to constrain ourselves in some \nways to rein in our appetite for spending.\n  One of the ways to do that almost passed about--well, a few years ago \nin the Senate here; I have forgotten the year. But it failed by one \nvote. That is the balanced budget amendment. A lot of people think that \nwould be a good way for Congress to tie our hands so we cannot spend \nmore than we take in. Every single Republican has cosponsored a \nbalanced budget amendment. We hope we will get a lot of support from \nour friends on the other side of the aisle as well, because it clearly \nwould require the Federal Government to live within its means each \nyear, as most American families have to do.\n  There is also something that I believe is also a very good idea, and \nthat is a constitutional spending limit. In other words, you do not \nhave to require that the budget is balanced if you limit spending to, \nin this case, 18 percent of the gross domestic product. The advantage \nof that is there will be a desire on the part of everyone who wants to \nspend more money to have a more robust economy, because every \npercentage of growth or every dollar of growth in the gross domestic \nproduct means more money you can spend at the Federal Government level. \nSo I would imagine if we wanted to spend more money at the Federal \nGovernment level, we will be supporting regulatory policies that do not \nwipe out whole industries such as the coal industry, we will support \ntax policies that promote growth, that try to keep tax rates at a lower \nlevel, and do not punish companies here in the United States so they \nhave to move operations abroad, and so on.\n  In other words, these are things we can do to promote economic growth \nthat mean we have a bigger GDP. If you have a bigger GDP, then you can \nspend more money at the Federal Government level. But if you do not \nhave a bigger GDP, then you cannot; we can only spend 18 percent of the \nGDP under this proposal.\n  And that, by the way, is about the historic average of what we have \nspent. In the last year and a half, unfortunately, we have gone way \nabove that. We are spending around 22 percent of GDP. It is going up to \n24 or 25 percent. That is not sustainable, and almost everyone agrees.\n  Another idea that is sponsored by Senators Corker and McCaskill, a \nRepublican and a Democrat, is the--they call it the CAP Act. That CAP \nAct would cap both mandatory and discretionary spending. It would put \nall government spending, in other words, on the table. It would not \njust take the discretionary spending we are talking about tonight to \nkeep the government funded, we would also include all of the other \nspending.\n  Beginning in the year 2013, the CAP Act would establish Federal \nspending limits that, over 10 years, would reduce spending to 20.6 of \nthe gross domestic product. Calculated a little differently, that is an \naverage of the last 40 years of spending. What it would do is create a \nglide path by which we could gradually reduce the spending so you do \nnot have to do it all at once.\n  I mean the reality is, if we try to be too strong here in the way we \nare going to reduce spending, we are not going to be successful because \npeople will not stand for it. Have you already seen the debate \nyesterday and today: Oh, my goodness, you are going to cut money from \nthis and that? We cannot do that.\n  There will always be resistance to reducing spending.\n  So it has got to be done, in my view--I think both Senators Corker \nand McCaskill agree--it has to be done in a way that Members also agree \nto each year, rather than simply deciding this is too hard, we are \ngoing to give up. And, of course, since it is only statutory, we could \ngive up. We can waive it by 60 votes and say: Too hard. We are going to \ngive up. So it has to be at levels that are tough, but over a 10-year \nperiod gradually we can reduce.\n  It is a little bit like going on a diet. You did not get the weight \nyou have overnight, and you are not going to lose it overnight. It \nmakes more sense to do it in a way that keeps you healthy, keeps a \nconsensus around here, but for sure gets us to the goal we want to \nachieve so that our kids and grandkids do not have to pay for all of \nthe things we have purchased.\n  This CAP Act, by the way, has a lot of good provisions, such as a \ndefinition of emergency spending so we cannot game it every year when \nwe decide we want to spend more. If we just say, well, this is \nemergency spending, then we do not have to count it in our \ncalculations.\n  I would like to see more dramatic reductions. I know other people \nwould too. But, as I said, this is the kind of Main Street proposal \nthat should attract a lot of attention on both sides of the aisle.\n  These are three ideas: the balanced budget amendment, the \nconstitutional spending limit, and the statutory CAP Act. There are a \nlot of other good ideas. And we, frankly, are going to have to have a \ngood debate about these ideas, because I will predict there is no way \nthe debt ceiling will be increased without Congress adopting some of \nthese constraints and the President signing those into law so we will \nknow that in the future we do not have to keep raising the debt \nceiling.\n  The last point I wish to make is there are two big reasons why we are \ntrying to reduce the deficit. First, we all know we cannot keep \nspending what we are spending. The interest on the national debt, in a \nlittle over 10 years, is going to approach $1 trillion a year. It is \nover $200 billion this year. It will be close to $250 billion next \nyear. It keeps going up about $60, $80 billion a year, to the point \nthat in the tenth year, it is $900 some billion. Think about that. You \nwant to spend money on education. You want to spend money on health \ncare. You want to spend money on defense. Sorry, we have to spend it on \ninterest on our national debt. This is money we are paying to the \nChinese or to anybody else who happened to purchase American debt. But \nit is going to crowd out spending in other areas that we want to spend \nmoney on. That is not good. And as a result, we have got to get this \nspending under control while we still have an opportunity.\n  But there is a second reason it is so important, and that is, the \nmore money, in effect, that is sucked up by governments--that includes \nthe Federal Government--the more money out of the economy the Federal \nGovernment demands, the less money there is for private sector growth \nand investment. And it is, of course, in the private sector where most \nof the new jobs are created. That is why we need to leave more money in \nthe private sector. We are not reducing Federal spending in order to \nengage in some big austerity program to try to punish people by \nproviding less for them, and so on. We are doing it to create more \nprosperity. The whole idea is prosperity.\n  I ask unanimous consent for a couple more minutes of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. In other words, the idea here is to spend less money at the \nFederal Government level, thereby allowing more for the private sector \nto invest in job creation, thereby growing the economy, making us a \nmore wealthy nation, and helping our families and job creators in the \nprocess.\n\n  I have cited a Wall Street journal op-ed many times. I will close \nwith this: It is an op-ed that was written by Gary Becker, George P. \nSchultz--he was Secretary of three things including Treasury--and John \nTaylor, who is a Stanford economics professor. The three wrote an op-ed \nin the Wall Street Journal. I will quote two short paragraphs. They \nstart out by saying:\n\n       Wanted: A strategy for economic growth, full employment, \n     and deficit reduction--all without inflation. Experience \n     shows how to get there. Credible actions that reduce the \n     rapid growth of Federal spending and debt will raise economic \n     growth and lower the unemployment rate. Higher private \n     investment, not more government purchases, is the surest way \n     to increase prosperity. When private investment is high, \n     unemployment is low.\n       Above all, the federal government needs a credible and \n     transparent budget strategy. It's time for a game-changer--a \n     budget action that will stop the recent discretionary\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\n     spending binge before it gets entrenched in government \n     agencies.\n\n  And they conclude by saying:\n\n       We need to lay out a path for total Federal Government \n     spending growth for the next year and later years that will \n     gradually bring spending into balance with the amount of tax \n     revenues generated in later years by the current tax system. \n     Assurance that the current tax system will remain in place--\n     pending genuine reform in corporate and personal income \n     taxes--will be an immediate stimulus.\n\n  I think this is an excellent strategy for a long-term growth policy. \nIt is predicated on the fact that Congress will work in the short term, \ni.e. tonight, to reduce the spending for the remaining 6 months of this \nfiscal year.\n  We will then begin work on a budget that will reduce spending over \nthe course of the next 12 months and, in the context of the debt \nceiling debate, will also act on other programs to constrain government \nspending. It could be a balanced budget amendment, a constitutional \nspending limit, the CAP Act I talked about, or any other idea people \ncan bring to the Senate and House floors and get passed here, to begin \nto constrain the spending, not just so we will have the money to spend \nin the government on the things we want to do, but also so we can free \nup the great energy of the private sector so investment can once again \nflow, people can be hired, we can have economic growth and a real sense \nof prosperity in this country in the years to come.\n  That is the challenge we face after the agreement is reached tonight. \nI know you share my hope that an agreement will soon be announced and \nwe can then move on to the other items I am talking about here this \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise tonight, as so many of \nmy colleagues have through this long day, to urge all of us to join to \nprevent a government shutdown.\n  We have all expressed a growing amount of frustration here with what \nI would characterize as politics as usual under the dome of this great \nCapitol, in which we are so fortunate to serve. But it sure seems like \nthese are the kind of politics where the goal posts get continually \nmoved, and no amount of civility can seemingly overcome the impasse \nthat is unfolding down the corridors in the House of Representatives.\n  I know the Presiding Officer operates in this way, and the American \npublic operates in this way, and they expect us to work together. They \nexpect us to pass an appropriations bill that funds our government. But \nit appears as though some unrelated policy riders that are not about \nappropriating money but are about setting policy are leading to an \nimpasse that could lead to an unnecessary and costly shutdown of \ngovernment operations and services.\n  Last night--I do not know where the Presiding Officer was--my \ncolleague Senator Bennet was down here. He highlighted how petty the \nsituation has become. He pointed out if you and I went to Applebee's \nfor dinner tonight, and we had a $20 dinner for two, and then we had a \nfight over the bill, we would be fighting over 4 cents.\n  Well, I have some news. It looks like today we got an agreement that \nwe reached on the actual numbers, but now the House wants to add some \ncontroversial policy riders into the mix. It is as if that same check \narrived when we were at Applebee's and after finally agreed on who is \ngoing to pay the 4 cents, but we are now arguing over whether the \nwaitress, who is a hard-working American, should receive health care.\n  I have to say, I think people watching this are scratching their \nheads. I sure am. We all are facing an impending government shutdown. \nAs I have said, some Members seem to want to inject very controversial \npolicy issues into the debate. These issues have divided us for too \nmany years.\n  We ought to have that debate elsewhere. It is forcing this shutdown \non the American people. Some people who are standing their ground think \nthey are doing something about the deficit. I am often the one \nhighlighting how disturbing our long-range fiscal picture has become.\n  But what is equally frustrating is the disservice being done to the \nAmerican public by the current debate. Not only are we taken off the \nbeat from addressing our real fiscal imbalances, which would be the \ndebate we need to have on the 2012 budget or on the longer term \nchallenges the Simpson-Bowles commission pointed out, but we are now \nfocusing on women's health issues. I don't understand. We have a \ntentative agreement to cut billions from current spending levels, but \nthe Speaker of the House seems to continue to demand that we ought to \nfocus on nonbudget issues. These are hot-button issues. Why we would \ninsert them into an unrelated budget debate when there is so much at \nstake is beyond me.\n  I understand we want to show the American people we are serious about \ndeficit reduction. I am, I know the Presiding Officer is, and I know \nthe American people are. But in Colorado, people see straight through \nthis latest ploy to inject nonbudgetary issues into the debate. It is \npolitics as usual.\n  I know we have felt a little better recently. We have had 13 straight \nmonths of private sector growth. We have added 1.8 million jobs during \nthat time. But our economy is still very fragile. Way too many \nAmericans, way too many West Virginians, and way too many Coloradans \nare struggling.\n  I have no doubt that a government shutdown at this time would have a \ncounterproductive effect on our recovery.\n  Don't take my word for it. Listen to what top business leaders of all \npolitical persuasions are saying. The Business Roundtable president, \nJohn Engler, former Governor of Michigan, a Republican Governor, said \nbusinesses would face the dangerous ``unintended consequences,'' where \ninterest rates could rise because of a shutdown and we would have \nturmoil in our financial markets. Forecasters at Goldman Sachs have \nwarned that a shutdown could shave off growth in our GDP every single \nweek. CEOs of all stripes all over the country have warned about a \nshutdown's impact on confidence in the U.S. economic recovery. The \nPresiding Officer and I know that confidence is what we need. That is \nwhat is really lacking in many respects.\n  A shutdown would actually prevent what we need to address our long-\nterm growth and fiscal balance. In other words, if we get the economy \ngrowing again, we would have more tax revenue, and we would see that \ngap between what we are spending and bringing in narrow.\n  I can't help but think in the context of this debate about my uncle \nStewart Udall. I have talked to the Presiding Officer about the effect \nmen like his father had on his upbringing and his values, his public \nservice commitment. But Stewart Udall, my uncle, father of my cousin, \nSenator Tom Udall, wrote a book called ``The Forgotten Founders'' that \nfocused on the settling of the West. I bet it would apply as well to \nWest Virginia. The theme of the book was on how the West was settled, \nhow it was built. He made a strong case in his book that the people who \ncame out West were not looking to get into gunfights or range wars, \nregardless of what the Hollywood movies suggest. They wanted to start a \nnew life and in a new country, pursuing what we now call the American \ndream.\n  My uncle Stewart pointed out that when we watched those Hollywood \nmovies, it was the people standing on the sidewalks watching the \nmythical gunfight who were really the people who built the West. They \nwere looking to work together. They weren't looking to get into fights. \nThey were looking out for each other. It didn't matter what one's \npolitical party was.\n  To me, the American people today are standing on those board \nsidewalks watching the same senseless gunfights and range wars. These \nare the people who matter. These are the people who will ultimately be \nhurt and affected by a shutdown.\n  I know I was hired by the people of Colorado and sent to the Senate \nto come here and work together and solve some very difficult challenges \nfacing this country. That is why today I introduced the Preventing a \nGovernment Shutdown Act of 2011. This bill was originally a Republican \nidea. It is meant to ensure that the American people are not unfairly \nsubjected to the effects of a government shutdown simply because some \nMembers of Congress want to make a political point and pursue \npersistent squabbling over the budget. The bill would ensure that \nFederal appropriations continue at last year's funding levels as a \nbridge to\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\nkeep the government running until a compromise could be reached for the \nremainder of the fiscal year. Once Congress is able to reach a \nbipartisan agreement to fund the government for that fiscal year, then \nthe automatic funding under my proposal would stop and it would be \nreplaced by the enacted bill.\n  I know there are some who say: Wait a minute, the Congress is charged \nwith passing appropriations bills that reflect strategic planning, \ncurrent functional needs, and create stability. What I am suggesting is \nthat the Preventing a Government Shutdown Act would create a safety \nvalve that would ensure that partisan shutdown politics don't punish \nthe American people and destabilize the economy going forward.\n  It seems as though a vocal minority wants to be combative, almost for \nthe sake of being combative--let's fight for the sake of fighting. But \nin this case, in these delicate and fragile economic times, that is not \na helpful thing to do, to put it mildly. I think the mature thing to do \nwould be to have a piece of legislation in place that would eliminate \nthat kind of irresponsible behavior moving forward.\n  As I come to a close, I have to think the American people are amazed \nat this, if they have time because they are busy providing for their \nfamilies. We have to settle down here. We have to act as adults. We \nneed to work collaboratively toward a budget solution. We have to \nreduce the debt and the deficit. The Presiding Officer has been on \npoint on that as well as on this. But you won't find anyone more \ncommitted than I to that cause. Let's reach it in a way that protects \nour senior citizens, veterans, students, and border security--I could \ngo on with a long list of important functions the Federal Government \nprovides--and let's do it in a way that slashes spending but doesn't \nharm our fragile economic recovery or divert our attention on divisive \nsocial issues.\n  We can't afford a government shutdown. We just flatout can't afford a \ngovernment shutdown. I will be disappointed, to say the least, if the \nbipartisan deal that is before us--it is in our hands--is undercut by \ncontentious, unrelated issues that only serve to divide us rather than \nto bring us together.\n  One thing we can agree on is that our military personnel deserve \nbetter than this. We have young people fighting in two wars as I speak. \nWe have young men and women serving all over the globe in over 50 \ncountries. The last thing our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nneed is to worry about whether they will be able to pay their bills. \nMilitary families have already done more than their share. Now we are \nasking them to do even more. That is simply unacceptable.\n  I know we can find a solution to this particular situation. We worked \ntogether in the Senate with Senator Hutchison and a bipartisan group of \nSenators to introduce the bipartisan Ensuring Pay for Our Military Act. \nThis bill, S. 724, would ensure that our military servicemembers would \nnot have interrupted pay in the event of a shutdown. We need to pass \nthat bill if we don't get the job done tonight.\n  Three days ago, I wrote a letter, joined by close to 18 of my \ncolleagues, including the Presiding Officer, to Mr. Boehner. I know \nSpeaker Boehner well. He and I served in the House together. I urged \nhim to work with all of us to avoid a shutdown. I will stay here the \nrest of this day, all night, whatever it takes. I am here to urge all \nof us, both Chambers, let's sit down together. Let's reason together. \nLet's use common sense together. Let's find a compromise. That is the \nAmerican way. I know that is why I was elected to the Senate. People in \nColorado know I work across party lines. The Senate could set that \nexample right here tonight. We have numerous examples of us working \ntogether across party lines.\n  I had to come to the floor tonight. I know the night is growing on. I \nhad to come down here and urge Senators in this great body, the world's \ngreatest deliberative body, to find a commonsense compromise to keep \nour government funded, keep our economy focused upon, and move our \ncountry forward. That is job 1.\n  I thank the Chair for his attention and his willingness to work with \nme and the spirit with which he serves West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, when I was Governor of West Virginia, we \ngrappled over the budget like every State, every Governor and every \nlegislature, every senator and every delegate. But when the deadline \narrived, people came together and we did our job--Democrats and \nRepublicans, business and labor, progressives and conservatives--and we \nenacted a balanced budget every year without failure. It is part of our \nconstitution. It is who we are.\n  I have only been in the Senate for 5 months, and I have never seen \nanything quite like this. I never could have imagined anything quite \nlike this. But I see so much opportunity if we start talking and \nworking together. We are outspending our revenues by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars every month. They tell us our revenue estimates \nwill be about $2.2 trillion this year, but our expenditures are \nexpected to be over $3.7 trillion.\n  I believe everybody we speak to, and everyone who is listening to us, \ncan understand we have a problem. But yet we are grappling over this \ntonight: a budget that should have been done 6 months ago.\n  This is a budget crisis. It is not a social crisis. And to put all of \nthis into the mix right now is wrong. Instead of all of us coming \ntogether, Republicans and Democrats, with a commonsense budget \ncompromise, we face a shutdown of the government not over how much to \ncut but over what social issues we agree or disagree on.\n  On many of these social issues, I will be the first to admit I am \nprobably more conservative than most on my side of the aisle. I am pro-\nlife, and I am proud of it. But this is a budget crisis, and I have \nsaid that. This is not the place or the time for that. There will be a \ntime and a place to vote on these issues, but not when they jeopardize \nthe paychecks of our brave men and women in uniform, which the \nPresiding Officer so eloquently explained is what is at risk. That is \nwrong. The Presiding Officer knows it is wrong, and we all know it is \nwrong, no matter what side of the aisle.\n  Our dear friend, the Senator from Arkansas, was speaking about the \ncooperation we all should have reaching out across the aisle, not \nputting blame, because we are all at fault and we will all be looked at \nas the culprits. The bottom line is, we need to come together and fix \nthis. The American people expect that from us. The people back home in \nColorado and also in West Virginia expect that from the Presiding \nOfficer and me, and it is what is right for the Nation.\n  That is one of the reasons I and so many of my colleagues here have \nsaid we are going to give up our salary. We call it the no work, no pay \npledge. That no work, no play pledge is pretty much universally \nunderstood. In West Virginia, when you do not have a good day's work, \nyou should not expect a payday.\n  I can say it is not my fault, and the Presiding Officer can say it is \nnot his fault, and everybody could, but we are all part of this, and we \nhave to put the pressure on. But I have to tell you, as my father would \ntell me all the time, he said: Joe, whatever your problems are, try it \nwithout a paycheck and you will compound them rapidly.\n  I am going to be sending my paycheck back to the U.S. Treasury to pay \ndown our debt. Many others will be donating them to charity. We will be \nstanding with the American people, our military men and women, who will \npay a heavy price for their elected government's failure to finish a \nbudget, unless a commonsense agreement is reached tonight. And I \nbelieve it will be. As we have a few precious hours left, I still am a \nvery optimistic person.\n  With that, there are some of our colleagues who have talked tonight \nabout passing a piece of legislation, even if we do not come to an \nagreement, that our brave men and women, who are serving all over the \nworld to protect us to live in freedom, will be paid.\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\n  To my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, I want to say, \nthere are many instances where we might agree on social issues and some \nwhere we might disagree. That is the healthy part of our democracy. It \nis what makes us so unique. I assure you, there is a time and a place \nfor everything. There is a time and a place for those votes. But not \ntonight. Today is not that time. Our deadline is here and rapidly \napproaching, as you can see.\n  My hope and prayer is that tonight we will do what is right, we will \ncome together as Americans, and we will agree to a commonsense budget \nthat is the first step to putting our fiscal house back in order. That \nis why the people of West Virginia sent me here. I took that oath of \noffice not just to represent the Democrats on my side of the party or \nthe Democrats in West Virginia, I took that oath of office to represent \neverybody in West Virginia: Democrats, Republicans, all different walks \nof life. I am going to do everything I can to make sure they understand \nI am here for them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2338-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2338-S2340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the period \nfor morning business for debate only be extended until 10:30 p.m., with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the \nmajority leader to be recognized at 10:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenators Leahy, Merkley, and Boxer as cosponsors to S. 724.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this brings to 77, out of 100 \nSenators, who are now sponsoring this bill. Our bill, S. 724, is very \nsimple. It just says if there is a government shutdown, our military \nwill be paid their full pay on time.\n  This bill is the very least we can do to assure every military family \nthat they do not have to worry for one minute whether their mortgage is \ngoing to be paid, whether their car payments will be paid, or whether \nthey will be able to get over this hump without thinking that there \nmight be a halving of their pay, or that it might be delayed.\n  I am especially concerned, of course, about those who are overseas, \nbut their families are at home, because if the mom or dad is overseas \nand there is a glitch somewhere, they are not here to help. I think it \nwould be unthinkable that we would go to midnight and not have taken \ncare of these families and assured them that everything is going to be \nfine.\n  I want to say that I hope there is an agreement, and I have heard the \nrumor that there is an agreement. If there is one, I know that it will \ninclude military pay. I believe that. If, for any reason, that \nagreement does not happen in the next 3 hours, or if the agreement \ndoesn't include military pay--which I don't think will happen--I think \nboth Houses of Congress want to serve our soldiers and their families, \nbut I will be here until midnight, and I am going to make sure that \nwhatever happens, either S. 724, with 77 sponsors in the Senate, is \npassed, or that we have an agreement that both Houses have before them \nthat will assure that the military pay is handled in that other \nagreement.\n  So we are going to be here for 3 more hours and make sure that the \nwill of the Senate, which is very clear with 77 sponsors, is met.\n  I want to just mention again that there was a Web site put up early \nthis morning by just one woman who was very concerned about this issue \nand heard about my bill in the news. Her name is Hope Guinn Bradley. \nShe is from Hawaii. I do not know her. She has started a social media \nnetwork like I have never witnessed in my life. We now have over 1 \nmillion support hits on her Web site, called Ensuring Pay for our \nMilitary Act of 2011. In one day, she has accumulated 1 million support \nsentences, or messages, for what she is doing.\n  If you would go to that Web site and do nothing else but read those \ncomments by people who are supporting our military and who are clearly \nin the support of our military--you know, I would like for the military \npeople to see it just so they understand how much America appreciates \nthem and what they do because they are saying to the people here in \nWashington, DC: You take care of our young men and women who are \nfighting for us. You better do it or there will be consequences.\n  Are they right? Absolutely. I have spoken a couple of times today. I \nwant to make sure that we have the letters from the military \norganizations that have been written in support of S. 724. There is one \nfrom the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America that wrote a \nwonderful letter. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord along with two other letters to which I will refer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Iraq and Afghanistan\n\n\n                                          Veterans of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     248 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of \n     America (IAVA) strongly supports S. 724, the Ensuring Pay for \n     Our Military Act of 2011. This bill ensures that all members \n     of the Armed Forces will continue to receive the pay and \n     allowances they have earned despite any lack of interim or \n     full-year appropriations.\n       Our men and women in uniform protect our nation and \n     continue to do so despite budget disagreements in Washington. \n     The members of our Armed Forces are essential to the defense \n     of our nation and must be treated as such.\n       Many young service members and their families are dealing \n     with multiple deployments and often live paycheck to \n     paycheck. Military families should not be asked to bear \n     further financial stress in addition to fighting the war on \n     terrorism. This legislation protects the men and women who \n     protect us.\n       If we can be of any help in advancing S. 724 please contact \n     Tim Embree at (202) 544-7692 or tim@iava.org. We look forward \n     to working with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul Rieckhoff,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                       for Uniformed Services,\n\n                                   Springfield, VA, April 7, 2011.\n     Hon.

The bill also includes a \n     provision to authorize the Secretary of Defense to allow \n     those who serve as DOD civilians or contractors in support of \n     our men and women in uniform to continue to be paid as well.\n       The National Association for Uniformed Services thanks you \n     for introducing legislation that demonstrates our nation's \n     appreciation for those who serve in our Armed Forces. We look \n     forward to working with you and your staff and deeply \n     appreciate your continued support of the American soldier and \n     their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard A.

Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: On behalf of the 377,000 members of \n     the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), I am \n     writing to urge you to cosponsor S. 724, the ``Ensuring Pay \n     For Our Military Act of 2011,'' recently introduced by \n     Senators Bob Casey and Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n       Recent media stories stating servicemembers may not be paid \n     in the event\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\n     of a government shutdown are only adding to unfair pressures \n     on already over-stressed troops and families.\n       With loved ones involved in three separate combat \n     operations and humanitarian relief in Japan, military \n     families should not have to wonder if they will be able to \n     cover house and car payments and other bills.\n       S. 724 would continue pay and allowances for active and \n     reserve component forces in the event of a failure to enact \n     interim or full-year appropriations for the Armed Forces. \n     Absent any assurance that pay will continue, MOAA believes \n     this legislation is essential to provide fair treatment for \n     military members and families.\n       We respectfully request that you cosponsor and support \n     immediate passage of S. 724 to ensure this situation never \n     arises again in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           VADM Norbert Ryan, Jr.,\n                                                  President, MOAA.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America \nunderstand better than anybody what it is like to serve there and to \nnot have any other stresses that would add to what they are already \ndoing for our country. They say pass S. 724.\n  The National Association for Uniformed Services, with more than \n180,000 members, sent a letter in support.\n  The Military Officers Association of America has also added its \nsupport with 377,000 members.\n  We have the grassroots support. Everyone understands this. I will \nread a couple of the messages that have been on this wonderful Web \nsite, but, first, here is one that came to my Web site:\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: My husband serves as a Captain in \n     the United States Army. As the wife of a currently deployed \n     soldier and mother to our two-year-old son, I find it \n     outrageous that our government is debating whether or not to \n     continue to pay our troops.\n       While my husband and I are very fiscally responsible, many \n     of his junior soldiers simply cannot handle the implication \n     of what it would mean to not receive their paychecks. We \n     worry for these soldiers' families. How will they afford \n     groceries? How will they afford diapers for their babies? \n     Will they be able to pay their rent or mortgages? These are \n     not questions that we should have to ask. Money should not be \n     a worry on these soldiers' minds. My husband and the soldiers \n     in his unit do incredibly dangerous missions and quite \n     frankly it frightens me that this could split their focus in \n     a very negative way.\n       My husband and his fellow soldiers risk their lives on a \n     daily basis. They miss holidays and their children's \n     birthdays. They deserve to know that the same government that \n     sent them over to fight is looking out for them. They deserve \n     to know that our government would not send them over to a war \n     zone and then deny them their pay. My husband does not have \n     the luxury to ``walk off the job.'' He stays there until the \n     mission is complete, and the Senate has a mission as well: to \n     pass the Ensuring Pay for Our Military Act of 2011, S. 724.\n\n  Here is another hit that was found on the Ensuring Pay for Our \nMilitary Act of 2011 Web site:\n\n       As a military wife who is expecting our first child in \n     June, my husband and I recently PCS'd overseas and are \n     already on a tight budget to pay our new bills in Euros and \n     our bills stateside in dollars. Now we have to worry that we \n     will not have enough money to pay our bills and our credit \n     might be harmed, there is no safety net to help catch us when \n     we fall behind, no interest on the back pay that we will be \n     missing, or the late fees waived when we can't pay all of our \n     bills. We would have to tell our German landlords that we \n     cannot afford to give them money, how are they supposed to \n     understand? They are not in this situation, we as Americans \n     are. I am not complaining of being a military spouse; I chose \n     this life. I knew of the hardships of deployments (my husband \n     has served in both Afghanistan and Iraq), and I love what my \n     family does. I hope and pray that this issue will be resolved \n     soon.\n\n  Mr. President, really--I mean really, we have 3 hours until midnight. \nCan we tell these people that they might get half their paycheck on \nApril 15? We can't.\n  Here is another letter. I am obviously not reading the names, \nalthough they are on here. I don't want to in any way harm them:\n\n       As a veteran of OEF (Operation Enduring Freedom), I stand \n     behind you 100 percent and so do many others. This will tear \n     morale from the troops and their families, which can be a \n     dangerous thing. The mental and financial balance soldiers \n     and their families are on, as it is, is a delicate one. They \n     live month to month. Most are enlisted and make scratch as it \n     is. Cutting more pay will put these families on the chopping \n     block, and when a soldier's family is put in that position, \n     that soldier is no longer fighting for his country but is now \n     fighting for his family against his country. This would \n     destroy the basic foundation of all our forces from the \n     core.\n\n  There are 1 million hits on this Web site. So many of them are \ntouching, many are pleading, some are angry. I just want to say I do \nhave faith that in the next 3 hours, we will ensure that these people \nare taken care of. I do have that faith. But we only have 3 more hours. \nI want to ensure that we are going to be here. If it starts getting to \n11 o'clock and we have 1 more hour to ensure that not 1 more hour \npasses after midnight that this cannot be taken care of, I am going to \nbe here, and we are going to do it. And I am so proud that so far we \nhave 77 cosponsors of this bill. I think we will have unanimous support \nfor it. I do. But 77 people have made sure they called to be a \ncosponsor of this bill. I am proud we have something very bipartisan in \na very partisan atmosphere. That is maybe a ray of hope that this is \ngoing to be done in the right way.\n  I want the people of this country to know and I want it to be in the \nCongressional Record the overwhelming support that has now come because \nof the debate, what people are seeing and their support for the \nmilitary.\n  The Presiding Officer is a cosponsor of the bill. The Senator who is \ntaking his place right now is also a supporter of this bill--Senator \nMerkley, Senator Udall, Senator Durbin, Senator Kerry. We have very \nstrong bipartisan support. It is my faith that we are going to do what \nis right for our military because we can do no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas and her \ncosponsor, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey. They expressed the \ndeep-felt sentiments of all of us. I am happy to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  I can assure the Senator from Texas that we have discussed this at \nlength in our caucus, and there will be ample opportunity for all \nMembers to join in an effort to make certain our men and women in \nuniform, who are risking their lives, will not be in any way \ndisadvantaged by what is going on on Capitol Hill.\n  I share her frustration and anxiety. I have been listening and \nwatching these negotiations now for weeks. I cannot believe we have \nreached this point--less than 3 hours from a government shutdown--when \nthe differences are so minor, when there are so few things in \ndisagreement. It is time, literally, for the Speaker of the House to \ncome forward and accept the dollar amount he agreed to last night in \nthe White House Oval Office, to accept that amount which dramatically \ncuts spending to help reduce our deficit.\n  I do not know why we have literally wasted this entire day in \nnegotiations back and forth. Part of it was wasted, I am afraid, on \nthis whole question of funding the access of women and families across \nAmerica to health care. I understand that has been worked out now \nduring the course of the day. The Speaker has considered a different \napproach to it, thank goodness.\n  Now is the time to close the deal. Now is the time to get our job \ndone. Now is the time to not only stand up for the men and women in \nuniform--and they should be our first obligation--but stand up for so \nmany others deserving of our help too. They are not covered by this \nbill. Right now, there are FBI agents in America risking their lives \ntracking drug dealers and terrorists who are about to learn at midnight \nthat their jobs are in jeopardy, if not closed down, until Congress \nrelents. The same thing is true about those in our intelligence \ncommunity around the world. They may not wear a uniform, but they are \nliterally risking their lives as well for the security of the United \nStates in countries far and wide across this globe. The list just goes \non and on.\n  We first think of our military, as we should, but they are not the \nonly ones who are making great sacrifice for the safety of this \ncountry. When I think of their valor and courage, I wonder whether our \nleaders can summon \nthe courage, particularly at this point I hope the Speaker can summon \nthe courage to bring his caucus together and to vote, to avert this \nembarrassing--embarrassing--shutdown which will occur in less than 3 \nhours unless something happens.\n  I still believe it will. I still believe we have that chance, and I \nhope Senator\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\nHutchison, who has been a leader on this issue, does not have to come \nto the floor again. I can assure her, before anything happens to \ndisadvantage our troops, we will stand together in a bipartisan way, \nmaybe on her bill, maybe on another bill, but we will stand in a \nbipartisan way to protect these troops. I thank her again for her \nleadership. There is evidence between her and Senator Casey that there \nis a strong bipartisan feeling that we need to get this job done before \nthe Senate shuts down.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much what the leader \nhas said. I know this has been arduous, and I know the negotiations \nhave been arduous. That is why I believe that in the next 3 hours, we \nwill do the right thing on this issue. I hope we do the right thing for \nall of our country.\n  We have not talked about the other Federal employees who are \nessential and those who are going to be furloughed. There are so many \npeople in this country who are going to be affected in so many ways if \nthere is a government shutdown. I am focusing on the ones who cannot \nhelp themselves right now because they are overseas protecting our \nfreedom, but there are many people who are going to have hardships that \nare unnecessary.\n  I do appreciate what Senator Durbin has said.\n  There is one other person I want to mention; that is, Congressman \nLouie Gohmert. He started on the House side with the same bill I have \nintroduced on the Senate side. He has gained large support on the House \nside for this legislation. I commend Congressman Gohmert for assuring, \nas we were watching this week the very spirited debate that has gone on \nabout the possibility of having a government shutdown--Louie Gohmert \nstepped up first. I give him credit for saying there is one group we \ncannot leave behind no matter what happens. Our bills are virtually the \nsame. Whichever House can pass it first is fine with me because \nwhatever we do, we have to do it together and we have to do it before \nmidnight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I just wandered onto the floor hoping we \nwere coming close to some type of an agreement. I very much regret that \nwe have to careen from week to week, from period to period funding our \ngovernment on a temporary basis. I think all of us were hoping we could \nget this resolved. I still hold out some hope. There is 2 hours and 50 \nminutes or so of negotiations still to go.\n  I commend the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, for her efforts. \nShe has been relentless in reminding us for several days, if not more, \nthat we cannot leave our troops in the field and those who are wearing \nthe uniform serving our country in a situation where they are not paid. \nThis, of course, affects drug enforcement agents and many others across \nthe Federal spectrum. But these troops overseas are bearing hardship \nenough to not be caught up in a debate here which is necessary, a \ndebate that needs to be resolved.\n  As I said earlier when I spoke this morning or early afternoon, this \nis just a small little brushfire, as dramatic as the press has made it, \nand it does have consequences--serious consequences. But compared to \nthe size of the problem our Nation faces from a fiscal standpoint \nrelative to what we need to do and what we need to be debating, this is \na small part, just talking about funding for the next 6 months to fill \na gap that was left when no budget was passed and no action was taken \non it in the last Congress, the last fiscal year, to put us in a \nposition where we can move into and debate the real issue that is \nbefore us; that is, how do we make decisions that will affect the long-\nterm spending of this country, affect our budget and our deficit, and \nbring us back to a fiscally responsible place?\n  I hope as negotiations continue to go forward that we can resolve \nthis today so that we can begin that important debate. But if we \ncannot, at the very least, I believe it is important that we extend \nthis for a small amount of time--I regret we have to do it--so we can \nbring it to its final conclusion. But the most important point is that \nbefore midnight, we have to make sure we pass legislation which will \nensure that our people in uniform are paid their rightful due for the \nservice they are providing. Again, I commend the Senator from Texas for \nreminding us of that and being vigilant in making sure we absolutely \naddress that issue before this time runs out.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nLandrieu as a cosponsor of Senate bill 724.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, that makes 78 Members of the Senate \nwho are now sponsoring this bill for our military.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons).

Mr. President, I will read a statement that was issued by \nSpeaker Boehner and myself a few minutes ago. This is the statement:\n\n       We have agreed to an historic amount of cuts for the \n     remainder of this fiscal year, as well as a short-term bridge \n     that will give us time to avoid a shutdown while we get that \n     agreement through both houses and to the President. We will \n     cut $78.5 billion below the President's 2011 budget proposal, \n     and we have reached an agreement on the policy riders. In the \n     meantime, we will pass a short-term resolution to keep the \n     government running through Thursday. That short-term bridge \n     will cut the first $2 billion of the total savings.\n\n  I, first of all, express my appreciation to the Speaker and his \noffice. It has been a grueling process. We did not do it at this late \nhour for drama. We did it because it has been very hard to arrive at \nthis point.\n  I also express my appreciation to my counterpart, Senator McConnell. \nWe have talked during this process on a number of occasions. We have, \nas we say here, on many occasions it has turned out to be we have a \nterrific relationship. We do our best to protect each caucus. We have \nour battles here. But he is a pleasure to work with. I admire and \nappreciate his work for the people of Kentucky and the country.\n  This has been a long process. It has not been an easy process. Both \nsides have had to make tough choices, but tough choices are what this \njob is all\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\nabout. I think it is important to note, as we said in this statement, \nthat this is historic, what we have done--$78.5 billion below the 2011 \nbudget we have been working off of. We worked on many riders. What we \nhave done has been difficult but important for the country. We all \nagree there are many cuts that have to take place in the future. We \nunderstand that. We must get this country's fiscal house in order. But \nif the American people have to make tough choices--and they are doing \nit every day--so should their leaders. That is our responsibility--all \n100 of us and 435 Members of the House.\n  The Speaker and I reached an agreement that I have read that will cut \nspending and keep the country running. We have agreed to a historic \nlevel of cuts for the remainder of this fiscal year, as well as a \nshort-term bridge that will give us time to avoid a shutdown while we \nget this agreement through both Houses and to the President.\n  I repeat, we will cut $78.5 billion, and we have reached an \nagreement--I repeat for the second time--on the policy riders. I do \nthat because that has not been easy. In the meantime, we will pass a \nshort-term resolution to keep the government running through this \ncoming Friday. That short-term bridge will cut the first $2 billion of \nthe total savings we have already talked to, the $78.5 billion.\n  Mr. President, with the permission of the Republican leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 28, H.R. 1363; that a Reid-McConnell \nsubstitute amendment, a 7-day continuing resolution, which is at the \ndesk, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time and the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended; that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with \nall the above occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the majority leader, \nand Speaker Boehner for their outstanding work during this difficult \nnegotiation. We had an opportunity tonight to decide whether we wanted \nto repeat history or make history. Had we chosen to repeat history, we \nwould have allowed a government shutdown. Instead, we decided to make \nhistory by implementing in the middle of this fiscal year, as the \nmajority leader indicated, substantial reductions in spending. These \nreductions are in the billions. Once we get through this process, by \nthe end of next week we will move on to a much larger discussion about \nhow we save trillions by enacting, hopefully, on a bipartisan basis, a \nbudget that genuinely begins to get on top of this problem. The \nproblem, as we all know, is $14 trillion in debt and over $53 trillion \nin unfunded liabilities.\n\n  The President has asked us to raise the debt ceiling, and Senate \nRepublicans and House Republicans--and I hope many Democrats as well--\nare going to say: Mr. President, in order to raise the debt ceiling, we \nneed to do something significant about the debt. My definition of \nsignificant is that the markets view it as significant, the American \npeople view it as significant, and foreign countries view it as \nsignificant.\n  So for tonight, again, I congratulate the majority leader and the \nSpeaker. This is an important first step but just the beginning of what \nwe need to do to get our fiscal house in order.\n  Mr. REID. The Republican leader is right. We have a lot of work to \ndo.\n  The one thing I want to mention is how much I appreciate the support \nof the American people. Of course, they knew we needed to get this \ndone, but also the business community of our country.\n  I had a conversation earlier today with Tom Donohue, the President of \nthe Chamber of Commerce. It was so important to his organization that \nwe complete this. The Business Roundtable and organizations all over \nAmerica understand how important this is.\n  I want to mention one more person--I know the night is late--who is \nalways an unsung hero, but really a hero among heroes, and that is the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Dan Inouye, who is here \nbehind me tonight. He has been, with his tireless staff, working so \nhard. I applaud his person, Charlie Houy, who has a fantastic knowledge \nof what goes on in this country as it relates to money. He came to the \nSenate in 1983. He has been here all these years working in the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I am not going to go through all the staff, but it is important to \nmention my chief of staff, David Krone, who has worked so very hard. I \nwant to mention one other American. I never met him until we started \nthis--and what we have been through--and I hope I don't get him in \ntrouble--and that is John Boehner's chief of staff, Barry Jackson. He \nis a real professional. It has been very difficult to work through all \nthis stuff, but I admire his professionalism. Of course, the White \nHouse staff has been indispensable.\n  Mr. President, I would hope we could have the consent agreement \napproved at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 291) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n       Section 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to give recognition to one \nof the Commonwealth's most unique and historic areas, Laurel County, \nKY, which celebrated its 185th birthday on March 5, 2011. Located in \nKentucky's eastern coal country, Laurel County was named after the \ntrees that grow along the banks of the Laurel River. A county full of \nrich history and tradition dating back before the Civil War years, \nLaurel County first established their government and began business in \n1826. Organized through a general assembly, it was the 18th county \ncreated in the Commonwealth.\n  London, the largest town in Laurel County, also celebrated its 185th \nbirthday this year on March 6. Although named after London, England, \nthe town's festive characteristics gave it a name in its own light. In \nproximity to beautiful landscapes which were explored by the likes of \nDaniel Boone and Levi Jackson, the two parks that bear their names, the \nDaniel Boone National Park and the Levi Jackson Wilderness Road State \nPark, have been hailed as two of the most sought-after vacation spots \nin the country. Cumberland Falls State Resort Park as well as numerous \nhiking and bike trails also showcase some of the best scenery the \nBluegrass State has to offer. Well-known names such as national best-\nselling author Silas House, former University of Kentucky star and NBA \nbasketball player Jeff Sheppard, and the infamous Kentucky Fried \nChicken founder Colonel Harland David Sanders have all called Laurel \nCounty home.\n  Whether you are sampling a taste of fried chicken at the World \nChicken Festival, enjoying a country music show at the Renfro Valley \nEntertainment Center on a Friday night, or taking in the scenery of the \nchallenging Redbud Ride bike trail, Laurel County has a little \nsomething for everyone. Maybe it is a combination of these one-of-a-\nkind attractions, the pristine beauty of its natural landscape, and its \nstrong sense of southern Kentucky hospitality that makes Laurel County \nso welcoming and intriguing. Whatever it is, it keeps people coming \nback for more.\n  Mr. President, 185 years later, these vacation crossroads still tell \na story. Atop the peaks overlooking the Cumberland Gap where the small, \nyet crucial Battle of Wildcat Mountain was fought in the Civil War to \nthe crystal clear waters of Laurel Lake, I am sure there will be many \nmore stories to tell in the future.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating Laurel County, \nKentucky's 185th birthday. This is an exciting time for the people of \nLaurel County and the Commonwealth, and I send them my congratulations \nand best wishes for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2342-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2342-S2343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SBIR/STTR\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today, I rise to speak to an amendment \nI believe addresses three underlying issues in S. 493, the Small \nBusiness Innovation Research Program, SBIR, and the Small Business \nTechnology Transfer Program, STTR, Reauthorization Act.\n  First, this amendment reduces the reauthorization of these programs \nfrom 8 years down to 3 years. This reauthorization bill, S. 493, makes \nsubstantial changes to the SBIR and STTR programs, and it is important \nfor the reauthorization timeline to reflect that. The changes could \ndramatically improve the program, but in case there are additional \nchanges that need to be to ensure they remain successful and effective, \nit is in the best interest of the participating agencies and the \nparticipants in the programs that there is an opportunity to make \nadjustments after a few years.\n  Second, my amendment strikes the mandatory increase agencies must set \naside from their budgets to fund both the SBIR and STTR programs. \nCurrently, these programs are funded through the participating agencies \nsetting aside 2.5 percent of their total research budgets for the SBIR \nprogram and 0.3 percent for the STTR program. S. 493 would require this \nset aside be increased to 3.5 percent and 0.6 percent over a period of \ntime for the SBIR and STTR programs, respectively.\n  In this current budget environment, when all agency budgets are \nfeeling the pinch, increasing this mandatory set aside will mean fewer \ndollars are available for other research. These programs focus on \ncommercialization of cutting edge innovation, which is critical to our \ncountry's global competitiveness. However, this mandatory increase \nwould mean funding cuts to other life saving research. For the National \nInstitutes of Health this 1 percent increase to fund the SBIR program \nwould mean there would be about $300 million less for other NIH \nresearch, research focused on finding new cures. For example, NIH \nspends about $300 million per year on prostate cancer, a little less \nthan that on lymphoma research and spends only half of that on autism \nresearch every year.\n  There is no evidence that agencies must turn away high-quality \napplicants or underfund them because there is a lack of funding. In \nfact, agencies that participate in these programs currently have the \ndiscretion to spend more on the SBIR or STTR programs if they deem it \nappropriate. The current set aside is a floor, not a ceiling. This \namendment does nothing to change that. However, I believe mandating the \nincrease, especially in this current budget environment, especially for \n8 years, could greatly disrupt Federal funding for other critical \nresearch.\n  The third provision of my amendment addresses the reality that \nbringing an idea to market is a complex process that often requires \nseveral rounds of financing. This amendment ensures that all small \nbusinesses are given an opportunity to compete for these grants \nregardless of their financial makeup, as long as they are a small \nbusiness. Years ago there was an administrative change made to the \neligibility criteria for these programs that has severely restricted \nthe ability of quality applicants to compete for funding. That change \nhas unilaterally excluded companies solely due to their financial \nstructure and not due to the size of their company. Small businesses \nare small businesses because of the number of people they employ, not \nbecause they have received their start up money through a venture \ncapitalist, or an angel investor or from winning the lottery. This \nsentiment was echoed by the Director of the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy, John Holdren, in a letter sent to Chairman Landrieu \nin 2009. Mr. Holdren stated that ``it is critical for the U.S. economy \nand global competitiveness that the very best companies are sustained \nand the most promising small companies are not arbitrarily restricted \nor excluded because of their capital structure.''\n  Arbitrary exclusion from these programs has affected small businesses \nall over the country. Too many times it has become a defining part of \nthe story of too many promising small businesses. One such story is \nthat of ActaCell, Inc. It is a company started with leading research in \nthe lithium ion materials field from the University of Texas in 2007. \nWhen ActaCell applied for an SBIR grant through the Department of \nDefense, it met the new eligibility standards required by the program; \nboth in its size and its financial structure. However, as the \napplication was pending, ActaCell needed to secure additional financing \nin order to continue its operations and therefore fell\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\noutside of these new arbitrary guidelines. The result was the Federal \nGovernment missed out on an opportunity to fund promising research, \nsolely due to this arbitrary financial restriction.\n  The Austin Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter to my office with their \nmany concerns regarding this provision. They stated that the problem is \ncompounded by the fact that the majority venture capitalist-funded \ncompanies can house multiple unfunded ideas that are ultimately all \nexcluded from the program. This occurs, even though research shows \ngreat promise, only because a business's overall financial structure \noffends this financial restriction. Their letter states that ``Small \nbusinesses should not be forced to choose between the SBIR program and \nventure capital funding. To accelerate American technological \ninnovation, Federal efforts must promote the importance of both public \nand private sector sources of capital and partnerships.''\n  Yesterday, in front of the House Small Business Committee, another \nTexan told his story of how these restrictions have hurt innovation. \nMr. Glenn Norem cofounded Totus Lighting Solutions, a company that \nmanufactures and markets products that integrate surveillance with \nsensor monitoring on intelligent lighting platforms. Because of these \narbitrary financial restrictions in the SBIR program, Mr. Norem had to \nchose between venture capital funding and Federal grants. When asked \nwhat impact that decision has had on his company and other companies \nsimilarly situated, he stated, that it delayed commercialization. \nAllowing companies to partner with all available options enables \ninnovation, which grows companies and creates jobs.\n  This amendment is supported by the University of Texas, Austin \nChamber of Commerce, Rice University, the Association of American \nUniversities and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.\n  I will be proud to offer this amendment that will improve the \nunderlying legislation and help ensure that absolute best research gets \nfunded by American tax dollars, so that innovation can lead to \ncommercialization as quickly as possible. Our country's job creators \nneed us to do our jobs so they can do theirs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2343-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE--S. 627\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

The commission also would investigate \n     a recent increase in the number of exemptions from FOIA that \n     federal agencies have issued to prevent the release of \n     information.

Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to share \nwith my colleagues a success story involving the building of a Federal \nlaboratory project with funds from three separate Federal agencies.\n  Several years ago, as part of the efforts to remediate some of the \nexcess facilities at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in my home State \nof Washington, the Department of Energy decided to tear down virtually \nall of the laboratory facilities in the so-called 300 Area to remediate \nand make the area available for future industrial uses.\n  We all shared the goal of cleaning up the 300 Area--it is an \nimportant part of the ongoing cleanup work at Hanford. But because the \n300 Area was home to approximately 1,000 scientists, engineers and \nsupport staff for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, we \nknow that we would have to find a new place for them to conduct their \nwork.\n  As I am sure you know, building a replacement laboratory to \naccommodate 1,000 people is no easy task under any set of \ncircumstances. And the broad spectrum of work being done by these \nscientists--national security, homeland security, science research--\nboth increased the challenge and brought a number of Federal agencies \ntogether. This unique situation brought together three agencies--the \nDepartment of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration and \nthe Department of Homeland Security--to create a unique solution, \nbuilding the Physical Sciences Facility.\n  This arrangement--three separate agencies with funding in two \nseparate appropriations bills--isn't common in the Federal Government \nand isn't easy to accomplish. But with a lot of hard work, the $225 \nmillion Physical Sciences Facility was constructed on time and within \nbudget over 5 years' time. It has allowed the unique capabilities at \nPNNL to continue to be able to support critical missions for several \ngovernment agencies.\n  I appreciate the leadership of PNNL Director Len Peters and Mike \nLawrence, followed by Director Mike Kluse, who were determined to make \nthe Physical Sciences Facility a reality. I would also like to \nrecognize Carrie Desmond and Doug Clapp, both of whom used to work on \nmy staff, for helping to make this project happen in the face of odds \nthat were unbelievable at times, including budget requests that were \nnot always sufficient to keep the project on schedule.\n  Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend the dedication of the new \nlaboratory on April 19, but I will be there in spirit. I congratulate \nall of the people at PNNL, the Department of Energy, the National \nNuclear Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security \nwho have worked to make the Physical Sciences Facility at the Pacific \nNorthwest National Laboratory an important asset for the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2343-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2343-S2344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           REMEMBERING KATYN\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the lives lost \nin last year's plane crash near Smolensk that killed Polish President \nLech Kaczynski, his wife Maria, and 94 others who represented the \npolitical, cultural, and religious leadership of Poland. Words alone \noffer little solace before such awesome tragedy, which is one of the \nreasons people must gather together before monuments and flowers to add \na tangible dimension to our shapeless grief. While eloquent remarks can \nmove the heart, we all know a smile, a gaze, or an embrace can often do \nmore to bring comfort to the sorrowful.\n  Katyn has become a tragedy in three acts--the crime, the coverup, and \nnow the crash. Surely it is fitting for us to meet, comfort each other, \nand remember those who died. But what lies beyond our tears? Can good \ncome from this evil?\n  For the loved ones of those 96 souls who perished nearly a year ago, \nthey\n\n[[Page S2344]]\n\nmust take comfort in knowing that the final act of their beloved was a \nnoble one--that of remembering those martyrs whom Stalin and his \nhenchmen sought to erase from Poland and, indeed, from history.\n  As Stanislaw Kot, Poland's wartime Ambassador to Moscow, said, \n``People are not like steam; they cannot evaporate.'' He was right and \nit is written, ``Your brother's blood cries out to me from the \nground!'' In a haunting twist of fate, a hungry wolf in the Russian \nwinter would scratch at the snow and uncover the hastily buried bones \nof Poland's best and brightest. And the truth about this unspeakable \ncrime would one day be known.\n  We have come a long way--a very long way--from the time when this \natrocity was falsely presented as a Nazi crime and from the time when \nthe names of the dead could only be circulated in communist Poland in \nthe form of samizdat publications and whispered around kitchen tables.\n  Nevertheless, there is still more that must be done to set the record \nstraight. This involves insuring that all the evidence relating to the \nexecution sites, the executioners' identities, the motives for the \ncrime, and the fate of so many Polish families who vanished on the \nSiberian steppe are publicly available. We must ensure that the \nfullness of the truth is uncovered and shared for its own sake and for \nclosure. To that end, I welcome recent news of the Kremlin's release of \nstill more documents relating to the massacre.\n  Further, I believe that finally coming to terms with Katyn is a \nnecessary precondition for a durable Polish-Russian rapprochement, \nwhich is itself good insurance for maintaining a Europe, whole, free, \nand at peace.\n  Next week Presidents Komorowski and Medvedev will meet before the \nmass graves at Katyn and, I trust, will continue a dialogue of healing \nbetween two great nations that have suffered so much from the elevation \nof an ideology over a people. I wish them well in their talks and \nongoing mission of reconciliation and believe that the only lasting \nbalm for this wound lies in the heart and not in a courtroom or even a \nlegislature.\n  This is not to say that charges or claims should not be pursued, but \nto recognize that, in many cases, such actions will fall short and \noffer little by way of consolation.\n  It would be most unfortunate for the memory of Katyn to be debased by \nideologues of any ilk who would usurp this sacred memory for partisan \nprojects. For too long the truth about Katyn was denied by those on the \nleft who turned a blind eye to the reality of communism and many on the \nright seemed to view Katyn as just another issue to be exploited in the \nstruggle of ideologies. People and their memory are an end, in and of \nthemselves, and must never be used as a means to advance even a just \ncause. The only decent relationship to them is that of love and \nremembrance--our dignity and theirs demands nothing less.\n  My sincere hope is that Poland and Russia can do better than some \ncountries that have fought bitter diplomatic battles and enacted laws \nto force or deny recognition of historic crimes. By honestly evaluating \na shared past of suffering, Poles and Russians have a real opportunity \nto build a shared future of friendship and prosperity.\n  Poland is now free and her traditions support the forgiveness that \noffers a path out of the valley of this shadow of death. In so many \nways, Poland is, and must remain, a light to those nearby who still \nlive in the darkness of oppression and lies.\n  As we continue to ponder the devastation of last year's catastrophe, \nI would like to close by putting a couple faces on our sadness; those \nof Mariusz Handzlik and Andrzej Przewoznik, who both died in last \nyear's crash.\n  Mariusz was a diplomat and father of three. He was well known and \nwell liked in Washington from the years he spent assigned to the \nEmbassy of Poland. In 2000, he played a fateful game of chess with \nPolish war hero and Righteous Gentile Jan Karski who narrowly escaped \n``liquidation'' at Katyn. Karski would die in a Washington hospital and \nHandzlik in a gloomy Russian forest.\n  Andrzej was a historian, a husband, and father of two. He was the \nprinciple organizer behind the conference I cohosted as Chairman of the \nU.S. Helsinki Commission last year at the Library of Congress to mark \nthe 70th anniversary of the Katyn Forest Massacre. Andrzej hoped to \nspend time at our National Archives sifting through the papers of the \nMadden Committee and other relevant U.S. Government documents on Katyn.\n  The memories of Mariusz, Andrzej, and so many other truly exceptional \npeople on that doomed flight offer much by way of virtue and \naccomplishment that will inspire Poles for generations to come. Let us \ntake comfort in the truth that is, at last, known and bask in the \nwarmth of heroic memories and do this together with our Polish friends \nwho are second to no one in their love of freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2344-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MIKE CHAHINIAN\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the good works \nof a member of my staff who is leaving. Michael Chahinian has served \nwith the Alabama congressional delegation for over 7 years. The first 5 \nwere with Congressman Aderholt, and the past 2 have been on my staff.\n  Michael graduated from Cornell University several years ago with a \ndegree in government and East Asian studies. While at Cornell he \nlearned how to speak Mandarin Chinese. While on my staff, he learned to \nspeak Southern English. During his time on Capitol Hill he enrolled in \nthe Naval War College's master's degree program. Michael graduated last \nyear a with master's in national security and strategic studies with \nhighest distinction. His master's program helped revive a childhood \ndream to become a naval officer. After making application to enter \nOfficer Candidate School, Michael learned late last year he was \naccepted and will report for duty in a few weeks.\n  Michael has worked hard on banking, finance, small business and \ncommerce issues while a member of my staff. Most recently he was \ninstrumental in working on the details and negotiations over our \nSessions-McCaskill amendment, which would have imposed multiyear \nspending caps on the Federal budget. The amendment was carefully \ncrafted to get maximum bipartisan support, and with 59 votes, it \nreceived more support than any serious budget reform in the past \ndecade.\n  Michael has also been instrumental on my behalf in supporting \ndomestic manufacturing through his active role working on trade policy \nin my office. While on my staff, he has helped the domestic sleeping \nbag industry deal with unfair competition from a loophole in one of our \ntrade laws, known as GSP. On Congressman Aderholt's staff, he became \nknown for his good work on behalf of the local sock industry, dominant \nin the northeastern part of our State.\n  In each of these situations, Michael demonstrated hard work and a \ndogged tenacity. Though we hate to lose him, I am confident our loss \nwill be the Navy's gain. I wish him Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2344-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LAURA CAPASSO\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Mr. President, I am honored to pay tribute to the \nlife and service of Officer Jermaine Anthony Gibson of the Cathedral \nCity Police Department who was killed in the line of duty on March 19, \n2011. Officer Gibson will be remembered for his compassion, valor, \nbravery, and service in the field; and as a wonderful coworker, friend, \nand family man.\n  Jermaine ``Jay'' Gibson was born on August 3, 1982, in New Orleans, \nLA. He relocated to Richmond, CA, with his mother and brother in 1989. \nWhile attending Pinole Valley High School, he began 4 years of service \nas a police explorer--first with the Richmond Police Department and \nlater with the Vallejo Police Department. After high school graduation \nin 2001, he continued his education at the Basic Law Enforcement \nAcademy at Napa Valley College and graduated as a member of the \nacademy's class 50 in 2002.\n  Jermaine Gibson enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 2003, and from \n2006-2007 served concurrently as a level 1 police reserve officer with \nthe Desert Hot Springs Police Department. He was honorably discharged \nfrom the military as a Marine corporal on June 15, 2007. In recognition \nof his meritorious service, he was awarded numerous commendations--\nincluding a Good Conduct Medal, a Marine Corps martial arts Tan Belt, a \npistol expert badge, two rifle expert badges, and two Purple Hearts for \ninjuries sustained during combat in Iraq.\n  After returning to civilian status, Officer Gibson joined the Rialto \nPolice Department on August 19, 2009, as a full-time sworn officer. \nSixteen months later, he joined the Cathedral City Police Department, \nwhere he served until the end of his watch on March 19, 2011.\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences to his family, especially his wife \nJessica and their six-week-old son Jermaine Jr.; his mother Cheryl; and \nhis brother Taurean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2345-7", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2345-S2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING OCEAN FARM TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, for the past month, the U.S. Senate \nhas been considering legislation to reauthorize the critical Small \nBusiness Innovation Research, or SBIR, program. SBIR fosters an \nenvironment of innovative entrepreneurship by directing more than $2 \nbillion annually in Federal research and development funding to the \nnation's small firms most likely to create\n\n[[Page S2346]]\n\njobs and commercialize their products. I wish to recognize the \nachievements of Ocean Farm Technologies, a small business in Searsmont, \nME, which has utilized the SBIR program to revolutionize the \naquaculture sector through innovative new products.\n  Today, aquaculture supplies over 45 percent of the world's fish \nsupply, and Ocean Farm Technologies is at the cutting edge of improving \nthe sector's productive future. The company's founder Steve Page has \nover 30 years of experience as an organic farmer and entrepreneur. \nPrior to founding the company in 2005, Mr. Page acted as the \nenvironmental compliance officer for Atlantic Salmon of Maine, an \naquaculture company that farmed salmon in Machiasport.\n  One of Ocean Farm Technologies' most creative innovations is the self \npropelled and eco-friendly ``AquaPod'' containment system that allows \nfor an unprecedented diversity of marine species to be safely and \nsustainably cultivated at sea. Marine aquaculture has been restricted \nto calm coastal waters where stationary fish farms can be sheltered \nfrom ocean currents and storms. This has limited the variety of \ncultivatable species and has raised environmental concerns regarding \neffluent pollution.\n  Determined to overcome these constraints, Mr. Page obtained a \n$250,000 grant from the Maine Technology Institute to design a system \ncapable of surviving rough open ocean conditions. The resultant \n``AquaPod'' is an award winning and patented spherical fish pen made of \nreinforced polyethylene, steel, and mesh netting. It is submersible, \nself-propelled, environmentally friendly, and safe from marine \npredators.\n  In 2008, the ``AquaPod'' was successfully tested by researchers from \nthe Massachusetts Institute for Technology off the coast of Culebra, \nPuerto Rico. It is the first self-propelled open ocean aquaculture pen \nin the world. Additionally, it is the winner of the Maine Technology \nInstitute's Development Award, and has been deployed in places as \ndivergent as South Korea and Mexico.\n  Furthermore, Ocean Farm Technologies was the recipient of a Tibbetts \nAwards from the U.S. Small Business Administration earlier this year. \nThe award is presented to small businesses and individuals judged to \nexemplify the best in the SBIR program, and promote its mission and \ngoals. It is named for Roland Tibbetts, acknowledged as the father of \nthe SBIR program. This award is a distinguished honor, and I am proud \nof Ocean Farm Technologies for earning this high recognition.\n  Ocean Farm Technologies embodies the bright future of aquaculture, \nwhich is critical to my home State of Maine, and indeed the true spirit \nof American entrepreneurship. I wish Steve Page and everyone at Ocean \nFarm Technologies the very best, and thank them for their ingenuity and \nconsiderable accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2346-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OREGON AIR NATIONAL GUARD 70TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this month the Oregon Air National \nGuard is celebrating its 70th anniversary.\n  ``We've got people, we've got a place, and we're ready!'' These were \nthe historic words written in a request by Major G. Robert Dodson, an \nOregonian assigned to organize and command the first squadron of Oregon \nNational Guard Air Corps.\n  Ready as Major Dodson was, it hadn't happened quickly or easily. It \ntook several years to get the squadron assembled. General George A. \nWhite, Oregon's Adjutant General, requested a squadron as early as \nAugust 1939, but didn't receive official authorization to form the \nsquadron from the National Guard Bureau until August 1, 1940. On April \n18, 1941, Major Dodson assembled a group of 117 volunteers to form the \n123rd Observation Squadron.\n  Less than 8 months later, these Airmen were the first to conduct \nmaritime surveillance of the continental United States following the \nDecember 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  For the most part, their job was to conduct surveillance on the \nenemy. However, they did on at least one occasion ignore their orders \nto ``stick to taking pictures'' and dropped ordnance instead. It was \nnot without good reason. It seems that the Japanese they targeted had \nsunk the ship carrying the unit's beer rations. Their improvised attack \nwasn't appreciated by their commander, but even back then getting \nbetween Oregonians and their beer didn't go unpunished.\n  After the war, the Air National Guard was established as a separate \ncomponent of the U.S. Air Force. Since being formally designated the \nOregon Air National Guard, our State's aviators have played a vital \nrole in Korea, the cold war, and in military operations throughout the \nworld since the tragic events of 9/11. Seventy years and 15 different \naircraft models since their inception, the number of citizen-airmen has \nincreased more than twentyfold to 2,000.\n  Today, our Nation relies on F-15s from the Oregon Air National Guard \nto perform the air sovereignty mission for the entire Pacific \nNorthwest. Our twin-engine, air superiority fighter jets--Eagles--fly \nupwards of Mach 2 to intercept any threat along our Nation's border. \nAdditionally, the Oregon Air National Guard trains new Air Force pilots \nat Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls.\n  They are not only there for our Nation in times of war, but they \nanswer the call of the Governor during natural disasters. When flooding \nthreatened hundreds of lives in Vernonia, OR, in 2007 it was the Oregon \nAir National Guard's 125th Special Tactics Squadron that was first on \nthe scene. They saved hundreds of people from the rising water.\n  Today's Oregon Air National Guard units include the 142nd Fighter \nWing, 125th Special Tactics Squadron and 123rd Weather Flight in \nPortland, the 173rd Fighter Wing and 270th Air Traffic Control Squadron \nin Klamath Falls, Joint Force Headquarter in Salem, and the 116th Air \nControl Squadron in Warrenton.\n  As an Oregonian and as their Senator, I could not be more proud of \ntoday's Oregon Air National Guard and its rich heritage. It is an honor \nto serve these heroes; active, retired, and those that have given their \nlives. I am very appreciative of their 70 years of selfless service and \nsacrifice. The people of Oregon thank every member of this pillar of \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2346-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2346-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/08/senate-section/article/S2346-4", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 910.

A bill amend title 38, United States Code, to prevent the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs from prohibiting the use of service dogs \non Department of Veterans Affairs property; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, along with Senator Isakson, today I am \nintroducing a bill to allow veterans with disabilities who utilize \nservice dogs the same access to VA health care and facilities as those \nusing guide dogs. Right now, a vet who has a seeing-eye dog can go into \nany VA hospital to get services, but it is at the discretion of each \nfacility whether or not to allow a vet to bring a service dog, which \nthey use for mobility, assistance with living with hearing loss, \ncomfort for those experiencing PTSD, and to alert others if they have a \nseizure.\n  This bill will provide for full access to all veterans at every VA \nfacility, without exception. There should not be a variation in policy \nfrom one VA facility to another. It is a small but laudable goal to \npromote the access of persons with disabilities at VA facilities and \nguarantee all veterans, regardless of their disability, receive the \ncare and services they need and are entitled to through their selfless \nservice to our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 771. A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to modify a \nprovision relating to gaming on land acquired after October 17, 1988; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tribal \nGaming Eligibility Act with my friend and colleague from Arizona, \nSenator Jon Kyl.\n  This bill requires that Indian tribes demonstrate both an aboriginal \nand a modern connection to the land before it can be used for gaming.\n  The bill responds to growing concerns and frustrations about the \nnumber of ``off-reservation'' casinos proposals in California and \nacross the nation.\n  As of May 2010, the U.S. Department of Interior was considering 35 of \nthese proposals. Eleven of them are in my home State.\n  Casinos strain local governments, increase violent crime, and \nincrease bankruptcies. Gambling regulations are poorly enforced, \nlargely because deficit-plagued state governments have cut enforcement \nstaff down to the bone. Even when enforcement officials are present, \nhighly protective ``State Compacts,'' protect tribal casinos from true \nscrutiny and legitimate oversight.\n  The fact is that some tribes have abused their unique right to \noperate casinos by taking land into trust miles away from their \nhistorical lands and miles away from where any tribal member resides. \nThis is done to produce the most profitable casino, often with little \nregard to what is most beneficial to tribal members.\n  This unbridled reservation shopping is occurring with little to no \ninput from local governments or neighboring tribes.\n  The result: 58 casinos in California; 11 more in the approval \nprocess; and a very real potential for an additional 50 casinos in the \ncoming years.\n  That is why I am introducing the Tribal Gaming Eligibility Act. This \nlegislation addresses the problems that arise from off-reservation \ncasinos by requiring that tribes meet two simple conditions if they \nwish to game on lands acquired after the passage of the 1988 Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act.\n  First the tribe must demonstrate a ``substantial direct modern \nconnection to the land.''\n  Second, the tribe must demonstrate a ``substantial direct aboriginal \nconnection to the land.''\n  Simply put, tribes must demonstrate that both they and their \nancestors have a connection to the land in question.\n  In 2000, California voters thought they settled the question of \ncasino gaming when they passed Proposition 1A. This proposition \nauthorized the governor to negotiate gambling compacts that would make \nNevada-style casinos possible for ``federally recognized Indian tribes \non Indian lands.''\n  The words ``on Indian lands'' were key to Proposition 1A. This made \nit clear that gaming is appropriate only on a tribe's historical lands, \nand voters endorsed this bargain with 65 percent of the vote.\n  But fast-forward 10 years and this agreement is being put to the \ntest. In the last decade, the Department of the Interior has received \ndozens of gaming applications; some for casinos nowhere near a tribe's \nhistoric lands. Many of these requests have been granted and California \nhas become ground zero for tribal casinos. We have 58 Las Vegas style \ncasinos all across the State--from within miles of the Mexican border, \nto within miles of the Oregon border.\n  The problem is only going to get worse. There are 67 tribes currently \nseeking Federal recognition in California who will have the ability to \ntake ``initial lands'' into trust for gaming. This ``initial lands'' \nexemption gives landless tribes carte blanche when it comes to picking \na spot for their casino--urban areas, environmentally sensitive areas, \nyou name it! That is a real concern to me and my constituents.\n  As of May 2010, there were 11 applications for off-reservation or \nrestored lands casinos in California pending at the Department of the \nInterior. These include projects near San Francisco, Barstow, and \nSacramento.\n  It also includes applications for casinos in San Diego and Riverside \nCounties, where there are already 21 existing casinos.\n  By seeking to open casinos in urban areas close to the greatest \nnumber of potential gamblers, instead of on historical lands, these \ntribes are ignoring the will of California voters and the intent of \nCongress when it passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n\n  Unfortunately, without a legislative fix such as the Tribal Gaming \nEligibility Act, Californians have no power to stop these tribes from \nopening unwanted casinos in their back yards.\n  But voters are still trying to make their voices heard, rejecting the \nidea of reservation shopping. At one location, in Richmond, CA, a city \nof nearly 100,000 in the middle of the Bay Area--a tribe proposed \ntaking land into trust to open a 4,000-slot-machine casino. Proponents \ntout it as a major economic engine for a depressed area.\n  On November 2, Richmond voters made it clear how they feel: by a \nmargin of 58 to 42 percent, voters overwhelmingly rejected the advisory \nMeasure U on the Richmond casino and they elected two new city council \nmembers who strongly oppose the casino. It was an unambiguous rejection \nof this off-reservation gaming proposal.\n  Some people have tried to tell me that this is just a California \nproblem, and that we just need a California-solution. I am afraid this \nis not the case.\n  The Department of the Interior is considering gaming applications for \ntribes in Washington, Oregon, Mississippi, Nevada, and Massachusetts \njust to name a few. I urge my colleagues to ask your constituents and \nyour community leaders if they have were consulted about these \nproposals. Did they have any input? Were the needs of the cities, \ncounties, and neighboring tribes considered?\n  As a former mayor, I know the financial pressures that local \ngovernments face, especially in these tough times. The temptation to \nsupport large casinos can be strong. But I also know the heavy price \nthat society pays for the siren song of gambling. This price includes \naddiction and crime, strained public services and increased traffic \ncongestion.\n  Some Indian gaming proponents, often backed by rich out-of-state \ninvestors and gambling syndicates, would have us believe that these \noff-reservation gaming establishments are a sign of growth and economic \ndevelopment.\n  In 2006 the California Research Bureau compiled research on the \neffects of casinos on communities, and they released a report entitled \nGambling in the Golden State. The results were staggering.\n  The development of new casinos is associated with a 10 percent \nincrease in violent crime and a 10 percent increase in bankruptcy \nrates.\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\n  New casinos are also associated with an increase in law enforcement \nexpenditures of $15.34 per person.\n  California already spends an estimated $1 billion to deal with \nproblem-gamblers and pathological-gamblers, 75 percent of which \nidentify Indian casinos as their primary gambling preference.\n  This report confirmed what many local elected officials and community \nactivists already knew: casinos may create a few jobs, but they come \nwith a tremendous cost.\n  One reason for the high costs casinos is the woefully inadequate \noversight at Indian gambling facilities.\n  In California, gaming oversight officials are responsible for over \ntwice as much economic activity per inspector compared to their \ncounterparts in states with legalized commercial gambling. Using the \nmost recent data available from 2006:\n  California employed 180 gambling oversight officials to regulate $5.2 \nbillion dollars in economic activity.\n  This means the State only employed 1 official for every $28.9 million \ndollars of economic activity in the gambling industry.\n  By comparison, the 11 States that had legalized commercial gambling \naveraged 1 oversight official per $12.1 million dollars of activity.\n  Furthermore, closed-door gaming compacts limit what little power \nthese investigators actually have. They cannot conduct unannounced \nvisits, they have little discretion on what penalties to enact, and \nthey cannot enforce their punishments when they are handed down. Quite \nsimply, it is a broken system.\n  I know that some may try to mischaracterize my legislation and say \nthat I am trying to limit the sovereignty of Native American tribes or \ndestroy their ability to undertake much needed economic development.\n  But I am here today to say that nothing could be farther from the \ntruth.\n  The fact of the matter is that most casinos are appropriately \nplaced--on historical tribal lands--and there is no need to argue about \nthe legitimacy of these establishments.\n  My legislation only deals with those proposals that are truly beyond \nthe scope of Congressional intent when the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nwas passed in 1988.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 771\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect Federal employees and visitors, improve the \nsecurity of Federal facilities and authorize and modernize the Federal \nProtective Service; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nCollins and Akaka today to introduce the bipartisan SECURE Facilities \nAct of 2011 to modernize and transform an important but often \noverlooked agency within the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, \nresponsible for protecting 9,000 Federal buildings across the country.\n  The agency I refer to is the Federal Protective Service, FPS, where \n1,200 full time employees and about 15,000 contract guards safeguard \nnot just the buildings, but the one million people who work at and \nvisit these buildings each year.\n  Unfortunately, the threat to government workers and property is all \ntoo real. In 1995, a massive bomb decimated the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people. The Pentagon was \none of the targets of the 9/11 terrorists. A wing of the building was \nleveled and 184 people died. Last year, a man flew a small plane into a \nbuilding in Austin, TX, that housed an IRS and other government \noffices. An IRS manager was killed. Earlier this year, our friend and \ncolleague, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was critically shot at a \npublic forum. Most recently, a man planted an improvised explosive \ndevice outside the McNamara Federal building in Detroit. A dozen or so \nother violent incidents have occurred at federal buildings in the last \n3 years. Protecting the people who work and visit federal buildings is \ncritical to maintaining the integrity of our democracy.\n  Security at these buildings, however, is not where it should be. Poor \nmanagement, serious budget shortfalls, and operational challenges have \ndiminished FPS' effectiveness and undermined public trust. FPS guards \nwere famously caught sleeping on the job, putting an infant in its \ncarrier through an X-ray machine, and failing to detect bomb-making \nmaterials on investigators who passed through security.\n  The Federal Protective Service must be turned around, which is why we \nare introducing this legislation to strengthen the agency's management, \nprovide it with the necessary resources to fulfill its mission, and \nhelp it function at a higher level.\n  I want to single out for praise the Government Accountability Office, \nGAO, whose excellent work has significantly informed our legislation.\n  At a July 8, 2009, hearing before the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, GAO unveiled the results of a year-long \ninvestigation conducted at the Committee's request. GAO visited 6 of 11 \nFPS regions throughout the country and observed the guard inspection \nprocess; interviewed managers, inspectors, and guards; analyzed guard \ncontracts, training and certification requirements, and instruction \ndocuments. GAO's special investigations unit conducted its own covert \ntests at 10 high security Federal facilities in several different \ncities, some of which house district offices of our House and Senate \ncolleagues.\n  What did GAO find? A seriously dysfunctional agency. FPS lacks focus \nand strategies for accomplishing its mission; contract guards don't \nhave adequate training; FPS personnel suffer from low morale; oversight \nof contract guards is poor; and many standards that guide federal \nbuilding security are outdated.\n  GAO revealed that some guards lacked basic security or x-ray machine \ntraining. The FPS was hard pressed to identify which guards were \nqualified or effective. One guard used a government computer to run an \nadult website during his shift, while another allowed a baby in a \ncarrier to pass through an x-ray machine. A third guard was \nphotographed asleep at his station.\n  GAO investigators smuggled through security at one building readily \navailable components to make a liquid-based improvised explosive \ndevice. The investigators then made a bomb in a public restroom and \nmoved throughout the federal building undetected. I note that while the \ncomponents of the IED were real, the actual explosive liquids were \ndiluted to ensure the bomb was not functional.\n  FPS didn't come to this point overnight. In fact, its problems \nmultiplied when it was folded into DHS in 2003. At that point, the \nagency lost access to supplemental funding from its previous parent \nagency--the General Services Administration, GSA, and because of that, \nimmediately ran into trouble. FPS fell behind in paying its bills, \nbudget cuts hurt employee training and other functions, and personnel \ncuts diminished the agency's overall performance. At the same time, FPS \nwas given more responsibilities, and the previous administration was \nworking to downsize the agency workforce by 1/3.\n  Reform legislation is very clearly needed, and the SECURE Facilities \nAct of 2011 addresses many of the shortcomings detailed by GAO.\n  In particular, our legislation addresses four major challenges:\n  First, the bill would help the FPS carry out its mission by adding \nalmost 150 law enforcements and support personnel. The agency has \nassumed increased responsibilities since it joined DHS but has done so \nwith fewer personnel, and that is unsustainable.\n  Second, our legislation would tackle deficiencies within the contract \nguard program. FPS contract guards are the first line of defense at \nFederal facilities, so we must ensure they are held to high standards \nand are prepared and equipped to face the varied threats to which \nfederal buildings are vulnerable.\n  Third, the bill would ensure the FPS is prepared to address the \nthreat of explosives. The bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal \nBuilding in Oklahoma City occurred 16 years ago, but FPS has been slow \nto deploy sufficient countermeasures to detect and deter that type of \nattack.\n  Fourth, our bill would recognize the delicate balance between public \naccess and security. We have worked to put the emphasis on securing \nFederal facilities but we also support avenues of appeal if a building \ntenant believes a security measure unduly hinders public access. If the \nFederal Protective Service is to be held accountable--by Congress, the \nadministration, and the American people--it should no longer be forced \nto defend federal agencies that choose less costly and potentially less \neffective security for their buildings.\n  On the question of resources, our bill, for the first time, would \nformally authorize the FPS and the interagency government body \nresponsible for establishing security standards for all federal \nfacilities, the Interagency Security Committee. We would provide \nadditional funding for the agency by directing OMB to increase the \nbuilding security fees paid by other agencies. We would provide \nresources for FPS to hire 146 full time employees. We would ensure that \nFPS employs 1,200 full time employees or more at all times--a \nconservative number that may require future increases.\n  Many of the additional employees would be law enforcement officers, \nbut FPS would also have the flexibility to hire administrative and \nsupport personnel to improve its overall management, strengthen its \noversight of contract guards, monitor contractor performance, and share \ncontract assessments throughout the agency. The legislation also would \nprovide retirement benefits to FPS officers to help the agency recruit \nand retain quality personnel.\n  Recognizing that the nation's fiscal health and our unsustainable \ndeficits demand budget tightening, it is especially critical that we \nmake wise budget decisions. I believe the evidence clearly demonstrates \nthe need for additional spending for FPS.\n  With regard to improved standards, our legislation would require FPS \nto conduct overt and covert testing to assess guard training, test the \nsecurity of Federal facilities, and establish procedures for retraining \nor terminating poor performing guards. The bill would also require that \nbasic documents and manuals describing the responsibilities of security \nguards are up to date and periodically reviewed.\n  On explosives, we would require DHS to establish performance-based \nstandards for checkpoint detection technologies for explosives and \nother threats at Federal facilities. Our bill would also allow FPS \nofficers to carry firearms off duty, as most other Federal law \nenforcement officers can, allowing them to respond to incidents more \nquickly. And, finally, the bill includes several reporting \nrequirements--on agency personnel needs, retention rates of contract \nguards, the feasibility of federalizing the contract guard workforce, \nand additional methods for preventing and detecting explosives in \nfederal facilities.\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\n  Based on the Committee's and GAO's oversight work over the past \nseveral years, it is clear that Congress must move quickly to address \nthe remaining security vulnerabilities associated with our Federal \nbuildings.\n  I am confident that this comprehensive, bipartisan legislation will \nfoster meaningful reform, modernize the Federal Protective Service, and \nimprove the security of our Federal facilities across the country. I \nurge my colleagues to support the bill and I thank Senator Collins, \nSenator Akaka, former Senator Voinovich, and their dedicated staffs for \nhelping to get this bill introduced today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 772\n\n     SECTION 1.

Terrorists are \nintent on attacking the United States, and their tactics continue to \nevolve. The early identification of a security gap can save countless \nlives if we act promptly to close it. There is no substitute for pre-\nemptive action to detect, disrupt, and defend against terrorist plots.\n  As we remember the lives lost when terrorists attacked the United \nStates in 2001, we must avoid complacency. Our country's defenses must \nbe nimble, multi-layered, informed by timely intelligence and \ncoordinated across multiple agencies.\n  This is difficult work, requiring painstaking attention to detail and \nan unwavering focus. We must remain vigilant about the threats we face. \nUnfortunately, the evidence indicates there are significant security \nproblems at Federal buildings where thousands of employees serve \nthousands more of our citizens every work day.\n  The Federal Protective Service, FPS, is charged with securing nearly \n9,000 Federal facilities and protecting the government employees who \nwork in them, and the Americans who use them to access vital services.\n  But, independent investigations by the Government Accountability \nOffice, at the request of our Committee, and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Inspector General have documented serious and systemic \nsecurity flaws within the operations of the FPS. These lapses place \nFederal employees and private citizens at risk.\n  In April and May of 2009, for example, GAO's undercover investigators \nsmuggled bomb-making materials into 10 Federal office buildings. Every \nsingle building GAO targeted was breached--a perfect record of security \nfailure. At each facility, concealed bomb components passed through \ncheckpoints monitored by FPS guards. Once inside, the covert GAO \ninvestigators were able to assemble the simulated explosive devices \nwithout interruption.\n  A July 2009 GAO report documented training flaws for FPS contract \nguards, some of whom failed to receive mandatory training on the \noperation of metal detectors and x-ray equipment. Other contract guards \nwere deficient in key certifications such as CPR, First Aid, and \nfirearms training. All told, GAO found that 62 percent of the FPS \ncontract guards it reviewed lacked valid certifications in one or more \nof these areas.\n  This review also found that FPS did little to ensure compliance with \nrules and regulations and failed to conduct inspections of guard posts \nafter regular business hours. When GAO investigators tested these \nposts, they found some guards sleeping on an overnight shift.\n  In another example, an inattentive guard allowed a baby in a carrier \nto pass through an x-ray machine on its conveyor belt. That guard was \nfired, but he ultimately won a lawsuit against the FPS because the \nagency could not document that he had received required training on the \nmachine.\n  A few months earlier, in April 2009, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Inspector General also found critical failings in the FPS \ncontract guard program. The Inspector General's recommendations \nincluded many concrete steps to strengthen contract guard performance, \nsuch as improving the award and management of contracts and increasing \nthe amount of training and number of compliance inspections.\n  These reports demonstrate that American taxpayers are simply not \nreceiving the security they have paid for and that they expect FPS to \nprovide. The reports also show the vulnerabilities facing Federal \nemployees and federal infrastructure because of lax security.\n  While shining a light on these failings in multiple hearings, our \nCommittee pressed FPS to take action to close these security gaps. \nAlthough some tentative steps have been taken by FPS, we can no longer \nwait for OMB and DHS to implement the absolutely critical security \nmeasures necessary to help protect our Federal buildings, our Federal \nemployees, and the American public.\n  The legislation that I introduce today, with Senators Lieberman and \nAkaka, would help close these security gaps at our Federal buildings.\n  First, the bill would codify the Interagency Security Committee, \nwhich was established by Executive Order 6 months after the Oklahoma \nCity bombing, to increase security standards at Federal facilities. The \nISC, comprised of representatives from agencies across the government, \nwould establish risk-based performance standards for the security of \nFederal buildings. FPS would then enforce these requirements based on \nthe risk tier assigned the facility by the ISC.\n  Prior reports clearly demonstrate that FPS lacks authority to require \ntenant agencies of a Federal facility to comply with recommended \nsecurity countermeasures.\n  For example, although FPS may ask tenant agencies to purchase or \nrepair security equipment like cameras and x-ray machines, these tenant \nagencies can refuse to purchase or repair the equipment based on cost. \nSince FPS has no enforcement mechanism, these machines are not \nupgraded, or remain inoperable, and security suffers. With so much at \nstake, tenant agencies should not be able to effectively overrule the \nsecurity experts on the ISC and at FPS.\n  To address this problem, our legislation would provide FPS the \nauthority needed to mandate the implementation of security measures at \na facility. FPS also would have the authority to inspect Federal \nfacilities to enforce compliance.\n  The bill would allow the FPS Director to charge additional fees if \ntenant agencies fail to comply with applicable security standards. In \nsuch cases, the Secretary also must notify Congress of the non-\ncompliant facilities.\n  Our bill also would require an independent analysis of FPS's long-\nterm staffing needs.\n  The government has an obligation to protect our Nation's security, \nand our Federal buildings are targets for violence. This legislation \nwould provide FPS with stronger authority to improve security at our \nFederal buildings.\n  The American public that relies on these facilities and the Federal \nemployees who work in them deserve better and more reliable protection.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 774.

Res. 138\n\n       Whereas, on January 12, 2009, the United Nations Human \n     Rights Council passed Resolution S-9/1, authorizing a ``fact-\n     finding mission'' regarding the conduct of the Government of \n     Israel during Operation Cast Lead between December 27, 2008, \n     and January 18, 2009;\n       Whereas that resolution prejudged the outcome of the fact \n     finding mission by mandating that it investigate ``violations \n     of international human rights law and international \n     humanitarian law by the occupying power, Israel, against the \n     Palestinian people'';\n       Whereas, on September 15, 2009, the ``United Nations Fact \n     Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict'' released its report, \n     now known as the ``Goldstone report'', named for its chair, \n     South African Jurist Richard Goldstone;\n       Whereas the report made numerous unsubstantiated assertions \n     against Israel, in particular accusing the Government of \n     Israel of committing war crimes by deliberately targeting \n     civilians during its operations in Gaza;\n       Whereas the report downplayed the overwhelming evidence \n     that Hamas deliberately used Palestinian civilians and \n     civilian institutions as human shields against Israel and \n     deliberately targeted Israeli civilians with rocket fire for \n     over eight years prior to the operation;\n       Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Council voted to \n     welcome the report, to endorse its recommendations, and to \n     condemn Israel without mentioning Hamas;\n       Whereas, as a result of the report, the United Nations \n     General Assembly has passed\n\n[[Page S2361]]\n\n     two resolutions endorsing the report's findings, the United \n     Nations Secretary-General has been requested to submit \n     several reports on implementation of its recommendations, and \n     the Human Rights Council is scheduled to follow up on \n     implementation of the report during future sessions;\n       Whereas the findings of the Goldstone report and the \n     subsequent and continued United Nations member state actions \n     following up on those findings have caused and continue to \n     cause extensive harm to Israel's standing in the world and \n     could potentially create legal problems for Israel and its \n     leaders;\n       Whereas Justice Richard Goldstone publicly retracted the \n     central claims of the report he authored in an op-ed in The \n     Washington Post on April 2, 2011;\n       Whereas Justice Goldstone wrote in that article that if he \n     ``had known then what I know now, the Goldstone Report would \n     have been a different document'';\n       Whereas Justice Goldstone concluded that, contrary to his \n     report's findings, the Government of Israel did not \n     intentionally target civilians in the Gaza Strip as a matter \n     of policy;\n       Whereas, in contrast, Justice Goldstone states that the \n     crimes committed by Hamas were clearly intentional, were \n     targeted at civilians, and constitute a violation of \n     international law;\n       Whereas Justice Goldstone also conceded that the number of \n     civilian casualties in Gaza was far smaller than the report \n     alleged;\n       Whereas Justice Goldstone admitted that Israel investigated \n     the findings in the report, while expressing disappointment \n     that Hamas has not taken any steps to look into the report's \n     findings;
