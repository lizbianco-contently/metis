All of this is in northeast Louisiana, the Monroe area.\n  Reverend Smith is very distinguished and has brought real hope to so \nmany people in so many communities in that area--first of all, as a \nspiritual leader, the leader of his congregation and so many others; \nsecondly, as a true leader in fighting truancy, fighting dropout rates \nvery effectively, and also developing good jobs through many school \nsystems. But the third point I really want to make is that I am most \njoyful to help host him today because he is a true and a good and a \ntremendously supportive friend. I know that from personal experience, \nfrom personal counsel and encouragement, and so do so many other \nLouisianans know that, and we cherish the reverend in that very \npersonal way. So I am truly honored and delighted to be able to \nintroduce the Senate to Reverend Smith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S81-9", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S81-S82]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in 1946 President Harry Truman delivered his \nfirst State of the Union Message. This was the first State of the Union \nMessage since the end of World War II. The trials of war were behind us \nbut new challenges laid ahead. Truman laid out a vision for not only \nhow America could survive those challenges but thrive in the modern \nworld. He described the path forward in simple words. He said:\n\n       Our basic objective--toward which all others lead--is to \n     improve the welfare of the American people.\n\n  That meant economic prosperity. It meant Social Security and \nunemployment insurance. It meant an opportunity for higher education, \naccess to medical care, and the dream of home ownership.\n  The goal, he wrote, was ``that we become a well-housed people, a \nwell-nourished people, an educated people, a people socially and \neconomically secure, an alert and responsible people.'' And in the \nthree decades that followed that vision, that was reality. The middle \nclass was never larger, never stronger, and it had never been easier to \nbecome a part of that middle class. That is the way it was. Through \nhard work and ingenuity, Americans prospered together.\n  For three decades after World War II, the rungs on the ladder to \nsuccess grew closer together, but in the three decades that followed, \nsomething changed. The goal was the same--to be a well-housed, well-\neducated nation of responsible and economically secure people--but for \nmany, reaching that goal became very difficult--certainly more \ndifficult. Incomes skyrocketed for the richest few, but they stalled \nfor the rest, and the middle class lost more and more ground.\n  Today, the richest 1 percent holds nearly half of all the wealth in \nthis country. Today, the richest 1 percent takes home a quarter of all \nwages. Income, personal income--1 percent takes 25 percent of that. I \nrepeat, the richest 1 percent holds nearly half of all the wealth in \nthis country.\n  Americans are working just as hard as they worked 60 years ago, but \nthat hard work is paying off for fewer and fewer people. What does that \nmean? For the last three decades, the rungs on the ladder to success \nhave grown farther apart instead of closer together, and the farther \napart those rungs grow, the fewer Americans climb that ladder. The \nfarther apart those rungs are, the fewer Americans make it into a \ndisappearing middle class.\n  We just weathered the worst recession since the Great Depression, but \nthe financial collapse of 2008 was not the cause of the problem, it was \na symptom of the problem. It was a symptom of a system that is rigged \nto pay off for a few but leave many behind, and it is time to even the \nplaying field.\n  As we rebuild our economy, let's rebuild it to last. Let's rebuild it \nto work for every American, regardless of the size of their bank \naccount. This week, President Obama laid out a vision to do just that.\n  The President's plan will spur manufacturing. It is time to reward \ncompanies that ``make it in America'' and end giveaways to companies \nthat ship jobs overseas. It will reduce our reliance on expensive \nforeign oil. It is time to rely on plentiful, homegrown, renewable \nenergy sources, in spite of the fact that President Obama said that \njust less than 10 years ago we were importing 60 percent of the oil and \nnow it is less than 50 percent. We are producing more oil than we have \nin about a decade, and that is good, but we need to make sure the \nfuture is one of renewable energy. The plan will ensure that today's \nstudents have the skills to become tomorrow's workers. That is the only \nway to keep pace in a competitive world economy. And it will return \nthis country to the core value that has always made it a great \ncountry--a country of fairness. Everyone must share the prosperity as \nwell as the responsibility, and every person and every corporation must \nplay by the same rules. That value encouraged three decades of growth \nafter World War II, and it can make America grow again.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to make this vision of fairness a reality.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S82-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S82]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to briefly discuss a trip I took \nrecently to a country that for much of the past 50 years has ranked \namong the world's most isolated and oppressed by its own government. \nMany of us wondered if things would ever change in Burma, but after my \nrecent visit I am pleased to say that change is clearly in the air. It \nappears that Burma has made some progress toward democracy in the past \n6 months--made more than it has in the last decade. As one who has \ntaken a strong interest in Burma for over 20 years and as the lead \nauthor in this Chamber of an annual sanctions bill aimed at encouraging \nthe Burmese Government to reform, I can tell you this is welcome news.\n  On this trip I had the opportunity and privilege to meet with a woman \nwho for over two decades has embodied the struggle for peace in her \noppressed country. After Aung San Suu Kyi's political party won 80 \npercent of the vote in a free and fair election back in 1995, the \nBurmese military regime dismissed the results and kept her under house \narrest for the last 22 years--most of the time for the last 22 years \nconfined at home. Scores of other political reformers during that \nperiod were jailed or tortured, and the regime waged a brutal campaign \nagainst ethnic minorities, driving many of them out of their homes and \ninto refugee camps. But by her courage and her patience that justice \ndelayed would not be justice denied, Aung San Suu Kyi has kept the hope \nof freedom in her country alive. I have long admired her from afar. She \nonce took a great risk to smuggle out of Burma a letter thanking me for \nmy support, a letter I have proudly kept to this day. But never did I \nthink I would get to meet the Nobel laureate in person. It was quite a \nmoment.\n  Following an election in 2010 that was widely thought to be unfree \nand unfair, the new civilian government in Burma, to the surprise of \nmany of us, has made undeniably positive steps toward reform. In \naddition to releasing Suu Kyi from house arrest, scores of other \npolitical prisoners have been freed. During my visit last week, I spoke \nwith two who had just been released days before my arrival.\n  One of the longest standing armed conflicts in the world--the Burmese \nGovernment's campaign against the ethnic minority called the Karen--has \napparently been brought to a close. Many Karen people who fled Burma \nnow call Kentucky home. I had the chance to meet with many of them and \nother refugees from Burma, now resettled in Kentucky, at Louisville's \nCrescent Hill Baptist Church this past Saturday. I enjoyed meeting with \nthose folks and was pleased to relay to them the same message I share \nwith my colleagues today that change is indeed in the air in their \ncountry.\n  Because of all of these positive developments, I applaud Secretary \nClinton's recent decision to exchange ambassadors with Burma for the \nfirst time in 20 years. Of course, the Government of Burma still has a \nsubstantial way to go\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\nto achieve real and lasting reform. I would not support and I do not \nthink the administration would support lifting the sanctions that have \nbeen imposed unless there is much further progress.\n  The next steps will be elections to fill 48 seats of the national \nparliament on April 1. Suu Kyi intends to run as the representative of \nthe district with a significant Karen population. This election will \ngive the new government an opportunity to hold the first free and fair \nelections in Burma since 1990. It also demonstrates the seriousness of \nits recent reform efforts. The government must also fully and \npeacefully reconcile with Burma's ethnic minorities. This is vital. \nReports indicate that the military continues to engage in hostilities \nwith the Kachin. That is certainly troubling. And questions about \nBurma's relationship with North Korea must be answered.\n  As the new government enacts reforms, we should respond with \nmeaningful gestures of our own in the hopes of encouraging further \npositive developments from Burma's leaders. Reformers such as new \nPresident Thein Sein, whom I also met on my trip, are strengthened when \nthey can show positive results. Steps such as exchanging ambassadors \nwith the United States would enable them to do just that.\n  My trip to Burma has filled me with hope for its people, hope that \nthey will one day be free to elect their own leaders and hope that \nevery person regardless of the ethnic group can enjoy equal rights and \nfull protection under the rule of law. It also reaffirmed for me that \nthe desire to be free is absolutely universal and that the patient yet \npersistent leadership of one woman can make a tremendous difference.\n  These are indeed exciting times for all who care about the future of \nthe people of Burma. I know that includes a great many of my colleagues \nhere in the Senate. Burma has quite a long way to go, but it is \ncertainly moving in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S83-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S83]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEBT CEILING INCREASE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a few weeks ago President Obama asked \nCongress to raise the Nation's debt ceiling. Today virtually every \nRepublican in the Senate will oppose that request. Washington needs to \nstart spending less than it takes in, and our future will be uncertain \nand our economy in danger as long as the President fails to lead on \nthis crucial issue.\n  President Obama's record on the issue is absolutely clear. On the day \nhe took office, the Nation's debt stood at $10.6 trillion. Today it is \n$15.2 trillion. More spending, more debt, fewer jobs--that is what we \nhave gotten from this administration, and now they want to make it \nworse. But we should be working together to lower the debt, not having \nvotes to increase it.\n  The President must be willing to face this crisis head-on. He must be \nwilling to acknowledge how serious this issue is. Most Americans \nunderstand that we cannot keep spending money we do not have on \nprograms we do not need. Unfortunately, the President does not seem to \nbe one of those Americans. He has no plan to get this crisis under \ncontrol, and he continues to act as if it really is not a priority. Has \nhe noticed how that is working out for Europe?\n  Americans are worried and they are frustrated. Middle-class families \nare doing without. Why can't Washington? Well, we believe it can. So \ntoday Republicans will send a simple message to the White House: No \nmore blank checks. Democrats have been in charge of the Senate and the \nWhite House for 3 years. They have had the time they need to figure \nthis out. They have chosen the path of blame instead. They have had \ntheir chance. They have made it worse. We must do better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S83-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S83]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 98.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the joint \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 294, H.J. Res. 98, \n     relating to the disapproval of the President's exercise of \n     authority to increase the debt limit, as submitted under \n     section 3101A of Title 31, United States Code, on January 12, \n     2012.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil noon will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees for debate on the motion to proceed.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin once said, ``Promises \nmay fit the friends, but nonperformance will turn them into enemies.'' \nWe should be clear about what the debt limit means and what it does \nnot. Raising the debt limit does not authorize new spending. Let me \nmake that clear. Raising the debt limit does not authorize new \nspending. It does not mean an increase in future spending.\n  What does it mean? It simply means the United States will be able to \nmeet its obligations. Increasing the debt limit only permits the \nTreasury Department to pay the bills we have already incurred. It does \nnot authorize new spending. It permits the government to pay the bills \nthat have already been incurred. They have been incurred. We owe the \nobligation. It says: OK, we owe that. It is in the law, passed. It is \nhistory. We have to pay the bills. It allows our country to meet our \npromises to our citizens, and it means there is money to provide the \nbenefits to millions of seniors and veterans whose families depend on \nthem every day to make their ends meet.\n  We should remember why we are taking today's vote. Last August, \nCongress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011. We all remember it. \nThis legislation reduced spending by $2.1 trillion. That was a budget \naction taken by the President and the Congress together that reduced \nFederal spending by $2.1 trillion. It is a reduction. That is not \ncommonly understood, not widely known, but that is the fact. And it \nprovided a plan to raise the debt limit by the same amount. It did so \nso that the Federal Government could meet its financial obligations so \nwe could keep our promises.\n  Today's vote would reverse that agreement in August. Voting to \ndisapprove an increase in the financial limit is unreasonable. It would \nbe very much like your bank increasing your line of credit unless you \ntell them not to. Nonetheless, that is the issue we are voting on and \ndebating in the Senate.\n  Passing this resolution would mean there would be no money to keep \nour promises. The United States would default for the first time in its \nhistory. It would send a message to the world that the United States \ndoes not keep its promises. With all of the uncertainty in the world, \nespecially in Europe, that could have disastrous consequences. It could \nbe a contagion. There could be a reaction, a debt spiral in the wrong \ndirection, an interaction between the two--the United States defaulting \non its debt and Europe--some countries defaulting on theirs, perhaps \nGreece.\n  This is clearly the wrong time to take an action that would leave the \nUnited States to be placed in default. There would be disastrous \nconsequences for our economy alone, irrespective of the repercussions \nand reverberations around the world, especially Europe. Our gross \ndomestic product would shrink by as much as 1 percent and more than \n$150 billion. We would be defaulting. That default would compromise our \ncredit rating. What would happen if our credit rating was in jeopardy? \nIt would cause interest rates to skyrocket. Just think what would \nhappen if the United States, as we are struggling to slowly get our \neconomy going, was faced with a big spike in interest rates. That would \nstop the recovery dead in its tracks. It would do more than that. It \nwould probably plunge us back into recession. That is what would \nhappen. Yearly prices for food, gas, and utilities would increase by \nhundreds of dollars for American citizens. Americans could lose \nthousands in retirement savings; that is, if we default and interest \nrates have to go up so much as a consequence of default.\n  We have to act so investors would want to invest in the United \nStates. If\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\nwe default, U.S. businesses would not be able to meet payroll much less \nexpand. Millions of Americans would not be paid. Millions more would \nlose their jobs. We are trying to get the unemployment rate down. This \nwould cause it to go up dramatically. Default would cause it to go up. \nIf this passes, that would mean the United States would be in default \nand jobs would be harder to find and unemployment would rise. Americans \nwould be unable to access credit to buy a home, a car, or take out \nloans for college. The housing market would plummet again. The economy \nwould fall into another recession or even a depression.\n  At a time when our economy is starting to show signs of recovery, now \nis exactly the wrong time to risk a contraction. American workers, \nfamilies, and small businesses cannot afford that, to say the least. If \ntoday's vote succeeds and causes a default, the Federal Government \nwould not have funds to pay troop salaries.\n  What about SEAL Team 6 who took on Osama bin Laden? We read about \nthem in the last couple of days rescuing an American out of Somalia. \nThere would not be a SEAL Team 6, let alone the other troops that would \nnot be paid. Social Security benefits would not be paid. Just think of \nthat. Medicare bills would not be paid. Think of that.\n  These programs would all be in danger if we were to default, and a \npositive vote here would cause default. We are voting on a motion to \ndisapprove. That would hurt the families and seniors who rely on these \nprograms I just mentioned.\n  We need to do all we can to help these families make ends meet, not \nput their jobs and paychecks in danger. There is no doubt that we need \nto work together to reduce the deficit. Everybody agrees on that. We \nneed to work together to get it done. Clearly, we need to make changes \nto both revenue and the spending sides of the budget. That is clear.\n  We need to do so in a way that doesn't put jobs and economic growth \nat risk. We need to do it, obviously, in a fair and balanced way. That \nis why the people in our States sent us here.\n  As we do that, we can't refuse to meet our country's obligations. \nThere have been many efforts to reduce the budget deficit, whether it \nwas the Biden deficit commission, the so-called supercommittee, and the \nmany budget proposals we talked about--Bowles-Simpson and Rivlin-\nDomenici--and we are getting closer and closer and we are going to get \nthe job done.\n  As we work on that, again, we cannot refuse to meet our country's \nobligations, and we have to make sure we pay the bills we have already \nincurred. We need to show the world the United States keeps its \npromises. We have to show people we live up to our word.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep our promises and to vote no on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to express my disapproval of the \nPresident's request of a debt limit increase of $1.2 trillion, which \nwould place the total limit just below $16.4 trillion.\n  The requested increase amounts to nearly $4,000 of additional debt \nfor every American man, woman, and child; and the total debt limit \nbeing requested works out to over $50,000 per person. This would be a \nterrible burden to impose on our children.\n  For many in Washington, including this President, this debt limit \nincrease is just a matter-of-fact necessity. Watching the mainstream \nmedia, many Americans might be surprised to even know that it was set \nto happen. But this is no small matter. This is not an inconsequential \nincrease in the limit on Federal spending.\n  Federal spending is already out of control, and we all know it. Our \ntotal debt is already greater than the size of our entire economy. I \nwill repeat that: Our total debt is greater than the size of our entire \neconomy. The debt ceiling increase being requested amounts to nearly 8 \npercent of our entire gross domestic product, or GDP, and the total \ndebt limit being requested amounts to over 108 percent of GDP. That \nwould place us in worse shape than many of the eurozone countries \ncurrently confronting their devastating fiscal crisis.\n  Given the recent experience in Europe, it is disconcerting to hear \nrepeated calls by the grow-government-at-all-costs crowd to double down \non failed government initiatives to stimulate the economy by borrowing \neven more. Rates are cheap, they say, so let's continue riding this \ndebt bubble as far as we can.\n  We should have learned from the housing bubble and the European \nsovereign debt bubble that bubbles pop rapidly and with great \ndevastation. It was not long ago that the grow-government crowd was \nmocking concerns about indebtedness in the eurozone, taunting what they \ncalled ``bond vigilantes'' and saying that there was nothing there to \nsee. Interest rates will not go up. Don't worry. Rates are low, so \nborrow and spend.\n  We know how this story ends. It was not long ago that we saw the \nhousing market participants, lured in by the promise of an ever-bigger \n``McMansion,'' being told: Don't worry. Rates are low and housing \nprices never fall. The government backs your mortgage, so there is no \nrisk.\n  As outsized and highly speculative activity took place in the housing \nand financial sectors, Federal regulators ignored all warnings, failed \nto use their existing authority to promote safety and soundness and, \nfrankly, failed to do their jobs. To date, it is difficult, if not \nimpossible, to come up with a single name of a regulator who lost a \njob. In fact, many in the top slots got promotions. Meanwhile, \neverything bad that exists in the housing market and in mortgage \nfinance is blamed on the evils of private business. That is a great way \nto deflect regulatory failure, but a terrible way to get private \nactivity back into the housing arena.\n  The fact is, the housing bubble was caused by too much borrowing and \nthe folks who egged it on. The results were not pretty. Global \ninvestors struck against mortgage-backed securities issued in the \nUnited States, leading ultimately to a precipitous global strike on \nfinancial intermediation and massive government bailouts of financial \ninstitutions.\n\n  The experience with the housing bubble caused by mortgage debt is \nbeing replicated with the explosion of sovereign debt. The bond \nvigilantes did strike against profligate eurozone countries, and they \nprecipitously demanded higher and higher interest rates to protect \nlenders from risks of default. This effectively shut entire countries \nout of the debt market. Entire countries face an inability to borrow at \nrates they can sustain. Absent an ability to roll over debt, those \ncountries have been forced quickly and violently into fiscal \nrestructuring, immediate austerity, and sometimes even partial default.\n  The President's most recent request to take on more debt follows the \nsame bubble pattern that we know will lead to devastation and losses. \nI, for one, don't wish for us to continue flirting with catastrophe by \nencouraging bubbles with the fools' gold that because rates are cheap \nwe should borrow more.\n  We are on the edge of the cliff, and it is time to carefully but \ndeliberately take a few steps back. Rates may be low today, but they \ncan turn on a dime. When they do, the outsized Federal Government we \ncurrently have will suddenly be exposed as unaffordable. When that day \ncomes, our creditors can go on strike as quickly as they have in \nEurope.\n  Last summer we got a taste of what is to come when we received the \nfirst downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in history from a major credit \nrating agency. Americans can never be allowed to forget that this \ndowngrade occurred under, and because of, this administration's fiscal \nstewardship. We cannot risk what are likely to be further downgrades in \nthe near future by raising the debt limit.\n  It is time to resist the siren song of cheap credit and put our focus \nback on the job at hand, which is to allow the private sector to create \njobs and to get rid of the $1 trillion-plus deficits of the Obama \nPresidency, to get rid of our mountain of debt that surpasses the size \nof our entire economy, and to bring the size of our Federal Government \nback to its historical norms.\n  Federal outlays as a share of our entire economy averaged 18.6 \npercent over the past 40 years. Under the current administration, \nFederal outlays represent 25 percent of GDP in 2009, 23.8\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\npercent in 2010, and were estimated to have been 25.3 percent in 2011. \nThe current administration has engineered a Federal Government where \noutlays represent 25 percent--one-quarter--of our entire economy. The \nlast time Federal spending represented such a large share of our \neconomy was back in 1946 as the world began rebuilding after the \nravages of World War II.\n  I guess this is what one of my colleagues meant when he said the \nother day that America is in good shape. Economic and job growth remain \nweak, but Washington and the government jobs it funds is doing just \nfine.\n  The administration likes to talk about economic fairness--about the \nhaves and have-nots. But ultimately the people in the best shape in \nthis economy are those who owe their livelihoods to the Federal \nGovernment and Federal taxpayers. When the 99 percent are being taxed \nto fund and fuel an ever-growing Washington bureaucracy, we have what \nthe President might call economic justice.\n  There is no end in sight. After Federal spending spiked in World War \nII as the entire Nation mobilized to defeat the axis powers, it quickly \nratcheted down, with Federal spending averaging 16.5 percent of GDP in \nthe 10 years that followed. Yet with President Obama, the ratchet only \nmoved in one direction, up.\n  Equally of interest is the behavior of Federal spending relative to \nthe size of the economy in those Clinton years, which many look back on \nas the golden age of fiscal correctness. While Democrats focus solely \non the existence of budgetary bliss despite higher tax rates under \nClinton, they typically fail to mention how the budgetary bliss was \ngenerated. It is difficult to deny the facts, which include a reduction \nin Federal outlays relative to GDP from 21.4 percent in 1993 to 18.2 \npercent by 2001, a 3.2-percentage point reduction.\n  During those years government receipts relative to GDP did rise from \n17.5 percent to 19.5 percent, a 2.0-percentage point increase. But it \nis impossible to deny that the budget bliss was largely generated by \nreducing the share of the economy accounted for by Federal spending. Of \ncourse, my friends on other side of the aisle pledge allegiance to tax-\nand-spend economics. They wish to maintain a Federal Government where \nspending amounts to one-quarter of the size of the entire economy. To \nthem, Federal spending and big government are not problems; they are \nvirtues from which good things trickle down from government to \npreferred classes of people.\n  They decry that a deep recession has caused government receipts as a \nshare of GDP to fall below 15 percent and argue in panic that the \ndecline is proof that taxes must be raised, while refusing to \nacknowledge that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects \nthat revenues as a share of GDP will rise with economic recovery. \nFederal revenues have averaged 18 percent of GDP over the past 40 \nyears. They are projected by our Congressional Budget Office to reach \nnearly 19 percent of GDP in 2013, 21 percent in 2021, and 23 percent by \n2035 under current law. That is what they say.\n  Even under the CBO's so-called alternative fiscal scenario, CBO puts \nrevenues as a share of GDP at around 18.4 percent, higher than the \nlong-run average. Congress and the President should focus on the things \nthey are capable of controlling.\n  Mr. President, Federal revenues come from the economy, and as the \neconomy recovers, CBO expects revenues to recover and rise above \nhistorical norms relative to the size of the economy. The President and \nhis allies are putting the cart before the horse. They want to increase \nrevenues by raising taxes. But the real way to increase revenues is to \npromote economic growth.\n  Federal spending is something that Congress and the President have \nfull control over, however. Every Federal dollar spent counts because \nCongress and the President decide to spend it. Our deficits and debt \nare on an unsustainable path because of unsustainable spending. Yet \nwith this debt limit increase, the President and his allies are \nconfirming they are comfortable with our government consuming an ever-\nincreasing share of the economy.\n  The President has made clear before that in the name of class warfare \nhe is comfortable raising taxes regardless of whether those tax hikes \ngenerate revenues or decrease deficits and debt. With his latest \nproposal to tax the so-called rich, he has shown again he is willing to \nignore the fact--the clear fact--we have a spending problem not a \nrevenue problem.\n  To tackle our spending problem, unsustainable government promises \nembedded in entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social \nSecurity must be reformed. There is no budget analyst on this planet \nwho does not identify entitlement reform as key to getting the Federal \nbudget back on track. Yet over the 3 years of the Obama Presidency, \nthere has been no plan--no plan from the administration--to deal with \nentitlements.\n  The entitlement can is simply being kicked down the road, and to \ndeflect attention from our real fiscal challenges my friends on the \nother side of the aisle resort to the politics of division. Tax the \nevil banks and all will be equal, just, and fair, they suggest. Tax \nmillionaires and billionaires no matter whether they are fat cats on \nyachts or small business owners and all will be equal, just, and fair, \nthey suggest.\n  The politics of division bears no fruit. It is an economic dead end. \nYet it is elevated to the top of the President's agenda to divert \nattention from our bloated Federal Government. The taxes on the so-\ncalled rich or on evil financial institutions or evil energy producers \nor evil insurance providers have been promoted in the interest of \nfairness and equality.\n  Reducing income and wealth inequality is a laudable goal. Yet my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have not--and I repeat, have \nnot--proposed new tax measures to generate greater income equality \nthrough the Tax Code. The numerous permanent surtaxes on the so-called \nrich or on energy producers or on financial institutions have not been \noffered with corresponding permanent reductions in taxes for others \nwith lesser means. Rather, they have been offered to promote more \ngovernment spending and a permanently larger government. They are \npermanent tax hikes used to pay for temporary stimulus or taxes on \nbusiness to fuel more spending or bailouts or government jobs.\n  Of course, no mention is made of what effect those taxes have on \nbusinesses or private sector job creation. No mention is made about the \neffect those taxes have on the returns on retirement portfolios of \nseniors, which contain stocks and bonds of the vilified banks and \nenergy producers and insurance companies. The message to retired \nseniors in Sandy, UT, is clear: You have been suffering for years \nthrough near-zero returns on bonds because of Federal Reserve policy. \nBut now you will just have to take it on the chin when the value of \nyour pensions fall because the Federal Government needs to tax business \nto get more revenue for union construction jobs or stimulus or for \nbailouts of mortgages of speculative housing investors.\n  Mr. President, my friends on the other side of the aisle say they \nwant more equality and more jobs but do not offer tax proposals that \nwould generate more equality through the Tax Code or a better \nenvironment for job creation. Instead, they want to tax the so-called \nrich to get money for things such as high-paid infrastructure \ncontractors while fighting tooth and nail on behalf of their union \nconstituencies to retain and even expand Davis-Bacon and Contract \nService Act coverage, which we know costs taxpayers money and stifles \njob creation. These kinds of schemes have nothing to do with equality. \nThey have nothing to do with promoting as much job creation as \npossible. They have everything to do with the politics of division and \nwith cronyism.\n  In the recent flurry of tax-the-rich surcharges offered by the other \nside, each corresponding spending idea has been clearly directed to \nappease Democratic constituencies--mostly unions, again--and to build \nup campaign season talking points that say the only thing standing in \nthe way of Democrats' do-goodery is Republican refusal to tax some \neasily demonized group. This might make for good politics, but it is no \nway to formulate fiscal policy, and it is no way to run a country.\n  At first, to pay for a massive new stimulus plan of the President, \nthe Democrats wanted to limit deductions for people earning $200,000 or \nmore, which in September of last year was\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\nevidently how Democrats defined who was rich. Next came a proposed \nsurtax of 5.6 percent on people earning $1 million or more to pay for \nthe President's stimulus scheme. I am guessing the earlier definition \nof ``rich'' at $200,000 did not sit too well--or poll too well--with \nDemocrats in high-income jurisdictions, in places such as New York and \nCalifornia.\n  Next came a surtax of 0.5 percent on those earners to give funds to \nStates to help pay mostly union workers.\n  Next came a surtax of 0.7 percent on those earners to help pay for a \nnew Fannie-and-Freddie-like, government-sponsored enterprise called the \ninfrastructure bank.\n  Next came a permanent surtax of 3.25 percent on those earners for \nwhat was billed as a temporary payroll tax preference which, \nironically, gives more to richer earners than it does to poorer earners \nand gives nothing at all to the unemployed.\n  Next came a long-term surtax of 1.9 percent on richer earners, again \nfor the allegedly temporary payroll tax preference.\n  Mr. President, the pattern is clear. Democrats settle on their \nstimulus spending plan of the week, find out how much it will cost, and \nthen find out what surtax to slap on high earners, including business \nincome recipients. That is how we get tax proposals with rates of 5.6 \npercent, then 0.5 percent, then 0.7 percent, then 3.25 percent, then \n1.9 percent, and who knows what is going to come next. Never mind that \nbusinesses across this country have been clear that massive uncertainty \nfrom the current administration's policies and proposals is holding \nback hiring, job creation, and the economy.\n\n  Given the past few months of tax rate roulette being played by the \nDemocrats, is it any wonder families and businesses lack the confidence \nto take risks, make significant purchases and grow the economy?\n  And never mind that the Joint Committee on Taxation has told us \napproximately 34 percent of flow-through business income, which tends \nto be small business income, would be subject to Democratic surtax \nproposals. My friends on the other side of the aisle ask us not to mind \nthe effect on job creators, even as the economy faces massive \njoblessness.\n  If we abide by the recommendations of the editors of the New York \nTimes, who are in lockstep with the Democratic Party, we should not \ncare about more taxes on businesses. Indeed, in a December 9 editorial \nlast year, those tax policy experts told us:\n\n       For any savvy business owner, a surtax would have no \n     bearing on hiring decisions. If new workers are profitable \n     before tax, they will be profitable after tax, even if the \n     employer has to pay slightly more of the profit in taxes.\n\n  This view perfectly encapsulates the understanding of the economy \nheld by those who have never created a private sector job or worked to \nturn a profit. By this view, these rich business owners would not even \nflinch if we increases taxes. After-tax profitability of hiring does \nnot matter evidently, especially when we view business earners as those \nevil rich.\n  Mr. President, I know in certain circles it is fashionable to vilify \nbusiness and hold the profit motive as the root cause of mega-wealth. \nBut the notion that business decisions, including hiring, will not be \naffected in the least by higher taxes is truly bizarre.\n  The ongoing vilification of private businesses in America is \nshameful. Hard-working Americans who are by no definition rich, but who \nwork in mortgage markets and real estate markets and securitization \nmarkets and energy production markets and in financial markets, have \nbeen hit with a blanket indictment from this administration that they \nare wrongdoers.\n  Of course, if they do wrong they need to go to jail. But my \nexperience with the American people is, by and large, they play by the \nrules, seek to offer useful products to their buyers, and look only for \nfair rewards for their efforts. They do not deserve to be vilified by \nthe President and painted as purveyors of tricks and traps to abuse \ntheir neighbors in order to buy yachts.\n  Again, anyone who breaks a law should go to jail. Any Federal \nregulator who fails to do their job should be fired. But the vast \nmajority of Americans who operate and work hard and honestly in \nbusiness should not be shamed for their work. It would be far more \nappropriate to shame lawmakers who set tricks and traps in the Tax Code \nin order to get more money for the Federal Government to spend while \nfalsely selling their schemes as paths toward equality.\n  While President Obama seeks to take attention away from his \nhistorically record-high deficits and Federal spending that accounts \nfor 25 percent of the economy and his jobs deficit and his \ncongressional relations deficit by identifying some sort of ``trust \ndeficit'' he has with financial institutions, it is imperative that he \nand Democrats in Congress do not spend the rest of this year playing \nelection-year politics. People need jobs, and the Nation cannot afford \nto wait for the President and Democrats to get past November.\n  We need to stop the tsunami of job-crushing regulations and the \nrunaway regulatory agencies which continually stretch their authority \nin order to intervene into the economy and crush job creation. We need \nto reduce the time needed for private sector projects to clear the \nforest of regulatory and permitting redtape. We need to proceed \nimmediately with known shovel-ready, job-creating, and environmentally \nsafe projects such as the Keystone Pipeline. Despite having cleared \nyears of reviews and oversight and despite support from virtually all \ninterests--including unions but excluding radical environmentalists--it \nis inconsistent for the President to say he cares about American jobs \nwhile he prevents them from being created by approving the pipeline.\n  While the President needs to approve the Keystone Pipeline, I wish to \nagain express my disapproval of the administration's Federal spending \npipeline.\n  For 3 years, the administration has lacked any serious and coherent \nbudget plan. The administration has refused to deal seriously, if at \nall, with tackling unsustainable entitlement spending. It wishes to \ncontinue to practice the politics of division in order to permanently \nenshrine a European-sized Federal Government that absorbs over one-\nfourth of the entire size of our economy.\n  Americans do not want this oversized government. Americans do not \nwant or need job-stifling tax hikes. Americans do not need the Federal \nGovernment running their lives and making their choices. Allowing the \ndebt limit to rise would only serve to promote things that Americans do \nnot want and that Americans do not need.\n  Therefore, I disapprove of the President's request for a $1.2 \ntrillion increase in the debt limit which would place the total limit \nat nearly $16.4 trillion, and I urge my colleagues to similarly \ndisapprove.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the Senator from \nIowa for allowing me to move in front of him; and I ask unanimous \nconsent that at the conclusion of my remarks he be recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I speak \nimmediately following the Senator from Iowa.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say to Senator Hatch and his \nremarks, there has never been anyone I can recall who has been so \nrelentless in trying to stop all this deficit spending whom I \nassociated with and served with in the Senate.\n  One month ago we were standing here trying to pass a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution and Senator Hatch was right in the middle \nproviding leadership. We wanted that to be a reality.\n  My activity with the balanced budget amendment goes all the way back \nto the 1970s, when then-Senator Carl Curtis was trying to preratify an \namendment to the Constitution. I was a State Senator at that time, and \nwe were the first State to preratify the Constitution. So we know it \nhas been a real up-hill battle. It has been very difficult.\n  I think it is important, though, and one thing that hasn't been said \nin this debate is why we have this deficit and why we have this debt. \nIt is important\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nfor people to understand, and I know most people don't. But to overly \nsimplify it a little bit: The debt is the responsibility of the \nPresident. It is not the Republicans, it is not the Democrats, it is \nnot the House, it is not the Senate; it is the President who puts \ntogether a budget every year.\n  We have a President who put together his first budget, and the Obama \nfirst budget had a deficit of $1 trillion; the second budget he had in \n2011 was $1.3 trillion; then, last year, his budget deficit was $1.1 \ntrillion. But if you stop and think about what has happened in the \npast, that 2011 deficit was going to be much more than that because \nthey have now upgraded that to $1.65 trillion. So we are talking about \na President who is going to have in excess of $5 trillion in deficit, \nin the 4 years he has been in office, by his own budgets.\n  I remember back in 1996, when President Clinton came out with the \nfirst $1.65 trillion budget and I was outraged that we couldn't sustain \nthat kind of spending. Yet that was to run the entire country of the \nUnited States of America, and this is just the deficit alone.\n  So it is estimated the President will have presided over $14 trillion \nin spending by the end of the year. By then, our national debt will be \nover $16.3 trillion, making this President accountable for increasing \nthe national debt by about $6 trillion.\n  That is more debt than all Presidents, from George Washington to \nGeorge W. Bush, combined--one President, in a 4-year period.\n  Over the last couple years, the President has been warned and warned \nand warned that we have to do something about it. He has ignored these \nwarnings and instead went after the single largest contributor to the \ndeficit and to debt that this government is having; that is, \ngovernment-sponsored health care. He did this with the passage of \nObamaCare, a bill he talked about was going to be fiscally responsible. \nIn reality, the bill will increase the Federal expenditures by $2.5 \ntrillion in the first 10 years following the law's full implementation. \nAfter that, it will only skyrocket.\n  Their own estimate on ObamaCare is, after the first 10 years, it will \ngo up $4.4 trillion in addition to the $2.5 trillion.\n  We are talking about trillions, and every time I hear a projected \ncost, I know it is going to be a lot more than that. I recall back in \n1967, when the House Ways and Means Committee projected what Medicare \nwas going to cost. Medicare was put in, in 1966, and they said by 1990 \nMedicare was going to cost $12 billion. Guess what happened. In 1990, \nit wasn't $12 billion; it was $110 billion--10 times more than what \nthey were expecting. So I know this is going to cost a lot more than \nthe $4.4 trillion they are projecting after the first 10 years.\n  The President convened groups, gangs, commissions to figure out, Why \nis our Nation going so far in debt? We are going in debt because we \nhave a President whose budget reflects over $1 trillion of deficit each \nyear, and that is for four budgets. They talk about forming those \ncommissions; they come out with recommendations. Some of the \nrecommendations, by the way, were good, but the President rejected all \nthose recommendations. In fact, I would say the only cuts he is willing \nto go along with are cuts that are in our national security spending. \nHe has decimated our military, and right now we are looking at a \nreorganization that is going to be an even more difficult situation to \nrecover from after this President is gone.\n\n  By the way, when the President says he inherited deficits, it is \ninteresting that when President Bush went into office, he took over a \nmilitary that had been cut down during the Clinton administration by \nabout 40 percent. That was back during the euphoric chant that the Cold \nWar is over and so we don't need to have a military anymore, and so \nthey did that. Right after that, of course, we know 9/11 came. So \nPresident George W. Bush did have deficits. His deficits averaged $240 \nbillion a year for 8 years. Add that and it is $2 trillion. But this \nPresident, in 4 years, will have done nearly $6 trillion--three times \nas much as President George W. Bush did in 8 years.\n  So we still have the problems. Unemployment is ticking around 8.5 \npercent, the labor market is very weak, the regulatory train wreck, and \nthe regulations right now. People have talked an awful lot about the \ndeficit spending. That is what we are talking about this morning. I \ndon't want to confuse this issue, but I wish to tell you the \noverregulations we are having--here we have a President who is now \ntrying to invoke a cap-and-trade through regulation that he was not \nable to do through legislation. There is another cost that would be \nsomewhere in excess of $300 billion, not once but every year. So the \nregulations, the train wreck is on its way. It is alive and well, and \nwe have to do everything we can to try to stop it.\n  So they came up with a deal. They said: Let's put together something \nwhere, over a period of 10 years, we are going to try to come up with \n$1.5 trillion. Keep in mind, that is over 10 years when this President \ndoes that much in deficit each year.\n  So the first phase of this grand program they had was to increase the \ndebt limit by $900 billion to the current level of $15.2 trillion. It \nwas matched by discretionary spending cuts--or it was supposed to be--\nin the same amount. Then the supercommittee went to work to find $1.5 \ntrillion. Keep in mind, we are supposed to have $1.5 trillion to reduce \nas a justification for increasing the debt limit, which we did before, \nand that was over a period of one decade. So they are trying to find \n$1.5 trillion over 10 years that this President has been accountable \nfor increasing the deficit, the same amount, every year--or what will \nbe every year--for the 4-year period. But because we all know it \nfailed, we are facing additional automatic spending cuts of $1.2 \ntrillion. In exchange for this, the President is going to be allowed to \nincrease the debt limit by $1.2 trillion to a staggering level of $16.4 \ntrillion.\n  That is a lot of money, and it is hard for people to understand. I \nthink the best way to explain it is, what he is doing is he is \nadministering an increase in the debt of more than this country has \nsustained since the country's beginning.\n  In the President's first State of the Union Message, he promised to \ncut Federal deficits in half by the end of the first term, but we know \nwhat happened.\n  Before we agree to an increase in the debt limit, I think they are \ngoing to have to have some kind of reforms that actually reduce \nspending to levels that can put our Nation in a fiscally sound \nposition.\n  If we are serious about this and want to do something about the debt, \nwant to do something about the deficit, do you know how we can do it? \nIt would be very simple. All we would have to do is repeal ObamaCare. \nThat is all we would have to do. As already mentioned, the law is a \nfiscal nightmare, and it hasn't started yet. But as things stand, our \n$15 trillion debt is weighing us down, and now the President wants the \nauthority to add another $1.2 trillion to it. We can't allow this to \nhappen.\n  I know the President thinks he has us over a barrel. What he has done \nnow three times in a row, and he is planning to do it again, is say: If \nyou don't do something about increasing the debt limit, we are going \ninto default. He talks about the horrible results that are going to \nhappen. But when would that end if we don't have any sincere effort to \nstop the spending of the Obama administration?\n  Here is the last chance we have--the first chance we have is this \nresolution of disapproval that will be voted on. If we can do this, \nthen that is going to shock the President into knowing he has to be \nfiscally conservative. I am not speaking on my behalf. I am speaking on \nbehalf of my 20 kids and grandkids who are going to have to pay for all \nthis fun we are having.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                          Recess Appointments\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, I wish to respond to some of the shrill \nrhetoric and outright misinformation regarding President Obama's recent \nrecess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board and to the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  When all the political grandstanding is done, at the heart of this \ndispute is the ability of these two agencies to carry out their \ncongressionally mandated functions. One is charged with\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\ndefending the rights of consumers and the other defending the rights of \nworkers.\n  Republican partisan obstruction and filibusters prevented \nconfirmation of nominees to lead both these agencies, which would have \nprevented their legal authority to act. With the rights of millions of \nAmerican workers and consumers on the line, the President did what was \nhis duty to preserve the functioning of two critically important \nagencies--agencies that are essential cornerstones of our efforts to \nrebuild and restore our struggling middle class.\n  At a time when our Nation is engaged in serious soul-searching about \nthe demise of the middle class, the missions of the Consumer Bureau and \nthe Labor Board have become particularly essential. These agencies are \ntasked with the vital responsibility of standing for consumers and \nworkers against Wall Street and powerful corporations.\n  Indeed, the true significance of the debate over the President's \nrecess appointments is not about legislative or secure power or the \nmeaning of a pro forma session, but the true significance is about \nwhether we will let the powerful and well connected use the political \nprocess to rig the system or if, instead, we will enact and enforce \nlaws that will give workers and consumers a fighting chance at a decent \nmiddle-class life.\n  As a centerpiece of the Dodd-Frank bill to rein in the recklessness \non Wall Street, the idea behind the Consumer Bureau is simple. We need \na cop on the beat, looking out for the best interests of consumers who \nuse financial products, as we have regulators looking out for the \nfinancial health of banks, as we have a Food and Drug Administration, \nthe FDA, looking out for the safety of food and drugs for consumers or \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission that looks out for and protects \nour kids from harmful toys.\n  A strong Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will ensure that \nconsumers are not lured into debt through hidden fees. It will simplify \ndisclosures and reduce paperwork so consumers are not faced with \nmountains of paperwork they cannot understand. It would oversee \nproviders of consumer credit such as payday lenders--which for years \nhave acted similar to banks but without facing any kind of bank \nregulation.\n  Additionally, as student debt surpasses credit card debt as the \nlargest source of consumer debt in America, the Bureau can play a \ncritical role in helping families better understand the increasing \nchallenges of financing a college education as well as bringing some \nsanity to the private student loan marketplace.\n  Despite these laudable goals, Republicans refused to confirm Richard \nCordray, the President's nominee to lead the agency, unless the \nPresident would agree to water down the law and weaken consumer \nprotections. Forty-four Republican Senators served notice they would \nnot confirm anyone to the position of Director unless structural \nchanges were made to the Bureau that would effectively gut its ability \nto stand for consumers. When the President refused, they filibustered \nand prevented an up-or-down vote on this nomination, leaving the \nconsumer bureau unable to fully interpret and enforce the law.\n  As a consequence, Americans across the country were left in limbo, \nwith limited ability to stand up to big banks and financial scam \nartists. Leaving the Bureau so powerless was unacceptable, so the \nPresident had no choice but to use his constitutional authority to \nensure that this critical agency can continue to perform its \nlegislatively mandated mission.\n  The ramifications of Republican obstruction were even more dire at \nthe National Labor Relations Board, where the impending loss of a \nquorum of members meant the Board would become totally inoperable if \nthe President did not step in to fill the vacancies. Similar to the \nconsumer bureau, the NLRB, as it is known, is a government agency \ntasked with standing up for working families. In its very text, the \nvery text of the law that created the Board, it established that the \npolicy of the United States is to encourage the process of collective \nbargaining. Senator Robert Wagner of New York, the act's author in \n1935, explained that collective bargaining would increase the \npurchasing power of American workers and therefore aid our national \nrecovery from the Great Depression. This law was one of the \ncornerstones of a new American economic policy that created the largest \nmiddle class in history, gave rise to the economic boom that \ntransformed America and the world, and brought economic security and a \nbetter life to generations of Americans.\n  Unfortunately, not everyone agrees with this mission. Some very \npowerful interests think that a few at the very top should have a \nmonopoly power in our economy; that they should be able to set all the \nrules. These interests have lined up allies in Congress to wage a \nrelentless crusade against the National Labor Relations Board. In all \nmy years in public office, I have never seen anything like it.\n  Last year, Republicans in the House held at least eight hearings, \nspecifically addressing the NLRB. They passed two bills to amend the \nNational Labor Relations Act to strip workers of their rights. \nRepublican elected officials have tried to defund the agency. They have \nthreatened the professional credentials and livelihoods of nonpartisan \ncareer employees and even called on a Republican board member to \nresign, in order to incapacitate the agency. On the campaign trail, \nRepublican Presidential candidates have raged against the National \nLabor Relations Board and its employees.\n  What are the great crimes these dedicated public servants at the NLRB \nare supposed to have committed? First, they started a new initiative to \nmake sure workers are aware of their rights under law. In April of this \nyear, employers will have to post a notice about National Labor \nRelations Act rights on the office bulletin board, next to other \nlongstanding notices about the minimum wage, workplace safety, and \nother basic worker protections. This hardly seems to be an unreasonable \nburden.\n  Second, the NLRB prosecuted a case against a company that allegedly \nretaliated against its employees for going on strike. I spoke at length \nabout this case last year, on numerous occasions, on the floor of the \nSenate because there was so much misinformation about it. While the \ncase was brought against a powerful company and became very \ncontroversial as a result, prosecuting retaliation cases is \nunquestionably a necessary and important part of the NLRB's \nresponsibility. After all the fire and brimstone and all the threats \nfrom Republicans against this agency and the Governor of a certain \nState, as has happened in the past, this dispute was resolved by the \ncompany and the union. It has happened so many times in the past \nwithout us having to do a thing about it.\n  Third, the National Labor Relations Board enacted a rule to \nstandardize timelines for national elections. Under the act, after \nworkers petition for an election, the NLRB holds a hearing to decide \nwho should be in the bargaining unit and who should not be. In recent \nyears, many employers have started flooding that hearing with frivolous \nlitigation to stall the elections for months or even years, while \narguing or appealing over every minor detail their lawyers can imagine. \nThe NLRB decided to fix this problem and make sure workers get a vote \nin a reasonable period of time. The Board said workers should vote and \nthen, if necessary, the ballots would be sequestered while the \nlitigation drags on over certain peripheral issues. The new rules do \nnot encourage union organization and they do not discourage it; they \njust give workers the ability to say yes or no in a reasonable period \nof time. Workers should not have to wait until innumerable lawsuits, \none after the other, are disposed of before they even get a chance to \nvote.\n\n  In response to these eminently reasonable and fair proposals, \nRepublicans have attempted to shut the Board down by blocking all \nnominations. Senator Graham of South Carolina vowed publicly to block \nall nominees to the labor board, even if it meant the agency would \ncease to function. In his opinion, Senator Graham said, ``The NLRB as \ninoperable could be considered progress.'' To the thousands of American \nworkers every year who rely on the NLRB to enforce the law and defend \ntheir rights, that must sound pretty cold-blooded, a direct attack on \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  In practice, disabling the NLRB would mean American workers would\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\nhave nowhere to turn if their rights are violated. Thousands of \nAmerican workers are fired every year for trying to organize a union in \ntheir workplace--their legal right, by the way. With the labor board \nout of commission, these workers might never get their jobs back. If an \nemployer or a union refused to adhere to a contract, there would be no \nNLRB to resolve the dispute.\n  The labor board also ensures that unions do not step outside the law \nin their interactions with workers or employers. Those cases would be \nstuck in limbo too. Perhaps that is why a senior counsel to the \nNational Federation of Independent Business told the Congressional \nQuarterly that ``to have the Board totally shut down would be a \ntravesty.''\n  The President averted this travesty by appropriately exercising his \nrecess appointment authority. Indeed, the President showed restraint by \nonly appointing nominees to agencies that would lose their ability to \nfunction due to Republican obstruction. Acting to ensure the continued \nsmooth functioning of government under these circumstances is a \nPresident's--whether it is President Obama or any other President--\nconstitutional responsibility. As constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe \nhas explained, the Constitution considered the possibility that \ncongressional squabbles would lead to paralysis and determined:\n\n       The Constitution that has guided our Republic for centuries \n     is not blind to the threat of Congress's extending its \n     internal squabbles into a general paralysis of the entire \n     body politic, rendering vital regulatory agencies headless \n     and therefore impotent. Preserving the authority the \n     President needs to carry out his basic duties, rather than \n     deferring to partisan games and gimmicks, is our \n     Constitution's clear command.\n\n  Again, I say, if my colleagues do not like the National Labor \nRelations Act or Dodd-Frank, they can introduce a bill and try to get \nsupport to change the law. Of course, Republicans know such a bill \nwould fail miserably. Instead, they are trying to short-circuit the \nprocess laid out by the Constitution to pass legislation. Under their \ntheory, under the Republicans' theory, just 41 Senators could \neffectively repeal an existing law by simply denying an up-or-down vote \non the President's nominees. Think about that. We pass a law by \nmajority vote. It might even get through; of course, overriding a \nfilibuster with 60 votes. The President signed it into law. A couple \nyears later, the minority says we want to change it. We do not have the \nvotes to change it, but we can block a nominee, nominees to the agency, \nand effectively shut down the agency with only 41 Senators. That is \nwhat is going on here. That is what is going on.\n  President Obama took a bold but necessary step. Stepping in to \nprotect ordinary Americans from the consequences of congressional \ndysfunction is hardly an intrusion on Congress's authority. It is the \nessence of leadership.\n  I might point out I think facts will show that the last President \nbefore President Obama, President Bush, exercised his authority to \nappoint recess appointees 171 times. I think President Obama is right \nnow around 20 or 21, something like that.\n  Since President Obama was elected, Republicans have openly stated \ntheir No. 1 goal is not to govern or legislate; their No. 1 goal is to \nprevent the reelection of President Obama. Republicans in Congress may \nhave the luxury of playing these political games but any President does \nnot. Americans are counting on this President to do what is right for \nthe middle class and that is unquestionably what he did by making these \nrecess appointments to these two vital consumer protection agencies, \nthe Consumer Protection Agency and the National Labor Relations Board.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am going to speak about the debt \ndisapproval resolution that is before us because I feel so strongly it \nis time to send a strong message to the President and give the people \nof America some comfort that we are not going to continue to raise the \ndebt ceiling again and again without doing something that shows we \nunderstand the crisis we are in and that we are going to take the steps \nnecessary to whittle down our debt and do the responsible thing. \nHowever, I do want to respond to what has just been said about the \nrecess appointment of Mr. Cordray, the Director of the new consumer \nagency, which was done by the President when Congress was out of \nsession, depriving Congress of the ability to advise and consent to \nthis appointment.\n  I think to put it in the context where it is proper, it is very \nimportant to know that this consumer agency was created by a Democratic \nPresident who had complete Democratic control of Congress and gave this \nagency unprecedented power--unprecedented in that the agency has no \ncongressional oversight. None. We don't control the budget. In fact, no \none controls the budget of this new agency that was created with \ncomplete Democratic control of Congress and the Presidency.\n  This agency was created in the Dodd-Frank bill with no oversight by \nany entity whatsoever other than the Democratic President who signed \nthe bill that was given to him by the Democratically controlled \nCongress. So Mr. Cordray is now the head of an agency without \ncongressional approval, and Congress has no control over its budget, \nand we now have the possibility of a burgeoning new Federal bureaucracy \nthat is going to put more regulations on probably the most \noverregulated industry in America today, which is the banking industry.\n  If you talk to anybody out there trying to get capital in a small \nbusiness, they will tell you that the banks are being hamstrung. So now \nwe are going to give them more regulations that are going to put a \nfreeze on their capability to make consumer small loans. The banking \nindustry has plenty of regulation, and the Comptroller of the Currency \ndoes a good job. Certainly the FDIC has done its job in trying to make \nsure that the reserves are met for banks to be stable because we are \nnot going to be bailing out banks.\n  I heard the President of the United States talking at his State of \nthe Union Message. I heard him say: We are going to go through this \ngovernment, and we are going to cut back on regulations because we know \nregulations can hamper the ability of our small businesses to get up \nand get out there and hire people and make a profit. We think profit is \ngood because we think profit makes people able to hire more people and \nget this economy going.\n  So there is a constitutional issue at stake where the President just \ndecided that Congress was out of session and appointed Mr. Cordray. In \nany other instance, Congress would have some say because we would be \nable to set a budget for the agency and we would be able to curb some \nof its overreach if we feel that it is there; however, not this agency \nbecause there is no congressional oversight of this agency.\n  So we are in a position where we have Mr. Cordray--and let me say \nthere is nothing personal against Mr. Cordray, but there is a lot that \nis wrong with Mr. Cordray being appointed by the President rather than \nbeing confirmed by the Senate, which is in the law. There is a problem \nwhen there is no congressional oversight whatsoever that would be able \nto curb the overregulation that we suspect is going to happen in this \nagency.\n  This is not the end of this subject. Today we are going to be voting \non the increase in the debt limit by $1.2 trillion. What do we already \nhave on the books for debt? It is $15.2 trillion, which is a figure \nthat is now equal to or more than our gross domestic product. We are \nnot talking about Greece, we are talking about the United States of \nAmerica. We should be the beacon of economic stability in the world, \nand we are here to raise the debt limit without so much as a plan to \ncurb spending or to look at the entitlement reforms we know are \nnecessary because we cannot cut enough spending in the discretionary \naccounts to actually do what we must do to whittle down a $15 trillion \ndebt because the discretionary accounts are approximately 30 percent of \nthe total expenditures of our country.\n  The major responsibility this country has in defense is getting ready \nto be shredded by this administration, while we have a new consumer \nagency that has unfettered budgetary authority. Where is our \nperspective here? We are talking now about 30 percent of the budget \nthat we spend, the spending in our country, being discretionary \naccounts, and we are hearing today that the President is going to cut \nenormous numbers out of our defense budget, but\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\nat the same time we hear very little talk about entitlements, which are \nthe automatic expenditures we cannot control. If the President were to \nlead, he would be going into the entitlements and providing some \nsolutions and some leadership. The Republicans have said repeatedly: We \nwill work with you on entitlements because we know it is hard.\n  I have introduced legislation--along with Senator Kyl--that would \nbegin the process of shoring up Social Security and saving our system. \nIn fact, it is called the Defend and Save Social Security Act, and it \nwould cover a 75-year shortfall without raising taxes and without \ncutting core benefits. Anyone in our plan who is 58 years of age or \nolder would not be affected at all. However, starting in 2016, under \nour bill, the normal retirement age would start to increase 3 months \neach year for normal retirement. So if you are 58 or above, it would \nnot affect you at all. If you are 57, you would retire 3 months later. \nIf you are 56, you would retire 6 months later. That would begin to put \nus on a much more accurate table of when people are actually living and \nretiring. The actuarial tables show that people are healthier now than \nwhen Social Security passed, they work longer, they want to work \nlonger, and we need to make the actuarial tables match today's \nstandards of health and work.\n  In addition, my bill would propose a very modest change in the annual \ncost-of-living adjustment. We would begin the cost-of-living adjustment \nif inflation is over 1 percent, and at that point we would factor in \nwhatever the inflation rate is. So it would be a minor adjustment in \nthe cost-of-living adjustment, but we would never go into the core \nbenefits, nor would we tax anyone any more than they are being taxed \nright now. That is how we can address this in a gradual way and give \nour Social Security system the ability to stay solid and secure for 75 \nyears.\n  We have not heard the President of the United States talk about \ncorrecting something as solid and necessary as Social Security. We have \nnot heard anything from him about helping to solve the Medicare \nproblem, which is a different issue, but clearly it must be addressed \nbecause we are going into deficits every month, every week, and every \nday on Medicare.\n  The missing ingredient--and what the President has said in his State \nof the Union and what actually needs to happen--is entitlement reform. \nRepublicans have said: We will work with you on tax reform that will \nproduce more revenue with a fairer, flatter tax system, and one that \nwill make our businesses and corporations more competitive. If we put \nour corporations at a better competitive position in the world, then \nthey are going to hire more people. If we can do that with the \nPresident, we can make a difference in this debt and the deficits. \nHowever, all I am hearing is kind of a class warfare argument. It just \nseems old and stale because I think the American people are smarter \nthan that. I think the American people know that if businesses are \nhiring and if we can get an economy that is robust and strong with more \npeople working, everybody is going to do better, and that is what we \nall want.\n\n  Raising taxes, which is the only option the President seems to care \nabout, is not what we ought to be doing in a recession. You can dance \naround it, but if this is not a recession, then I don't know what it is \nwith millions of people not working and almost a 9-percent unemployment \nrate. I don't know what the definition of ``recession'' is by the \neconomists, but I think that when millions of people are not working \nand the unemployment rate is about 9 percent, that is a time when you \ndon't want to increase taxes and increase the burden on businesses with \na health care plan that is out of control. It is freezing hiring.\n  It is not rocket science, and it is time we got together with the \nPresident of the United States. He is the elected leader of our \ncountry, and we don't need partisan rhetoric and campaign speeches. \nWhat we need to do is look at the real capability we have to do \nsomething about this deficit; that is, cut domestic spending in a \nreasonable way, address entitlement reform, which we can do, and for \nheaven's sake, tax reform that creates a fairer, flatter tax and gives \nour corporations the ability to compete globally would be a step in the \nright direction.\n  I hope we reject his request. Let's not increase the debt limit. \nLet's sit down and get to work on bringing the debt down so we will \nnever go beyond $15 trillion in debt for our country and our future \ngenerations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The senior Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Durbin of Illinois be the next Democratic speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                         Voting Laws in Florida\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Senator Durbin, the chairman of \nthe Civil Rights Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, will convene \na hearing of the subcommittee in Tampa tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock \nfor the purpose of reviewing Florida's new election law that was passed \na year ago by the Florida Legislature. It is what has been \ncharacterized by this Senator and others as a voter suppression law. \nInterestingly, there is a pattern in about 14 States that has changed \nthe election laws to make it harder to vote, harder to register to \nvote, and harder to have one's vote counted as they intend. It is \nrather extraordinary that in this year of 2012 we would be concerned \nabout the right of access to the ballot and the right to vote, which is \na cherished constitutional right and one which is under assault in this \ncountry at this moment, especially in my State of Florida.\n  Let me give my colleagues some particulars. The new election law, for \nexample, has changed the voting registration requirements for those who \nsign up to register others--in other words, third parties--such as the \nLeague of Women Voters. The League of Women Voters had been registering \nvoters in Florida under the old law that was on the books for decades. \nThat law gave them, once they registered the voter--took the \ninformation--10 days to turn it in to the county supervisor of \nelections. That law had been on the books for decades.\n  Last year the Florida Legislature--signed into law by the Governor--\nchanged that time period to 48 hours and the penalties that accrue go \nup to $1,000 for the person who is registering the voters and does not \nturn in those names within 48 hours. Therefore, the League of Women \nVoters in Florida, which has been doing this as a civic duty, has \nstopped registering voters. They are not going to take the chance that \ntheir members would be fined up to $1,000.\n  Now, doesn't that sound like something exactly the opposite of what \nwe should be doing? We should be encouraging people to register to \nvote, which is what the League of Women Voters has been doing according \nto their civic duty for years. It is happening before our eyes. But \nthere is more.\n  College students, young people, got excited about politics in the \nlast Presidential election and voted in record numbers compared to what \nthey had been doing before. But the Florida Legislature changed the \nlaw. Now, if a college student who has not been registered before \nsuddenly gets interested and goes down to the Supervisor of Elections \nOffice and registers to vote for this year's general election, and they \narrive on election day and they are asked to show their identification, \nand they pull out their driver's license--the likelihood is their \ndriver's license is the address of their parents where they have grown \nup. If that address is in a different county from the county they \nregistered in, they will not get a ballot; they will get a provisional \nballot.\n  We know from the last Presidential election in 2008 in Florida only \nhalf of the provisional ballots were counted. Is this what we want to \ndo to encourage young people to get excited and interested in their \ngovernment, to get there on election day and get a provisional ballot \ninstead of a regular ballot? I don't think so. But it is happening \nright underneath our noses. That is one of the reasons the Judiciary \nCommittee is coming to Tampa tomorrow. We are going to flesh this out \nwith a whole bunch of witnesses. But, unfortunately, there is more.\n  After the debacle in the 2000 Presidential election in Florida where \nwe\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\nsaw mistake after mistake after mistake--and all too painfully we know \nthe results of how that election played out--to the credit of the \nFlorida State government, they made it easier to vote. They created \nearly voting. They created what was the old absentee ballot, where a \nperson had to swear they were actually going to be absent from their \nplace of voting on election day, and they made that easier by having \nthe vote by mail. They set early voting--and it has been the case for \nyears now--14 days prior to the election.\n  It was so successful in the last Presidential election that fully 40 \npercent of the entire general electorate voted before election day. So \none can imagine the process was a lot more orderly and there were less \nlines when 60 percent of the electorate turned out on election day \nbetween 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Of course, the 40 percent who voted early, \nmany of them have jobs, and it wasn't convenient for them to get to the \npolls. So they could do it at their convenience and they could do it on \nthe weekend. Some of them, such as single moms who had to arrange to \nget a babysitter, could do it at their convenience. Indeed, many \nminorities found it convenient when they could not get away from work \nto vote early.\n  So the Florida Legislature changed the law, and it was signed into \nlaw by the Governor, constricting that 14 days to 8 days. Then a very \ninteresting change took place. Instead of early voting going all the \nway up to and including the Sunday before the Tuesday election, they \nconstricted that so the last day of the 8 days is now Saturday. Guess \nwho has voted in record numbers after church on the Sunday before the \nTuesday election, record numbers: African Americans. So they will not \nbe able to go and vote on the Sunday before the Tuesday election \nbecause of the new law in Florida.\n  Now, those who passed this new law said it was to cut down on fraud. \nYet they have no example--and I am looking forward to asking some of \nthe witnesses tomorrow to make the record complete--no example of any \nincrease in fraud in the last decade of which these election laws were \npassed after the 2000 Presidential election to make it easier to vote. \nSo what we have is a pattern in over 14 States, including our State, of \nwhat I have just described, which is the law is one of the most onerous \nand one of the more distinct voter suppression laws that has been \nenacted. Why? Is it for partisan reasons?\n  If we restrict young people, if we restrict minorities, if we make it \nmore difficult for women, particularly single moms, does that suggest a \npattern of restricting certain voters and making it more difficult \nbecause of partisan reasons? I think it is pretty clear. This is \nhappening in America in the year 2012 when, in fact, the Constitution \ntells us that one of the most cherished opportunities--we even went \nthrough a civil war and then we went through the civil rights movement \nin order to guarantee the right of access to the ballot, and we had to \nknock down poll taxes and all kinds of impediments for people to vote. \nWe have gone through all of that experience since the 1850s and here, \nright under our noses, we are having these kinds of voter suppression \nlaws enacted.\n  There is a three-judge panel that is now considering this law in the \nDistrict of Columbia. There is also an examination under the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 in the five counties that are watched counties under \nthat act in Florida as to whether their civil rights have been \neclipsed. I am certainly hopeful that the court and/or the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Justice Department will look behind this smoke screen \nof so-called fraud as to what is really the motivation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to H.J. Res. 98.\n  Mr. COBURN. And the amount of time that has been allocated by the \nmajority leader and under the unanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. I understand that, but what is the total amount of time \nthat has been allocated to H.J. Res. 98?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until noon is equally divided.\n  Mr. COBURN. So the total amount of time is less than 2 hours today \nthat we are going to discuss this resolution; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Slightly more than 2 hours.\n  Mr. COBURN. Thank you. I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nresolution for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, how many minutes does the \nminority have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. How much time does the majority have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 24 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator consider 15 minutes, given \nthe inequity of the time?\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, actually, that was my whole point. We are going to \nspend a little more than 2 hours to raise the debt limit by $1.2 \ntrillion, and we can't give a Senator 20 minutes to talk about it?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, is there a consent order that \nwas entered into yesterday?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a unanimous consent agreement \nyesterday.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. And the minority has 8 minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator now has 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am asking for unanimous consent to speak \non this issue, a $1.2 trillion raise in the debt limit, for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will proceed.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I come to the floor aghast that we have \nentered into a unanimous consent agreement to spend less than 2\\1/2\\ \nhours talking about raising the debt ceiling another $1.2 trillion--\n$1.2 trillion.\n  We passed the Budget Control Act that raised the debt limit to $15.2 \ntrillion. The President has requested another increase in the debt \nlimit of another $1.2 trillion. We passed the Budget Control Act that \ndidn't cut spending. There is no absolute reduction in spending. We \ndidn't eliminate one program. We didn't do one oversight hearing on the \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government from the time of \nAugust, when we passed that, until now. No wonder America is disgusted \nwith Congress.\n  On September 7, the debt limit was increased from $8.9 trillion to \n$9.8 trillion. In July of 2008 the debt limit was increased to $10.6 \ntrillion, and in October to $11.3 trillion, in February of 2009 to \n$12.1 trillion, in February of 2010 to $14.3 trillion, in August of \n2011 to $14.7 trillion, in September of 2011 to $15.2 trillion, and now \nwe are going to raise it to $16.3 trillion.\n\n  I did not vote for one of those. The reason is a debt limit does not \nmean anything in this country, because every time we come up to the \ndebt limit, what we do is just pass it rather than do what the American \npeople have asked us to do.\n  Little has changed in Washington in the last 5 years. We have argued, \ndebated, and lamented over how to rein in the Federal Government's \ncosts and the out-of-control spending. All the time that was going on, \nwe were on a spending binge, spending money we do not have on things we \ndo not need. Even though we knew we had to borrow more money, Congress \nhas done nothing to avoid raising the debt limit--nothing.\n  We did not do oversight of Federal programs. We did not eliminate one \nduplicative program. We did not eliminate any spending in the Tax Code.\n  We hear all the Members of Congress and the President talking about \nhow we have to change stuff. We did not do anything on that which would \ngenerate more revenue, fair revenue to the Federal Government. We did \nnot work to save Medicare. We did not work to save Social Security. \nInstead of fixing the problem, we made it worse. We increased the \ndeficit. We funded ineffective programs. We wasted money on\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\nsilly projects. We funded duplication. We approved $1 trillion in more \nspending for next year--all of which will essentially be borrowed on \nthe backs of our grandkids and our kids.\n  Let me give some examples of what we spent money on last year.\n  We spent $75,000 to promote the awareness that Michigan raises \nChristmas trees. We spent $113,000 for video game preservation. We \nspent $550,000 for a documentary about how rock music contributed to \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. We spent $48,000 for the second \nannual Hawaii Chocolate Festival. We spent $350,000 to support an \ninternational art exhibit in Venice, Italy. We spent $10 million to \nremake ``Sesame Street'' for Pakistan. We spent $35 million on our own \nparty conventions, and we spent $764,000 to figure out how students use \nmobile messaging devices for social networking, which they already know \nhow they do it.\n  In February of last year, GAO brought us a wonderful report. It \nshowed thousands upon thousands of programs that are duplications. The \nmajority leader of this body voted against both attempts I made to take \nadvantage of that and eliminate waste and duplication. He never once \ninstructed committee chairmen to go find this duplication and eliminate \nit to save our children, to save our country, and we did not do any \nbetter on our side of the aisle. The fact is, we did not do anything. \nOf the thousands of things we could have done, we did nothing to lower \nour deficit, cut the waste or eliminate duplication.\n  We have known about this significant $100 billion gold mine of \nsavings from the GAO report for over 1 year now, and we have done \nnothing--zero. America should be disgusted with Congress because what \nwe care about is party power, not fixing the problems of this country.\n  Just this week, the GAO reported--an additional report; and next \nmonth we are getting the second third of the Federal Government on \nduplication, and it is going to have another $100 billion identified as \nwaste--we have 209 separate Federal programs to advance science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math education--209 programs, of which \nmost of them overlap one another.\n  We have put amendments on the floor to say: We want every agency to \ntell us of all the programs. It is defeated. They vote against it \nbecause they do not want to know what all the programs are. The only \nway we eliminate the duplication is to make the agencies show us what \nthey are doing. That goes down to defeat. Why? Because we do not want \nto do the hard work of living within our means such as every family and \nevery business in this country does. We ignore the realities. We are in \nla-la land on who can win the next election.\n  We have done nothing about the $9.5 billion in government benefits \nthat have been paid to people who earn more than $1 million a year in \nthis country. We have done nothing about that since that report came \nout. Government benefits from unemployment insurance to student loans, \n$9.5 billion a year, and we have done nothing--zero. We could have done \nit. We could save money. We have done nothing.\n  Real Americans--everyday Americans--understand the way we get out of \nour problems is through sacrifice and prioritizing what is important \nfor our country. We lack the leadership in this body to do that.\n  A veteran who served our country in a time of war wrote me a letter \nabout our current financial situation. More than nearly anyone I come \nin contact with in Washington, this regular citizen from the middle of \nthe country understands the problem, and he understands what is needed \nto fix it.\n\n       Dear Senator Coburn:\n       I'm a retired military member and Veteran, deployed four \n     times during my career--having spent years of my life in some \n     very dangerous places, away from home, and in tough \n     conditions. I am very familiar with shared sacrifice. In all \n     those days away, my sole purpose was to be prepared and \n     ensure my Soldiers were ready to deploy and return alive. In \n     our current situation, it's easy to feel like we're (as a \n     country) going into battle unprepared against an economic, \n     financial enemy of political gridlock and no compromise [no \n     leadership]; with two political parties vying for the next \n     election.\n       I'm well aware that many proposals currently out there \n     would potentially affect me. However, I'm willing to work \n     hard now and be part of a solution which solidifies our \n     country's future versus robbing my kids and grandkids from \n     the same opportunities our great country [offered me].\n       Please inform your colleagues--there are more people like \n     me awaiting leadership and good decision making than there \n     are left and right side uncompromising voters. These times \n     call for briefings to the American people, not speeches. \n     These times call for members of congress to stand together \n     and [to brief us on our unfunded liabilities]--and to show \n     how sacrifice now can lead to renewed prosperity later.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Robert Boudiette, Jr.,\n                                                       Lawton, OK.\n\n  I am embarrassed for us that we fail to meet the very standard we ask \nof the people who serve this country.\n  So rather than give a speech, let me give a briefing. We have done \nnothing to fix the 100-plus programs in surface transportation. We have \ndone nothing to eliminate the duplication in the 82 Federal Government \nprograms for teacher quality. We have done nothing to consolidate the \n88 economic development programs. We have done nothing to consolidate \nthe 80 different transportation assistance programs. We have done \nnothing to eliminate the 56 financial literacy programs. We have no \nbusiness teaching anybody financial literacy when we do not even have \nit ourselves. We have done nothing to consolidate the 47 job training \nprograms. As a matter of fact, we heard the President say he wanted to \nadd to it. Homeless prevention and assistance, 20 programs we have done \nnothing to consolidate; the food programs, disaster response and FEMA, \nand there are hundreds more. Yet we have done nothing.\n  Shouldn't we come together as men and women, Americans--not Democrats \nand Republicans--and say we are going to do what we can do to assure \nthe future of this country and quit thinking about the next election? \nWe ought to be doing what is needed. It is called making priorities. We \ncould save $50 billion if we got together and said: OK. Every committee \nis going to do oversight, eliminate duplication, and eliminate fraud. \nWe have a bill with 37 cosponsors to eliminate the fraud in Medicare--\n37. It is bipartisan. We cannot even get it to the floor to vote on it \nto make sure CMS eliminates some of the $100 billion a year in waste \nand fraud at CMS in terms of Medicare. That is how we save Medicare. \nBut yet we cannot get it to the floor. So when we do work together, we \nare blocked or impeded from having a vote where we have bipartisan \nconsensus.\n  I call on my colleagues--I love them dearly; I think they are \ntremendous individuals--we better change our vision. We better change \nwhat we have our eye on in terms of the risk to our country, the \nsurvival of our country, and it is time we come together, put \npartisanship aside, and say we are going to solve the problems in front \nof this country. We can do it. The brainpower is here. The capability \nis here. Let's do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has 18 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is there time remaining on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no remaining time on the other side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman if I \ncould have 8 minutes or 10 minutes to speak.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and my friend from Utah, the ranking member of the committee.\n  Senator Coburn of Oklahoma, who just spoke, and I probably see so \nmany things differently, but yet we see many things the same. He and I \ncome to the Senate with different backgrounds, perhaps different \npolitical values in many areas, and a much different voting record. \nThey would put us on opposite sides of the political spectrum if they \ndescribed those voting records. Yet I have found, over the last several \nyears, Senator Coburn and I have been able to agree and come together \non some of the important issues which he just raised on the Republican \nside of the aisle, which are shared on the Democratic side of the \naisle.\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n  Senator Coburn and I served on the Bowles-Simpson Commission, a \ncommission appointed by President Obama, to reduce our Nation's debt \nand deficit. I voted for the Commission report, with some misgiving \nover proposals but believed it moved us in the right, proper, and \nnecessary direction.\n  The fact and simple fact is, the United States borrows 40 cents for \nevery $1 our government spends. It borrows 40 cents for every $1 we \nspend, primarily after we have exhausted the savings of Americans, from \nforeign nations such as China, that end up buying the U.S. treasurys to \nfund our debt. So as we go more deeply into debt, we become more \nindebted to foreign countries, sovereign nations and their sovereign \nfunds. I think that is something that needs to be addressed, addressed \nin a proper fashion. Where Senator Coburn and I may disagree is in the \nfashion that we approach it.\n  We are currently emerging from a recession. We know what the impact \nhas been. Families and businesses across America have been hard hit--\nfamilies and their savings, many people losing their jobs, and \nbusinesses either going out of business or cutting back.\n  We are starting to see the first indications of recovery--the ``green \nshoots,'' as they say. As the President said in his State of the Union \nAddress, we lost 4 million jobs in America in the 6 months before he \nwas sworn in and another 4 million before his proposal to get the \neconomy moving forward was enacted into law--8 million jobs in that \nshort timeframe out of the 14 million unemployed today.\n  The President started to move the economy forward working off a \nproposal by President Bush to deal with financial institutions--a \nbitter pill for many of us but, I am afraid, necessary to keep our \neconomy stable--and then, with his investment program, to put America \nback to work.\n  These things are starting to take hold. We have seen a growth of some \n3 million private sector jobs since the President's program started. It \nis an indication we are moving in the right direction.\n  I would just say to my friend from Oklahoma, when we talk about \nissues such as deficit reduction and spending reduction, we should \nspeak to those issues in the context of economic recovery, to make \ncertain that whatever decisions we make in reducing the deficit, \nreducing spending, raising taxes, whatever it may be, that at this \npoint in time in our history, it is in the context of getting America \nback to work.\n  At 12 o'clock today we have a scheduled vote, and the vote is on the \ndebt ceiling. What is the debt ceiling? It goes back to my earlier \npoint. When we spend more than we bring in in revenue, we need to \nborrow it. As the need to borrow increases, the President has a \nresponsibility to ask for authorization from Congress. It is known as \nthe debt ceiling limit. In years gone by, it was a routine vote. In \nfact, if I am not mistaken, President Reagan asked for some 16 debt \nceiling extensions in the 8 years he served. For most of these, he was \ngiven permission to extend the debt ceiling on a bipartisan vote. \nSixteen times in 8 years--a rather common occurrence at that time but \none that we anticipated being part of the ordinary business of \ngovernment. That issue has become politicized now, and there are some \nMembers who will come to the floor and vote against extending the debt \nceiling, extending the authority of the President to borrow money to \nkeep our government functioning.\n  What troubles me greatly is that many of the same Senators who are \ngoing to vote against the debt ceiling voted for the spending. They \nvoted to spend the money knowing we did not have it and now, as former \nCongressman Obey of Wisconsin used to say, want to pose for holy \npictures--``Oh, I am opposed to the debt ceiling. I am not in favor of \ndebt.'' Really? How about your vote for the appropriations bills to \nfund our wars? Did you not vote for those? Did you not vote for the \nbudget resolution which passed on a bipartisan basis which established \nour spending for 2 years? Did you not vote as well when it came to the \ncontinuing resolution of appropriations that had to pass both the House \nand the Senate?\n  Many of my colleagues who dutifully voted for all of this spending, \nknowing in the back of their minds we did not have enough money and \nwould have to borrow to accomplish it, now will come to the floor in a \nfew moments and are going to say: We are holier than the others. We are \ngoing to vote against an extension of the debt ceiling.\n  I would say to those colleagues: Do not vote for the spending if you \nwill not vote for the borrowing because we know now they are linked \ntogether. They are one in the same. And the President is only doing \nwhat is responsible.\n  You know, we faced a government shutdown over this debt ceiling last \nyear. That was one of the first ever where a serious threat was looming \nthat we were not going to extend the debt ceiling and, in fact, would \nrenege or basically default on America's debts around the world. The \nresult of that would have been catastrophic. The reputation of America, \nits economy, and the soundness of the dollar was at stake. Thank \ngoodness, at the last minute those who were opposing the debt ceiling \nrelented, and they set up the process we will be addressing in just a \nfew moments. They said: Well, on a periodic basis, the Congress will \nhave to vote to extend the debt ceiling.\n  Last week, the House of Representatives said: No, we do not want to \nextend the debt ceiling. The same Members of the House who voted for \nthe spending bill, the same Members who voted for the Budget \nEnforcement Act, the same Members who give speeches back home about how \nwe can't turn our backs on our men and women in uniform and have to \nspend the money to bring them home safely, those same Members voted \nagainst the debt ceiling. It is a totally inconsistent position. It is \nnot honest. An honest position would be ``I do vote for spending. I do \nnot vote for borrowing.'' Very few Senators, if any, can say that with \na straight face. In fact, just the opposite is true.\n  I hope my colleagues here will accept our responsibility to extend \nthe debt ceiling by voting no on the motion to proceed to the \nconsideration of the debt ceiling. It is an important vote. And then I \nwant to join and meet the challenge of Senator Coburn of Oklahoma. \nThere are things we can and must do to bring our Nation's debt down, \nconsistent with the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission, consistent with \nthe work of the Gang of 6, and consistent with growing the American \neconomy. It has to include, as the Bowles-Simpson deficit commission \nrecommended, both revenue increases as well as spending cuts. Both have \nto happen.\n  When the President comes before us in the State of the Union and \nsuggests increasing tax rates of those making over $1 million a year, \nthe vast majority of Americans say that is reasonable. It is reasonable \nto ask those who are well off to pay their fair share. Well, let's make \nthat part of our conversation here. If we are serious about the \ndeficit, let's include revenue that will not hurt working families who \nare struggling from paycheck to paycheck but will bring the money in to \nlessen our need to borrow money from overseas.\n  That should be part of it, spending cuts and revenue enhancement that \nwill not hurt the economy. I think we can do that if we address it on a \nbipartisan basis. I stand ready to cooperate with my colleagues to \nachieve that. I hope they will join me in voting no against the motion \nto proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                                 Burma\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will speak on a different matter for \nabout 2 minutes. I wish to compliment the senior Senator from Kentucky \nfor his longtime work on behalf of dissidents in Burma. Very recently, \nhe visited Burma. He met Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the Nobel \nPeace Prize. As the senior Senator from Kentucky reported to us earlier \nthis morning on the floor of the Senate, we as Americans are making \nreal progress in Burma. Our sanctions in Burma are working. The \ngovernment there is relenting. I have had briefings from the State \nDepartment, and while we need to retain sanctions for the time being to \nencourage further progress, it is undeniable that we have been seeing \nreal progress in Burma. The dissidents, as led by Aung San Suu Kyi, are \nengaged in this process. Again, I want to compliment the Senator from \nKentucky for his 20 years of work in this area, and I\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\nthink it is probably in large part due to his efforts that we are \nmaking progress in Burma.\n  Mr. President, turning back to the subject at hand, Alexander \nHamilton once said:\n\n       To be able to borrow upon good terms, it is essential that \n     the credit of a nation should be well established.\n\n  That is obvious. We have low interest rates today because so far we \nhave been able to borrow on good terms. The good terms are that the \nAmerican people and investors worldwide know the United States is a \nsafe haven given all the consternation occurring in the world, the \nproblems in Europe, for example, and other countries. The United States \nis a safe haven. Investors want to borrow on U.S. Treasurys. That is \nwhy the rate is low, the lowest in recent history. And that is \nessentially because our credit is good. Investors trust the United \nStates.\n  It is important to also remember that this debt limit we are voting \non today is not an authorization for new spending. I repeat, it does \nnot authorize new spending. That is not what this is. It has nothing to \ndo with new spending. It just says that we have to honor our past \nbills, honor our past debts. As Alexander Hamilton said, for a country \nto be on good terms, it is important that we honor our past debts. The \ncredit of a nation should be well established.\n  I strongly urge our colleagues to vote no on this motion to proceed \nto disapprove because the result would be chaos. If that were to pass, \nit would be chaos. We would plunge ourselves back into recession, \nprobably through that into a depression. Interest rates would \nskyrocket. Inflation would skyrocket. We are trying to lower \nunemployment rates, not increase unemployment rates. We want people to \nhave jobs, not people not to have jobs.\n\n  If the United States did not honor its bills, if the United States \ndid not honor its debt it has heretofore incurred, it would cause \nchaos. It would show we are not a creditworthy country. For that \nreason, I think it is a no-brainer that this bill should be disapproved \nand, frankly, should be unanimously disapproved.\n  I think every Member of the Senate wants to honor the credit of the \nUnited States of America, wants to pay the bills we incurred in the \npast. It is an entirely different question as to what we do in the \nfuture, entirely different question as to how much we reduce our debt, \nentirely different question as to how much we cut spending and increase \nrevenues in order to reduce our deficits and our debt. That is an \nentirely different issue--an extremely important issue but entirely \ndifferent. That has nothing--nothing--to do with this vote. This vote \nis only whether we honor our past debts.\n  Once we say yes, we are going to honor our past debts, then clearly \nit is imperative that this body move ahead to reduce deficits, reduce \nour national debt. There has been a lot of discussion about that. We \nhave not made as much headway as we should have. But it is important to \nremember that in August of last year, this Congress voted to reduce \nspending by $2 trillion, $2.1 trillion--to reduce spending by $2.1 \ntrillion over 10 years. Close to $1 trillion of that was accomplished \non that vote, and the other $1.2 is part of the sequestration which \ngoes in effect in January of next year. It is not unimportant that this \nbody voted to reduce spending by about $2 trillion.\n  So we should honor our past debts. We should reduce spending--we \nshould reduce our budget debt and deficit. We do that by cutting \nspending and increasing revenue. That is a different issue. That is \nwhat we do in the future. That is what we have to work on this year and \nnext year. But today, it is important for the world to know that we \nhonor our commitments; the United States can be trusted; we have credit \nthat is well established because we honor our past obligations.\n  I strongly urge Members of the Senate to vote no on the motion to \nproceed to disapproval because I think there would not be a positive \noutcome if that vote were to pass. I am not one who is prone to \nexaggeration or to hyperbole, but I might say in this case that if this \nmotion were to proceed, we would be on the border of catastrophe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are here today to debate the President's \ndesire to take on more debt. We are here to debate whether it is a good \nthing to put current and future generations on the hook for the \nspending policies of this administration.\n\n  I believe that it is not a good thing. We should not enable this \nadministration to spend more taxpayer dollars by increasing the debt \nceiling.\n  We should be forcing the administration to lead, and to make the \nreductions in government programs and spending that everyone knows must \nhappen if we are to remain a free and prosperous Nation.\n  Here is the bottom line, and it is not pretty.\n  Our debt today is $4.6 trillion higher than when President Obama took \noffice.\n  In his 3 years in office, President Obama has run up the three \nlargest deficits in American history.\n  Three trillion-dollar deficits.\n  This is an enormous burden that the President is placing on American \ntaxpayers.\n  He talks about fairness. Well, this debt is unfair to current \ntaxpayers and future generations.\n  Yet by this debt ceiling increase, he wants Congress to give him a \ngreen light to spend more, running our debt up to nearly $16.4 \ntrillion.\n  The debt per person has increased by $13,963 since President Obama \ntook office.\n  This is unacceptable.\n  I will be voting for this resolution of disapproval. The debt ceiling \nshould not be increased. The fiscal path that this Nation is on is a \npath to ruin. The President knows that. But instead of hitting the \nbrakes and getting spending under control, he is slamming on the \naccelerator.\n  This is no longer acceptable.\n  Voting for this resolution, as the House did overwhelmingly, would \nmake it clear that the way to address our spending problem is by \nreducing spending.\n  This resolution is worthy of our support, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to the motion \nto proceed to H.J.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss \nH.R. 3801, the Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act of 2012, \nand I urge the Senate to pass this legislation today. Passing this bill \nwill not only help to secure our southwest border, but it also affords \nus the opportunity to honor an incredible colleague.\n  I had the privilege of serving with Congresswoman Gabby Giffords in \nthe House of Representatives, and she is the force behind this \nlegislation. She originally introduced it in 2010, before the senseless \nact of violence that took place, and she won its passage. But the \nSenate failed to take it up.\n  Over this past year, we have been working with Gabby's staff, and I \nwas honored to introduce her bill in the Senate with Senators Heller, \nBingaman, and Feinstein. It passed by unanimous consent in December but \nwas held up in the House because of a procedural issue. This allowed \nGabby to reintroduce it in the House this week with Congressman Jeff \nFlake. Yesterday, as we all bid Gabby an emotional farewell, the House \noverwhelmingly passed it by a vote of 408-0.\n  I commend the House leadership for working to make sure this \nimportant legislation passed as Gabby's final legislative act before \nresigning. I want to especially say how honored I am to have worked on \nthis legislation with her.\n  Like all Americans, I have watched in awe at Gabby's courage and her \nremarkable grace. She inspires us all. She represents the best of our \nNation. Dr. Martin Luther King once said that darkness cannot drive out \ndarkness; only light can do that. Gabby is truly a shining light to all \nwho know her.\n  The Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling Prevention Act is a testament to \nGabby's commitment to securing our borders from illegal activity. A new \ntrend in drug smuggling is to fly a one-person ultralight aircraft over \nthe border to drop drugs. Hundreds are flown across the southwest \nborder each year. Each one can carry hundreds of pounds of narcotics.\n  Because ultralights are not categorized under existing law as \naircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration, they do not fall under \nthe provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930. This means a drug smuggler \npiloting an ultralight is subject to weaker criminal penalties than one \nwho uses a small plane.\n  Ultralight presents a unique challenge for Border Patrol and \nprosecutors. Our legislation will close any unintended loopholes. It \nwill give our law enforcement and prosecutors the additional tools they \nneed to combat drug smuggling. It will also add an attempt and \nconspiracy provision to the aviation smuggling law. This enables \nprosecutors to charge people other than the pilot who are involved in \naviation smuggling. It gives prosecutors a new tool to go after the \nground crews who aid pilots as well as those who pick up drugs that are \nbeing dropped off in the United States.\n  This bill will also direct the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to establish and collaborate in \nidentifying the equipment and technology for border protection to \ndetect ultralights. The ultimate purpose of this legislation is to make \nour communities safer, and it is fitting that Gabby, from the very \nbeginning, has been so instrumental in making it happen. I also want to \nacknowledge the hard work of her staff who worked on this bill \ntirelessly every day. Peter Ambler is one of her staff members who has \nbeen key. I know Gabby's staff is very dedicated to her, and I know \nGabby's perseverance to advance her legislative priorities during her \nrecovery demonstrate what a good public servant she is.\n  Gabby, we know you will be back. But until then, we wish you and Mark \nall the very best, and we thank you for your extraordinary service to \nour Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I addressed the Senate recently on \nPresident Obama's recess appointments, and he did this when the Senate \nwas not in fact in recess. I described at length why this was an \noutrageous and unconstitutional power grab. However, President Obama's \ndecision to bypass the constitutional advice and consent of the Senate \nis not an isolated incident by the President. It is merely the latest \nescalation in a pattern of contempt for elected representatives of the \nAmerican people and the constitutional separation of powers. This \npattern has become more apparent since the last election when public \nopinion turned against the direction that President Obama was trying to \ntake the country.\n  When the President's party in 2009 and 2010 had an overwhelming \ncontrol of both Houses of Congress, he was able to pursue his agenda \nwith only the slightest of lip service to the objections from \ncongressional Republicans because we were very much in the minority, \nand, of course, we believe we were representing millions of Americans \nwhose views were in opposition to President Obama's views. In 2009 and \n2010, President Obama could in fact govern more like a Prime Minister \nin a European parliament, where the leader of the party in power \ndictates the policy to be rubberstamped by that parliament.\n  Since the 2010 election, that is no longer the case. There was a \ntremendous voter backlash against both the style and substance of the \nPresident's agenda. A groundswell of Americans became convinced their \ngovernment was out of touch, and they demanded to be heard. The \nPresident's party in the Senate is now well below the supermajority \nnecessary to pass legislation without consulting the minority party, \nand that is the way it was intended for the Senate to work. Moreover, \nthere is now a new majority in the House of Representatives trying to \nchart a new course based on the concerns that so many voters expressed \nin the last election.\n  Rather than accept the message of the 2010 election and the fact he \nis faced with a Congress that is no longer a rubberstamp, the President \nhas decided that he does not need Congress at all. Imagine that. In \nfact, he has even said so.\n  In October, upset that Congress would not pass his latest stimulus \nbill exactly as he had proposed, the President launched a media \ncampaign around the tag line, ``We can't wait for Congress.'' Under \nthis banner he has announced executive actions for everything from \nmortgage and student loans, summer jobs for youth, and new fuel economy \nstandards.\n  A President being frustrated with Congress is nothing new. We all \nknow that from history. What is more remarkable is the notion that the \nPresident, however, can act independently of Congress. ``Where they \nwon't act, I will,'' the President has said.\n  Article I, section 1 of the Constitution of the United States says:\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States,\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\n     which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  Having had their rights violated by King George, our Founding Fathers \nintentionally put the power to make laws in the branch of government \nthat is most directly related and accountable to the citizenry of this \ncountry. Under our Constitution, the President's role is not to make \npolicy unilaterally but, to quote the Constitution, ``take care that \nthe laws are faithfully executed.''\n  Some might say the whole ``we can't wait'' campaign is just harmless \npolitical rhetoric. It would be bad enough if the President were just \nkidding when he implies that he is usurping legislative power, the \nlegislative power vested in the duly elected representatives of the \ncitizens of the 50 States. However, after his latest power grab, there \ncan be no doubt that President Obama is dead serious. It is not just \npolitical rhetoric.\n  This disregard for the constitutional role of Congress did not start \nwith President Obama's ``we can't wait for Congress'' campaign. An \nearlier indicator of actions to come was his controversial appointment \nof several new so-called czars. The President is well within his rights \nto choose advisers. We all agree to that. That is in the past just what \nthese positions now termed ``czars'' are supposed to be, just advisers. \nHowever, it became clear that many of President Obama's new high-level \nczars--such as the climate czar, for instance--were involved in \ncrafting regulations and other roles normally reserved for Senate-\nconfirmed officials. Why? Because then they could be called to the \nSenate committees to respond and have us operate a proper oversight \nfunction.\n  Another example of President Obama's disregard for Congress is his \nadministration's unilateral pursuit of climate change regulations. The \nHouse and Senate have considered various proposals to regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions, but these have proved very controversial and \nvery harmful to the economy. When the climate legislation backed by \nPresident Obama could not achieve sufficient support to pass Congress, \nthe administration announced that it would go ahead anyway. While a \nSupreme Court ruling opened the door to that possibility, the fact that \nCongress specifically did not authorize such regulations should have \ngiven the President pause.\n  In a similar move, when the DREAM Act as currently written was unable \nto secure sufficient support in Congress to pass, an Immigration and \nCustoms memorandum appeared calling for immigration laws to be enforced \nso as to bring about the same ends as the legislation that could not \npass Congress. Congress also rejected the card check bill supported by \nPresident Obama to eliminate secret ballot elections for union members. \nSure enough, the National Labor Relations Board proposed a rule \nproviding for snap elections, which would achieve the same goals, thus \ngiving union leaders an upper hand in union elections.\n  The President's ``Race to the Top'' education program is another \nsignificant overreach. Congress bears responsibility for writing a $5 \nbillion check to the Secretary of Education in the first stimulus bill \nwith minimal guidelines attached. However, the administration blew past \neven those broad guidelines to implement an unprecedented Federal \nintervention into State education policy. The resulting program offered \nthe possibility of big grants to cash-strapped States provided they \nfirst changed State laws to implement specific policies favored by the \nSecretary of Education. Most States, such as Iowa, implemented the \nSecretary's preferred policies and applied for the funds yet never saw \na dime in return for changing out State laws.\n  In a similar move, the President announced he would grant waivers to \nStates for relief from the requirements of the No Child Left Behind \nAct. The catch is that States will have to adopt key components of his \neducation reform agenda in order to get such a waiver. This is despite \nthe fact that Congress is currently considering legislation to update \nthe Federal education policy and may not adopt all aspects of the \nPresident's proposal. Moreover, current law allows for waiving existing \nrequirements on a case-by-case basis but does not authorize the \nadministration to add new requirements in return.\n  So far during my remarks I have mostly focused on areas where the \nPresident has acted without authority from Congress. On the other hand, \nwhen Congress has passed legislation the President has not entirely \nagreed with, he has announced while signing them into law that he will \nnot implement the parts he does not like.\n  During the 2008 campaign, candidate Obama said that he was ``not \ngoing to use signing statements as a way of doing an end run around \nCongress.''\n  However, he has done just that on numerous occasions.\n  Moreover, he has made clear his intention to not enforce certain laws \nthat are already on the books, such as federal anti-drug laws.\n  The President's Attorney General also decided not to defend a legal \nchallenge to the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  Again, the Constitution makes clear that it is the President's \nresponsibility to ``take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed'' \nwhether the current occupant of the White House agrees with those laws \nor not.\n  I can think of plenty more examples of executive overreach.\n  It would be much harder to think of examples where Congress has \nsuccessfully fought off an executive power grab.\n  In fact, the more President Obama has gotten away with these little \npower grabs, the bolder he has become.\n  Congress has not been effective in fighting this executive \nencroachment because Congress is not of one mind.\n  Members of the President's party are understandably reluctant to \noppose him publicly.\n  However, with this latest escalation, the time has come for Congress, \non a bipartisan basis, to say ``Enough is enough.''\n  I would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to think \nhard about the precedent being set for the next Republican President.\n  Once the genie is out of the bottle, you are not likely to be able to \nget it back in.\n  For those who are tempted to sympathize with the President when he \njustifies bypassing Congress because of ``obstructionism'', I would \nreturn to the fact that our system of checks and balances between the \ndifferent branches of government did not come about by accident.\n  The philosophy underpinning the American Revolution, as expressed in \nthe Declaration of Independence, is based on ``unalienable Rights'' and \nthe principle ``That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted \namong Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the \ngoverned.''\n  As a result, our government was intentionally structured to provide \nmaximum protection to individual rights.\n  In our Constitution, that principle takes precedent over getting \nthings done.\n  In my previous remarks, I quoted the Father of the Constitution, \nJames Madison, in Federalist 51, ``separate and distinct exercise of \nthe different powers of government'' is ``essential to the preservation \nof liberty.''\n  Madison was concerned about a temporary majority faction assuming \nfull control of the government and acting tyrannically toward those \nAmericans in the minority.\n  By contrast, the French Revolution was inspired by the philosophy of \nJean-Jacques Rousseau, who wrote that claims of natural rights must be \nabandoned in favor of submission to the authority of the ``general \nwill'' of the people as a whole.\n  The application of this philosophy tends to result in power \ncentralized in a ruling elite that claims a unique ability to interpret \nthe ``general will''.\n  This centralization of power allows for a more active government.\n  That may be attractive to those whose main concern is making the \ntrains run on time. But Amtrak doesn't run on time.\n  On the other hand, the single-minded pursuit of a common purpose at \nthe expense of individual rights has led to some of history's worst \ntyrannies.\n  Our system of separation of powers, federalism, and checks and \nbalances, designed to protect individual rights, results in a more \ndeliberative form of government.\n  This can be frustrating.\n  It means that the President cannot expect Congress to just pass his \nproposals without reading them. But Speaker Pelosi said about Health \nCare\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nReform we have to first pass it to find out what is in it.\n  Still, these features of our Constitution perform an important role \nin preventing one faction of Americans from dominating another.\n  President Obama is not the first to become frustrated with the checks \nand balances built into our constitutional system.\n  In fact, at the dawn of the 20th century, an entire philosophical \nmovement developed around the idea that our Constitution had become \noutmoded, that its focus on individual rights was no longer applicable \nto the modern age.\n  I mentioned in my previous remarks about the President's \nunconstitutional appointments that it was Theodore Roosevelt who \nstarted to change the way Presidents viewed power.\n  It is worth noting that President Obama recently gave a speech in \nOsawatomie, KS, the site of Teddy Roosevelt's famous ``New \nNationalism'' speech.\n  That speech marked the beginning of Roosevelt's break with the \nincumbent Republican president, William Howard Taft.\n  Roosevelt then went on to challenge Taft in the 1912 election on the \nProgressive Party ticket.\n  In that speech, which President Obama commemorated, Roosevelt \ndescribed his New Nationalism as ``. . . impatient of the impotence \nwhich springs from overdivision of governmental powers.'' Throw the \nConstitution out the window.\n  He went on to say that, ``This New Nationalism regards the executive \npower as the steward of the public welfare.''\n  An even more explicit description of the progressive view of the \nConstitution was written by the ultimate winner of the 1912 \npresidential election, Woodrow Wilson.\n  In his Constitutional Government, Wilson wrote,\n\n       The makers of the Constitution constructed the federal \n     government upon a theory of checks and balances which was \n     meant to limit the operation of each part and allow to no \n     single part of organ of it a dominating force; but no \n     government, can be successfully conducted upon so mechanical \n     a theory.\n       Leadership and control must be lodged somewhere . . .\n\n  It seems strange we have made it for 225 years under our \nConstitution.\n  He then goes on to describe at length why he feels the President is \nwhere this ``leadership and control'' should ultimately be lodged.\n  This philosophy advocates a concentration of power in order to more \neffectively act on behalf of ``the people,'' at the expense of \nrepresenting the diverse views of Americans.\n  It is contrary to the founding principles of our Nation and foreign \nto the realities of American civic life.\n  We are a large nation with tremendous variety in both geography and \npeople.\n  No one man can claim to speak on behalf of all Americans, which is \nwhy we have a Congress in the first place.\n  The voices of all Americans deserve to be heard through their elected \nrepresentatives and the rights of each American must be respected.\n  As the State motto of Iowa goes, ``Our liberties we prize, and our \nrights we will maintain.''\n  We must not let short term partisan interests trump those enduring \nconstitutional principles.\n  The Senate, and the whole Congress, has a solemn duty to defend its \nconstitutional role.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S97-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S97-S98]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MICHIGAN'S 175TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my State of \nMichigan on its 175th anniversary of statehood. On Thursday, January \n26, 1837, President Andrew Jackson signed into law the bill granting \nMichigan statehood. The bill was surprisingly controversial. At the \ntime, Michigan and Ohio had been embroiled in an argument called the \nToledo war. Before Michigan was granted statehood it had to surrender \nits claim over Toledo. But in exchange we got the Upper Peninsula of \nMichigan, one of the most beautiful places in the entire country--I \nwould say in the entire world. So I think we won that trade.\n  Twenty-four years later President Lincoln would exclaim, ``Thank God \nfor Michigan,'' when Michigan troops arrived to defend Washington, DC, \nduring the Civil War. Around the turn of the century, the auto industry \ntook off in Michigan. Henry Ford paid the workers $5 a day to build the \nModel Ts so they could afford to buy the cars they made. That was \nviewed as revolutionary at the time. Those workers not only created the \nmiddle class in this country--and we are very proud it started in \nMichigan with our workers--but they made America an international \nsuperpower.\n  During World War I, Michigan factories built boats and vehicles that \nhelped turn the tide in Europe. During World War II, Michigan's role \nbecame even more important. Auto plants were rapidly converted to \nmilitary use, building tanks and jeeps and bombers. The Nation's first \nfreeways were built in Michigan to connect our factories in Detroit \nwith those in other parts of the State. The iconic image of Rosie the \nRiveter saying, ``We can do it'' was based on a real woman named Rose \nMonroe who worked at the Willow Run factory in Michigan.\n  After the war, Michigan experienced incredible growth, becoming the \nhome of our American middle class. Only California and Florida saw \ngreater population growth than Michigan in the postwar years. \nManufacturing took off across the State and eventually across the \ncountry. Farms saw greater increases in production with the invention \nof new machinery and the adoption of increased specialization. We built \nthe Mackinac Bridge connecting our two beautiful peninsulas, an \nengineering marvel that remains one of the largest suspension bridges \nin the world. Of course, Motown Records and all the wonderful musicians \nwho have come since then gave the world some of the most wonderful \nmusic and the best musicians who have ever lived.\n\n  The last few years have been tough on all of us in Michigan, but we \nhave been through tough times before, and every time we have come back \nstronger than ever. We may be 175 years old, but one would not know it. \nOur economy is growing stronger and more nimble than ever. Great \nsacrifices have gotten us to this point as we have moved through great \nrecessions and changes in a global economy. I am very proud of everyone \nin Michigan who is working hard and bringing things back.\n  Our auto companies have made an incredible comeback. G.M. is, once \nagain, the world's largest automaker. Ford is investing billions of \ndollars in Michigan plants, and Chrysler is reminding the country that \nthe very best cars and trucks are imported from Detroit. I am so \ngrateful for all the sacrifice and hard work of our workers who have \nhelped get our companies to this point.\n  It was great to hear President Obama talk so much about the future of \nMichigan's economy in his State of the Union speech. We are \ndiversifying to support new technologies and new businesses. The \nPresident invited a Michigan worker, Bryan Ritterby, who lost his job \nin the furniture business at age 55 and was able to get retrained and \nhave a new job at a wind turbine factory on the west side of the State. \nHe said, ``I am proud to be working in the industry of the future.'' \nThat came about because of the concerted effort of all of us working \ntogether not only to help General Motors and Chrysler but to focus on a \nmanufacturing strategy of the future to make things in America.\n  The President talked about our leadership with clean energy \nmanufacturing and advanced battery technology. In fact, Michigan is now \nNo. 1 in new clean energy patents. We are doing so much in innovation. \nIn fact, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is opening a new office \nin Detroit in July, which is the first satellite office in the country. \nI am proud to have offered the provision to name it the Elijah McCoy \nPatent Office, after an African-American inventor whose high-quality \nproducts and innovations gave rise to the expression, ``the real \nMcCoy.''\n  On Michigan's 175th anniversary, there are so many reasons I am proud \nto represent our beautiful Great Lakes State, from our incredible \nwaters to our tradition of manufacturing, to our great diversity in \nagriculture. We make and grow products in Michigan. We don't have a \nmiddle class in this country, we don't have an economy unless we do \nthat, and Michigan is, once\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\nagain, leading the way. I am most honored to serve the great people of \nMichigan who are, without a doubt, the toughest, friendliest, hardest-\nworking people in the country.\n  The author John Steinbeck once wrote of a trip he took to Michigan. \nHe said, ``It seemed to me that the Earth was generous and outgoing \nhere in the heartland, and, perhaps, its people took a cue from it.'' \nIn fact, our people have.\n  Today, as we celebrate Michigan's 175th birthday, we have an \nincredible history to be proud of and an incredible future to look \nforward to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the State of my birth, the State I am \nhonored to represent in the Senate, the great State of Michigan \ncelebrates its 175th birthday today. This landmark occasion is cause to \nreflect on Michigan's contributions to the greatness of our nation.\n  Michigan has never failed to excite imaginations. The great Civil War \nhistorian Bruce Catton, a Michigan native, once wrote that Michigan has \nalways been less about the present than about our voyage to the future, \n``to the fantastic reality that must lie beyond the mists.'' From the \nfirst European explorers who yearned to learn what they would find on \nthe far lakeshore or around the next river bend, to the scientists and \nengineers who today are charting the technologies that will define our \nworld for decades to come, Michigan has always helped to answer \nAmerica's burning question: What comes next?\n  To a large degree, that voyage of discovery has always been about the \ngrowth of America's economy and the prosperity of her people. The \nlumber that built great cities in New York and Chicago came from our \nforests. The ores that fed the Industrial Revolution came from our \nCopper Country and Iron Mountains. The cars that put the world on \nwheels, and helped build America's middle class, came from our \nfactories--as did the bombers and tanks that helped win World War II. \nAnd today, the exploration of new technologies in energy and \ntransportation is helping to shape America's economy so that we can \nprosper in an extraordinarily competitive global marketplace.\n  Our State's identity is inextricably linked to the jewels that \nsurround us: the Great Lakes. Their waters provide the drinking water \nthat sustains us. They drive our economy. They help move goods to and \nfrom the far corners of the globe. They bring visitors to our shores. \nAnd they are a treasure trove of memories--of families sharing a picnic \non the beach, of a kayaker's solo paddle through the mists of early \nmorning, of a youngster's first successful cast of a fishing line or of \na sunset walk along the water. We are custodians of the largest store \nof fresh water on the globe, and throughout our history, Michiganians \nhave sought to exercise that responsibility with gratitude and care.\n  Michiganians have left an indelible mark on history, a mark that \nreaches far beyond our borders. The cry ``Remember the Raisin!'' \nrallied American troops to win the War of 1812, and Custer's shout, \n``Come on, you Wolverines!'' helped turn the tide at Gettysburg. From \nW.K. Kellogg's cereal to Thomas Edison's light bulb to Henry Ford's \nassembly line, Michigan innovators have shaped the world around us. \nMichiganians helped to run the Underground Railroad and to lead the \nfight for civil rights. A Michigan woman, Sojourner Truth, changed the \nworld by asking, ``Ain't I a woman?'' And a Michigan man in the White \nHouse, Gerald Ford, helped heal the wounds of division in the dark days \nof Watergate.\n  Michigan has given the world remarkable artists, from the poems of \nPhilip Levine to the sounds of Motown. Michigan has given the world \nMagic Johnson's smile, Joe Louis's power and Derek Jeter's leadership.\n  Michiganians look back with pride on these 175 years. And we look \nforward with hope and anticipation to that always-approaching future \nthat Bruce Catton described, to the fantastic reality that awaits our \nState in the years ahead. I hope my colleagues will join me in \ncelebrating the 175th anniversary of Michigan statehood and the \ngreatness ahead for our State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S98-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S98-S106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CITIZENS UNITED ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, representing a State that is coming up \non our 350th anniversary, I am delighted to salute the great State of \nMichigan on its 175th anniversary.\n  I rise to note the anniversary of an unfortunate event that is \nundermining the very core of our cherished democracy. This past \nSaturday marked the 2-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's \ndisastrous 5-to-4 decision in a case called Citizens United v. the \nFederal Election Commission. With that feat of judicial activism, the \nconservative block of the Supreme Court gnawed a hole in the dike \nprotecting our elections integrity, overturned the will of Congress and \nthe American people, and allowed unlimited, anonymous corporate money \nto flood into our elections.\n  Senator McCain recently called this ``one of the worst decisions in \nhistory.'' Senator Schumer said, at the time, ``One thing is clear; the \nconservative block of the Supreme Court has predetermined the outcome \nof the next election; the winners will be the corporations.''\n  It is no secret around here that big corporate interests long have \nhad oversized influence in the legislative and executive branches. But \nCitizens United supersizes that influence so it threatens to overrun \nour elections. Here is how my home State newspaper, the Providence \nJournal, explained it:\n\n       The ruling will mean that, more than ever, big-spending \n     economic interests will determine who gets elected. More \n     money will especially pour into relentless attack campaigns. \n     Free speech for most individuals will suffer because their \n     voices will count for even less than they do now. They will \n     simply be drowned out by the big money.\n\n  This election year already confirms those fears. Senator McCain noted \nearlier this month--and I will quote him again:\n\n       I predicted when the United States Supreme Court, with \n     their absolute ignorance of what happens in politics, struck \n     down [the McCain-Feingold finance] law, that there would be a \n     flood of money into campaigns, not transparent, unaccounted \n     for, and this is exactly what is happening . . . and I \n     predict . . . that, in the future, there will be scandals \n     because there is too much money washing around political \n     campaigns now that nobody knows where it came from and nobody \n     knows where it's going.\n\n  Senator McCain got it right. Look at Iowa, New Hampshire, and South \nCarolina. This election cycle has been the coming-out party for the \nsuper-PACs, the so-called ``evil twins'' of candidates' campaigns.\n  Why evil twins? Because unlike candidates' campaigns, super-PACs can \naccept unlimited corporate cash. Unlike candidates' campaigns, super-\nPACs can hide the identities of who is funding them until long after \nthe voting is over. Unlike candidate's campaigns, super-PACs can run \nvicious and misleading advertisements without anyone being accountable \nto the voters.\n  Super-PACs supposedly cannot coordinate their activities with the \ncandidates' campaigns, but we all know this is pure fiction. In \npractice, they are run by close confederates of the candidates, fueled \nby the same donors and acting in perfect harmony with the campaigns and \nit is out of control. Through the date of the New Hampshire primary, \nsuper-PACs spent over $14 million, far more than the candidates' \ncampaigns did themselves. Here is the problem: Corporations are not \npeople. By refusing to acknowledge this, the Citizens United opinion \nhas undermined the integrity of our democracy, allowing unlimited \ncorporate money to drown out ordinary citizens' voices.\n  This is not just some unfortunate side effect of a longstanding right \nenshrined in our Constitution. This is new and novel. The Founders \ncertainly did not consider corporations to be citizens of our \ndemocracy. Corporations are not even mentioned in the \nConstitution once. Indeed, private business corporations were actually \nrare at our Nation's founding.\n\n  As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent in Citizens United it is:\n\n       Implausible that the Framers believed `the freedom of \n     speech' would extend equally to all corporate speakers, much \n     less that it would preclude legislatures from taking limited \n     measures to guard against corporate capture of elections.\n\n  So there is no case to support the Citizens United decision if one is \nan ``originalist.''\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\n  Federal laws have restricted corporate spending on campaigns since \n1907. The principle that an inanimate business corporation is not \nallowed to spend unlimited dollars to influence political campaigns is \na long-established cornerstone of our political system from Teddy \nRoosevelt, a century ago, to Senators McCain and Feingold in our time, \nwho won that bruising legislative battle for the 2002 bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act. Citizens United overturned not just all that \nlegislation but also overturned a long line of judicial decisions \nupholding those restrictions on corporate cash and elections. So there \nis no case based on precedent either.\n  Justice Stevens noted that ``the only relevant thing that has changed \n[since those prior precedents] . . . is the composition of this \nCourt.''\n  The conservatives got a majority of five and they ran with it--\njudicial activism pure, plain, and simple. The activism appears pretty \nnakedly in the majority's finding of fact.\n  For starters, a Supreme Court is not supposed to make findings of \nfact. Its role is to review the factual record presented to it and \ninterpret the law. But the Supreme Court's conservative bloc \nnevertheless made findings of fact in Citizens United. Here is one:\n\n       We now conclude that independent expenditures, including \n     those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or \n     the appearance of corruption.\n\n  They just declared that to be true. So a company comes in, drops a \ncouple million dollars to smear one candidate on behalf of the other in \na closely contested race, and you don't think that other candidate is \nin the company's pocket? Please.\n  Say a year later that company comes back and it sits down quietly \nwith the Congressman and says: Remember that ad we ran smearing your \nopponent last year that helped you win the election? Well, here is one \nwe are going to run against you through a different, phony shell \norganization unless you vote with us on this bill. No possibility of \ncorruption or the appearance of corruption? Please. It is ludicrous. It \nis patently false.\n  Here is another finding of fact by this bloc of judges:\n\n       The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will \n     not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\n\n  If all we are doing is listening to the corporations, people are \ngoing to be fine with that. Please. Anyone in politics knows how phony \nthat statement is. There are hundreds of thousands of pages to the \ncontrary in the records of the previous Supreme Court decisions that \nwere overturned and from legislative hearings.\n  Here is what the Senate said 100 years ago, speaking about corporate \nmoney in elections:\n\n       The evils of the use of [this] money in connection with \n     political elections are so generally recognized that the \n     committee deems it unnecessary to make any argument in favor \n     of the general purpose of this measure. It is in the interest \n     of good government and calculated to promote purity in the \n     selection of public officials.\n\n  This finding of the Senate was magically overturned by the Citizens \nUnited Five. Other courts are having trouble swallowing this phony \nfactfinding.\n  The Montana Supreme Court recently rejected this false premise that \nunderlies Citizens United. Here is what they said:\n\n       Clearly the impact of unlimited corporate donations creates \n     a dominating impact on the political process and inevitably \n     minimizes the impact of individual citizens.\n\n  Now, that is true. But the conservative justices comprising the \nCitizens United Five had to make these unsupported findings of fact. \nThey are the analytical linchpin of the Citizens United decision. \nWithout the pretense that corporate money could never corrupt or appear \nto corrupt elections, the rest of their analysis falls to pieces, and \nthey would never have been able to open the floodgates for the big \ncorporations.\n  So they had to make these findings, even though the findings were \ncontrary to precedent, contrary to common sense, contrary to fact.\n  Americans of all political stripes are disgusted by the influence of \nunlimited, anonymous corporate cash in our elections. Rhode Islander \nCharles--I will just use his first name--in Little Compton wrote to me:\n\n       [i]t is wrong that someone who shouts louder or further, in \n     this instance solely because they have more money, should \n     drown out another person . . . [C]orporations have no \n     problems getting their views aired.\n\n  Hope-Whitney in Bristol wrote to me:\n\n       [j]ust the idea that a corporation is considered an \n     individual in regards to politics goes against everything \n     American to me . . . [T]hey have become the Emperors as they \n     have the financial ability to be heard everywhere . . . I'd \n     be willing to bet that a majority of their own employees do \n     not agree with their political representation.\n\n  Elizabeth in Wakefield, RI, wrote:\n\n       Big business should not control our elections. It is bad \n     enough that they deeply influence our politicians through \n     lobbyists.\n\n  Rhode Islanders, like Americans across the country, have had enough. \nIn 2010, we came within one vote in this Chamber of passing the \nDISCLOSE Act, which would have at least kept the corporate cash from \nflooding our elections anonymously. This year, let's redouble our \nefforts to limit the damage done by Citizens United. We must if we are \nto preserve democracy of the people, by the people, and for the people \nfrom this tide of unlimited, unaccountable, and anonymous corporate \nmoney polluting the power of elections.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about one of the \nworst Supreme Court decisions in the history of the Court. Two years \nago the Supreme Court handed down the landmark decision Citizens \nUnited, and with it they gave corporations a blank check to utterly \ndestroy our political system. I wish to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to tell my colleagues about the practical impact of this \ndecision and how it threatens our democracy and why we need to do \nsomething about it.\n  Let me start with the punch line. In Citizens United, the Supreme \nCourt ruled for the first time that corporations are guaranteed the \nsame free speech rights as real people to influence elections. I didn't \nsay it was a funny punch line. The Court had previously held that money \nor campaign contributions are speech, so functionally that means the \ncorporations are now able to spend as much money as they want, whenever \nthey want, in any election in this country.\n  Let me tell my colleagues how.\n  My colleagues may have heard a lot about PACs. ``PAC'' is short for \npolitical action committee, and it is an entity that is separate from a \ncampaign that can run political ads on issues or support or oppose a \ncandidate. They can also give a limited amount of money directly to \ncampaigns. The idea behind them is that if a number of citizens share \nviews on issues, say, the environment, they can pool their resources, \nmake their views known, and influence an election. They can run ads to \ncall for the election of a candidate who supports those shared beliefs. \nBut a PAC cannot coordinate with that candidate's campaign. It is not \nsupposed to be an extension of that campaign.\n  Prior to Citizens United, corporations could get involved in the \npolitical process, but there were special protections in place. They \ncouldn't use their money to make a direct contribution to a campaign, \nand they couldn't buy political ads to directly influence elections. \nInstead, they had to give money to a PAC, and how much they could give \nwas very tightly restricted. Corporations could only use their treasury \nfunds to pay to set up and administer a PAC and could not use any money \nto expressly advocate for the election or defeat of any candidate. \nTheir executives, like all other individuals, could only write checks \nof up to $5,000 to these PACs.\n  Citizens United began the process of unraveling these protections \nwhen it was found that companies could give unlimited money to PACs for \nthe purposes of running ads directly advocating for or against a \ncandidate. This kind of activity is called ``independent \nexpenditures.''\n  There is one line from the Supreme Court's opinion that I think is \nworth sharing with my colleagues, as Senator Whitehouse did as well, \nbecause it highlights for me and for him just how absurd the thinking \nof the Court was on this case. It said:\n\n       [I]ndependent expenditures, including those made by \n     corporations, do not give rise\n\n[[Page S100]]\n\n     to corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n\n  I added the emphasis.\n  This one line that is so flawed and so out of touch with reality is \nwhat has spawned the complete unraveling of our campaign finance \nsystem, and it has opened the floodgates for political spending.\n  A subsequent case, FreeSpeechNow.org v. FEC, continued what Citizens \nUnited started by finding the contribution caps--the limits on what \ncorporations and wealthy individuals can give to PACs--to be \nunconstitutional.\n  The combination of these two court cases is what gave rise to what is \nnow known as a super PAC, and as a result many regular PACs have now \ngiven way to these super PACs. What does this mean in practice? It \nmeans that corporations can now give an unlimited amount of funds \ndirectly from their general treasuries to PACs and that those funds can \nbe used to run ads supporting a candidate or running attack ads against \ntheir opponents. And because the cap on contributions to PACs was \neliminated for individuals as well, now CEOs and other superwealthy \nindividuals can write multimillion-dollar checks to influence \nelections. This entirely undermines the restrictions that were put in \nplace on how much an individual or corporation can give to a candidate \nrunning for office. A person just gives however much they want to the \ncandidate's super PAC, and they buy ads that support the candidate's \nelection or, as we have seen a lot of lately, they run negative ads \nthat smear another candidate.\n  A super PAC is not a new legal entity; it is just a PAC that started \nto bundle together these unlimited corporate donations with unlimited \ndonations from super-rich individuals with the goal of supporting or \ndefeating certain candidates. Let's be clear. These super PACs aren't \nabout issues, they are about campaigning for candidates--even though \nthey ostensibly can't coordinate with the official campaign and legally \na candidate can't even force them to stop.\n  As so many people have noted, in this new political reality it would \nbe unilateral disarmament--and ultimately electoral defeat--for elected \nofficials to run away from super PACs. That is why the system needs to \nbe changed.\n  But it gets even worse. In a post-Citizens United world, one often \ncannot even find out where the money is coming from. PACs and super \nPACs have to disclose several times a year where they get their money \nfrom, but companies often don't want us to know they are giving lots of \nmoney to elect or defeat someone, so they do something that looks like \nmoney laundering, except that it is legal. They might create and give \nmoney to a shell corporation which in turn donates to a super PAC. When \nyou look at the records of the super PAC, which are published only \nabout quarterly, you will see the shell corporation but not the \noriginal source of the money. A company might give money to one shell \ncorporation which, in turn, could give money to another PAC, and so on, \nuntil it finally reaches the ultimate super PAC. With records published \nso infrequently, it is nearly impossible to trace back to the original \ncorporation.\n\n  To make matters even worse, many super PACs have been able to get \npermission from the Federal Election Commission to delay their \ndisclosure statements, rendering all of these supposed disclosures \ncompletely useless.\n  So back to the punch line. Corporations can now spend an unlimited \nsum of money to buy elections, and the American people generally won't \neven know about it. Corporations and superwealthy individuals no longer \nhave to play by any sensible rules when it comes to the checks they \nwrite for campaigns. Citizens United ushered in the wild, wild west of \npolitical spending. But don't take my word for it. Let's look at some \nof the numbers.\n  In the 2010 election, outside groups spent over $280 million on \npolitical ads and other campaign expenses. This is more than double the \namount spent by outside groups in 2008 before the decision, and it is \nmore than five times the amount spent by these groups in 2006. The \nchamber of commerce alone spent more than $32 million on campaigns in \n2010, which is more than any other single outside group, and it is \nnearly double the amount it spent in 2008. Outside groups spent more on \npolitical advertising in 2010 than the official Democratic and \nRepublican Party committees.\n  But that was 2010, when corporations and the superwealthy were just \nbeginning to understand the utility of this amazingly misguided \ndecision. The last several months have given us example after example \nof what big money can do to control the political process.\n  Now, I may not agree with the views of all of the Republican primary \ncandidates--or any of them, for that matter; some of them individually, \nmaybe, but not as a whole--but I do believe that everyone deserves a \nfair shake when they run for office. And a fair election is just not \npossible when corporations and wealthy individuals can swoop in and \ndrown out the voices of hundreds of thousands of Americans with a \nsingle fat check.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich pulled off a surprise win \nin South Carolina. But I would venture to guess it wouldn't have \nhappened if Mr. Gingrich's super PAC hadn't received a $5 million check \nfrom one guy, a multibillionaire from Las Vegas. This super PAC, also \nknown as the group Winning Our Future, used the money to pay for attack \nads against former Governor Mitt Romney. Just a few days ago, it was \nannounced that the wife of this same billionaire wrote another $5 \nmillion check to Mr. Gingrich's super PAC to help him out in Florida. \nNow, I wish I could offer an example of a company writing a similar \ncheck, but as I mentioned before, there is just no way of knowing if \nthey did or didn't because they don't have to disclose it and they can \ntake steps to hide it. But this example of two $5 million checks from \none couple who just happened to be willing to talk about their \ndonations should show just how big we are talking about. This is very, \nvery big money, and it is happening now.\n  To be fair, Mr. Romney has his own super PAC called Restore Our \nFuture, and it is currently outspending every other PAC in Florida by \n20 to 1. I wish I could tell my colleagues how this is possible, but \nthe first disclosure statement for this campaign season won't be out \nuntil the end of this month, and even then it will be hard to trace it \nback to individual companies or people through all the shell \ncorporations and other PACs.\n  This is only the beginning. Hold on to your hats. Over the next 10 \nmonths, I predict we will not just see a flood, but we will see a tidal \nwave of political spending by corporations and the wealthiest of the \nwealthiest Americans, the vast majority of whom are also running these \ncorporations. And what will this mean? It means it will be hard for $25 \nindividual contributions to make any impact when compared to a single \n$5 million check from a superwealthy and super-self-interested \nindividual. Your voice and the voice of millions of Americans like you \nwill be overwhelmed by the voice of a corporation or ``uber'' wealthy \nindividual who can write multimillion-dollar checks without blinking an \neye. All of this is going to happen under a shroud of secrecy.\n  We may not know who is bankrolling these groups, but we do know who \nis hurt by them, and it is all of us--Democrats and Republicans alike. \nNo matter where one's ideology falls or with what political party one \nassociates, I think people will agree with me that this process isn't \nfair. It isn't right, and it is something we need to change.\n  Congress tried to do something about this a little over a year ago \nwhen we took up Chuck Schumer's DISCLOSE Act. Despite overwhelming \npublic support for disclosure laws, this tremendous piece of \nlegislation did not pass. It failed in the Senate by one vote. I am sad \nto say that every Democrat voted for it and every Republican voted \nagainst it. That is a very disappointing outcome because this is an \nissue that affects candidates of both parties. It is one we should all \nbe able to get behind.\n\n  We are all hurt by corporations that can write enormous checks to \ntheir favorite politician, and we are all hurt when wealthy individuals \ncan shield their contributions from the public by donating to shell \ngroups and phony organizations that do nothing but pass\n\n[[Page S101]]\n\nthose dollars on to help the candidate of their choice. This is a \nmatter of transparency and accountability and fairness which should cut \nacross the entire political spectrum.\n  Although we may not agree on everything, I do think we can all agree \nwe need to do more to bring greater transparency to the election \nprocess. A number of my Republican colleagues agree with me--and had \nagreed for years before the Supreme Court further unraveled \nrestrictions on corporate spending.\n  I will read one of the quotes. A good friend of mine, Senator Jeff \nSessions, said:\n\n       I don't like it when a large source of money is out there \n     funding ads and is unaccountable. . . . To the extent we can, \n     I tend to favor disclosure.\n\n  I could go for minute upon minute upon minute reading these quotes. I \nwill not in the interest of time.\n  So this is a problem we all need to recognize, we all need to deal \nwith. Republican Presidential candidates are dealing with it now, but \nsoon it will be the Democrats' turn. So I have teamed up with a number \nof my colleagues, many of whom will be speaking today, to see that \nCongress can take up legislation where we disclose, where we have \ngreater transparency for this out-of-control spending. We are going to \nwork hard to bring our Republican colleagues to the table and get their \nagreement on a path forward. Disclosure will not fix all the evils of \nCitizens United, but it certainly will be a step forward. I hope my \ncolleagues will join with us in this effort, and I hope to be back on \nthe floor many times on this issue.\n  Madam President, I thank you for your indulgence because I have run \nout of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. As \nhe was eloquently telling us, last Saturday was the 2-year anniversary \nof the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that caused our democracy \nto take a giant step back from the values we hold dear in this country. \nIt was a ruling that overturned decades of campaign finance law and \npolicy, allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend \nunlimited amounts of their money influencing our democracy, and blew \nthe door wide open for foreign corporations to spend their money on \nelections right here in the United States.\n  That disastrous decision opened loopholes in our campaign finance \nlaws big enough for the biggest corporations and wealthiest Americans \nto drive truckloads of anonymous money right through, and as we have \nseen over the last 2 years, that is exactly what they have done. Tens \nof millions of dollars have flooded our electoral process, with no \ntransparency, no accountability, no way for the American people to know \nwhere it is coming from or who would benefit from the policies being \nadvocated. This is wrong. It is not the way elections in America are \nsupposed to work.\n  We are a country that believes very strongly that every voice \ndeserves to be heard. If you have a good idea, you can go out and talk \nabout it. If your fellow citizens agree with you, they can stand with \nyou. They can tell their friends and their neighbors and vote for you \nor in support of the issue. That is one of the foundations of our great \ndemocracy. Today it is being subverted. The Citizens United ruling has \ngiven special interest groups and the wealthiest Americans a giant \nmegaphone to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens across America--\nto spend unlimited money and do it with no transparency, no \naccountability.\n  This is a personal issue for me. When I first ran for the Senate back \nin 1992, I was a long-shot candidate with some ideas and a group of \namazing and passionate volunteers by my side. Those volunteers cared \ndeeply about making sure the voices of average Washington State \nfamilies were being represented. They made phone calls. They went door \nto door. They talked to families across my State who wanted more from \ntheir government. Well, we ended up winning that grassroots campaign \nbecause the people's voices were heard loudly and clearly. But to be \nhonest, I do not think it would have been possible if corporations and \nspecial interests had been able to drown out their voices with a \nbarrage of anonymous negative ads.\n  My story is not unique. In every election across the country, \nordinary citizens make the decision to get involved in the political \nprocess. They lace up their shoes, hit the streets, and make their case \nto their fellow citizens. They ask their friends and their neighbors \nfor financial support to help them spread their ideas. And they \npublicly--publicly--release the names and contributions of everyone who \nsupports their campaign.\n  These men and women come from all different walks of life, and they \neach have their own reasons for running, but for most of our Nation's \nhistory, they had a shot. They could compete. Ordinary Americans who \nwanted to get involved in public service to improve their community or \ntheir State or their Nation could do that because their voice could be \nheard. But if Citizens United is allowed to stand, these Americans are \ngoing to be drowned out and beaten down by the onslaught of unlimited \nand anonymous money special interests can throw into races to support \nthe candidates who agree with them, the candidates who will be good for \ntheir own bottom line and who will not threaten the loopholes and \nsubsidies or tax breaks from which their financial backers profit. This \nis wrong. It needs to end.\n  Last session, I was proud to support legislation--the DISCLOSE Act--\nthat would shine a bright spotlight on this process and force special \ninterest groups and CEOs to take responsibility for the ads they put on \nthe airwaves--the same way candidates do. That bill would have \nstrengthened overall disclosure requirements for groups that are \nattempting to sway our elections. It would have banned foreign \ncorporations and special interest groups from spending in U.S. \nelections, made sure corporations are not hiding their election \nspending from their shareholders, limited election spending by \ngovernment contractors to make sure taxpayer funding is never used to \ninfluence an election, and would have banned coordination between \ncandidates and outside groups on advertising so corporations and \nspecial interest groups can never sponsor a candidate.\n  That bill was blocked on the Senate floor last session, but we cannot \ngive up. We need to overturn Citizens United and hand democracy back to \nour citizens. Anyone who believes special interest groups and big \ncorporations should not be able to spend unlimited money influencing \nour elections without any accountability or any transparency should \nsupport this effort. Anyone who believes foreign entities should have \nno right to influence U.S. elections should stand by our side. And \nanyone who agrees with Justice Brandeis that ``sunlight is the best \ndisinfectant'' should drop their opposition to this and work with us to \nget this done.\n  Throughout the history of our great Nation, ordinary citizens have \nhad a strong voice in our electoral process. The Citizens United \ndecision is a threat to that critical foundation of or democracy, and 2 \nyears later, it is clearer than ever that we cannot allow it the stand. \nSo I thank all of our colleagues who are speaking out here on this \nfloor and vow to continue to work with them to right this wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am proud to follow the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Washington who has spoken so \npowerfully on this issue, which is especially appropriate at this time \nbecause we do mark the 2-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's \nmomentous and misguided decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission. That decision strikes at the core of democratic ideals and \nprinciples, not just because it opens the floodgates for money that can \ndrown out the voices of millions of ordinary Americans in the political \nprocess, but it also demonstrates the results of judicial activism at \nits worst. In that case, the Court, by a 5-to-4 margin, held that \ncorporations have a first amendment right to spend unlimited amounts of \nmoney in the service of political candidates and that those rights \ncannot be abridged by placing limits on their\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\nindependent spending for political purposes.\n  This decision not only expanded the ability of wealthy individuals \nand large corporations to flood out the voices of millions of ordinary \nAmericans, it also reversed nearly a century of existing law and struck \ndown the validly approved--by this Congress--Bipartisan Campaign Reform \nAct, approved in 2002. The purpose of that act was to limit the \ncorrosive influence of money on our political process that has been \ndiscussed and denounced by Members of this body again and again and \nagain and by the President of the United States as recently as a couple \nnights ago.\n  This decision, in my view, was wrong as a matter of law as well as \npolicy. It enables unlimited anonymous money to be contributed in \nsupport of or opposition to candidates. It allows the wealthy and \npowerful to have a disproportionate voice in the most important and \nfundamental aspect of our democracy--a free and fair election that \ncounts everyone's vote equally.\n  The shock waves of that decision in Citizens United are reverberating \nnow with increasing impact throughout our political system. We can see \nthem every day, literally, in the ads that appear on TV in major \nmarkets in the primary States and throughout the country that could and \nwould--might as well be in the voices of the candidates themselves. \nOutside groups spent four times as much money in the 2010 midterms as \nin the 2006 midterms--nearly $300 million. Nearly half of the money \nspent in the 2010 elections was spent by just 10 groups. Outside \nspending per race tilted in favor of the winning candidate in 60 of the \n75 contests last year where power changed hands. This impact is visible \nand tangible, undeniable in our political process. It is right before \nus, as visible as the desks and people in this Chamber. That impact can \nbe expected to grow dramatically in 2013, as spending in the \nPresidential years is typically much higher than in the midterm \nelections.\n  According to opensecrets.org, which tracks political spending, as of \ntoday, 296 groups organized as super PACs have already reported \nspending nearly $41 million on the upcoming election. These super PACs \nare banned from explicitly coordinating with the candidate they \nsupport, but they are operated and controlled by supporters, many of \nthem former staff members. Their collaboration and confederacy are no \nless impactful because of that rule barring explicit coordination.\n  We must act to limit the destructive effects of Citizens United \nbefore it permanently alters the nature of our political system, \nundermining it forever and eviscerating the fundamental rights and \nfreedoms that are protected by our Constitution.\n  I am a strong proponent of legislative proposals to force \ncorporations and individuals to disclose their enormous donations and \nexpenditures to the public--a number of them have been mentioned by my \ncolleagues--and I support them. The Supreme Court's opinion in Citizens \nUnited naively argued that voters could readily learn the identity of \ncompanies behind these corporate-funded political advertisements. But \nthe fact is otherwise.\n  Nearly half of the $300 million spent by outside groups in 2006 came \nfrom groups that did not disclose their funding source. We must pass \ndisclosure legislation immediately to at least allow sunshine to rein \nin the worst excesses of this new system, to give ordinary Americans \nthe knowledge they need so that disclosure protects their freedom.\n  But I also believe we need to go further, and that is why I am a \ncosponsor of the constitutional amendment that would reverse this \ndecision. The amendment, S.J. Res. 29, would reiterate what we all \nbelieved the law to be before Citizens United. That resolution \nclarifies, and the amendment would do so, that Congress does indeed \nhave the power ``to regulate the raising and spending of money and in \nkind equivalents with respect to Federal elections and that States have \nthe authority with regard to State elections to do the same.''\n  I know that amending the Constitution is not easy, and supporting a \nproposed amendment is not something I do lightly. But, unfortunately, \nthe Supreme Court has clearly demonstrated that it will permit \nunchecked corporate power over elections, and the task is then for \nCongress and the States and the people to restrain such spending and \nthereby rein in the Supreme Court.\n  Many have seen Citizens United as an expression of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt's judicial activism in favor of well-funded and well-lawyered \ncorporations, often at the expense of vulnerable Americans, and there \nis support for that view of the Supreme Court trend in decisions.\n  In AT v. Concepcion, it expanded the ability of companies to force \nconsumers into secretive binding arbitration agreements. In Wal-Mart v. \nDukes, it restricted the ability of similarly situated persons, \nincluding female employees who faced discrimination in the workplace, \nto ban together and seek redress against a powerful company.\n  In PLIVA v. Mensing, a case involving a woman who sustained injuries \nfrom a drug company's failure to properly disclose the risk of a \ngeneric drug, the Court sided with the drug companies, holding that a \ngeneric drug company is not liable under State law for failing to \nnotify the FDA or the consumer about newly discovered risks of the \ndrug.\n  In Sorrell v. IMF Health, the Court overturned a Vermont law intended \nto prevent improper and invasive practices of drug companies tracking \ndoctors' prescriptions to patients. Just 2 weeks ago, in CompuCredit v. \nGreenberg, the Court halted a class action lawsuit by consumers who \nsigned up for a credit card marketed to individuals with poor credit \nhistories. Each of those decisions and others has been interpreted as \npart of a pattern that led the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a \nhearing a few months ago entitled: ``Barriers to Justice and \nAccountability: How the Supreme Court's Recent Rulings will Affect \nCorporate Behavior.''\n  But more important than that perception and the appearance of that \nfavoritism in judicial activism is the activism itself, the potential \noverreaching that undermines the faith and confidence of people in the \nCourt. Citizens United exemplifies judicial activism at its worst. \nPeople want limits on the corrosive and corrupting influence of money. \nThey want restraints on the power of corporations and wealthy \nindividuals to fund----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. In closing, people speak through their legislature. \nThe judiciary struck down a measure through which the people spoke to \nplace those limits on the ability of corporations to shape results, and \nthe judiciary now should be overturned through a constitutional \namendment that restores the Democratic voice of the people as a whole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon State.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, my colleagues and I come here today to \nspeak out against the hijacking of American democracy by powerful \nspecial interests. It was 2 years ago this last Saturday that the \nSupreme Court found in Citizens United that unlimited secret funding of \ncampaigns in America is just fine. This is not an opinion shared by \nAmericans who understand that secret donations corrupt the electoral \nprocess. It is not an opinion shared by virtually everyone who serves \nin this body, who has come to this floor and talked about transparency \nand accountability. Certainly it is a viewpoint that would be very \nstrange to the authors of the Constitution.\n  What are those first beautiful three words of the Constitution? Are \nthey, ``We the powerful''? Are they, ``We the special interests''? No, \nthey are not. Those three words are, ``We the people.'' Virtually every \nschoolchild in America can tell you that. ``We the people.'' That is \nwhat American democracy is all about.\n  The entire Constitution is written for the prosperity and success for \nthe rights of the citizens of the United States of America. Indeed, it \nwas President Lincoln who captured the genius of American democracy in \nthis phrase: A government of the people, a government by the people, \nfor the people.\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\n  Citizens United is the opposite. Secret unlimited donations are an \ninstrument of the powerful. Secret unlimited donations are an \ninstrument of very large companies. Our Constitution honors free \nspeech. The first amendment is about free speech. It recognizes how \nimportant it is that citizens are able to openly debate the merits of \ncandidates and the merits of ideas. But the action of the first \namendment is that competing voices must be heard and measured against \neach other in a marketplace of ideas. But that falls apart under \nCitizens United.\n  Under Citizens United, the torrent of cash amounts to the equivalent \nof a stadium sound system drowning out the voices of the people. Let me \ngive you an example of what I am talking about. If you were to take a \nvery successful company in 2008--I will choose one, Exxon, a very \nprofitable company--if it had spent 3 percent of its net profits in \n2008, that money would have been equal to the money spent by all \nAmericans on the Presidential campaign. One company, one board room, \none proposal, spending 3 percent--only 3 out of 100--of the net \nprofits, equivalent to all money spent by all of the rest of America on \na Presidential election. That completely corrupts the concept of a \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people.\n  Now, in 2012 we are seeing the results. I am going to put up a chart. \nTake a little comparison. We see that spending in 2008 at this point in \nthe campaign was about $23 million. About half of that, where these \nblue arrows come to, was coming from independent expenditures. The \nother half was coming from candidates and parties.\n  Well, here we are 4 years later, post-Citizens United. Look down \nhere, and you will see the very small amount that comes from candidates \nand parties. You will see this enormous part of the funding coming from \nindependent parties. Ninety-five percent up to this point is coming \nfrom independent parties. Well, the number went from 26 to 45, and the \namount spent through the ordinary system has dropped massively. This is \nthe special interest impact on American elections. This is the impact \nof the powerful on American elections.\n  Now, let's look at the campaigns to date for the Presidency. The Iowa \ncaucuses: Newt Gingrich started to rise to the top of the polls, but \nthen super PACs supporting Mitt Romney weighed in. They came to town \nand they spent a huge amount of money. When caucus night came, Gingrich \nlost, and he lost badly.\n  Newt Gingrich commented, ``For a State this size,'' referring to \nIowa, ``to spend that number of dollars in negative ads aimed at one \ncandidate is pretty amazing.''\n  It is amazing and it is effective. The story changes when Newt \nGingrich had a super PAC of his own that came in with $5 million in \nSouth Carolina. Instead of being defeated, he won. The pattern is \nclear. The message is clear: The vast expenditures of secret powerful \nmoney make an enormous difference in who wins elections.\n  Why is this corrupting? Every person on this floor, every one of us \nsees that pattern. Everyone running across this country sees that \npattern. It means, when the powerful come to an individual and say: You \nare going to run. This is my position. Will you not back it? And they \nknow that company can put millions into their race, that corrupts the \nprocess.\n  When a bill is on the floor of this Chamber and someone knows the \nperson backing that bill can spend millions of dollars in the upcoming \nrace, that corrupts this process. That is not what American democracy \nis all about. So we must change that. We must have full disclosure of \ndonors. We must have timely disclosure of donors. We must have \ncommonsense limitations on how money is raised and how it is spent. \nThat is why with others, I have joined to back Senator Tom Udall's \nconstitutional amendment that makes it very clear that is exactly what \ncan be done.\n  This does not constrain speech; this makes free speech work as \ndesigned in the Constitution for the citizens in a government by and \nfor the people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I commend my colleague from Oregon for \nhis statement.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak \nimmediately after Senator Wyden for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from New York for his courtesy. I too \nwill be brief. It is an extraordinary honor to represent Oregon in the \nSenate. Having this special privilege, I have tried to make the \nlodestar of my service transparency and accountability. It is why I \nworked with the distinguished Senator from Missouri Mrs. McCaskill to \nend secret holds in the Senate.\n  I have had more than 600 open town meetings. That is why we take \nlegislative drafts and put them online so citizens can comment wherever \npossible. It is all about transparency and accountability. Today's \ncampaign finance system is neither. It is not transparent, it is not \npossible for Americans to see who is giving what sums to what \nparticular candidate, and there is no accountability--certainly no \naccountability in the sense that when people go to the polls in Vermont \nor New Hampshire or New York or anywhere else people know who has given \na donation so that they can factor that in to their political judgment.\n  With the explosion of mass media, the tradition of negative \ncampaigning through pamphleteers and partisans has grown and grown to \nthe point where the typical voter cannot find a way to avoid the flood \nof half truths and outright falsehoods. It becomes even harder to send \nthe message that voters want; that is, we made our choice because we \nhave full and complete information.\n  Now, all of this was getting worse until the Congress came together \nto take two steps. The first was Congress enacted regulations of \nindependent expenditures and eliminated the so-called soft corporate \nmoney that had begun to overwhelm the process.\n  The second step--and I want to thank Senator Collins from Maine for \nworking with me on this issue--is we passed what is called ``stand by \nyour ad.''\n  This is the law that requires candidates who sponsor political ads to \ntake individual responsibility for their ads and state in the ads that \nthey ``approve this message.'' I thank Senator Schumer, who has been a \nchampion for this kind of accountability for years.\n  That is where we were until the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \nCitizens United drove the system right back into the mud. Through this \ndecision, the Supreme Court has seen fit to create what amounts to a \nnew route for massive sums of unreported, unaccountable, and \nunacceptable spending to drown out any responsible discourse. In my \nview, this decision degrades our democracy and creates the appearance \nthat the American Government is simply up for sale to the highest \ncorporate bidder.\n  This decision by the 5-to-4 majority on the Supreme Court overturned \nalmost a century of precedent and undermined the intent of the \nFounders. The decision, in my view, reflects a lack of understanding \nabout a political process and an inability to see the corrosive effect \nof massive and hidden expenditures.\n  Justice Kennedy, in the decision, specifically said this:\n\n       We now conclude that independent expenditures, including \n     those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or \n     the appearance of corruption.\n\n  In effect, it was the opinion of the Court that if Disney or Comcast \nor British Petroleum spends $20 million in an otherwise $10 million \nSenate race advocating one candidate, that newly elected Senator will \nnot even have the appearance of working in their corporate interests \ninstead of the public interest. In my view, that kind of reasoning does \nnot pass the smell test. This is the sort of decision that ought to be \nleft to the branch of government with constituents who understand not \njust the theory but the reality of elections.\n  It is incumbent upon the Congress, whose members do understand the \nelectoral system, to begin the process of restoring balance to the \nmechanisms of democracy. This needs to be done before our elections are \nentirely overrun by shadowy interests warring unchecked, using the \npolitical system and American voters as pawns.\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\n  My final point is that I do not reach this judgment lightly. I \nbelieve constitutional amendments ought to be reserved for those \nsituations when the delicate balance set up by the Founders has been \nupset by time, circumstance, or, in this case, a sudden and ill-\nconsidered change in the jurisprudence that governs our system. That is \nthe situation we face today, and it is why I have decided to add my \nname to the sponsors of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to again call for increased \ndisclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures so the American \npeople are informed about who is spending in our elections.\n  I thank my colleagues from Oregon, Senator Wyden and Senator Merkley, \nfor their good remarks, as well as many of the others who have spoken.\n  This week marks the second anniversary of the Supreme Court's \nappalling decision in Citizens United, in which Chief Justice Roberts \nand his cohort of activist judges overturned a century of legal \nprecedent and created a flood of special interest group spending \ncoursing through the veins of American elections.\n  It is my view this decision has done more to poison our politics than \nmost any other in recent times. In fact, some have argued this is the \nworst decision the Supreme Court has made since Plessy v. Ferguson. I \nagree a great deal with that argument.\n  The Court's decision created a loophole that allowed entities to \ncreate groups to serve as a conduit to anonymously funnel money and \nmislead the public about their true motives. The decision has also led \nto the creation of super PACs, which are not only able to receive \nunlimited contributions and spend money at unprecedented levels, they \nare able to do so without accountability, working under the protective \nshadow of anonymity. As a result, a multimillionaire individual, \ncorporations, and labor unions could spend $1 million or $5 million or \n$10 million against a candidate because they didn't like his or her \nstand on the environment, but all the ads would talk about would be, \nsay, gay marriage. Nobody would know where the ads came from.\n  What the decision does is make our people feel more and more distant \nfrom our politics and our government. That is corrosive--vituperatively \ncorrosive for any democracy. What has happened since this decision is \nappalling. I sometimes wonder what our Supreme Court Justices are \nthinking as they watch what is happening. Can they hide up in their \nivory tower and say this is the first amendment at work? They know \nbetter than anybody that no amendment is absolute. They know we can't \nscream fire falsely in a crowded theater and we have libel laws, child \npornography laws, and other kinds of laws that balance the needs of the \nfirst amendment with other societal needs.\n  One of the foremost needs of our society is for a fair functioning \ndemocracy, where there is some semblance of equality, that each person \nwho votes has the same weight in the system. We know money \ncounterbalances that fundamental fairness, but never has the balance \nbeen so put out of whack as by this decision. This decision--it is hard \nto believe that our Supreme Court Justices, whatever their ideology, \nwent for this. I hope some of them are paying attention.\n  To be honest with you, I sat behind the Supreme Court Justices at the \nState of the Union Address. I was so tempted to talk to them about \nthis, but I wasn't sure if that was appropriate protocol. I hope they \nare listening today--particularly Justice Kennedy, the swing vote, who \nwrote the majority decision. I hope they will listen to what we are \nsaying because what they are doing is undoing our democracy. It is that \nfundamental.\n  In short, the Citizens United decision represents one of the most \ncorrosive and destructive changes in law that has occurred in recent \nmemory. Democracy is already struggling to stay afloat in a sea of \npowerful special interests, and this decision is an anchor around its \nneck.\n  In my judgment, there is no more important step we can take to ensure \nAmerica's continued greatness than to fight back against this deeply \nflawed decision allowing anonymous special interests to subvert \ndemocracy. The need for reform is urgent.\n  Last Congress, I sponsored the Disclose Act to foster effective \ndisclosure. I pledged my continuing commitment to fight for disclosure \nlegislation in this Congress. The Disclose Act failed to get cloture by \none vote. I hope the level of unmitigated spending in the Republican \nprimary has changed the minds of the opponents. As we have seen, we now \nhave a system where a single person can change the course of an \nelection. That is a system more like monarchy than a democracy.\n\n  This is not a partisan issue. There are super PACs and other kinds of \nanonymous giving on both sides. In fact, two of the leading candidates \nfor the Republican Presidential nomination called super PACs ``totally \nirresponsible, totally secret'' and ``a disaster . . . [that] makes a \nmockery out of our political campaign season.'' That wasn't me or \nSenator Shaheen or Bernie Sanders speaking. One quote came from Newt \nGingrich and one quote came from Mitt Romney.\n  Disclosure will lift the curtain of secrecy and at least reveal the \ntrue identity of these organizations. One of the Supreme Court \nJustices' predecessors, Justice Brandeis, said, ``Sunlight is the \ngreatest disinfectant.'' People would not have malicious, pernicious, \nand false ads if they had to disclose who they are. It is plain and \nsimple. But if you can hide behind the shroud of secrecy and put \nunlimited money into these campaigns, as the Supreme Court decision \nallows--and we have not changed it because our colleagues on the other \nside are even against disclosure, which, of course, is allowed by the \nlaw--the American democracy gets weaker.\n  Even eight of the nine Justices, in the activist and overreaching \ndecision in Citizens United, agreed that the American people deserve \nmeaningful disclosure. That makes the decision even more galling \nbecause they didn't require disclosure or limit what they did in light \nof the fact that we don't have disclosure, as they wrote. The Court \nfound, though, that there was a strong governmental interest in \n``providing the electorate with information about the sources of \nelection-related funding.''\n  In conclusion, we cannot afford to be complacent while our democracy \nis under attack. The effect of the Court's decision is clear. The flood \nof secret money has begun cascading through our election system, and \nthe American people need us to act. Spending by special interest groups \nmust be checked, and the very least we can do is demand that these \ngroups step into the light and identify themselves.\n  The Citizens United decision is a poison coursing through our body \npolitic and disclosure is the antidote.\n  I yield the floor. If Mr. Coats is not here, with the permission of \nthe minority, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New \nHampshire be allowed to proceed immediately after me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, to all of my colleagues who have come to \nthe floor today to talk about the critical nature of spending in our \ncampaigns, I say I am pleased to join them to talk about the importance \nof preserving our representative democracy by restoring some \ncommonsense restrictions to our Nation's campaign finance system.\n  As we have heard, Saturday was the second anniversary of the Supreme \nCourt decision in the case of Citizens United v. The Federal Election \nCommittee. Already we have seen how that decision has altered the \nlandscape of politics in this country.\n  When the Supreme Court struck down limits on corporate financing of \nelections, it ushered in the age of the super PAC. These so-called \nsuper PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money during \npolitical campaigns with very limited disclosure requirements.\n  This election cycle the floodgates have opened. Super PACs have \nalready spent over $30 million in the 2012 cycle, and the election is \nstill 10 months away. That amount of money is staggering.\n  When I was home over the holidays in New Hampshire, before our \nPresidential primary, I witnessed firsthand that influx of corporate \ncash and what\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nit does to the Presidential election. Negative ads paid for by the \nsuper PACs contributed to disaffecting our voters and drowning out the \nvoices of the people, those ordinary, everyday citizens of New \nHampshire who aren't able to put in tens of thousands of dollars, in \nsome cases millions, to affect the outcome of an election.\n  This has to stop. This is not a partisan issue. The commonsense \nrestrictions that were struck down in the Citizens United decision were \npart of legislation like the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, \notherwise known as McCain-Feingold. That thoughtful legislation which \nhad broad, bipartisan support limited soft money and corporate funding \nof political ads and campaign spending in a way that made sense.\n  Our campaign finance system has gotten way off course. It is time for \nus in the Congress to help put it back on track. The unchecked \ninfluence of money in our elections compromises the very future of our \nrepresentative democracy.\n  The monied special interests and corporations have been given free \nrein to spend unlimited amounts of money during campaigns, and they do \nnot need our help being heard. It is homeowners struggling to pay their \nmortgages, parents who want to send their children to college but \naren't sure how they can afford it, and unemployed workers who are \nlooking for jobs and hoping tomorrow will be better than today--those \nare the voices that are being drowned out in a sea of corporate and \nspecial interest cash, and those are the voices of the American people \nwho need to be heard in Washington.\n  So on the second anniversary of this decision, as we think about what \nwe need to do to address this and to change the negative direction it \nis taking this country, I urge all of my colleagues to turn their \nattention to this important work and to reach across the aisle to build \nconsensus on this issue. Let's all tell the American people that we \nhear their voices calling for change.\n  I look forward to speaking with all of my colleagues in the coming \nweeks and months about the specific approaches we can take to repair \nour broken campaign finance system, and I hope we will have the courage \nand the commitment to do something about this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I very much appreciate \njoining all my colleagues on the floor who have been speaking about the \nCitizens United case. I think what we are seeing in the Senate is what \nwe are seeing in the country. The citizens of this country are \nconcerned about unlimited corporate funds in campaigns, and Senators \nwho are also concerned about that are standing and speaking out, as I \nknow our Presiding Officer has, and are offering constitutional \namendments in trying to resolve the situation we have before us.\n  Two years ago this week, the Supreme Court issued its misguided \ndecision in Citizens United v. FEC. Citizens United was a victory for \nspecial interests at the expense of the average American. It held that \ncorporations deserve the same free speech protections as individual \nAmericans. It enables these corporations to spend freely from their \ntreasuries on campaign advertising. It also gave rise to so-called \nsuper PACs that we are seeing too much of. These super PACs can raise \nand spend unlimited funds to campaign for or against candidates.\n  Now, what do we mean by corporate treasuries and super PACs? Let me \ncite an example. Exxon--the large oil company--has $80 billion in its \ncorporate treasury. If Exxon wanted to go out and create a super PAC or \ncontribute to these 200-plus super PACs that are out there to the tune \nof $80 billion, it could do it. That is what the Supreme Court opened \nin terms of its ruling.\n  The toxic effect of this ruling has become brutally clear in the last \n2 years. The Citizens United decision opened the floodgates to \nunprecedented campaign spending, drowning out the voices of ordinary \nAmericans. Huge sums of unregulated, unaccountable money are flooding \nthe airwaves. An endless wave of attack ads, paid for by billionaires, \nis poisoning our political discourse. The American public--rightly so--\nlooks on in disgust. As we head into the election year, this bad \nsituation will only get worse. The checkbooks are out, and the money is \ngushing. Citizens United really means citizens denied--denied a fair \nplaying field, denied an equitable influence in our political system, \ndenied their right to be truly heard, and denied the right to even know \nwho is spending all of this money.\n  While much of the focus this week is on Citizens United, we must \nrealize that the corruption of our campaign finance system did not \nsuddenly happen 2 years ago. The Citizens United decision sparked a \nrenewed focus on the need for reform, but the Supreme Court laid the \ngroundwork for a broken system many years ago.\n  In 1976, the Court held in Buckley v. Valeo that restricting \ncandidate campaign expenditures violates the first amendment right to \nfree speech. It established the flawed precedent that money and speech \nare the same. Since then, the influence of money has continued to play \nan increasing role in our Nation's elections. Sadly, in many cases, a \ncandidate's ability to either raise money or self-finance can outweigh \nthe quality of a candidate's ideas or dedication to public service.\n  The Buckley and Citizens United decisions, among others, demonstrate \nthe Court's willingness to ignore longstanding precedent and declare \nour campaign finance laws unconstitutional. Because of this, I believe \nthe only way to truly fix the problem is to first amend the \nConstitution and grant Congress clear authority to regulate the \ncampaign finance system. In November of last year, I introduced such an \namendment. I am proud to say it currently has 19 cosponsors and support \ncontinues to grow.\n  Our proposed constitutional amendment is broadly tailored and similar \nto bipartisan proposals introduced in previous sessions of Congress \ndating back to 1983. It would authorize Congress to regulate the \nraising and spending of money for Federal political campaigns, \nincluding independent expenditures, and it would allow States to \nregulate such spending at their level. It would not dictate any \nspecific policies or regulations.\n  I chose my approach to not only overturn the previous bad Court \ndecisions but also to prevent future ones. We don't know what a future \nCourt may do. In Citizens United, the Court upheld campaign \ncontribution disclosure requirements. A future Court might declare the \nsame laws unconstitutional. Our amendment would remedy this problem by \nrestoring Congress's authority--stripped by Buckley v. Valeo and \nsubsequent decisions--to regulate the campaign finance system. If \nratified, the amendment would ensure that campaign finance laws would \nstand constitutional challenges regardless of the makeup of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  The text of my constitutional amendment and any of the others is less \nimportant right now than the concept. Hearings can be held, and the \ntext can be worked out. That is really the easy part of a difficult \nprocess. What is harder to achieve--and something we rarely see in our \ncountry--is gaining the widespread support necessary to amend the \nConstitution.\n  The Citizens United decision was disastrous, and it may have been the \nvery catalyst we needed to build a movement to amend the Constitution. \nThere is a groundswell of support growing across the country for a \nconstitutional amendment to rein in the out-of-control campaign finance \nsystem. City councils, from places as diverse as Los Angeles and New \nYork to Missoula, MT, have endorsed resolutions calling on Congress to \npass an amendment. Several grassroots organizations and coalitions have \nformed to advocate an amendment. Hundreds of thousands of citizens have \nsigned petitions. Is it difficult to amend the Constitution? Yes, and \nit should be. But I believe the growing momentum demonstrates that this \nis the right time for Congress to act.\n  Our Founders did not intend for elections to be bought and paid for \nby secretive super PACs. Our Founders did not bequeath a government of \nthe millionaires, by the millionaires, and for the millionaires. Money \ncan have a corrosive effect on the political process. We have seen \nevidence of that in campaigns at all levels of government.\n  We need to put elections back in the hands of average Americans and \nnot in\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\nthe hands of special interests with unlimited bank accounts. We need to \nanswer to the American people and not just to the privileged. Our \nNation cannot afford a system that says ``come on in'' to the rich and \npowerful but then says ``don't bother'' to everyone else. The faith of \nthe American people in their electoral system is being corrupted by big \nmoney. It is time to restore that faith. It is time for Congress to \ntake back control. It is time for a constitutional amendment that will \nallow real reform.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S106-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S106-S108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DRUG SHORTAGE CRISIS\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the drug \nshortage crisis that is continuing to spread across the country. I am \nproud to stand here today with my friend and colleague, Senator Susan \nCollins of Maine, who has been a leader on this issue and who shares my \nconcern for so many patients who are struggling to find much needed \nmedication. This is a crisis that has grown to such proportion that \ncurrent drug shortages have impacted individuals all across the \ncountry, forcing some patients to delay their lifesaving treatments or \nuse unproven, less effective alternatives. In some cases, drug \nshortages have even resulted in patient deaths. Enough is enough. We \ncan no longer just simply talk about this issue and have meetings. We \nneed to act.\n  Here is one story. A few months ago, I met a young boy named Axel \nZirbes. Axel has bright eyes and a big smile. He also happens to have \nno hair on his head because he has childhood leukemia. When his parents \nfound he had leukemia, and he was scheduled to start chemotherapy \ntreatment last year, they learned that an essential drug--Cytarabine--\nwas in short supply and might not be available for their son. \nUnderstandably, they were thrown into a panic, desperately looking for \nany available alternatives. They even prepared and made plans to take \nAxel to Canada, where the drug was still readily available. \nFortunately, it didn't come to that.\n  But Axel and his parents are not alone. Earlier this month, I held a \nforum in Edina, MN, where a woman by the name of Mary McHugh Morrison \nshared her story of how she struggled with the shortage of the \nchemotherapy drug Doxil. When Doxil went into shortage last year, Mary \nwas in the middle of her chemotherapy regimen and was shocked when her \ndoctor told her they had actually run out of the drug necessary to \ncontinue her treatment. This is in Minnesota, where we have excellent \nhealth care, as you know, Mr. President. Literally, they ran out of the \ndrug in the middle of a chemotherapy treatment.\n  While trying to get herself added to a wait list, Mary was able to \ncall around to other hospitals and clinics in her area in search of any \navailable Doxil and was able to find extra treatments four separate \ntimes. She actually talked to the forum about how she grappled with the \nethics of the fact that because she knew people and was able to call \naround and get this, that she was taking this limited drug out of \nsupply for herself and not for other patients.\n  However, because of a few delays in the treatment, Mary's doctor told \nher that her tumor had, unfortunately, returned and that she was no \nlonger responding to Doxil. She is now going without treatment and, \ndepending on her health condition, could be placed on a clinical trial \nat the Mayo Clinic in March.\n  But these shortages aren't just affecting cancer patients. There are \nalso shortages in drugs that help people improve their quality of life. \nJust this week, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that hundreds of \npatients in the Minnesota Sleep Disorder Center at Hennepin County \nMedical Center have suffered a shortage of Ritalin, Adderall, and their \ngeneric equivalents. These shortages have had significant impacts on \nthese patients' quality of life, oftentimes forcing them to pay \nhundreds more dollars for expensive alternatives or professionals \nrisking their careers to adjust to their diseases and spending extra \nhours and days of time trying to find ways to fill their prescriptions \nor their pharmacists doing that or their doctors doing that or their \nnurses doing that. We know how difficult this health care system is \nanyway, and now we are putting patients in this position and wasting \nthe time of medical professionals to find drugs that should be readily \navailable.\n  These are just a few examples of real people who are just trying to \ndeal with their disease, and there are many more like them.\n  Across the country, hospitals, physicians, and pharmacists are \nconfronting unprecedented shortages. Many of these are generic drug \nproducts that have been widely used for years and are proven effective. \nMany of them are for cancer. The number of drug shortages has more than \ntripled over the last 6 years--and if you don't believe my stories, \nlisten to this--jumping from 61 drug products that were in shortage in \n2005 to more than 200 last year. That is not 200 instances, that is 200 \ndifferent kinds of drugs that affect hundreds of thousands and millions \nof patients across this country. A survey by the American Hospital \nAssociation found that virtually every single hospital in the United \nStates of America has experienced shortages of critical drugs in the \npast 6 months. More than 80 percent reported delays in patient \ntreatment due to a shortage. These aren't just a few stories that come \ninto our office anymore, these are the facts.\n  For some of these drugs, no substitutes are available or, if they \nare, they may be less effective and may involve greater risk of adverse \nside effects. The chance of medical errors also rises as providers are \nforced to use second- or third-tier drugs with which they are less \nfamiliar.\n  A survey conducted by the American Hospital Association showed that \nnearly 100 percent of their hospitals experienced a shortage. Another \nsurvey conducted by Premier Health System showed that 89 percent of its \nhospitals and pharmacists experienced shortages that may have caused a \nmedication safety issue or error in patient care.\n  It is clear that there are a large number of overlapping factors that \nare resulting in unprecedented shortages. Experts cite a number of \nfactors that are responsible. These include market consolidation and \npoor business incentives, manufacturing problems, production delays, \nunexpected increases in demand for a drug, inability to procure raw \nmaterials, and even--and this is a new phenomenon--the influence of a \n``gray market,'' where middlemen are literally hoarding the drugs \nbecause they have heard there is going to be a shortage.\n  Financial decisions in the pharmaceutical industry are also a major \nfactor. Many of these medications are in short supply because companies \nhave simply stopped production. They decided it wasn't profitable \nenough to keep producing them. Mergers in the drug industry have \nnarrowed the focus of production lines. As a result, some products are \ndiscontinued or production has moved to different sites, leading to \ndelays. When drugs are made by only a few companies, a decision by any \none drugmaker can have a large impact.\n  To help correct a poor market environment or to prevent ``gray \nmarket'' drugs from contaminating our medication supply chain, we must \naddress the drug shortage problem at its root. Last year, I introduced \nthe Preserving Access to Life-Saving Medications Act to address this \nissue. With the support and leadership of Senator Collins, Senator Bob \nCasey, and others, this bipartisan bill would require drug \nmanufacturers to provide early notification to the FDA whenever there \nis a factor that may lead to a shortage. This will help the FDA take \nthe lead in working with pharmacy groups, drug manufacturers, and \nhealth care providers to better manage and prepare for impending \nshortages, more effectively manage those shortages when they occur, and\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\nminimize--and that is what we want to do--their impact on patient care. \nThe legislation would also direct the FDA to provide up-to-date public \ninformation of a shortage situation and the actions the agency would \ntake to address them.\n  Additionally, the bill requires the FDA to develop an evidence-based \nlist of drugs vulnerable to shortages and to work with the \nmanufacturers to come up with a continuity of operations plan to \naddress potential problems that may result in a shortage. The bill \nwould also direct the FDA to establish an expedited reinspection \nprocess for manufacturers of a product in shortage. With manufacturers \nproviding early notification, the FDA's drug shortage team--and they do \nnow have a drug shortage team--can then appropriately use their tools \nto prevent shortages from happening.\n  If you think this wouldn't work, in the last 2 years the FDA, with \nmore information, has successfully prevented nearly 200 drug shortages. \nSo it does work when they get the information. But nothing requires \nthem to get the information, and that is what we are trying to do \ntoday. It is not the end-all, be-all solution for the long term, but at \nleast in the short term, when these patients are experiencing these \ndrug shortages that can impact their treatment, that can impact their \nlives, it gives the FDA that extra tool to look for alternative drugs. \nIf they can't find them in this country, maybe they can find them in \nCanada. But it puts the patient first, not the drug companies.\n  At the urging of the bipartisan work group I have been involved in, \nthe FDA held a public workshop last September that brought together \npatient advocates, industry, consumer groups, health care \nprofessionals, and researchers to discuss the causes and the impact of \ndrug shortages and possible strategies for preventing or mitigating \nfuture shortages.\n  In addition to the workshop, we have been speaking with a broad range \nof stakeholders to try to discover why we have seen such a large number \nof shortages over the past few years. This current explosion of \nshortages appears to be a consequence of a lack of supply of certain \nproducts to keep up with the substantial expansion in the scope and \ndemand for these products. We must ensure we have the manufacturing \ncapabilities to keep up with the demand.\n  There are a lot of ideas for incentives and pricing, but we also know \nthat those will take a long time to take effect on the immediate \nshortage problem. That is why we want to get this bill passed--and \npassed very soon.\n  The President has issued an Executive order, which is helpful, but it \nstill doesn't get at the very serious problem of the kinds of drug \nshortages we are seeing. The Executive order pushes drug companies to \nnotify the FDA of impending shortages, expands the FDA's current \nefforts, and instructs the FDA to work with the Department of Justice. \nBut there is still much more work to be done. Patients such as Axel or \nMary shouldn't have to be burdened with the added stress and worry \nabout whether they have enough medicine. It is time for action. I urge \nmy colleagues to pass our bill.\n  I now turn it over to my friend and colleague from Maine, Senator \nSusan Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me first begin my remarks by \ncommending my friend and colleague from Minnesota for leading the way \non this very important bill.\n  There are so many issues that divide us in this Chamber. Surely, this \nis an issue that should unite us. It is not a Democratic issue. It is \nnot a Republican issue. It is an issue of serious consequence to the \nAmerican people and to our health care system. I would hope--and the \nreason Senator Klobuchar and I have come to the floor today--that we \ncan act immediately to pass our bill, get it through the House, and \nsend it to the President.\n  Physicians, pharmacists, and patients throughout the country are \nstruggling to cope with the surge in shortages of needed drugs which is \ncausing significant disruption in health care and putting patients at \nrisk. I share with my colleague from Minnesota her concern about this \ncritically important problem.\n  According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the number of \ndrug shortages has nearly quadrupled over the last 6 years, jumping \nfrom 61 products in 2005 to a record 231 by the end of November of last \nyear. And there appears to be no end in sight.\n  Many of the drugs in short supply are vital. They are used in \nhospitals and cancer centers for anesthesia, for chemotherapy, and for \nthe treatment of infections. There are also continuing shortages of \ndrugs used in emergency rooms and in intensive care units.\n  I have met with several doctors and other medical professionals and \npharmacists in Maine who are extremely concerned about this issue. They \nhave told me that these shortages are causing serious problems around \nour State and across our Nation, including forcing some medical centers \nto ration drugs or postpone elective surgeries. Even more tragic, \noncologists have told me of situations where they have been forced to \nchange a patient's chemotherapy regime midcourse because they suddenly \nencountered a shortage of a particular drug. Moreover, for some drugs, \nsuch as the leukemia drug Cytarabine, which Senator Klobuchar mentioned \nas well, there are no effective substitutes.\n  This crisis is widespread. In a survey by the American Hospital \nAssociation, more than 80 percent of our hospitals reported that they \nhave had to delay treatment due to the shortages. Just think what that \nis like for a patient who has received the diagnosis of cancer and has \nstarted treatment and then finds out the lifesaving drug they need is \nnot available. It is hard enough to cope with the devastating \ndiagnosis. To add to that the fact that the drug you need isn't \navailable is just too much to bear. More than half of our hospitals \nhave said they could not provide some of their patients with the \nrecommended therapy.\n  Drug shortages are also adding to the cost of care. Hospital \npharmacists are having to spend additional time--some 8 to 12 hours per \nweek--dealing with shortages, increasing labor costs by an estimated \n$216 million a year.\n  That is why I joined with my colleague from Minnesota in cosponsoring \nthe Preserving Access to Life-Saving Medications Act. Our bill will \nprovide the FDA with better tools to better manage and, we hope, \nprevent shortages of lifesaving medications.\n  First and foremost, it takes the very commonsense step of requiring \npharmaceutical manufacturers to notify the FDA of the discontinuance, \ninterruption, or other adjustment in the manufacture of a drug that \nwould likely lead to a shortage. Providing early warning when a drug \nwill not be available will help both physicians and their patients. It \nbuilds on its successful model--the FDA's Drug Shortage Program--which \nencourages manufacturers to report potential or existing shortages so \nthat the problems can be addressed or other manufacturers can ramp up \ntheir production. Through this voluntary approach, the FDA was able to \navert 195 shortages last year.\n  Our bill also directs the FDA to provide up-to-date public \nnotification of any shortages, and it directs the FDA to work with \nmanufacturers to establish contingency plans to address drug shortages \ndue to manufacturing problems, such as the shortage of raw materials or \nreduction in production capabilities.\n  Our legislation would give the FDA the information and the tools it \nneeds to help address and prevent drug shortages. This, in turn, will \nhelp to ensure that our hospitals and health care professionals are \nable to provide the best care medical science allows. Most important, \nit will help ensure that patients have access to the medications they \nneed when they need them most.\n\n  I am proud to join with my colleague from Minnesota in sponsoring \nsuch an important initiative. I urge our colleagues on the HELP \nCommittee to act quickly to report this bill and the full Senate to act \nwithout delay to approve it as well. Surely, this is an issue that \nshould bring this Chamber together and that we should act on \nimmediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins for her great\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\nleadership. This bill is moving. This bill is picking up support across \nthe Nation. Again, we need to get it done. We cannot wait. These \npatients cannot wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S108-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S108-S110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CITIZENS UNITED\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I am here today also to talk about something that is \nvery important to the future of our democracy; that is, campaign \nfinance reform and the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court \nwhich had its second anniversary a few days ago.\n  I see Senator Gillibrand from New York is also here to speak on this \nimportant issue. She is a leader. The Presiding Officer has done some \nvery important work in this area as well, which I will get to in a \nminute. Most fundamentally, I am here to talk about the public lack of \ntrust and our need to ensure that the American people have a government \nthat is responsive to their concerns.\n  It is vital that the American people have trust and confidence in \ntheir government. Right now it is clear they do not have either. The \nAmerican people believe Washington is focused more on scoring political \npoints for special interests and not looking out for their interests, \nfor the interests of the people of this country, for the interests of \nthe middle class. They have seen the preservation of oil company \nsubsidies while at the same time the price of gasoline has remained \npainfully high. Simply put, they think the system is broken.\n  While most people probably do not have the time to study the \nintricate details of campaign finance law, which unfortunately has \nloopholes and things written in it that make it hard to figure, the \nAmerican people have a pretty good sense there is something wrong with \nhow we conduct our elections. The American people know spending on \ncampaigns has gotten out of control and that spending by special \ninterest groups is contributing greatly to that problem--and they are \nright.\n  The Supreme Court Citizens United decision has made it profoundly \nworse by loosening the rules on special interest spending on political \ncampaigns. We are now in a situation where candidates have to report \nevery single contribution they raise over a certain amount. That is \ngood. But literally millions of dollars in special interest money can \ncome in in attack ads, can come in and do whatever it wants, and you \nliterally cannot prove who that person is who put in that money. It \nshakes the very foundation of our democracy when the people who are \nvoting in these elections cannot even tell where the money is coming \nfrom that is paying for the ads.\n  Citizens United has unleashed a new wave of special interest \nspending, and the American people have been inundated with negative ads \non their televisions. Worse, they are constantly hearing about the \nincreased role that special interests are playing in our elections, and \nthat heightens their suspicions that Washington is working only for the \npowerful, only for the people who can pay for issue ads. The public \njustifiably believes the more money outside groups spend on campaigns \nthe less their voices are heard. How can they have a voice when people \nare drowning out their voices with multimillions of dollars? This is a \nbig problem and it is something I think we need to address.\n  The President touched on this issue of money in politics in his State \nof the Union this week, and in his address last year he took on \nCitizens United directly. He knows we need change, and I agree. \nUnfortunately, the Citizens United decision makes it very difficult to \ntake action legislatively. That is why I am a sponsor of a \nconstitutional amendment which would allow Congress to pass laws \nregulating campaign fundraising and spending.\n  Tom Udall has worked on one. I know the Presiding Officer also has a \nsimilar bill as well. I hope we can advance this amendment, but I \nrealize it will be an uphill battle, especially as we enter an election \nyear. But we must change this system. In the meantime, even before the \nelection, I am hopeful we will take some steps to make it more \ntransparent so at least we can start finding out who is spending this \nmoney--the people of Vermont or the people of New York or the people of \nMinnesota can find out who is putting in millions of dollars, and they \ncan draw their own conclusions--they are pretty smart--about why they \nare spending that money.\n  We need it to be transparent. We also have to stem this great abuse \nof power, this great amount of money that is coming into the system. \nBut in the end we will need a constitutional amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nmarking the 2-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in \nCitizens United. I want to express my support for legislation to \nreverse the harmful impact of this decision and restore accountability, \ntransparency and common sense to our Nation's electoral system.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, on January 21, 2010, the Roberts Court handed \ndown a 5-4 decision striking down parts of the ``Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act.''\n  That decision--Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission--flew \nin the face of nearly a century of Congressional law and overturned two \nprior rulings of the Supreme Court.\n  This case is not alone.\n  It is part of a pattern of decisions from the Roberts Court that have \noverturned precedent.\n  I have a real concern that this Court is going out of its way to \nrewrite and reinterpret prior law with decisions, I am sorry to say, \nseem to favor corporate interests over the interests of the American \npeople.\n  The Citizens United decision may be the most troubling of these \nactivist decisions.\n  This decision does not only impact one group of people or one area of \nthe law--it affects the very functioning of our elections and the \ndemocracy of more than 300 million Americans.\n  The Court's decision in this case opened the door to unlimited \ncorporate spending in Federal elections.\n  Let me repeat: unlimited spending.\n  The Court held that the First Amendment of the Constitution protects \nthe rights of corporations to spend freely--in the millions or even the \nbillions--on election ads to support or defeat a particular candidate.\n  What does this mean in the real world?\n  This means that an oil company like ExxonMobil--a company that earned \n$45 billion in profits last year--could spend unlimited money to \nsupport a candidate who supports more drilling, or to defeat a \ncandidate who opposes more oil drilling.\n  It means that Xe Services, formerly known as Blackwater, and other \ndefense contractors could spend unlimited sums toward the election of \ncandidates who view their defense positions favorably.\n  Or large banks like Bank of America would be free to use their \ncorporate treasury to attack candidates who favor financial regulation \nand consumer protection.\n  As Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21 testified at a Rules Committee \nhearing in 2010, ``It would not take many examples of elections where \nmultimillion corporate expenditures defeat a Member of Congress before \nall Members quickly learn the lesson, vote against the corporate \ninterest at stake in a piece of legislation and you run the risk of \nbeing hit with a multimillion-dollar corporate ad campaign to defeat \nyou.''\n  Is this what we want?\n  Four years ago in 2008, at this same point in the presidential \nelection cycle, $12.9 million was spent by super PACs in support of \ncandidates.\n  The fall 2010 midterm elections ushered in this new political \nlandscape with outside groups spending a record $300 million on \npolitical advertisements and other messages. This amount represents a \n340 percent increase above 2006 spending levels.\n  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the spending by \npresidential super PACs in this year's election cycle has quadrupled \nsince 2008 to an astonishing $42.5 million spent as of January 24, \n2012.\n  More money is being spent than ever before.\n  Do not take my word for it.\n  Take a look at what is going on in the Republican Presidential \nprimary. Corporations and wealthy individuals are funding these super \nPACs and spending vast amounts of money to attack candidates.\n  My concerns with these dramatic increases in spending are heightened \nby a\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\nrecent finding from the Center for Responsive Politics that \napproximately 44 percent of the outside spending in 2010 came from \nanonymous sources.\n  The Roberts Court's decision in Citizens United was, I believe, the \nwrong one.\n  It protects corporate free speech and will drown out an individuals' \nfree speech. It has threatened to put democratic elections in the \nUnited States up for sale to the highest bidder. And it will, I \nbelieve, lead to voters having less reliable information about \ncandidates, not more.\n  The Court gets the final word on the Constitution, and it has spoken.\n  However, Congress should pass the DISCLOSE Act or Senator Tom Udall's \ncampaign finance constitutional amendment.\n  I supported the DISCLOSE Act in the last Congress because I believe \nit is a critical step forward, but the bill was narrowly defeated on a \ncloture vote of 59-39 in September of 2010.\n  Given what we have seen in the Republican primaries this year, I \nthink this body must try again to pass the DISCLOSE Act. In 2010, we \ncame close to passing it and needed just one additional yea vote to \nmove the bill forward.\n  The DISCLOSE Act ensures the American public knows who is funding an \nad when they see it on television, and it will close loopholes that \ncould have otherwise allowed unlimited spending in our elections by \nforeign nationals and corporations receiving government assistance.\n  I understand that Senator Schumer is working to reintroduce this \nlegislation, and I fully support him in this effort.\n  Senator Udall's resolution to amend the Constitution would authorize \nCongress to regulate the raising and spending of money for federal \ncampaigns, including the independent spending of super PACs.\n  This resolution is a critical step to ensure that corporate dollars \nwill not flow in the dark to one candidate and against another, but, \ninstead, our election process will regain the transparency it has lost \nafter Citizens United.\n  I believe it is essential that we pass legislation to address this \ngrowing problem, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to do \nso.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, two years ago, with the stroke of a pen, \nfive Supreme Court justices acted in a case known as Citizens United to \noverturn a century of law designed to protect our elections from \ncorporate spending. They ran roughshod over longstanding precedent to \nstrike down key provisions of our bipartisan campaign finance laws, and \nruled that corporations are no longer prohibited from direct spending \nin political campaigns. I was troubled at the time and remain troubled \ntoday that in that case, the Supreme Court extended to corporations the \nsame First Amendment rights in the political process that are \nguaranteed by the Constitution to individual Americans.\n  Now, 2 years later, the American people have seen the sudden and \ndramatic effects of the Citizens United decision. The flood of \ncorporate money flowing into campaigns from undisclosed and \nunaccountable sources has had an enormous influence in the Republican \nprimary elections this year, just as it did in the 2010 mid-term \nelections. Instead of hearing the voices of voters, we see a barrage of \nnegative advertisements from so-called Super PACs. This comes as no \nsurprise to the many of us in Congress and around the country who \nworried at the time of the Citizens United decision that it turns the \nidea of government of, by and for the people on its head. We worried \nthat the decision created new rights for Wall Street at the expense of \nthe people on Main Street. We worried that powerful corporate \nmegaphones would drown out the voices and interests of individual \nAmericans. Two years later, it is clear those concerns were justified.\n  We held a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee last year to \nexplore how the Citizens United decision affects the lives of \nhardworking Americans. I began that hearing by talking about how our \nConstitution starts with the words, ``We the People of the United \nStates.'' In designing the Constitution, ratifying it, adopting the \nBill of Rights and creating our democracy, we spoke of, thought of, and \nguaranteed, fundamental rights to the American people, not \ncorporations.\n  There are reasons for that. Corporations are not the same as \nindividual Americans. Corporations do not have the same rights, the \nsame morals or the same interests. Corporations cannot vote in our \ndemocracy. They are artificial legal constructs to facilitate business. \nThe Founders understood this. Americans across the country have long \nunderstood this.\n  Corporations are not people. That is common sense rooted in core \nAmerican values. Nowhere does our Constitution mention corporations. \nThe great Chief Justice John Marshall understood this distinction when \nhe wrote in 1819 that, ``A corporation is an artificial being . . . the \nmere creature of law, it possesses only those properties which the \ncharter of its creation confers upon it. . . .''\n  The distinction between corporations and people is one that was at \nthe heart of the campaign finance reforms proposed by Teddy Roosevelt \nmore than a century ago limiting the role of corporations in the \npolitical process. Those reforms were preserved and extended through \nanother century of legal developments that followed. Nine years ago, it \nwas these same values that informed bipartisan efforts in Congress, on \nbehalf of the American people, to enact the landmark McCain-Feingold \nAct. That legislation strengthened the laws protecting the interests of \nall Americans by ensuring a fair electoral process where individual \nAmericans could have a role in the political process, regardless of \nwealth.\n  As I pointed out at our hearing last year, when the Supreme Court \nfirst reviewed the constitutionality of the McCain-Feingold Act in \n2003, in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, it upheld the key \nprovisions of the Act against a First Amendment challenge. Six years \nlater, a thin majority of the Supreme Court, made possible by President \nBush's appointment of Justice Samuel Alito, reversed course on the very \nsame question. In so doing, the conservative activist majority \ndiscarded not only the McConnell decision, but ignored longstanding \nprecedent to effectively redraft our campaign finance laws. As Justice \nStevens noted in dissent: ``The only relevant thing that has changed \nsince . . . McConnell is the composition of the Court.'' The \nConstitution had not changed, but five Justices rewrote it.\n  The reason so many Americans continue to recoil from the Citizens \nUnited decision 2 years later is that the brand of conservative \njudicial activism on display in that decision is a threat to the rule \nof law and an effective representative democracy. At the core of the \nFirst Amendment is the right of individual Americans to participate in \nthe political process to speak and, crucially, to be heard. That is \nwhat the campaign finance laws were designed to ensure--that Americans \ncan be heard and fairly participate in elections. Rather than abiding \nby the limitations that Congress has developed to ensure a multitude of \nvoices in the marketplace of election contests, five justices on the \nSupreme Court decided that the biggest corporations should be \nunleashed, and can be the loudest and most dominant, and drown out \nindividual Americans. They showed no deference to Congress, and little \ndeference to the precedents of the Supreme Court.\n  The risks we feared at the time of the Citizens United decision, the \nrisks that drove Congress to pass bipartisan laws based on longstanding \nprecedent, have been apparent in the elections since that decision. \nCitizens United has opened the floodgates of corporate influence in \nAmerican elections. In these tough economic times, I believe individual \nAmericans should not have their voices stifled by unfettered corporate \ninterests. I remain concerned that this decision will invite foreign \ncorporate influence into our elections.\n  Recently, Justice Scalia responded to the criticism of the Citizens \nUnited decision and the advent of Super PACs and their overwhelming \ninfluence by saying that if people do not like it, they should turn off \ntheir televisions. That response misses the point. Americans should not \nbe told to tune out from democracy or from considering a fair exchange \nof ideas. American voters should be able to speak, be heard and to hear \ncompeting voices, not be overwhelmed by corporate influence and\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\ndriven out of the governing process. Even some whose response to the \nCitizens United decision was more muted have turned a corner, and \nrecently, Senator McCain, a lead co-author of the McCain-Feingold Act, \nconceded that Super PACs are ``disgraceful.'' They allow nothing more \nthan to have corporations or wealthy individuals dominate and control \nlocal elections.\n  We have tried to curtail some of the worst abuses allowed by the \nSupreme Court's decision, but Senate Republicans have blocked those \nefforts. In 2010, Senate Republicans filibustered the DISCLOSE Act, \npreventing the Senate from even debating the measure, let alone having \nan up-or-down vote in the Senate. The DISCLOSE Act would have added \ntransparency to the campaign finance laws to help prevent corporations \nfrom abusing their newfound constitutional rights. It would have \npreserved the voices of hardworking Americans in the political process \nby limiting the ability of foreign corporations to influence American \nelections, prohibiting corporations receiving taxpayer money from \ncontributing to elections, and increasing disclosure requirements on \ncorporate contributors, among other things.\n  By preventing us from even debating the DISCLOSE Act, Senate \nRepublicans ensured the ability of wealthy corporations to dominate all \nmediums of advertising and out the voices of individuals, as we have \nseen and will continue to see in our elections.\n  We continue to try to fight the effects of corporate influence \nunleashed by Citizens United. We have introduced the Fair Elections Now \nAct, to establish a voluntary program for viable congressional \ncandidates to accept Federal grants, matching funds, and vouchers to \nsupplement money from small dollar donors. Rather than fundraising, \nthis legislation will enable incumbent candidates more time to better \nrepresent their constituents, and it will level the playing field to \ngive challengers the chance to better compete with established \ncandidates without relying on wealthy donors to fund their entire \ncampaign. The Fair Elections Now Act represents one important step \ntoward minimizing corporate influence in the electoral process, and \nensuring that candidates for Congress are neither beholden to corporate \ninfluence, nor so consumed with fundraising that they do not have the \ntime necessary to legislate. I hope that Senators on both sides of the \naisle will work to enact this important measure.\n  We continue to work to protect shareholders of publicly held \ncorporations from having their money spent on political activity \nwithout their consent, another consequence of the Citizens United \ndecision. I am a cosponsor of the Shareholder Protection Act, which \nwould require shareholder authorization and full disclosure of any \npolitical spending by publicly held corporations. Last week, I joined \nwith 14 other Democratic Senators in sending a letter to the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, SEC, urging it to consider using its authority \nto immediately implement part of this legislation requiring full \ndisclosure of corporate political spending. Such an action is within \nthe SEC's power to do today. This information is not only material to \nshareholders, but it is something shareholders continue to request from \ncorporations. As we wrote last week, a corporation's money belongs to \nthe shareholders, not the executives, and they deserve a voice in how \nit is spent.\n  Vermont is a small State. It is easy to imagine the wave of corporate \nmoney we are seeing spent on elections around the country lead to \ncorporate interests flooding the airwaves with election ads, and \ntransforming even local elections there or in other small States. It \nwould not take more than a tiny fraction of corporate money to outspend \nall of our local candidates combined. If a local city council or zoning \nboard is considering an issue of corporate interest, why would the \ncorporate interests not try to drown out the view of Vermont's \nhardworking citizens? I know that the people of Vermont, like all \nAmericans, take seriously their civic duty to choose wisely on Election \nDay. Vermonters cherish their critical role in the democratic process \nand are staunch believers in the First Amendment. Vermont refused to \nratify the Constitution until the adoption of the Bill of Rights in \n1791. The rights of Vermonters and all Americans to speak to each other \nand to be heard should not be undercut by corporate spending.\n  When the Citizens United decision was handed down, I said that it was \nthe most partisan decision since Bush v. Gore. As in Bush v. Gore, the \nconservative activists on the Supreme Court unnecessarily went beyond \nthe proper judicial role to substitute their preferences for the law. \nBut Citizens United is broader and more damaging, because rather than \nintervening to decide a single election, we have seen the Court's \nintervention affecting all elections. On the 2 year anniversary of \nCitizens United, I call on all Senators, Republican or Democratic, to \ncome together to restore the ability of every American to be heard and \nparticipate in free and fair elections.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Like millions of Americans all across our country, I \nwas shocked to learn that insider trading by Members of Congress, in \nfact, and their families and their staff, using nonpublic information \ngained through their congressional work, is not clearly and expressly \nprohibited by law and the rules of Congress. The American people need \nto know that their elected leaders play by the exact same rules by \nwhich they have to play. They also deserve the right to know their \nlawmakers' only interest is what is best for the country, not what is \nbest for their own financial interests.\n  Members of Congress, their families and staff, should not be able to \ngain personal profits from information they have access to that \neveryday middle-class American families do not. It is simply not right. \nNobody should be above the rules.\n  I introduced a bipartisan bill in the Senate with 28 of our Senate \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to close this loophole. The \nSTOCK Act legislation is very similar to the legislation introduced by \nmy friends in the House, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter and Congressman \nTim Walz. I thank them for their longstanding dedication and leadership \nto this important issue. I also thank Chairman Lieberman, Ranking \nMember Collins, and all of the committee members for their work in \nacting swiftly to move this bipartisan bill out of committee with a \nsense of common purpose straight to the floor for a vote. I thank \nLeader Reid for his leadership and support in bringing up this bill \nbefore the full Senate.\n  Our bill, which has received the support of at least seven good \ngovernment groups, covers two important principles. First, Members of \nCongress, their families and their staff, should be barred from buying \nor selling securities on the basis of knowledge gained through their \ncongressional service or from using the knowledge to tip off someone \nelse. The SEC and the CFTC must be empowered to investigate these \ncases. To provide additional teeth, such acts should also be in \nviolation of Congress's own rules to make it clear that this activity \nis not only against the law but inappropriate for this body.\n  Second, Members should also be required to disclose major \ntransactions within 30 days, to make information available online for \ntheir constituents to see, providing dramatically improved oversight \nand accountability from the current annual reporting requirements.\n  I am pleased the final product that passed with bipartisan support in \nthe committee is a strong bill with teeth and includes measures such as \nensuring that Members of Congress cannot tip off others with nonpublic \ninformation gained through their duties and ensured trading from this \ninformation would also be a violation of Congress's own ethics rules.\n  Some critics say the bill is unnecessary and is already covered under \ncurrent statutes. I have spoken to experts tasked in the past with \ninvestigations of this nature and they strongly disagree. We must make \nit unambiguous that this kind of behavior is illegal. As\n\n[[Page S111]]\n\nmy home State newspaper, the Buffalo News, notes:\n\n       The STOCK Act would ensure that it's the people's business \n     being attended to.\n\n  President Obama said in his State of the Union Address, send this \nbill and he will sign it right away.

Mr. President, I rise because I am deeply concerned about \nPresident Obama's unconstitutional overstep of executive authority in \nthe ostensible appointment of Richard Cordray as the Director of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB, and three new members \nof the National Labor Relations Board. These unilateral, nonrecess \nappointments are a blatant abuse of power, one that threatens the very \nlegitimacy of the confirmation process and essentially undermines \nCongress's critical responsibility to restrain the excesses of the \nexecutive branch.\n  On January 4, mere weeks after this body had rejected Mr. Cordray's \nnomination, the President went ahead with his own agenda, disregarding \nour decision and the fact that the Senate was in pro forma session. \nDays later, unbelievably, the Obama Justice Department's Office of \nLegal Counsel defended the move, essentially saying that pro forma \nsessions do not matter anymore; that the President can determine \nwhether the Senate is in recess.\n  Reversing years of precedent, the administration is asserting that \nthe executive branch now has the authority to decide whether the \nlegislative branch is or is not in session. This presumptuous action by \nthe President goes far beyond the limited powers he is granted by our \nConstitution. It is an affront to the democratic checks and balances \nestablished by our Founders, and it constitutes a gross violation of \nprecedents set by those who have come before us.\n  The courts surely will have a say in what the President has done, \namounting to an expensive, unnecessary move for pure political \nreasoning. It was only a matter of days before business groups filed a \nlegal challenge against the President's appointments to the NLRB.\n  To be sure, the President has the right to make recess appointments. \nThis much is unquestioned and is clearly set forth in article II, \nsection 2 of the Constitution, which states the President can ``fill up \nall vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.''\n  But the power he has to execute this right nevertheless hinges on a \ncondition that all parties have acknowledged: The Senate must be in \nrecess. As it states in article I, section 5, clause 4 of the \nConstitution:\n\n       Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, \n     without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than 3 \n     days.\n\n  The House of Representatives had not formally given our Chamber that \nconsent when the President made his appointments. Moreover, Senators \nhad agreed by unanimous consent to remain in pro forma session.\n  What the President has done triggers a dangerous new precedent. With \nthis overstep, those in the Obama administration have put their \npolitical agenda above the Constitution and above the founding \nprinciples that established our government's separation of powers. This \nis no trifling matter.\n  Equally troubling is this power grab could inspire further overreach, \nsetting an unconstitutional model for future administrations. It stands \nto reason that if the President's judgment, not Congress's, dictates \nwhen the Senate is in recess, then what would stop him from making an \nappointment whenever he chooses?\n  Michael McConnell, a distinguished former Federal judge and director \nof the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, recently \nsuggested in the Wall Street Journal that the President could, for \nexample, make an appointment overnight or during a lunch break. The \nparameters of what recess means would be subject to his discretion and \nhis discretion alone.\n  In 2007, majority leader Harry Reid kept the Senate in pro forma \nsession to block nominations by President Bush. He said then that \nrecess appointments are ``an end run around the Senate and the \nConstitution.'' The majority leader's position then was that pro forma \nsessions may be used to prevent recess appointments. The Democratic \nleadership was correct on the law then and they ought to be outraged \nnow over President Obama's disregard of precedent and of the \nConstitution.\n  Instead, the Democratic leader, who should be protecting the \ninstitution that he currently has stewardship of, as well as protecting \nour Constitution, last week defended the President's appointments on \nthe national news as ``a good move.''\n  The Constitution does not change based on which party occupies the \nWhite House. The same rules should apply no matter who holds office. \nAmerica was not built upon nor did it rise to greatness because of a \nsingle branch of government. Our democracy sits on three separate \npillars, and the decisions of the legislative branch are not merely a \nhurdle for the President to run around.\n  The Constitution endowed the Senate with exclusive authority to give \nadvice and consent on the executive branch and official nominations. \nSenators upheld their role to advise when we rejected Mr. Cordray's \nnomination. Many of us made our reasons for the disapproval well known.\n  Last year, 44 Republican Senators sent a letter to the President \nstating that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau established by \nthe Dodd-Frank Act was in desperate need of reform before a Director \ncould be appointed. This has nothing to do with Mr. Cordray as an \nindividual, but it has everything to do with creating a flawed agency--\nan extremely powerful one at that. We pointed out our concerns about \nhow unaccountable this Bureau will be to the American people. We raised \na red flag about the extraordinary power it gives to unelected \ngovernment bureaucrats, particularly the Bureau's Director. It is clear \nthat our advice did not fit with the White House's agenda.\n  This happens in a functioning democracy, and this should be honored. \nThe President has decided not to honor the will of the Senate. He has \ntried to make an unauthorized appointment that the Members of this body \nhave rejected. In doing so, in circumventing the decisions of elected \npublic servants, his Executive order ultimately diminishes the voice of \nthe American people.\n  In recent months, the President has made it obvious that he wants to \nrail against a do-nothing Congress. Perhaps it is part of his \nreelection strategy. Yet, instead of working with Congress to make \nneeded reforms, he fuels an already polarized environment with this \nmove on recess appointments.\n  I say this with all sincerity to the President and to my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle: There is a time for spin and there is a \ntime to make political points, but politics and theater ought to stop \nshort of trampling on our Constitution.\n  Like each of you, I made an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution when I took this office. I would not be upholding this \npledge if I did not speak out now about what the President has done. \nPreserving the constitutional sanctity of the decisions of the Senate \nand the role it serves is one way we support and defend our founding \ndocument and the democratic ideals of those who created it.\n  The chair of the Banking Committee has scheduled a hearing on \nTuesday, supposedly to hear testimony from Mr. Cordray on his plans for \nthe Consumer Finance Protection Board. Let me be explicitly clear. \nRichard Cordray is not the duly constituted Director of the CFPB. His \npurported recess appointment does not comply with the Constitution and \nis, in fact, a nullity. I will not provide the administration with an \nappearance of legitimacy in this action, and I will therefore not be in \nattendance at next Tuesday's hearing. This may seem to be a small step, \nbut I hope it is the first of what will become a debate in this Senate \nby both parties about the constitutional system of checks and balances. \nThis matter will also go to the courts, and I pray that somewhere in \nthe process the sanctity of our Constitution will be upheld.\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\n  I approach this matter regretfully and soberly but with apprehension \nabout what the Obama administration is trying to do to our 225-year-old \nConstitution. I call upon Members of both parties in this Senate to \nrise in solemn defense of this institution and the constitutional \nprinciple of the separation of power.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen).

Before I speak on my formal comments, I just want to say \none thing. I know the Senator from New York was here a little bit ago \ntalking about the STOCK Act. She made an incredible presentation to us \nin the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, and I am \ngrateful she is moving forward on that. We actually added a piece to \nthe STOCK Act that I think makes it a lot stronger than it was by \nmaking sure that as officials report their transactions, they are done \nelectronically and are searchable. That means anybody in this country \ncan go to the Senate's Web site and find the information about their \nSenator.\n  As you know, as a new person in this office, as I am, when we file \nour disclosure forms, they are sent to the Senate Clerk, and then if \nyou want them, they have to copy them and send it off to someone else. \nYou cannot search for them and you cannot get them, which is \nunbelievable. So we made sure in the committee that if we do this act--\nI think it is a strong act; it is something we should do--we make sure \nit is searchable and available electronically in this age we live in \ntoday.\n  I already put my disclosure form on my Web site. I have put it on \nthere since the day I came into office. I think people need to know \nexactly what their Senator's investments are. If they have spouses--in \nmy case, all of my spouse's information is on there even though I am \nnot required to do it. I put it on there because I think people need to \nknow the household income of their Senator and where it comes from and \nwhere their investments are. We overreport. After I fill out the forms, \nwe have an attorney review it, and he always tells me we are giving too \nmuch information. I have to remind him that is what I am doing. That is \nthe way I think it should be done.\n  Again, I congratulate the Senator from New York who was here for the \nwork on the STOCK Act, and I am glad I could participate in making it \neven stronger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S112-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S112-S113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NOME REFUELING SITUATION\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I seek to speak on the floor to speak of \nmy residence of Alaska, a State that constantly overcomes adversity in \nits tough winters. This year has been an especially tough winter.\n  Alaska's history is marked by stories of people coming together to \novercome extreme hardships and save their communities. None is more \nmemorable than the 1925 Serum Run, when diphtheria ravaged the remote \nArctic community of Nome. The needed vaccine was raced to the community \nby a team of 20 mushers and some 150 sled dogs. They faced brutal \nFebruary weather and extreme cold, with winds and snowdrifts, and \ncarried their precious cargo--the vaccine--some 700 miles in just 5\\1/\n2\\ days. It is a speed record that has never since been broken, and it \nsaved the community. The feat is memorialized by the 1,000-mile \nIditarod sled dog race known as the last great race on Earth.\n  This year, the city of Nome faced a 21st-century challenge: the need \nfor energy. The fall fuel barge--the last scheduled before winter set \nin--was blocked first by a mammoth October storm which swept up western \nAlaska and then by heavy sea ice. The barge had to turn back, but \nwithout the delivery Nome would run out of fuel by March. Nome is not \nconnected by road, and the earliest the next barge would arrive would \nbe this June. Flying in 1.3 million gallons of fuel would have taken \n300 flights and would have boosted the cost of an already expensive \ngasoline and home-heating fuel to over $9 a gallon. As you can see \nhere, the price of fuel in the community right now is over $5 a gallon.\n\n  The Sitnasuak Native Corporation and Vitus Marine proposed to do what \nhas never been done before: bring over 1 million gallons of diesel fuel \nand gasoline to Nome in the dead of winter. They contracted with a \nRussian-flagged tanker, the Renda, which was ice-capable and double-\nhulled.\n  To ensure the safety of the delivery, the Coast Guard immediately \nrecognized it had a mission and the right equipment. The Coast Guard \nicebreaker Healy had just completed a lengthy scientific tour off the \nArctic. Rather than return home, they stayed on the job as winter set \nin, breaking open lanes through the ice to allow the tanker to arrive.\n  The Healy and the Renda encountered conditions more severe than \nanticipated, with colder temperatures, stronger winds, and thicker ice. \nSome days their progress was frozen, literally, but the Healy pressed \non through the ice. With the determination that is the hallmark of the \nU.S. Coast Guard, they succeeded. They did not make it to Nome Harbor, \nwhich was frozen solid, but close enough to top off the city's fuel \ntanks through a half-mile-long hose. Now they are on their way back \nhome but not out of the ice yet. The Healy and the Renda still have \nseveral hundred miles before they reach open water.\n  I take to the floor today to offer my thanks and congratulations to \nCaptain Beverly Havlik and the men and women aboard the Healy for a job \nwell done and also the crew of the charter tanker, the Renda, and many \nothers who helped ensure that the transfer of fuel was safe, workers \nfrom the Sitnasuak Corporation, Vitus Marine, the city of Nome, State \nof Alaska, and others who have played their part, even the University \nof Alaska researchers who flew aerial drones to inspect ice conditions \nin advance of the approaching vessels. Together they proved that winter \noperations are possible even in the most challenging circumstances.\n  I speak today not just to congratulate all those who pitched in to \nhelp refuel this community but to consider its broader implications and \nlessons.\n  First, America is an Arctic nation. The residents of cities such as \nNome and Kotzebue and Barrow and numerous smaller villages thrive in \nthe often challenging but rich Arctic environment. The Alaska Native \npeoples have thrived for generations and for thousands of years, living \noff the resources of the land and the sea.\n  Second, the Arctic offers much to our Nation. Its offshore oil and \nnatural gas is our most promising energy province, which is actively \nbeing considered by industry. Trade routes over the top are \nincreasingly being explored by shippers eager to cut up to 40 percent \noff trade routes between the east and the west.\n  Yet, while we are an artic nation, we lack the basic infrastructure \nto serve its people, to fulfill our responsibilities and take advantage \nof its opportunities. But it is not just me saying it. Just today the \nNorthern Waters Task Force released a report calling for a better \nArctic infrastructure. The Healy is our Nation's only operational polar \nicebreaker, and it is only rated as a medium-duty vessel. Our two \nheavy-duty icebreakers are both idle. The 36-year-old Polar Star is \nbeing retrofitted and should be operational again soon, but it has been \nproposed to send her sister ship, the Polar Sea, to the scrap heap.\n  Since taking office, I have repeatedly called for recapitalizing the \nNation's icebreaker fleet. A comprehensive Coast Guard study recently \nfound that 6 to 10 icebreakers are needed just to meet the Coast \nGuard's statutory responsibilities. Until we have a firm plan to meet \nthese needs, I have introduced legislation with Senator Cantwell to \nhalt the dismantling of the Polar Sea until all options can be \nconsidered. Without icebreakers, we can neither meet our \nresponsibilities nor take advantage of our opportunities as an Arctic \nnation. We are falling behind Arctic nations such as Russia, China--\nwhich is not an Arctic nation but is building icebreakers--Canada and \nothers as well. Russia is building a year-round Arctic port. Canada is \nconducting military operations. And, as I mentioned, China is building \nnew icebreakers.\n  America must build its Arctic infrastructure, such as a deepwater \nport to maintain our national presence as other nations make their \nclaims to the\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\nArctic. We need to maintain spill response capabilities, enhance \ncommunications, track the increasing vessel traffic using polar routes, \nstrengthen communications and the base scientists who are researching \nthe changing Arctic ecosystem.\n  In addition, we need the legal framework to support our Arctic \npresence, and that means ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty. We \nneed a robust scientific program to track changes in the Arctic which \nin the past has operated like a global air-conditioner.\n\n  But scientists say, and the residents of the region confirm, that the \nArctic is warming. As its ice pack diminishes, it is changing our \nweather. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, \nsays there were a record 12 weather disasters in the United States \ncosting more than $1 billion each in 2011. The hurricane force storm \nthat blocked the fuel delivery to Nome isn't the only unusually severe \nweather facing my State. South central Alaska has had--and I will \nrepeat this when I say it--24 feet of snow--24 feet of snow so far this \nwinter. The cities of Cordova and Valdez know a thing or two about \nheavy winter snowfalls, but this is an unusual one for them.\n  In Cordova, buildings collapsed and avalanches cut the town off from \nits airport. That is a true concern since, like 80 percent of the rest \nof Alaska, Cordova is not connected by roads to the rest of the State.\n  The Army and Air National Guard sent soldiers and airmen to the \nscene, and the State of Alaska sent over 100 State responders and heavy \nequipment to the town by the State ferry system. The whole town, along \nwith the Guardsmen and the State workers, pitched in and worked around \nthe clock to clear the snow off the streets and roofs as another snow \nand rain system was about to hit. The only problem: Alaskans can be \nrather enthusiastic and kept breaking every single one of those snow \nshovels. Eventually they ran out and had to have more snow shovels \nshipped in from out of State.\n  Other parts of the State are affected as well. Boats capsized in the \nfishing port of Kodiak due to the heavy snow. Yesterday, once again, \nthe Coast Guard came and performed their duty--not only one but two \nrescues of the crews of fishing vessels that sank near Kodiak Island.\n  NOAA is closely watching the heaviest sea ice in decades in the \nBering Sea, which threatens to close the important crab fisheries and \ndestroy millions of dollars in fishing gear.\n  Some politicians downgrade public service and say government can't do \nanything right. I am grateful for the government's response. I am \ngrateful to the Coast Guardsmen on the Healy who gave up their holiday \nwith their families to ensure Nome got its fuel, and I am grateful to \nthe Alaska National Guard and State and local governments working to \nhelp dig out Cordova and Valdez.\n  I know my time has expired, but I wish to say there is no question in \nmy mind that the work the Coast Guard did, the National Guard, and many \nothers, set us on a course to again recognize the incredible people who \nare doing incredible things in our State and around the country. As we \ncontinue to look at the vast resources of the Arctic, more of these \nresources will be necessary, and I know one thing about Americans, \nabout Alaskans, and that is we will be ready to take on the challenges \nof the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

These four \nappointments are unconstitutional because they did not, as required by \narticle II, section 2, receive the ``advice and consent'' of the \nSenate, even though such advice and consent was necessary under the \ncircumstances.\n  President Obama has asserted that the appointments are constitutional \nunder the recess appointments clause. That clause provides that the \nPresident may ``fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess \nof the Senate.'' That clause does not apply here, however, because the \nSenate was not in recess when President Obama made the appointments in \nquestion.\n  In making these appointments, the President did not state that he \nbelieves an intrasession adjournment of less than 3 days constitutes a \nrecess, and there can be little dispute that such a brief adjournment \nas occurred between January 3, 2012, when the second session of the \n112th Congress officially began, and January 6, 2012, when the next pro \nforma session of the Senate occurred, does not, in fact, constitute a \nrecess for purposes of the recess appointments clause.\n  The Department of Justice has consistently maintained that an \nintrasession adjournment must be longer than 3 days to constitute such \na recess. The text of the Constitution evidences that the Framers did \nnot consider an adjournment of less than 3 days to be constitutionally \nsignificant. Indeed, in article I, section 5, we read that ``neither \nHouse, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of \nthe other, adjourn for more than three days.''\n  Now, at the time these appointments--the appointments in question--\nwere made, the Senate had not received consent from the House of \nRepresentatives to adjourn for a period of time of more than 3 days. If \nan intrasession adjournment of less than 3 days were to be considered \nconstitutionally sufficient for the President to exercise his recess \nappointment power, it is unclear what, if anything, might prevent the \nPresident from routinely bypassing the Constitution's advice-and-\nconsent requirement and appointing nominees during even weekend \nadjournments.\n  The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel asserts that the \nPresident may unilaterally conclude that the Senate's brief pro forma \nsessions do not constitute sessions of the Senate for purposes of the \nrecess appointments clause. But this assertion is deeply flawed. It is \nfor the Senate and not for the President of the United States to \ndetermine when the Senate is in session. The Constitution expressly \ngrants the Senate the power to determine the rules of its own \nproceedings.\n  Granting the President unilateral power to override the Senate's \ndetermination of when it is in session would undermine the \nconstitutional prerogative and violate the Constitution's fundamental \nprinciples of separation of powers.\n  The OLC memorandum on which the President relies asserts that the \n``touchstone'' for determining when the Senate is in session is ``its \npractical effect: viz. whether or not the Senate is capable of \nexercising its constitutional function of advising and consenting to \nexecutive nominations.'' This analysis contradicts the text and the \noriginal understanding of the recess appointments clause.\n  The purpose of that clause, we read in Federalist No. 67 which was \nauthored by Alexander Hamilton, was to avoid obliging the Senate ``to \nbe continually in session for the appointment of officers.'' Nothing in \neither the Constitution's text or in the debate surrounding the recess \nappointment clause suggests in any way that the President should have \nthe unilateral power to appoint officers and judges at times when the \nSenate is regularly meeting, even if that body is not conducting \nsubstantial business.\n\n  In addition, the OLC memorandum's functionalist argument fails on its \nown terms. During the Senate's pro forma sessions, including its \nsession on January 6, 2012, the Senate was manifestly capable of \nexercising its constitutional function of advice and consent. Notably, \nat one such pro forma session on December 23, 2011, the Senate passed a \nsignificant piece of legislation demonstrating that it is, in fact, \ncapable of conducting business--meaningful business--at such sessions.\n  But regardless of how much business the Senate conducts during pro \nforma sessions or how much business it indicates in statements that it \nintends to conduct in advance of such sessions, the Senate has been and \ncontinues to be capable of conducting business at such sessions--\nincluding advising and consenting as to nominations for the President \nshould it decide to do so.\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\n  OLC's argument boils down to an untenable assertion that because the \nSenate has chosen not to act on the President's nominations during its \nsessions, it was incapable of doing so.\n  Finally, OLC's assertion that pro forma sessions are not cognizable \nfor purposes of the recess appointments clause violates established \nconstitutional practice and tradition. The Constitution provides that \n``[n]either House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the \nconsent of the other, adjourn for more than three days,'' and that \n``unless [Congress] shall by law appoint a different day,'' Congress \nshall begin each annual session by meeting ``at noon on the 3d day of \nJanuary.''\n  The Senate has commonly and without objection used pro forma sessions \nto fulfill both constitutional requirements, evidencing a past \nconsensus that such sessions are of constitutional significance. \nPresident Obama's novel assertion that such sessions no longer count \nfor purposes of the recess appointments clause thus upsets precedent \nand creates an internal contradiction in the treatment of Senate \nsessions for purposes of the Constitution.\n  President Obama's January 4, 2012, appointments to the CFPB and the \nNLRB are unconstitutional. As duly sworn Senators, we each have an \ninstitutional and a constitutional duty to preserve and defend the \nprerogatives of the Senate, particularly from the encroachments of the \nExecutive. The President's unconstitutional appointments simply cannot \nstand.\n  Throughout my time as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have \nmade it a point to work collaboratively with Members from across the \naisle, and I have also gone out of my way to cooperate with the current \nadministration to ensure that the overwhelming majority of the \nPresident's nominees to judicial and other positions are considered and \nreceive a vote. Both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor I \nvoted for dozens of nominees with whom I fundamentally disagreed on \nvarious issues simply because they were nominated by a President who \nwas duly elected by the people. But I will do so no more.\n  My concerns, to be clear, are nonpartisan, and I will be equally \ncritical of any Republican President who might attempt to make recess \nappointments under the same deeply flawed legal theory. Given this \nPresident's blatant and egregious disregard for proper constitutional \nprocedures and for the Senate's unquestioned role in such appointments, \nI find myself duty-bound to resist the consideration and approval of \nadditional nominations until the President takes steps to remedy the \nsituation.\n  Regardless of what precise course I choose to pursue, the President \ncertainly will not continue to enjoy my nearly complete cooperation \nunless and until he rescinds his unconstitutional recess appointments.\n  Thank you, Madam Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to spend a few minutes on the \nSenate floor to talk about home--about Alaska. We have a tendency \nsometimes up north to do things in a big way, a bold way. We tend to \nbrag a little bit about it. That is all OK. But we have been in the \ncenter of the news cycle for a few weeks this winter, at the onset of \nthis year, because of our weather which has been big and bold.\n  As a consequence of some of the extremes that we are seeing up north, \nI think it has brought out the best of Alaskans and certainly the \nwarmth that comes from a northern climate. I think the occupant of the \nchair sees that in her State where she has some conditions with snow \nand cold.\n  The neighbor-to-neighbor response that comes about when we are \ndealing with Mother Nature at her finest or at her most extreme, I \nthink, is something that helps define us as a people.\n  Today, I wish to speak for a few moments to recognize the very \nextraordinary efforts we have seen recently of the U.S. Coast Guard and \nthe Alaska National Guard in helping the residents of several of our \ncommunities since early this year.\n  Earlier on the Senate floor, my colleague, the junior Senator from \nAlaska, mentioned some of the events that have happened. He, too, \nacknowledged the hard work and very significant efforts of our Coast \nGuard and the Alaska National Guard. I think it is important to make \nsure we all take the time to tell the story, to share it with \ncolleagues and with people around the country.\n  In many parts of the United States right now there are some areas \nthat are just begging for snow. I have sons out in Colorado, and they \nare waiting. I know on the east coast many of us would prefer a little \nbit more snow. Sometimes it is one of those ``be careful what you ask \nfor'' situations, or we may be like the town of Valdez and have 27 feet \nof snow in our community. That is a little bit more than I think most \nof us would ask for or hope for.\n  The community of Nome has been in the news for months now as they \nhave felt the brunt of some early winter storms, storms that have \nforced them as a community in the northwest region of the State to feel \nthe pinch of Mother Nature in a very extreme way. Nome is a community \nof about 3,500 residents. It sits up on the west coast of Alaska. Most \npeople in this country recall Nome from the early days of the Gold \nRush. But more recently, Nome comes into the national news every March \nwhen the famous Iditarod dog sled race is run which finishes in Nome. \nIt is a 1,100-mile race where man and animal are pitched against Mother \nNature in a pretty intense way.\n  Nome makes it in the headlines for several different reasons. This \nyear adds yet another reason that Nome is in the history books, where \npeople are talking about this incredible part of the State. Alaska is \nknown for our tough winters and, again, I started my comments by saying \nwe kind of like the fact that we are tougher than the rest of the \nworld, and we brag about it. This winter, though, has been particularly \nharsh.\n  We have seen record cold. We have seen snowstorms hit the State \nearlier than usual. I was up in the State last week, places such as \nBethel where it normally averages about zero this time of year, and we \nare looking at 20 below for extended periods of time, not just a day or \ntwo. In southeastern Alaska not only have they been hit with below zero \ntemperatures, but massive amounts of snow are hitting them as well.\n  Nome is, again, a coastal community. When they receive their annual \nfuel supplies, they basically fuel up for the winter. The only way to \nget to Nome is to fly in or to go by water. So in order to get the fuel \ntanks filled up for the winter, the annual fuel barges come in early \nfall before they have ice conditions out in the Bering Sea.\n  This year, if you will recall, back in October, everybody was \nwatching the news because of the massive storms that were pounding \nwestern Alaska. Back in Washington, DC, every evening on the news we \ncould see these major storms coming through. If we were here or down in \nFlorida, they would have called them hurricane force winds. For us, it \nwas a winter storm--a tough one.\n  What happened with that storm is that it prevented the fuel barge \nfrom reaching Nome, so the shipment of fuel that they would receive for \nthe winter is not able to come in.\n  One might think, well, fuel up the community another way. Again, \nthere are no roads. What is the other way? The other way is aircraft. \nSo one would have to fly in barrels of fuel, driving the cost of fuel \nup, and, quite honestly, adding to the risk of transport. So it is an \nissue where fuel delivery by air, while it is possible, is not the \npreferable way. They are in a situation where they have not only a \ncommunity of 3,500 but all of the surrounding villages in the region \nrelying on Nome for their backup. So they are at risk too. Without the \nfuel tanks being filled, what the community and region were looking at \nwas a situation whereby about March--sometime in March, depending on \nhow harsh the winter was--they were going to run out of fuel.\n  Well, if the January temperatures are any indication--on average, it \nis usually about 2 degrees, but it has been 20 below and colder \nrecently. That means people go through fuel pretty darn quick. Then \nwhat do they do? They are stuck until spring. You say: Well, isn't \nApril or March spring? Not in Northwest Alaska because fuel barges \ncannot get to port until all of the ice in the Bering Sea has melted, \nwhich doesn't happen until May or June--perhaps earlier if the ice \nmoves.\n  That is the reality up north. So we have a major community and \noutlying villages that are looking at a very real threat to their \ncommunity. Senator Begich showed a picture on the Senate floor of gas \nprices in Alaska. When I was in Nome last week, I saw first-hand the \nprice of regular fuel at the pump was $5.43. That is what residents of \nNorthwestern Alaska are paying today. Diesel is a hair less than $6. If \nthey were having to fly in fuel for the balance of the winter, they \nwere looking at about $9 a gallon. This is on top of all of the other \nextraordinary costs they pay as a community that is reliant on air for \njust about everything they need.\n\n  Most of you may have seen the story in the news. Lots of people got \nto work to try to address the situation. I was in contact with the \nCoast Guard to see what they could do to help. The Coast Guard was \namazing in saying: Yes, we are committed to this mission. We are going \nto help the people of Nome, the people of the region. So what came \ntogether was a pretty interesting story.\n  There is a fuel tanker, the Renda, which is home-ported over in \nRussia. The Renda filled up with fuel in South Korea and was going to \npick up fuel in Japan. They got shut out of Japan by weather. They had \nto go to Unalaska, Dutch Harbor on the Aleutian Chain, to fill up. For \nthose of us who know of the Jones Act, there is an issue there. They \nhad to get the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, \nTransportation, and Energy to act to get a Jones Act waiver so the \nRussian fuel tanker could fill up in an Unalaska port and haul the fuel \nnorth to the people of Nome. It is a pretty interesting saga, just in \ndescribing the beginning.\n  This is more than a 1,000-mile nautical journey, and they were \nbreaking ice for about half of the way. The Renda is a pretty capable \nship, but she is not an icebreaker. How she got through that ice is an \ninteresting part of the story. The Coast Guard Cutter Healy, which had \nbeen on a research mission since early May and was on her way back to \nSeattle to deliver the crew got a call that Nome needed help. The fine \nmen and women of the Healy missed their Christmas, their New Year's, \nand headed back north to clear a path for the Renda to Nome.\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\n  Now, I think it is important to stop here and recognize that this is \nnot the Coast Guard doing something for the people of Nome or the \npeople of Alaska that is not part of the Coast Guard's mission. This \nmonth-long journey was the first fuel delivery through sea ice in \nAlaska's history, but not the first time the Coast Guard has worked to \nget fuel to a community. This is important.\n  Back in 2000, CWO Richard Glasgow testified about ice-breaking \noperations on the Hudson River. At that time, there were five Coast \nGuard cutters that performed ice-breaking duties from Sandy Hook, NJ, \nall the way up to Troy, NY. They were working to get heating fuel to \nabout 4 million people in the communities along the river. Officer \nGlasgow testified that as a direct result of the Coast Guard's \ncontinuous ice-breaking efforts that winter, all 274 petroleum-bearing \nbarges that started the trip up the Hudson made it through the ice.\n  He also noted if the Hudson had remained closed to barge traffic, it \nwould have taken over 21,000 tank truck loads to move that petroleum, \nassuming that the trucks were available to make those deliveries.\n  So we basically had a situation on the East Coast where the Coast \nGuard came to the rescue. They cleared a path so that commerce could be \nfacilitated, and these communities along the Hudson could have the fuel \nand the resources they needed. The Coast Guard made it happen in an \nefficient and environmentally responsible way--avoiding 21,000 tank \ntruck loads of fuel on the roads.\n  This is not unlike the role the Coast Guard has played in Alaska. The \ndifference with Nome is that there could not be 21,000 truck loads of \npetroleum because there are no roads for those trucks to travel to \nNome. So we did not have the option for any other means of transport to \nthe community short of air transport.\n  So when we look at what the Coast Guard Cutter Healy and Captain \nHavlik and all the crew members did, they were following in the \nfootsteps of many members of the Coast Guard before them in carrying \nout the Coast Guard's stated ice operations mission, which is to assist \nvessels and communities in emergency situations and facilitate \nessential commercial maritime activities.\n  The Coast Guard carried out this mission by assisting with 680 ice \ntransits, representing the transport of over $2 billion of cargo. \nSimilarly, just last year, Coast Guard cutters coordinated with the \nCanadian Coast Guard ships to facilitate the movement of about $2 \nbillion worth of critical goods on the Great Lakes.\n  I point this out because I think it is important for people to know \nthat in addition to all the other critical missions the Coast Guard \nhas, one of theirs is to assist vessels and communities in emergency \nsituations and to facilitate essential commercial maritime activities \nlike getting fuel--an absolute bare necessity to the people in this \nnorthwestern region at a time when temperatures are 20 below for days \nand days on end. It was critical to us, and the Coast Guard did a \nremarkable job.\n  Again, I wish to recognize these men and women who gave up their \nChristmas holiday, who gave up their New Year's holiday to assist \nAlaskans, and they were nothing short of remarkable. I had the \nopportunity to go on board the Healy when I was in Nome last week, as \nthe Renda was beginning to lay the hose from the fuel barge to the \nshore. I also spoke with the men and women and they were exceptionally \nproud of their mission. But I said to them: You will go back home and \nyour world will be changed because you will be able to stand and say: \nYes, I was on the Healy when we broke ice to get the Renda to northwest \nAlaska.\n  Let me give an update. Renda, the tanker, was able to get close to \nNome after weeks of transit made difficult by the winter conditions of \nthe thick ice and the currents and the winds. There were days when they \nactually went backward. The Coast Guard Cutter Healy would break the \nice, loosen it, but it was so cold and things were happening so fast, \nthe ice would refreeze the distance between the cutter and the Renda.\n  In addition to some pretty tough environmental conditions, we had \nsome language issues going on between the Coast Guard cutter and the \nRussian tanker. They had to translate the mission. We had some cultural \ndifferences going on. But what they were able to facilitate, again, was \npretty remarkable. I am giving laudatory praise to our Coast Guard, but \nI think it is also important to recognize the good work the crew of the \nRenda did in assisting as well.\n  Using NOAA's satellites to determine where the best mapping could be, \nwhere to cut through that, they were able to break through and get \nwithin about a half mile of the shore of Nome. It was close enough so \nthat when I got off the Healy, I was able to take a snow machine to \nshore. It was about a 3-minute snow machine ride. That is how close \nthey were able to get in safely to the shore. The Renda laid hose \nacross the ice to connect to the tankers onshore.\n  It was about a 6-day process to transfer the fuel to the community, \nbut the parties involved did it safely, without any incident \nwhatsoever. They were able to then close that operation and, last \nFriday, they took off from Nome to go back--the Renda to Russia and the \nCoast Guard Cutter Healy to Seattle.\n  I asked for a progress report just this afternoon. And as of today, \nthe Healy and the Renda were approximately 240 nautical miles southwest \nof Nome, 275 nautical miles from the ice edge. So they still have a \nlong way to go getting through the ice.\n  One might ask the question: Why don't they just go back the way they \ncame in? Because, obviously, they cut the trail. But it doesn't work \nthat way. It is cold up there. In fact, they are continuing to rely on \nthe NOAA satellites to help them map out a perhaps more efficient way, \nbut it has been tough. They have very challenging ice conditions and \nvery steady strong winds. The weather is giving them winds in excess of \n25 to 30 knots. Hopefully, they are going to be diminishing to 15 knots \non Friday. But they are working with NOAA and other folks to find the \nsafest, the most expedient route out of the ice. But the ice forecast \ncontinues to see ice edge expanding to the south. So all the progress \nthey are making going south, the ice is just coming at them in the \nother direction.\n  So it is challenging, but, again, these are extraordinary \nprofessionals across agencies. I have mentioned NOAA, and I mentioned \nwhat we needed to do in order to facilitate the Jones Act waiver \nthrough the Departments of Energy, Homeland Security, Transportation, \nand Defense, but we also had the State Department involved, we had the \nEPA involved, and the native corporation Sitnasuak to put this whole \nthing together. We had incredible local leadership coming out of the \ncommunity of Nome. We had the University of Alaska researchers who \nhelped with the UAVs to determine, again, how we best lay everything \nfrom the tanker in the safest place across the ice. An incredible act \nof collaboration.\n  I see my friend from Illinois is on the floor, and I know I have gone \nover my time, but I have about 3 more minutes to wrap up if that works \nfor my colleague. Senator Durbin comes from a State that appreciates \nsnow, and so I think my colleague would like to hear the rest of my \nstory because I am not done acknowledging the fine men and women of the \nAlaska National Guard who played a role in helping to dig out the \ncommunity of Cordova after record snowfall.\n  We have had some pretty tough snows. Cordova is a coastal community \nin south central Alaska, and they got hammered. They got about 176 \ninches of snow. Last week, when we checked in, they had 16 feet of snow \non the ground, which is pretty unusual. Not quite Valdez's record, \nwhich is sitting at 27 feet right now, but it was enough that roofs \nwere caving in and there were public safety concerns. What the \ncommunity did was come together, as small communities do, to try to \nshovel out, and 50 or 60 Alaska National Guardsmen were there to help. \nThe Coast Guard was there too helping to shovel--it was quite a lovely \ncommunity story.\n  Again, it is one of those stories that reminds us that whether Mother \nNature hits us with winds and storms and cold in the north, or \nhurricanes in the south, we come together as a people. We come together \nas communities to\n\n[[Page S117]]\n\nhelp, and sometimes we have some real heroes that emerge. Some of those \nheroes for us in Alaska these past few weeks have been our U.S. Coast \nGuard and our Alaska National Guardsmen and women.\n  As I started my comments, I said we do things bigger in Alaska, \nperhaps a little bolder. There is a new movie coming out that you may \nhave heard about. It is called ``Big Miracle.'' It is about the rescue \nof the whales back in the late 1980s. Some of you may remember the \nwhales were trapped in the ice off Point Barrow. It is a wonderful \nstory about how we, as Alaskans, came together with the Russians, state \nand federal agencies, environmental and other groups that would \nnormally not be allies, and regular folks for a common purpose. That \nmovie, ``Big Miracle,'' reminded me that in Alaska we have a few more \nbig miracles we can brag about, and they begin with people who truly \nmake the health, safety, and well-being of others their top priority, \neven when they do not know any of those people.\n  I know the people of Nome and Cordova and the people of Valdez all \ngive thanks to those who stepped up during these tough winter months to \nhelp us out and were there at our side. I thank the Chair for the extra \ntime, and I thank my colleague from Illinois for his patience and again \nextend my heartfelt thanks to our U.S. Coast Guard men and women, as \nwell as the fine men and women of the Alaska National Guard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Alaska \nand tell her that this week on National Public Radio there was a \nfeature about Cordova and all the snow they have had to deal with \nthere. I am sure this is perhaps commonplace in her great State, but as \nwe listened to it from Chicago, we felt blessed we haven't been hit too \nhard yet this winter. But our hearts go out to the men and women in the \nCoast Guard and the National Guard in Alaska and the people who are \nstruggling in Alaska's communities to survive these natural disasters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S117-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S117-S118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, each of us takes on an agenda in Congress, \nthings that are important to us personally, and sometimes one or two of \nthose issues become very personal and very important to us. The one \nthat has become very personal to me relates to the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act is a bill I introduced 10 years ago--10 years ago. To \nserve in the Senate, one has to be a patient person because nothing \nhappens quickly. But 10 years is long enough, and I am urging my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a close look at this \nlegislation today.\n  First, let me explain what it is all about. It is a bill that would \nallow students to literally earn their legal status in America. These \nare students who came to the United States as children. They have been \nhere for a long period of time. They have good moral character. They \nmust graduate from high school, speak English and complete at least 2 \nyears of service to our country in the military or at least 2 years of \ncollege, and that can include vocational training, which I think can be \nequally valuable to many young people. And I have talked to the \nPresiding Officer about this. I certainly believe that should be part \nof this conversation.\n  The DREAM Act would make us a better and stronger country. These \nyoung people are waiting for the opportunity to contribute to America. \nI have come to the floor dozens of times now to tell their stories. \nThere was a time when they were afraid to speak out and to identify \nthemselves. But thank God that has changed. They now speak out because \nthey understand when people see who they are, what they have done, and \nwhat their dreams are, they can appreciate the fact these are good \nyoung people who, when given a chance, will make us a safer and \nstronger nation.\n  That is why this proposal has been supported by the Department of \nDefense. They want these young people--these high school graduates of \ngood character--to come into our military and make it better. Of \ncourse, many others see this as a valuable addition to our economy--\ntomorrow's engineers and scientists and teachers and doctors and \nlawyers and entrepreneurs. These young people can make America a better \nplace.\n  I contacted the Obama administration last year, along with 21 of my \ncolleagues, and asked that they take a look at these young people when \nit comes to deportation. Understand we estimate there are 11 million \nundocumented people in America. There are some who just say: Oh, send \nthem all back.\n  That is not even in the realm of reality. So I have asked the Obama \nadministration, along with 20 of my colleagues, to focus on those who \nare any danger to the United States and send them back--deport them. In \nfact, the Obama administration has done just that. I have asked them as \nwell, since we have limited resources, to please try to identify those \nwho might fall into the qualification of the DREAM Act and do not \ndeport them.\n  There are some who argue: Oh, wait a minute. They should all go. But \nwe know we have limited resources for enforcement. If a person is a \nState trooper, parked on the side of a highway in Illinois or West \nVirginia, with a speed limit of 55 miles an hour, and one car comes by \nat 65 miles an hour and the next one comes hurtling by at 110 miles an \nhour and they can go after only one car, which one will they go after? \nWe know the answer. They go after the car that is traveling so fast it \nis a danger to its occupants and everyone else. The same is true when \nit comes to questions of deportation. Use good sound prosecutorial \njudgment, with limited resources, to deport only those people who could \nbe a threat or a danger to these United States. That is the first \npriority.\n  Earlier today, Senator Grassley, who is the ranking member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, came to the Senate floor and claimed that \nthe Obama administration is using this discretionary authority to \nimplement the DREAM Act because it failed to pass Congress. I \nrespectfully disagree with my friend from Iowa.\n  The DREAM Act would give these young people the chance to earn legal \nstatus. That is not the case when it comes to deportation. Even if they \nare not deported, they are still not in a legal or permanent legal \nsituation in the United States. Their future is still in doubt and in \nquestion. So there is no parallel as far as that is concerned.\n  I have come to the floor many times to introduce those who follow \nthis debate to these young people to get to know who they are and why I \nthink this cause is important and their lives are important to us. Let \nme introduce today two of them.\n  This is Alaa Mukahhal. Alaa is of Palestinian descent, was brought to \nthe United States by her parents 19 years ago when she was 7 years old. \nShe is 26, and she grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, my home State. \nShe was an honor student in high school and graduated from the \nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana Champaign--a great university--with a \nbachelor's degree in architecture. She sent me a letter, and here is \nwhat she said:\n\n       Being undocumented and with no pathway to the citizenship \n     means I actually can't use my architectural degree. It means \n     I can't get a job and move forward with my life. This year, \n     once again, we wait for Congress to do the right thing and \n     give undocumented young people all across America a chance to \n     better serve our communities and our country. I am an asset \n     to this country, a resource, with a desire to make good use \n     of my degree. I want to be able to work and design affordable \n     housing for low-income communities.\n\n  In the finest American tradition, Alaa has become an activist. She \nhas stepped out to introduce herself to America so we know who these \nDREAM Act students are and what they could mean to the future of our \nNation.\n  Let me also introduce to you this lovely young lady, Maria Luna. \nMaria has a heartbreaking but inspiring story.\n  Her mother lives in the United States. But just before she was to be \nborn in the United States, her mother fled the country and gave birth \nto her on the Mexican side of the border. Maria's mother abandoned her \nin Mexico at that point--left her when she was only 3 days old. \nLuckily, her\n\n[[Page S118]]\n\ngrandmother stepped in and started raising Maria in Los Angeles, CA. \nHer grandmother passed away when Maria was 10 years old.\n  After her grandmother's death, Maria went to live with her biological \nmother who, unfortunately, was abusive both physically and emotionally \nto this young woman. While she was in high school, Maria learned that \nshe did not have legal status because she was actually born across the \nborder in Mexico. She asked her mother to file the papers for her so \nthat she could be legal in America. Her mother refused, and she \nthreatened to turn her into the authorities if she caused any trouble \nat home.\n  Maria persevered. She became a straight-A student. She graduated from \nhigh school with a 4.2 GPA. This is what she said:\n\n       Even through everything that I was facing at home, I was \n     able to find relief at school. At school, I felt worthy. My \n     dignity was returned. I was valued based on my merit and \n     drive.\n\n  In 2010, Maria graduated from California State University of \nSacramento. She also decided to start to tell her story publicly about \nwhy she believes the DREAM Act is so important.\n  Maria wants to go to business school and become an entrepreneur. She \nhas begun a career in modeling--as you can tell, a lovely young lady--\nalthough she doesn't have legal status and can't be paid for her work. \nShe sent me a letter, and here is what she said:\n\n       Through my involvement through the DREAM Act I have learned \n     of many students who like me have excelled despite tough \n     odds. One thing that we all share in common is our hunger to \n     succeed and give back to this country. My dreams and \n     ambitions are all for America. This is where I belong. I know \n     no other home. It is here that I was given an opportunity, it \n     is here that I have become educated. America adopted me and \n     raised me as her own. And because of that, I am forever \n     indebted to her. All I want is to have the ability to give \n     back to my country.\n\n  Mr. President, you and I know this is a nation of immigrants. We are \nfortunate that at some point in the past our parents and grandparents \nhad the courage and determination to come to these shores and fight the \nodds. They came here speaking broken, if any, English. They persevered \nthrough the rejection of people who wanted nothing to do with \nimmigrants. They took the dirtiest, hardest jobs available because that \nwas it, and they prayed that their kids would have a better life. That \nwas the immigrant's dream, and it always has been. That is the dream of \nthese children: that they can have a better life, that they can make \nthis a better country. All they are asking for is a chance to earn the \nright to be legal, to earn it--not to be given it but to earn it.\n  I am going to continue to work for passage of the DREAM Act. I hope \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will look at this in an honest \nand fair way. I know immigration has been a hot button issue since \nright after the Pilgrims got off the Mayflower. The next boat that \narrived, I am sure some of the Pilgrims said: Oh, not more of those \npeople.\n  Well, that is the story of America. Thank goodness a lot of those \nimmigrants from Italy, from Lithuania, from Poland, from China, from \nMexico, decided to stick it out and fight for their future. These young \npeople deserve that same opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S118-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S118-S120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A SECOND OPINION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I have \nweek after week ever since the President's health care law was passed, \nto bring a doctor's second opinion about the health care law.\n  I traveled the State all the last week in Wyoming talking to people \nabout the things they look for in a health care law, which is what they \nwant as patients, as citizens. What they are looking for is the care \nthey need from a doctor they want at the price they can afford. Across \nthe board, they do not believe they are getting that with the health \ncare law that was passed in this body and then in the House and signed \nby President Obama during the last couple of years of the \nadministration.\n  It is interesting, as we went to the floor of the House in the House \nChamber this past week for the President's State of the Union speech, \nit was almost 7,000 words, and he focused very little on the health \ncare law.\n  One might say: Well, why is that? Well, it seems pretty obvious it is \nbecause that law was unpopular when it was passed, and it is actually \nmore unpopular with the American people today than it was the day it \nwas passed. The more people find out about it, the less popular \nit becomes.\n\n  Even the White House understands this law is deeply flawed, it is \nextremely unpopular, and it actually makes it harder for small \nbusinesses to create jobs. So when the President wants to talk about \njob creation in America, he realizes his health care law isn't helping, \nand it is actually making it worse.\n  I had townhall meetings in different communities around Wyoming last \nweek, where you gather a group of people together. My colleagues ought \nto do the same in their own communities and their home States and ask \nthe group of people: Do you believe, under this health care law--you \nremember, the one the President promised that if passed that the cost \nof your insurance would go down? Do you remember that law? Do you \nbelieve that after that was passed, that your health care costs will \nactually go up? How many believe the cost of your care will go up and \nyour insurance will go up? Every hand went up.\n  Then ask those same people, who now say they are going to end up \npaying more: Do you think the quality--because there is a lot of \ndiscussion about quality and access and concerns about care. Do you \nbelieve the quality of your care will go down? Again, the hands went \nup.\n  So we have people who are saying: We are going to be paying more and \ngetting less, and that is not what I want.\n  So today I am here to discuss something about the health care law \nthat the President did leave out of his big speech on Tuesday night, \nand that is the issue of waivers.\n  On January 6, while we were all back in our home communities, many \npeople talking to folks around their home States--on January 6, while \nCongress was not in session, the House was not in session, the Senate \nwas not in session--the administration ended their program that has \nbeen a major embarrassment to the Obama administration. Month by month, \nthe President has had to announce that he had to issue more and more \nwaivers from his health care law, waivers that the President granted to \nunions, to businesses, and to insurers. Each and every waiver served as \na clear admission that the health care law, as written, didn't get the \njob done and doesn't work.\n  Well, as of January 6, 2012, the administration has issued a total \nnumber of waivers that covers more than 4.1 million Americans. Over \n1,700 waivers were given covering more than 4.1 million Americans.\n  Now, interestingly, of all of those people, a very small percentage \nof workers in this country are union workers. Yet over half of all the \nwaivers given, 2.2 million of those people were those who are covered \nwith union insurance. So we have 4.1 million Americans given waivers. \nSo 2.2 million people with union insurance got a waiver; that is, 54 \npercent of all of the waivers went to union employees who supported the \nhealth care law. These are the people who were out in the streets \nrallying, saying: We want the health care law. They have it on their \nWeb sites. They had celebrations when it was passed.\n  Then, do you remember what Nancy Pelosi said? First, you have to pass \nit before you get to find out what is in it. As all these people \ngetting their insurance through unions found out, if they complied with \nthe law as written it would break their policies, break their programs, \nand they said: We cannot afford to have this law apply to us. Please \ngive us a waiver. And 2.2 million people with union insurance got a \nwaiver. As they say, they let the word out January 6, 2012, while \nCongress was not in session and while people were focused on other \nthings.\n  The rest of America's small business owners were not so lucky. A new \npoll from the Chamber of Commerce found that 78 percent of small \nbusinesses surveyed reported that taxation, regulation, and legislation \nfrom Washington made it harder for their businesses to\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\nhire more workers. These are the small businesses of the country, the \npeople who are the job creators. In that same poll, 74 percent of small \nbusiness owners said the recent health care law makes it harder for \ntheir business to hire more employees.\n  Now, aren't these the very people we are asking to go out and hire \nmore workers to get America back to work? Yet the President's and \nDemocrats' health care law is making it harder for 74 percent of small \nbusinesses in this country to hire more employees.\n  So how did we get here?\n  Well, in May of 2011 I came to the Senate floor, right here, and \nexplained that the waiver recipients, under the way it worked, had to \nreapply because they were getting annual benefit waiver limits year \nafter year after year. Realizing what an embarrassment this drip, drip, \ndrip of new waivers was going to be by the administration, in August of \n2011 the administration switched course. The Department of Health and \nHuman Services announced at that point that if people wanted a waiver, \nthey were going to have to apply for a final waiver that would carry on \nall the way through 2014--a 3-year waiver. They wanted to get all of \nthis out by the beginning of 2012 so it wouldn't be a continued \nelection year embarrassment for this President, this administration, \nand those who voted for it. This scheme allowed the administration to \ndodge issuing more waivers leading up to the 2012 Presidential \nelection.\n  It is clear these waivers were going to be an election year \nembarrassment for the President. They are an embarrassment because each \nand every waiver was yet another reminder to the American people that \nPresident Obama's health care law wasn't working.\n  The President promised, and we remember hearing him loudly and \nclearly: If you like the health insurance plan you have, then you can \nkeep it. Well, what he meant was, to keep the coverage you have, if you \nlike it, you may need a waiver from Washington.\n  I also want to talk for a moment about what happens now that this \nSeptember deadline has passed and these 4 million waivers have been \ngranted.\n  It is now no longer possible to apply for an annual benefit limit \nwaiver. It is no longer an option for business owners in this country. \nSo that means it leaves hard-working Americans who want to start a new \nbusiness forced to choose between two options. I think they are bad \noptions.\n  One, they can offer high-cost, government-approved health insurance. \nWell, that is going to make it very expensive for them to try to open a \nnew business and hire workers. The expense of opening that business may \nlikely be too great. So those jobs are not created, and unemployment \nrates stay high. No. 2, they could not offer coverage at all because \nthey cannot afford the health care law's onerous mandates. If they \nchose that second option, what happens ultimately? The American \ntaxpayers will end up footing the bill.\n\n  With a $15 trillion debt and unemployment hovering around 8.5 \npercent, the last thing we should do is adopt policies like this health \ncare law and then this waiver that discourage America's best and \nbrightest from starting new companies and hiring new workers. But that \nis exactly what President Obama's health care law does. It stifles \ninnovation, strangles the market, and it saddles the American people \nwith more debt.\n  This is just another example showing how the President's health care \npolicies are making the situation worse. His policies are hurting \nAmerica's economy. His policies are making the standard of living in \nAmerica worse. His policies are making health care in America worse. \nHis policies are making America's debt worse.\n  Almost immediately after President Obama signed this health care bill \ninto law, the employers around the country began to sound the alarm. \nThey said the health care law's annual benefit limit policy would force \nthem to stop offering health insurance to hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans and their families. That is why the administration came up \nwith this waiver idea. Nowhere in the health care law is the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services granted explicit authority to start an \nannual benefit limit waiver program--nowhere in the law. What the \nadministration should have done is come to Congress and ask for help to \nfix the problem they had created. That would mean, however, the \nPresident and Washington Democrats would have to admit their health \ncare law was flawed.\n  Washington Democrats crafted policy mandating that everyone must buy \ngovernment-approved health insurance. In many cases, it is insurance \nthese individuals do not need, do not want, and cannot afford. The \nPresident pushed his mandates on the American people without \nunderstanding how limited health insurance products work in the \nmarketplace. The administration simply ignored the fact that many \nemployers cannot afford to offer the Cadillac health insurance coverage \nto their workers that the government is mandating.\n  Now, if those businesses do not have a waiver already, they will not \nbe able to offer their employees any insurance coverage at all, and new \nbusiness startups will not have the opportunity to ask for a waiver. \nThose employers might have wanted to offer some basic level of health \ninsurance coverage to their new employees, but thanks to the Obama \nadministration they will not be able to offer anything at all because \nof the expense.\n  This is just another example of Washington Democrats pushing a one-\nsize-fits-all, ``we know best'' policy where they think they know what \nis best for all of the people of this country. How many more \ndisruptive, ticking timebombs are there lurking in this health care \nlaw? We do not know because many of the provisions do not even go into \neffect until 2014 or later. That is why I come to the floor week after \nweek giving a doctor's second opinion, to mention and to tell that I \nintend to fight each and every day to make sure the American people \nwill never have to find out, come 2014.\n  I am committed more than ever to repealing the health care law, \nrepealing it and replacing it with health care reforms that help \nAmerican families get the care they need from a doctor they want at a \nprice they can afford.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is not the time for a debate with my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming. I would just say there \nare two sides to the story. Try to have my friend, the Senator from \nWyoming, explain to Jeff Hill, a young man who, within 2 weeks after \nturning age 24--he had to go off his parents' insurance when he turned \n23--got testicular cancer. His parents had to spend money they didn't \nhave, borrow money they didn't have to take care of the problems this \nyoung man developed with testicular cancer, all the surgery, radiation, \nall the other chemo he had. Try to have him explain to the more than 2 \nmillion seniors who have been able to have wellness checks as a result \nof this law we passed. How about the people in Nevada who have come to \nme with tears in their eyes, explaining to me that their daughter or \nson now has the ability to have insurance because they cannot be denied \ninsurance because of a preexisting disability.\n  That is why we have seen this litigation which has been generated, \nand the appellate courts by a 3-to-2 margin have favored the law, \nincluding a brilliant decision written by an extremely conservative \njudge, Judge Silberman in the DC Court of Appeals, who upheld this law. \nThat is why many consumer groups have joined in the appeal to the U.S. \nSupreme Court, along with the pharmaceutical industry, along with the \ninsurance companies--because this is something that is good for the \nAmerican consumer.\n  That is why it was so unfortunate that the Republicans blocked \nsomething that would help consumers after the financial wizardry that \ntook place on Wall Street that basically tore down the economies of so \nmany different States. When we passed the Dodd bill, we wanted to make \nsure consumers were protected. That is why we tried for months and \nmonths to have someone selected to fill that spot.\n  Republicans said: We do not like the law. We like him, but we don't \nlike the law, so we do not want the law effectuated, so we are not \ngoing to approve him. And they did not. That is why President Obama, \nunder the terms of the Constitution that is written to protect this \ncountry, has in that Constitution the power of recess appointments.\n\n[[Page S120]]\n\nThat is what he did to protect the consumer.\n  The health care law we passed protects the consumer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S120-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

The report, which covers fiscal year 2012, was \nprepared by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to Section 308(b) \nand in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as \namended.\n  The report shows the effects of Congressional action through January \n20, 2012, and includes the effects of legislation enacted since passage \nof the Budget Control Act of 2011, which established allocations, \naggregates and other levels for 2011, 2012, 2012-16, and 2012-21. The \nlegislation includes: P.L. 112-29, the America Invents Act; P.L. 112-\n33, the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012; P.L. 112-40, an act to \nextend the Generalized System of Preferences, and for other purposes; \nP.L. 112-41, the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement \nImplementation Act; P.L. 112-42, the United States-Colombia Trade \nPromotion Agreement Implementation Act; P.L. 112-43, the United States-\nPanama Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act; P.L. 112-55, the \nConsolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012; P.L. 112-\n56, an act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the \nimposition of 3 percent withholding, and for other purposes; P.L. 112-\n74, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012; P.L. 112-77, the \nDisaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012; P.L. 112-78, the Temporary \nPayroll Tax Cut Continuation Act, 2012; and P.L. 112-80, an act to \namend title 39, U.S.C., to extend the authority of the United States \nPostal Service to issue a semipostal to raise funds for breast cancer \nresearch.\n  The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are \nconsistent with the technical and economic assumptions of Section 106 \nof the Budget Control Act of 2011 and CBO's March 2011 baseline.\n  The estimates show that for fiscal year 2012, spending is $27.5 \nbillion in budget authority and $20 billion in outlays above the levels \nprovided pursuant to the Budget Control Act, while revenues are $0.9 \nbillion below the levels provided pursuant to the Budget Control Act. \nThe overage in spending is the result of P.L. 112-78, the Temporary \nPayroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2012, which was passed at the end \nof last session. While that legislation was fully paid for over 10 \nyears, it increased spending in 2012. Finally, the estimates show that, \nin total, there has been no net change for Social Security.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter and accompanying tables from \nCBO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2012.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor former Czech \nPresident and renowned human rights activist Vaclav Havel. Vaclav Havel \ndied last month, and I was sad to note that the news of his death was \novershadowed by not only the holidays but also by media coverage of Kim \nJong Il's death. The irony--that one of the great leaders of the third \nwave of democracy, passed at virtually the same time as one of the \ncentury's most dangerous, repressive tyrants--is striking.\n  Eulogies to Havel from everyday Czechs, European and world leaders, \nand admirers across the globe have poured forth in the past month, and \nfor me, some of the most touching have come from the Czech Romani \ncommunity. The Roma community, which is often ostracized from and \ndisenchanted with mainstream politics, embraced Havel as a leader and a \nfriend. And indeed Emil Scuka, the Czech president of the International \nRomani Union, said ``Vaclav Havel was not afraid to publicly stand up \nfor Romani people even though he knew he could lose a great deal \npolitically by doing so because the public wouldn't like it. He never \nmade such political calculations in advance . . . With the death of \nVaclav Havel, all of us Romani people are losing a great defender, a \nfighter for freedom and human rights. We are losing the certainty that \nwhen things are at their worst, Vaclav Havel will help us. However, I \nbelieve his ideals, his ideas, and his philosophy will live on.''\n  I was also inspired by the eloquent tribute of Gabriela Hrabanova, a \nformer advisor to the Czech government on Romani issues, who said \n``Everyone has been writing about how this is the end of an era. I \nfirmly hope that is not the case. The legacy of Vaclav Havel must \nremain with us, and the space for truth and love in society must \ncontinue to increase.''\n  Just a few days before his death, Havel was actively following \nprotests in Moscow, and published an opinion in the independent Russian \nnewspaper Novaya gazeta, and called the current Russian government a \n``specific combination of old stereotypes and a new business-mafia \nenvironment.'' He encouraged Russian citizens to see that the current \nregime, which presents itself as democratic, is in fact not democratic \nat all. Exposing the truth of the repressive Communist regime lead to \nthe victory of his peaceful Velvet Revolution, and Havel was convinced \nthis experience could be replicated in Russia, if the citizens were \ncommitted.\n  I am not at all surprised by a report from Aung San Suu Kyi, who said \nshe received a letter in the days following Havel's death from Havel \nhimself. Suu Kyi said that Havel wrote from his deathbed that he was \nthinking of her and how the transitional experience from Czech Republic \nmight prove useful to her in Burma's transition and her own quest for \nfreedom and truth. Even in the last moments of his life, Havel was \nthinking about the imperiled human rights defenders around the world, \nfrom Russia to Burma, whom he could help.\n  And so it strikes me that in addition to the resolution honoring \nHavel, introduced by Senators Rubio and Lieberman, on which I am a \nproud cosponsor, we should also take this moment to rededicate \nourselves to the principles so clearly visible in the life of this \nvirtuous man. We must aid the Havels of this generation in their \nefforts to live in truth and freedom. We must do an even better job of \nprioritizing respect for human rights whenever we engage other \ngovernments, whether we are dealing with the transitional regime in \nEgypt, long-established rulers in Bahrain, newly elected leaders in \nHonduras, or strategic allies in Europe.\n  Vaclav Havel was a hero of the twentieth century, and I was very \nfortunate to have met him. I am also very proud of all that the \nHelsinki Commission and the United States did in Eastern Europe to \nsupport Havel and his friends in their quest to live in truth. We must \nstrive to honor that commitment in the rest of the world, so that \nHavel's legacy, and our own, lives on in the twenty-first century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S121-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S121-S122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL MICHAEL DUBIE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

He certainly deserves the honor.\n  Earlier this year, when Tropical Storm Irene devastated much of \nVermont, General Dubie led the Vermont National Guard in confronting \none of the most serious crises our State has ever faced. The Guard \nacted immediately to deliver emergency supplies to victims cut off by \nthe storm's destruction. Helicopters airdropped food and water. When it \nbecame apparent that Vermont needed more airlift because some of the\n\n[[Page S122]]\n\nVermont Guard's helicopters were in Iraq, General Dubie coordinated \nwith other State Guards to get the help Vermont needed.\n  The Guard's intensive rescue and aid mission eventually evolved into \na longer-term recovery and rebuilding mission. Skillfully and \ntirelessly, Vermont citizen-soldiers set to work removing debris and \nrebuilding roads and infrastructure.\n  General Dubie commanded some 500 activated Guard members in the wake \nof Irene. But that does not account for other ongoing missions in 2011, \nor the substantial contribution the Vermont Guard has made to the wars \nin Afghanistan and Iraq--including a major activation to Afghanistan in \n2010. In honoring General Dubie as Vermonter of the Year, we pay \ntribute to the tremendous sacrifice made both in State and overseas by \nVermont National Guard members and their families.\n  True to form, General Dubie, despite his extensive experience with \ndangerous overseas missions, has called the Irene deployment the \nproudest mission of his career because he was able to directly help so \nmany of his fellow Vermonters.\n  MG Michael Dubie is a proven leader and he embodies the best of \nVermont. I am proud to recognize his hard work and I wish him continued \nsuccess in his career.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Burlington Free Press article \nentitled ``Maj. Gen. Dubie is Vermonter of the Year'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 1, 2012]\n\n                Maj. Gen. Dubie Is Vermonter of the Year\n\n       As the Vermonter of the Year, we select Maj. Gen. Michael \n     Dubie, adjutant general of the Vermont National Guard, as the \n     representative of the team of men and women of the Guard and \n     the many civilians who worked together to help Vermont \n     recover from Tropical Storm Irene.\n       In our lifetime, Tropical Storm Irene is arguably the \n     biggest and most dominant local news story. Three people lost \n     their lives during the storm. Vermont National Guard 1st Sgt. \n     Shawn Stocker lost his life working to respond. Thousands \n     lost their homes, their businesses and many of their \n     possessions. Thousands more suffered property damage. Irene \n     washed away some roads, damaged many others and rendered \n     useless the state office complex in Waterbury.\n       Who would have thought that our state could recover so well \n     in less than 90 days!\n       Vermonters owe this recovery to so many. State and local \n     government leaders have done their jobs well. In every \n     community impacted by the storm, there were at least a few \n     civilians who devoted most of their time and energy for many \n     weeks helping their community respond and recover. Hundreds \n     of volunteers from all over our state and beyond stepped up \n     to do extraordinary things. They collectively demonstrated \n     both the indomitable spirit of Vermonters and our love for \n     community.\n       Approximately 500 Vermont National Guard members were \n     activated as well. We are especially mindful that this \n     activation is in addition to Air Guard deployments to Norway \n     and Korea, ongoing Vermont National Guard missions in \n     Djibouti, Kosovo, Macedonia and Senegal, helicopter rescues \n     in Iraq--all in 2011--and following the major activation to \n     Afghanistan in 2010. Let us also remember, as the Iraq War \n     officially comes to its end, the tremendous sacrifice made by \n     Vermont National Guard members and their families while \n     serving our country during these past nine years.\n       As Dubie said in nominating the men and women of the \n     Vermont National Guard, ``As you know, we are a team. It is \n     what makes us so strong.'' In responding to Tropical Storm \n     Irene, the Vermont ``team'' also included many civilians. \n     Together, the Vermont National Guard and the community \n     members searched and rescued and then delivered supplies to \n     people in otherwise unreachable locations. Then they began \n     reconstruction. In addition to the National Guard, all of \n     these volunteers should be commended and thanked for their \n     efforts.\n       We can choose only one person, however, as Vermonter of the \n     Year. Because so many people did so much, the selection \n     committee found it hard to identify a single individual to \n     recognize. So we choose Maj. Gen. Michael Dubie to honor them \n     all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S122-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     RECOGNIZING THE ``MAJOR CHARLES ROBERT SOLTES JR., O.D.

Department of \nVeterans Affairs Blind Rehabilitation Center.''\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S122, January 26, 2012, the Record reads: Mr. President, \ntoday I wish to . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Mr. \nBOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 111th \nCongress, I strongly supported the bill that ultimately became P.L. \n111-164. That law designated the Department of Veterans Affairs Blind \nRehabilitation Center in Long Beach, CA, as the ``Major Charles Robert \nSoltes, Jr., O.D. Department of Veterans Affairs Blind Rehabilitation \nCenter.''\n  Naming this facility after MAJ Charles Robert Soltes, Jr. is an \nappropriate expression of our support for our blinded veterans. In \n2004, while deployed in Iraq, MAJ Soltes was serving in the 426th Civil \nAffairs Battalion in the U.S. Army when the vehicle he was traveling in \nwas struck by an improvised explosive device, costing him his life.\n  MAJ Soltes was the first Army optometrist to be killed in action \nwhile on active duty. He left behind a long-lasting legacy in the \nveteran community. His sacrifices remain an inspiration, particularly \namongst the approximately 157,000 veterans in the United States who are \nlegally blind and the more than one million veterans suffering from \ndebilitating low vision.\n  Mr. President, I was the son of a World War II veteran and before \nentering public service, I practiced optometry in Rogers, AR. With that \nbackground, I hold an immense respect for, and a particularly strong \ninterest in, the care that VA blind rehabilitation centers provide our \nwounded warriors. Approximately 60 percent of veterans with known \ncombat-related Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and 30 percent with \nnoncombat-related TBI report vision symptoms. As eye injuries continue \nto plague our servicemembers overseas, our VA eye care providers play a \nvital role in the medical service our veterans receive.\n  This week, the VA health care system adds one more location where \nthose who have given so much for our freedoms can seek help with their \nvision problems. The dedication of this facility as the ``Major Charles \nRobert Soltes Jr., O.D. Department of Veterans Affairs Blind \nRehabilitation Center'' is a fitting tribute to a fallen hero who \ncommitted his life to our country and the health and wellbeing of his \nfellow Americans. The service and sacrifice of MAJ Soltes will not be \nforgotten and his dedication to country and mankind will live on \nthrough the increased care for our Nation's blind veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S122-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING ETTA JAMES\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the life and artistry of Etta James, the legendary \nsinger and entertainer who moved and delighted music lovers for more \nthan half a century. She died in her hometown of Riverside, CA last \nweek at the age of 73 after a long and valiant battle with leukemia.\n  Born Jamesetta Hawkins in Los Angeles in 1938, she began singing in \nthe St. Paul Baptist Church choir at age 5 and recorded her first hit \nrecord, ``The Wallflower (Roll With Me Henry),'' when she was just 15. \nEtta James was equally at home singing rhythm & blues classics like \n``Something's Got a Hold on Me,'' soulful ballads such as ``All I Could \nDo Was Cry,'' and passionate love songs including the incomparable ``At \nLast.''\n  I was fortunate enough to grow up with her music, dancing to ``The \nWallflower'' in high school, ``At Last'' as a newlywed, and ``Tell \nMama'' as a young mother. As she continued to tour and record, later \ngenerations marveled at her talents, reveled in her exuberant \nperformances, and admired her indomitable spirit.\n  Through her music, Etta James brought the joys and sorrows of life \nhome to millions of fans all over the world. She will be deeply missed, \nbut her music will live on in our hearts and souls.\n  On behalf of the people of California, I send my deepest condolences \nto her husband, Artis Mills; her two sons, Donto and Sametto James; and \nher four grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S122-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S122-S123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT TRAVIS RIDDICK\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

Master Sergeant Riddick joined the Marine Corps \nafter graduating from high school in Centerville, IA. In doing so, he \nwas following in a laudable family tradition of patriotic service. His \nfather and grandfather were marines, as well as his uncle and cousins. \nHis twin brother recently retired after 21 years in the Navy. Travis \nRiddick certainly did his family, his State, and his country proud. He \nwas awarded six Air Medals, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation \nMedal, four Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, seven Marine \nCorps Good Conduct Medals, two National Defense Service Medals, the \nSouthwest Asia Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq \nCampaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Armed Forces Service Medal, \nthe Humanitarian Service Medal, the NATO Medal, the NATO ISAF Medal, \nand the Kuwait Liberation Medal.\n  My prayers are with his mother, Barbara, his father, John, and his \nwife, Jennifer, as well as his children and all his family and friends. \nHis father reports that Travis loved his job and his mother said that \nhe was the best marine ever. Our Nation is tremendously fortunate to \nhave individuals like Travis Riddick who have the drive to step forward \nand serve their country with enthusiasm and honor. To selfless heroes \nlike Travis Riddick, we owe nothing short of our liberty. Unlike at the \nbirth of our country, when every person who aligned with the cause of \nfreedom was putting themselves at great risk, those who enjoy our way \nof life today rely on a select group of patriotic Americans to preserve \neverything we hold so dear. We can never repay the debt we owe, but we \nare obliged to honor and remember them for their sacrifice in the name \nof liberty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S123-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL HANDICAPPING CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n Mr. HELLER.

CROIX RIVER BRIDGE PROJECT\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nremarkable commitment of a key group of Senate staffers, who worked \ntirelessly over the last several months to ensure the passage of a \ncritical bill for advancing the bipartisan St. Croix River Bridge \nProject. By replacing the outdated, 80-year-old Stillwater Lift Bridge \nwith a bridge that adequately meets the needs of local businesses and \nfamilies, this bill will promote public safety and economic development \nin communities throughout the St. Croix River Valley.\n  Passing the bill was truly a team effort, requiring all hands on deck \nfrom lawmakers at the State, local and Federal level. We could not have \ndone it without the leadership of my co-sponsors in the Senate--Al \nFranken, Ron Johnson and Herb Kohl--or our colleagues in the House from \nboth Minnesota and Wisconsin. But most importantly, we could not have \nreached this important milestone without the talent and tenacity of the \nhard working people ``behind the scenes.''\n  This includes the staff of the Environment and Public Works and \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committees as well as the U.S. \nDepartments of Transportation and Interior, who worked closely with my \noffice. And it includes all of the hard-working members of my staff who \nlogged countless long hours to ensure we had a bill that was strong, \neffective and bipartisan. Their hard work made all the difference.\n  I am especially grateful to my Deputy-Legislative Director Travis \nTalvitie, who played an indispensible role every step of the way. \nTravis came into this process with a deep understanding of \ninfrastructure policy, which he immediately put to work on this bill. \nWhen he wasn't meeting with community leaders from Stillwater and the \nSt. Croix River Valley, he was coordinating with Federal agencies, and \nhas become an expert on the important Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n  Thanks to the efforts of all involved, I am hopeful that Minnesota \nand Wisconsin will soon have a bridge that not only improves public \nsafety and promotes economic growth, but preserves the incredible \nbeauty of the St. Croix River.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S123-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S123-S124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VERMONT STUDENTS' ESSAYS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord these essays written by Vermont High School students as part of \nthe second annual ``What is the State of the Union?'' essay contest \nconducted by my office. The following essays were selected as ``Runners \nUp.''\n  The Statements follow.\n\n             Monica Allard, Milton High School (Runner Up)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       The American Dream is adaptable. The ideals that we have \n     long valued are admirable, but often contradicting or \n     impossible to achieve with a large population. In today's \n     economy, that translates to the right to a free market \n     economy, conflicting with the practical need for government \n     interference; the right to succeed for oneself, battling with \n     the need to work together for today's and future generations. \n     As long as our country is able to prosper without certain \n     regulations, I encourage it to run free, but when the winter \n     comes and there is no more grazing, the horse must accept the \n     fence that accompanies the grain. It is imperative that \n     Americans collectively work to solve problems with social \n     security, our economy, and our political system in these \n     troubled times.\n       ``Maybe if we ignore it, it will go away'' has been the \n     standard approach to growing concerns about social security \n     in the last few years. Because of increasing life expectancy, \n     more people are retiring than the system can support. When \n     the newest generation retires, there won't be enough funds \n     for everyone, unless something changes soon. A fixed rate \n     retirement check is the logical solution, if we deduct money \n     from the fixed rate check based on income. Working citizens \n     would pay fewer taxes because only the people who need social \n     security will be receiving it, and everyone else would have \n     more money to put aside for their own retirement plans.\n       The predominant issue of the 21st century has been the \n     international recession. Unemployment rates are high, but \n     what many young Americans don't realize is the shortage in \n     technical workers. There is a national trend towards \n     traditional four-year universities, but technical careers are \n     the road to take if you are searching for job stability, \n     demand, potential for advancement, and self-employment or a \n     local employer in today's economy. Through ad campaigns and \n     offering incentives to students enrolling in technical \n     universities. This is a simple way to lower the unemployment \n     rate, while promoting local businesses.\n       Another important step in rejuvenating our economy is \n     passing legislation that gives the national government more \n     control over the stock market. Occupy movements have swept \n     the country and it is time for Congress to respond, instead \n     of hiring and appointing the same executives who were largely \n     responsible for our economy's collapse.\n       In order to move forward, we need to present a united \n     front. Republicans and Democrats are rending our country in \n     two because of partisan pressure. We need radical change in \n     the political system: remove all party authority. Primaries \n     and power distribution in Congress put too much emphasis\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\n     on parties, cause corruption, and detract from the primary \n     duty of Senators and Representatives to their states and \n     country.\n       As our soldiers rejoin their families at home we are forced \n     to turn our focus inward. Reform is necessary. It is not a \n     question of when nor is it a question of how. Rather, the \n     question is whether or not we are willing to do what is \n     necessary to save our great county. God bless America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Kayleigh Ehler-Vock, South Burlington High School (Runner Up)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       During a time of severe recession, a government facing \n     incredible debt, and a collapsing financial system, our \n     future looks dark. As a student that has been in the system \n     for 13 years, and will continue to higher education, I have \n     seen the benefits and complications of the current situation \n     with education. Next year, I will be attending college and \n     the cost of tuition is daunting. The high cost deters kids \n     from attending college. However, in our world today, a high \n     school diploma no longer ensures a hopeful career. \n     Republicans and democrats alike acknowledge the need to \n     invest in the skill and future of the youth.\n       Those who choose to continue their education to better \n     themselves and America should not be punished by entering the \n     real world chained down by debt; no one should be at the \n     bottom because they choose to go to college. According to \n     Helen Krispien of The Hopkinton Crier, the cost of private \n     college is approximately 57% of yearly income, and therefore \n     having two children in college is 114% of yearly income. The \n     cost of tuition is expected to increase by 5% per year, \n     leaving those in 15 years with tuition of $103,946. Reform is \n     needed. Colleges and universities must be required to cut \n     their own costs. They know their budget better than anyone, \n     and like our nation, they need to find a way to balance \n     competition with lowering skyrocketing costs. This will allow \n     for less borrowed education, and less government \n     intervention. Furthermore, revamp colleges in hometowns \n     allowing affordable options for the working class. As a \n     nation, we need to eliminate the interest that banks charge \n     on student loans. Instead, temporary tax breaks should be \n     given to those who have children that have attended college \n     for four years. This will allow for quicker repayment of \n     loans, and will insure a successful future for both the youth \n     and our nation. The government shouldn't be funding the \n     system the way they do now; funding should be used on reform.\n       Aspiring students see college as an investment into the \n     future; friendships, suitable partners, and a confidence in \n     them. In four years, I don't want to enter into a world of \n     hurt. I want to be a proud American, able to look back and \n     see what this great nation can do to recover from the \n     struggle we are facing. I want my parents to be able to \n     retire; they have worked hard to raise me and my siblings, \n     they deserve what they were promised. I am proud our \n     government is willing to listen, and if we work together as \n     one nation, America can be triumphant and re-establish the \n     high caliber and positive regard we have for much of history.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Kate Raszka, Champlain Valley Union High School (Runner Up)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       My fellow Americans: The current state of our nation is one \n     of anticipation; anticipation for the future and what changes \n     will occur in the government regarding both foreign and \n     domestic affairs.\n       Our country faces many difficulties: a struggling economy, \n     the draining of resources from involvement in foreign \n     conflicts, too few new jobs, environmental degradation, \n     uncertainty about how to pay for health care, and a damaged \n     international reputation because of our handling of suspected \n     terrorists. While we face many difficulties, we can find \n     strength as one union and pursue solutions as a nation.\n       The United States must continue to lead by example. We \n     should teach the world how to prevent the degradation of our \n     environment. We as a country can promote renewable energy \n     resources. This would create a larger, newer market which in \n     turn would provide many new jobs. We have the power to \n     directly change the future. We must lead the fight to \n     preserve our planet.\n       It is unfortunate that while our country faces many \n     domestic issues we have been deeply involved in conflicts \n     overseas. However, our involvement in Iraq has led to a more \n     stabilized and democratic country. As we pull out, we leave \n     with a success.\n       Currently our judicial branch is deciding whether or not \n     the recently passed health care bill violates individual and \n     states' rights. All Americans deserve affordable health care. \n     To be successful our citizens must be able to live without \n     the fear of being unable to provide themselves or their \n     children healthcare. It may be wrong to require all people to \n     buy insurance, but a solution must be found by our esteemed \n     members of Congress in which all seeking citizens will find \n     affordable health care.\n       The indefinite incarceration of our citizens suspected of \n     terrorist involvement is a wrong that must be corrected. The \n     National Defense Authorization Act is a direct violation of \n     habeas corpus and must be dealt with. I urge the Supreme \n     Court to do so immediately.\n       The greatest solution to our problems is to make our \n     education system the greatest in the world and prepare our \n     youth for the competitive future. Educating our children will \n     prepare our younger generations to solve new problems that \n     will undoubtedly arise in the future. Currently, our \n     children's test scores fall below other rising nations' \n     scores. With our resources these results are unacceptable. It \n     is time to ensure that all our citizens, particularly those \n     below the poverty line, can attend college.

As a sovereign power, we \n     must lead through example. While progress has been made in \n     three domestic key fronts, America must advance \n     environmentally, economically and educationally.\n       We must take the first step in saving the environment, or \n     it will not sustain us and our ever expanding nation. America \n     must take initiative; by reducing our dependency on foreign \n     oil, to improve relations abroad, and purses for Americans at \n     home. This is also an opportunity to create jobs for \n     Americans, through national programs that would emphasize a \n     greener economy, such as lowering the cost of public \n     transportation, cutting gasoline and foreign fuel spending, \n     and creating energy efficient plans for buildings and \n     residential areas. By funding regional and national projects, \n     we create jobs and take large steps forward towards a low \n     carbon future.\n       The necessary changes in the environment intertwines with \n     our second key front: education. We need to fund and broaden \n     opportunities ranging from the elementary to university \n     level. More programs with emphasis on environmental service, \n     protection and restoration would prepare the men and women of \n     America to attack real world problems. If the budget for \n     education were to increase, there would be more monetary \n     provisions for grants, payment for teachers and new programs. \n     Projects and research, such as investigating alternative fuel \n     resources, and technological innovations, would not only \n     benefit our environmental front, but would prepare our \n     nation's future for the larger arena they must compete in. \n     Let us not wait for another Sputnik crisis to advance in \n     education and the sciences. We need simply to offer \n     accessible opportunities for higher learning for the variety \n     of people that seek it.\n       The environmental and educational fronts cannot begin to \n     expand or flourish, without a sturdy and secure economic \n     front. We must also adapt our freestanding market: the debt \n     continues to rise, and the need to invest the American people \n     in their nation increases as well. We must restore the \n     people's faith in the government. Our middle class will \n     strengthen. Unfortunately, this has to be achieved through \n     austerity: budgets must be redistributed to focus on our \n     priorities, such as our three fronts. While the free market \n     begs for stimulus, we must not wane and give in, but offer a \n     firm guiding hand to decrease the national debt. This must \n     begin by focusing our resources on environmental changes, \n     which would be brought forth through advances in educational \n     programs. By becoming less dependent on foreign resources, we \n     not only further invest in our nation and economy, but \n     provide jobs for hardworking Americans.\n       If the United States is to remain a strong domestic and \n     international power, we must adapt to our current situation \n     and prepare for the upcoming year. We must make significant \n     changes in order to progress. These changes on our three \n     fronts--environment, economy and education--will be \n     difficult, but they are changes that will only benefit us; \n     these are changes we can believe in.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S123-3", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S123-S124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VERMONT STUDENTS' ESSAYS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord these essays written by Vermont High School students as part of \nthe second annual ``What is the State of the Union?'' essay contest \nconducted by my office. The following essays were selected as ``Runners \nUp.''\n  The Statements follow.\n\n             Monica Allard, Milton High School (Runner Up)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       The American Dream is adaptable. The ideals that we have \n     long valued are admirable, but often contradicting or \n     impossible to achieve with a large population. In today's \n     economy, that translates to the right to a free market \n     economy, conflicting with the practical need for government \n     interference; the right to succeed for oneself, battling with \n     the need to work together for today's and future generations. \n     As long as our country is able to prosper without certain \n     regulations, I encourage it to run free, but when the winter \n     comes and there is no more grazing, the horse must accept the \n     fence that accompanies the grain. It is imperative that \n     Americans collectively work to solve problems with social \n     security, our economy, and our political system in these \n     troubled times.\n       ``Maybe if we ignore it, it will go away'' has been the \n     standard approach to growing concerns about social security \n     in the last few years. Because of increasing life expectancy, \n     more people are retiring than the system can support. When \n     the newest generation retires, there won't be enough funds \n     for everyone, unless something changes soon. A fixed rate \n     retirement check is the logical solution, if we deduct money \n     from the fixed rate check based on income. Working citizens \n     would pay fewer taxes because only the people who need social \n     security will be receiving it, and everyone else would have \n     more money to put aside for their own retirement plans.\n       The predominant issue of the 21st century has been the \n     international recession. Unemployment rates are high, but \n     what many young Americans don't realize is the shortage in \n     technical workers. There is a national trend towards \n     traditional four-year universities, but technical careers are \n     the road to take if you are searching for job stability, \n     demand, potential for advancement, and self-employment or a \n     local employer in today's economy. Through ad campaigns and \n     offering incentives to students enrolling in technical \n     universities. This is a simple way to lower the unemployment \n     rate, while promoting local businesses.\n       Another important step in rejuvenating our economy is \n     passing legislation that gives the national government more \n     control over the stock market. Occupy movements have swept \n     the country and it is time for Congress to respond, instead \n     of hiring and appointing the same executives who were largely \n     responsible for our economy's collapse.\n       In order to move forward, we need to present a united \n     front. Republicans and Democrats are rending our country in \n     two because of partisan pressure. We need radical change in \n     the political system: remove all party authority. Primaries \n     and power distribution in Congress put too much emphasis\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\n     on parties, cause corruption, and detract from the primary \n     duty of Senators and Representatives to their states and \n     country.\n       As our soldiers rejoin their families at home we are forced \n     to turn our focus inward. Reform is necessary. It is not a \n     question of when nor is it a question of how. Rather, the \n     question is whether or not we are willing to do what is \n     necessary to save our great county. God bless America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Kayleigh Ehler-Vock, South Burlington High School (Runner Up)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       During a time of severe recession, a government facing \n     incredible debt, and a collapsing financial system, our \n     future looks dark. As a student that has been in the system \n     for 13 years, and will continue to higher education, I have \n     seen the benefits and complications of the current situation \n     with education. Next year, I will be attending college and \n     the cost of tuition is daunting. The high cost deters kids \n     from attending college. However, in our world today, a high \n     school diploma no longer ensures a hopeful career. \n     Republicans and democrats alike acknowledge the need to \n     invest in the skill and future of the youth.\n       Those who choose to continue their education to better \n     themselves and America should not be punished by entering the \n     real world chained down by debt; no one should be at the \n     bottom because they choose to go to college. According to \n     Helen Krispien of The Hopkinton Crier, the cost of private \n     college is approximately 57% of yearly income, and therefore \n     having two children in college is 114% of yearly income. The \n     cost of tuition is expected to increase by 5% per year, \n     leaving those in 15 years with tuition of $103,946. Reform is \n     needed. Colleges and universities must be required to cut \n     their own costs. They know their budget better than anyone, \n     and like our nation, they need to find a way to balance \n     competition with lowering skyrocketing costs. This will allow \n     for less borrowed education, and less government \n     intervention. Furthermore, revamp colleges in hometowns \n     allowing affordable options for the working class. As a \n     nation, we need to eliminate the interest that banks charge \n     on student loans. Instead, temporary tax breaks should be \n     given to those who have children that have attended college \n     for four years. This will allow for quicker repayment of \n     loans, and will insure a successful future for both the youth \n     and our nation. The government shouldn't be funding the \n     system the way they do now; funding should be used on reform.\n       Aspiring students see college as an investment into the \n     future; friendships, suitable partners, and a confidence in \n     them. In four years, I don't want to enter into a world of \n     hurt. I want to be a proud American, able to look back and \n     see what this great nation can do to recover from the \n     struggle we are facing. I want my parents to be able to \n     retire; they have worked hard to raise me and my siblings, \n     they deserve what they were promised. I am proud our \n     government is willing to listen, and if we work together as \n     one nation, America can be triumphant and re-establish the \n     high caliber and positive regard we have for much of history.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Kate Raszka, Champlain Valley Union High School (Runner Up)\n\n                           [January 23, 2012]\n\n       My fellow Americans: The current state of our nation is one \n     of anticipation; anticipation for the future and what changes \n     will occur in the government regarding both foreign and \n     domestic affairs.\n       Our country faces many difficulties: a struggling economy, \n     the draining of resources from involvement in foreign \n     conflicts, too few new jobs, environmental degradation, \n     uncertainty about how to pay for health care, and a damaged \n     international reputation because of our handling of suspected \n     terrorists. While we face many difficulties, we can find \n     strength as one union and pursue solutions as a nation.\n       The United States must continue to lead by example. We \n     should teach the world how to prevent the degradation of our \n     environment. We as a country can promote renewable energy \n     resources. This would create a larger, newer market which in \n     turn would provide many new jobs. We have the power to \n     directly change the future. We must lead the fight to \n     preserve our planet.\n       It is unfortunate that while our country faces many \n     domestic issues we have been deeply involved in conflicts \n     overseas. However, our involvement in Iraq has led to a more \n     stabilized and democratic country. As we pull out, we leave \n     with a success.\n       Currently our judicial branch is deciding whether or not \n     the recently passed health care bill violates individual and \n     states' rights. All Americans deserve affordable health care. \n     To be successful our citizens must be able to live without \n     the fear of being unable to provide themselves or their \n     children healthcare. It may be wrong to require all people to \n     buy insurance, but a solution must be found by our esteemed \n     members of Congress in which all seeking citizens will find \n     affordable health care.\n       The indefinite incarceration of our citizens suspected of \n     terrorist involvement is a wrong that must be corrected. The \n     National Defense Authorization Act is a direct violation of \n     habeas corpus and must be dealt with. I urge the Supreme \n     Court to do so immediately.\n       The greatest solution to our problems is to make our \n     education system the greatest in the world and prepare our \n     youth for the competitive future. Educating our children will \n     prepare our younger generations to solve new problems that \n     will undoubtedly arise in the future. Currently, our \n     children's test scores fall below other rising nations' \n     scores. With our resources these results are unacceptable. It \n     is time to ensure that all our citizens, particularly those \n     below the poverty line, can attend college. Many of the \n     students with low test scores live in poor environments with \n     few opportunities.

BARLOW\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate former Utah State Senate President Haven J. Barlow on his \nrecent 90th birthday. He is a true patriot who spent much of his life \nserving his State and his country, and I thank him for that service.\n  Haven was born January 4, 1922 in Clearfield, UT to Jesse B. and \nIssadora Beck Barlow. His mother Issadora was killed in a tragic car/\ntrain accident when he was just 9 months old, causing him to learn his \nshare of responsibility at an early age.\n  After graduating from Davis High School, Haven earned a degree in \nbusiness administration at Utah State Agricultural College, now Utah \nState University. He joined the U.S. Navy and attended officer \ncandidate school at Harvard University. He served as a naval supply and \ndisbursement officer in the Pacific and the Atlantic in World War II, \nreceiving the Philippine Liberation Medal.\n\n[[Page S125]]\n\n  Haven and his wife Bonnie Rae Ellison Barlow were married for 58 \nyears before Bonnie Rae passed away at age 79. Haven and Bonnie Rae \nreturned to Davis County after World War II, where they reared their \nsix children in Layton.\n  In 1949, Haven started the Barlow Realty and Insurance Company, and \nhe still checks in daily at the very successful real estate development \noffice.\n  In 1952, Haven was elected to the Utah State Legislature, where he \nserved consecutively for 42 years from 1953 to 1994, longer than any \nother legislator in Utah history. He served as President of the Utah \nState Senate for 6 years.\n  While serving as a senator and representative for 42 years in the \nUtah State Legislature, Haven introduced and sponsored a number of \npieces of legislation that formulated the landscape in northern Utah. \nIn the field of education, one of Haven's passions, he supported the \nestablishment of then-Weber State College as a 4-year school, Weber \nState's transition from college to university, and the securing of \nfunding for the Weber State Davis Campus. Today, Weber State boasts \nover 24,000 students. Haven also supported the bill that turned Utah \nState Agricultural College into Utah State University.\n  Haven backed legislation that created the Davis Applied Technology \nCenter, which is now the Davis Applied Technology College. The \nvocational school trains students in a variety of technologies and \nskills that can be directly applied to the workplace. Additionally, \nHaven supported the Ogden-Weber Applied Technology Center, also now a \ncollege, which offers similar services to its students.\n  In 1981, Haven was a proponent of the Hill Aerospace Museum, which \nwas founded that year and is now home to over 90 aircraft. The museum \nhosted its millionth visitor in 1996, and now has nearly 200,000 \nvisitors annually.\n  Even given his many accomplishments, there is perhaps nothing more \nadmirable about Haven than his support for charity. He sponsored \nlegislation that created the Utah Botanical Center, home of a ``giving \ngarden'' which donates all produce to local food banks. He has also \ndonated money and countless hours to the United Way of Salt Lake, and \nhas been known to tell skeptical donors that if they wound up unhappy \nabout their donations, he would pay them back personally. United Way of \nSalt Lake Regional Director Jim Young has said of Haven, ``[His] \nirrepressibly positive attitude makes him a joy to be around. He has \nwhat a colleague of mine calls `yes, in his heart.' Haven's heart for \nthose around him challenges us to become more involved in our community \nand make a difference.''\n  The world is a better place because of Haven Barlow. He is an example \nfor all Americans to follow, and I wish him a very happy 90th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S125-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING CYR BUS LINES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, during the past 100 years our \ncountry has seen remarkable changes. From horse drawn-carriages to cars \nand airplanes, and handwritten letters to text messaging, our world has \nundergone a vast transformation. Few small businesses have had the \ntenacity to adapt to these changes and continue to prosper, but those \nwho have, deserve our sincerest praise. With this in mind, today I rise \nto recognize Cyr Bus Lines, located in Old Town, ME, which this year \ncelebrates its 100th anniversary.\n  When John T. Cyr founded this small transportation firm in 1912, it \nutilized horses and carriages for transporting everything from timber \nto passengers. And now, the Cyr name is highly regarded throughout \nMaine for its elite bus transportation. As the needs of Maine changed, \nso did the company, shifting from local trucking to expand into school \nbuses and motor coaches to best suit the wishes of its customers. The \nresult of Cyr's successful adaptation has been a flourishing \nenterprise.\n  Today, Cyr buses are a familiar sight to numerous school children and \nparents, serving 17 different school districts across Maine. \nAdditionally, the company offers over 120 guided coach tours, allowing \ncustomers a relaxing and informative trip to several destinations. In \n2012, these guided tours include routes to popular destinations \nthroughout New England as well as more distant favorites such as Quebec \nand New Orleans. This year, one could even book a tour aboard a \nluxurious Cyr bus to visit Washington D.C. during the magnificent \ncherry blossom season.\n  Cyr Bus Lines represents a true family-owned small business, which \nhas been handed down throughout generations and is now owned and \noperated by the founder's grandson, Joe Cyr. Joe took over operations \nin 1967 from his father, Harvey, and has continually strived to improve \nthe company. As the years have progressed, the fourth generation of the \nCyr family has become involved with Joe's son Mike running the coach \ndepartment and Joe's daughter Becky acting as bookkeeper.\n  In light of this firm's long-term success, it should come as no \nsurprise that this small business has received several honors \nrecognizing their commitment to safety and quality. Most recently in \n2011, Cyr Bus Lines was awarded the International Motor Coach Group, \nIMG, award for Motor Coach Safety. Further, at the 2011 annual meeting \nof the Maine Chamber Group Trust, the local provider for workers' \ncompensation insurance, Cyr Bus Lines received honors for both ``Most \nImproved Safety Program'' and for ``No Indemnity Claims in 2010.'' \nAdditionally on April 21, 2011, two of Cyr's employees received first \nplace trophies, in the categories of transit school bus and \nconventional school bus, for their exceptional driving skills at the \nMaine Association for Pupil Transportation Central Maine Conference and \nSchool Bus Rodeo.\n  A century later, Cyr Bus Lines continues to maintain a position of \nexcellence in the community. This small business' tireless and \nsuccessful efforts to persevere and prosper in a changing environment \nrepresent a truly monumental achievement. I am proud to extend my \ncongratulations to the Cyr family and everyone at Cyr Bus Lines on \ntheir 100th anniversary. I offer my best wishes for their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S125-2", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S125-S126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF THE MAINE ASSOCIATION OF AGRICULTURAL FAIRS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Maine \nAssociation of Agricultural Fairs and to congratulate this venerable \norganization on 100 years of championing the agricultural fair industry \nand the agricultural community of Maine.\n  As the Maine Association of Agricultural Fairs celebrates its \ncentennial anniversary, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the remarkable progress and strides made by this historic \norganization in this century and the last. Founded in 1912, the \nAssociation served as a vital catalyst in uniting the agricultural \nfairs across Maine and promoting a shared spirit of fellowship and \ncooperation.\n  What was once a welcomed vehicle for local farmers to exchange and \nshowcase their cattle and goods has over many decades evolved into 26 \nofficially licensed agricultural fairs. During Maine's fair season, \nwhich starts in July and ends in early October, families can look \nforward to any number of events that have achieved iconic status, \nincluding harness racing, educational museums, the world's largest \nsteer and oxen show, as well as a world-class Woodsmen's Day \ncompetition--all of which speak to Maine's legendary work ethic and \ncan-do spirit.\n  Every one of Maine's storied agricultural fairs has its own persona, \ntradition, and imprint on the landscape of our State and the unerring \ncharacter of our people. In fact, just last year I had the privilege of \nattending two agricultural fairs--the Skowhegan Fair which began in \n1818 and, according to the Association, lays claim to being the oldest \ncontinuous-running fair in the United States, and the Fryeburg Fair \nwhich is considered Maine's largest agricultural fair, attracting more \nthan 300,000 people annually.\n  In this second decade of the 21st century, the integral role that the \nMaine Association of Agricultural Fairs and that agriculture itself \ncontinue to play in the lives of Mainers could not be more paramount or \nindispensable. As many of my colleagues in the Senate can attest, and \nas thousands of Mainers undeniably understand firsthand, the \nagricultural industry is one of the bedrock foundations of our State \nand Nation--central both to consumption and commerce.\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\n  In fact, it was the Father of our country, President George \nWashington, also an avid agriculturist, who considered the improvement \nof agriculture as one of the greatest pursuits ``in which more real and \nimportant services can be rendered to any country.'' I could not agree \nmore!!\n  What was true at the founding of our great Nation remains ever-true \ntoday because of the example set by all in my State who are tied \nirrevocably to working the land, and by the exceptional leadership of \nthe Maine Association of Agricultural Fairs, Board Members, and \nvolunteers. We could not be more appreciative to them for the well-\nearned spotlight they shine on the infinite contributions made by Maine \nfarmers and organized fairs, which have become a staple on the yearly \ncalendar for our State and indeed across New England. To experience one \nof these wonderful fairs is to witness the very best of who we are as \nMainers and to experience the limitless pride our farmers take in \ncultivating the bounty our great State has to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S126-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe following enrolled bill, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, was signed on January 25, 2012, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, by the President pro tempore (Mr. Inouye).\n\n       H.R. 3237.

A bill to reauthorize and improve the Older Americans Act of \n1965, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is no great secret that our country \ntoday faces many enormously difficult problems. We remain in the midst \nof a very serious recession. Real unemployment is at about 15 percent. \nOur middle class continues to decline. The gap between the very rich \nand everybody else is growing wider. Fifty million Americans have no \nhealth insurance. Millions of young people are struggling, trying to \nfigure out how they are going to make it into college and pay for their \ncollege education. But in the midst of all of those problems, I hope \nvery much that we do not forget about the problems facing one of the \nmost vulnerable sectors of our society; that is, senior citizens.\n  We are an aging population. That is no secret. Today, and every day, \nsome 10,000 Americans reach the age of 65. If we as a nation do not \nbegin to address the very serious reality of an aging population, we \nare going to be in a lot of trouble that we are not anticipating.\n  One of the issues we have to understand is that not only are we an \naging population, but many of those people who are becoming 65 and \nolder are dealing with issues of poverty. Incredibly enough, 20 percent \nof the seniors in this country are living on average incomes of $7,500 \nper year--$7,500 per year average income for the bottom 20 percent of \nseniors in this country. Frighteningly, and embarrassingly, more and \nmore seniors in this country are literally going hungry. Today, there \nare almost 1 million seniors who go hungry and many more who face the \nthreat of hunger. That should not be happening in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  What America is supposed to be about is that when we age, we can live \nout our remaining years with security and dignity, not trying to find \nfood in order to stay alive.\n  Now, that is the bad news. The good news is that we have Federal \nlegislation called the Older American Act which, to some degree, begins \nto address these very serious problems.\n  I am happy to announce, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nPrimary Health and Aging, we are introducing legislation to reauthorize \nand improve the Older Americans Act.\n  The legislation we are offering is going to do its very best to say \nsenior citizens in this country will not go hungry. This legislation is \ngoing to significantly increase funding for senior centers all over \nthis country, to provide congregate meal programs in senior centers. In \nmy view, these congregate meal programs are enormously important, not \nonly because they provide good nutrition to seniors all over our Nation \nbut also they allow seniors to come together to socialize, to talk to \neach other, to get some of the professional help they need in their \nwaning years. So we have to strengthen the congregate meal program, and \nthat is what this bill does.\n  In addition to that, there is another program which is almost life \nand death to some of the most fragile and vulnerable people in this \ncountry; that is, the Meals on Wheels Program. What Meals on Wheels is \nabout--it takes place all\n\n[[Page S134]]\n\nover this country--is, you have people in senior centers and in other \ninstitutions who take meals--a good, quality, nutritious hot meal--to \nseniors, sometimes living at the end of a dirt road in Vermont or in \nUtah or in New Hampshire. These are people who cannot leave their \nhomes, especially in the wintertime. These are people who, in some \ncases, would not survive if they did not have that Meals on Wheels \nProgram.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to thank the many volunteers from \nsenior centers and other institutions who get in their cars and trucks \nto take these hot meals to seniors all over this country through the \nMeals on Wheels Program.\n  What we are finding in my State of Vermont--and what we are finding \naround the country--is, many senior centers simply do not have the \nresources now to accommodate the growing number of seniors who need the \nMeals on Wheels Program.\n  Let me further say to any of my friends who say: Senator Sanders, \nthis is a good idea. It is going to cost money. Yes, it will. Increased \nfunding for Meals on Wheels and congregate meals will cost additional \nrevenue. But at the end of the day, the Federal Government will save \nmoney. We have had hearings on this issue. We have had physicians come \nforward, and they say one of the reasons seniors end up in the \nhospital, seniors end up in the emergency room, is because they are \nmalnourished. Sometimes, literally, because of poor nourishment, they \nfall, break their hips, at great expense to Medicaid or Medicare. So \nnot only is it the right and moral thing to do to keep seniors in this \ncountry from going hungry; in the long run, we save money by keeping \nthem healthy.\n  Furthermore, in this bill, we are going to do something I think is \nlong overdue. There has been a lot of discussion in the Senate and in \nthe House about Social Security. Some of my friends--often Republicans, \nsometimes Democrats--think we should cut Social Security, we should try \nto move toward a balanced budget by cutting funding for some of the \nmost vulnerable people in this country. I strongly oppose that.\n  One of the arguments brought forth to cut Social Security is: The \nCOLA--the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly; how we determine what \nthe COLA is--it is too generous. It is inadequate. When I tell that to \nsenior citizens in Vermont, do you know what they do? They laugh. They \nliterally laugh when I tell them there are people in Washington, DC, \nwho believe the formulation as to how we determine COLAs is too \ngenerous, and they say: Bernie, we have not gotten a COLA for the last \n2 years, so how is this too generous? They are, of course, right.\n  The way we, in my view, formulate the COLA right now is inadequate, \nnot because it is too generous but quite the contrary. The truth is, \nseniors' purchasing needs are different than the general population. \nEverybody knows that. Seniors spend a higher percentage of their income \non prescription drugs. They spend it on health care. In cold-weather \nStates such as mine and New Hampshire, they spend it on keeping warm. \nSenior citizens are not out there, by and large, buying flat-screen TVs \nor laptop computers or iPhones or iPads. Their money is going into \nhealth care.\n  What has been happening in recent years is, while the cost of some \nproducts--electronics in general--has been going down, the cost of \nprescription drugs and health care has been going up. So when you tell \nseniors their COLA is too generous, they tell you that makes no sense \nat all because they are spending more and more on health care, \nprescription drugs, staying warm in the wintertime.\n  So what we have done in this bill is requested that the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics improve the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly, or \nCPI-E, by including more of the items seniors spend money on, such as \nprescription drugs and other health care costs. We must have a more \naccurate measure for COLAs for seniors, and I believe this is the path \nto a fair COLA.\n  I look forward to working with all the Members of the Senate to make \nsure we do right by our parents and our grandparents, that we make sure \nseniors in this country can live out their remaining years in security \nand dignity by reauthorizing a strong and fair Older Americans Act in \nthe coming months.\n  I especially want to applaud Senators Kohl, Mikulski, Casey, and \nFranken for introducing other thoughtful, innovative, and important \nOlder Americans Act amendments.\n  We are at a critical moment in American history.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1469) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. LEVEES.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and\n       (2) the term ``covered hazard mitigation land'' means \n     land--\n       (A) acquired and deed restricted under section 404(b) of \n     the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c(b)) before, on, or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) that is located--\n       (i) in North Dakota; and\n       (ii) in a community that--\n\n       (I) is participating in the National Flood Insurance \n     Program on the date on which a State, local, or tribal \n     government submits an application requesting to construct a \n     permanent flood risk reduction levee under subsection (b); \n     and\n       (II) certifies to the Administrator and the Chief of \n     Engineers that the community will\n\n[[Page S137]]\n\n     continue to participate in the National Flood Insurance \n     Program.\n\n       (b) Authority.--Notwithstanding clause (i) or (ii) of \n     section 404(b)(2)(B) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster \n     Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n     5170c(b)(2)(B)), the Administrator shall approve the \n     construction of a permanent flood risk reduction levee by a \n     State, local, or tribal government on covered hazard \n     mitigation land if the Administrator and the Chief of \n     Engineers determine, through a process established by the \n     Administrator and Chief of Engineers and funded entirely by \n     the State, local, or tribal government seeking to construct \n     the proposed levee, that--\n       (1) construction of the proposed permanent flood risk \n     reduction levee would more effectively mitigate against \n     flooding risk than an open floodplain or other flood risk \n     reduction measures;\n       (2) the proposed permanent flood risk reduction levee \n     complies with Federal, State, and local requirements, \n     including mitigation of adverse impacts and implementation of \n     floodplain management requirements, which shall include an \n     evaluation of whether the construction, operation, and \n     maintenance of the proposed levee would continue to meet best \n     available industry standards and practices, would be the most \n     cost-effective measure to protect against the assessed flood \n     risk and minimizes future costs to the federal government;\n       (3) the State, local, or tribal government seeking to \n     construct the proposed levee has provided an adequate \n     maintenance plan that documents the procedures the State, \n     local, or tribal government will use to ensure that the \n     stability, height, and overall integrity of the proposed \n     levee and the structure and systems of the proposed levee are \n     maintained, including--\n       (A) specifying the maintenance activities to be performed;\n       (B) specifying the frequency with which maintenance \n     activities will be performed;\n       (C) specifying the person responsible for performing each \n     maintenance activity (by name or title);\n       (D) detailing the plan for financing the maintenance of the \n     levee; and\n       (E) documenting the ability of the State, local, or tribal \n     government to finance the maintenance of the levee.\n       (c) Maintenance Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--A State, local, or tribal government that \n     constructs a permanent flood risk reduction levee under \n     subsection (b) shall submit to the Administrator and the \n     Chief of Engineers an annual certification indicating whether \n     the State, local, or tribal government is in compliance with \n     the maintenance plan provided under subsection (b)(3).\n       (2) Review.--The Chief of Engineers shall review a \n     certification submitted under paragraph (1) and determine \n     whether the State, local, or tribal government has complied \n     with the maintenance plan.\n\n  The bill (S. 2039), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S137-1", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JANUARY 30, 2012, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, if I could just take a moment. I know my \nfriend from Arkansas is here to speak.\n  This is the last day this group of pages, who have been here since \nSeptember, will spend in the Senate. I believe I am going to speak at \ntheir graduation--I am quite sure that is true--tomorrow.\n  I think the pages render such terrific service to this body. They do \na lot of things. They get very little credit for what they do, but we \ndepend on them for some of the most menial tasks a lot of times. But \nthey are always polite. I have never had one treat me impolitely in all \nof the years I have been in the Senate. I can only speak from personal \nexperience, and I have said this before on the Senate floor, and I will \nsay it again: My two oldest grandchildren--granddaughters--both served \nin the Senate as pages, and it really changed their lives. I say that \nwithout any reservation. They became more in tune with what is going on \nin our country, and it hasn't left them. They look back with great--I \ndon't know if ``reverence'' is the right word, maybe that is the wrong \nchoice, but they look back certainly fondly on their experience here in \nthe Senate.\n  I hope these young men and women understand how much we appreciate \nwhat they do. I do hope from a personal perspective that they have \nbenefited as much as my two granddaughters did during their time here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S137-5", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES SERGEANT FIRST CLASS BENJAMIN WISE\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, we are constantly reminded of the \nsacrifices of American troops and their families. These brave Americans \nfight for our freedoms and our values while putting their own lives at \nrisk. We must always remember their service and thank them for their \npatriotism, dedication, and commitment, and honor those who have paid \nthe ultimate price.\n  Today I am here to pay my respects to Arkansas soldier SFC Benjamin \nWise, who sacrificed his life for the love of his country while in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Sergeant 1st Class Wise graduated from West Side Christian School in \nEl Dorado, AR, in 1995, and enlisted in the military in 2000, joining \nthe Army as an infantryman assigned to the 520th Infantry Regiment, 2nd \nInfantry Division at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.\n  He discussed his military service with the Hope Star in 2004, saying \nthat he was proud to be a soldier and that he wanted to serve his \ncountry.\n  In 2005, he volunteered for the special forces--something his sister \nHeather told the Arkansas Democrat Gazette was something he talked \nabout growing up. His new position in the 3rd Battalion, 1st Special \nForces Group suited him well. Sergeant 1st Class Wise's comrades said \nhe was a friend to all of the members of his unit, cracking jokes and \noffering an ear to listen to all of their concerns.\n  He was well aware of the dangers he faced, having served four \ndeployments--twice to Iraq and twice to Afghanistan. His family says \nthat Ben was proud of the career he built in the Army. He was all too \nfamiliar with the sacrifices associated with work in war-torn \nAfghanistan after his brother, Jeremy Wise, a former Navy SEAL working \nas a security contractor, was killed in the country in December of \n2009.\n  On Monday, January 9, 2012, Sergeant 1st Class Wise was injured \nduring an attack by insurgents during a small-arms fight. He passed \naway on January 15, 2012.\n  SFC Benjamin Wise is a true American hero. I ask my colleagues to \nkeep his family--his wife Traci, sons Luke and Ryan, and daughter \nKailen--and his friends in their thoughts and prayers during these very \ndifficult times. I humbly offer my appreciation and gratitude--and I \nknow I speak for the Senate and Congress as a whole--to this patriot \nand his family for his selfless sacrifice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/01/26/senate-section/article/S137-6", "month": "01", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 30, 2012, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.
