Mr. President, we have 5 days remaining until a few \nextremist Republicans--and note I say ``a few''--drive our economy off \na cliff because they are too radical and inexperienced to compromise. \nFinancial experts are begging Congress to come to an agreement that \naverts a first-ever default on this Nation's financial obligations.\n  This is what one financial analyst said yesterday about the need to \navert a default crisis which would spark a global economic depression.\n  The market is saying we need a deal. Default is starting to seep into \nthe marketplace.\n  It will not be long, they say, before our financial markets severely \nreact to continued stubbornness by the tea party Republicans, tanking \nour economy. Wall Street had a very bad day yesterday--its worst in \nmonths--largely based on the news that Congress still has not found a \npath forward.\n  That does not only affect big investment banks or wealthy investors; \nall around the country, ordinary Americans with 401(k)s and college \nsavings accounts lost money yesterday. Their life savings took a hit \nbecause a small group of radical Republicans who do not represent \nmainstream Americans have refused to move even 1 inch toward \ncompromise.\n  Yesterday's bad economic news should be a sign to those Republicans \nwho deny reality. Default will rock our financial system to its core. \nMany reasonable Republicans realize time is running out. They have \nurged their colleagues to compromise.\n  Yesterday on the Senate floor, John McCain, the Republican senior \nSenator from Arizona and President Obama's opponent in the last \nPresidential election, asked his own party to return to reality. It \n``is not fair to the American people to hold out and say we won't agree \nto raising the debt limit. . . . ''\n  He called the radical Republican approach--saying up is down and \ndenying\n\n[[Page S4974]]\n\nthe sky is blue--``unfair'' and ``bizarro.'' Those are quotes from John \nMcCain. He further said:\n\n       It's time we listened to the markets. It's time we listened \n     to the American people and sit down and seriously negotiate.\n\n  He was talking to his fellow Republicans and, in particular, to a tea \nparty that does not seem to realize Republicans control only one-half \nof one branch of government. That faction of the Republican Party is \nholding our economy hostage. That is an understatement.\n  My counterpart, Senator McConnell, also urged a return to reason.\n\n       We cannot get a perfect solution, from my point of view, \n     controlling only the House of Representatives. So I'm \n     prepared to accept something less than perfect because \n     perfect is not achievable.\n\n  That is from Senator Mitch McConnell. Both sides know neither side \nwill get everything it wants. That does not mean we should not come \ntogether to find a compromise that gives each side something it needs. \nRepublicans have drawn the line at ending wasteful tax breaks for \ncorporate jet owners and oil companies making record profits. They have \nvowed to protect corporate welfare at taxpayer expense. Democrats have \nvowed to protect senior citizens who rely on Social Security and \nMedicare benefits. We will not allow them to suffer while Republicans \nprotect tax breaks for billionaires.\n  The compromise plan we are considering in the Senate protects both of \nthese priorities--both parties' priorities. Whether one agrees with the \npriorities, the legislation I have on the floor in the form of an \namendment protects those priorities--Democratic priorities and \nRepublican priorities.\n  Unfortunately, in a concession to Republicans, we did not ask \nmillionaires and billionaires to contribute their fair share. We would \nhave loved to have done it. But the line has been drawn by the \nRepublicans and we followed that. But it does protect seniors who \nRepublicans insist should feel the pain.\n  It would also avert a default crisis while cutting $2.5 trillion from \nthe deficit. That is twice as much as the Boehner plan. Yet House \nRepublicans refuse to support the Senate compromise. I am happy to talk \nto any of my Republican colleagues--I have talked to several of them, I \nam happy to continue that--to listen to reasonable suggestions to make \nthe Senate compromise legislation even better. That would require tea \nparty Republicans to admit ``compromise'' is not a bad word.\n  Legislation is the art of compromise, and they need to learn that. A \nsignificant number of House Republicans said their party would rather \nsee this Nation default on its financial obligations than cooperate \nwith Democrats. That says it all. It is hard to comprehend that, but \nthere has been a spate of these Members of the House of Representatives \nwho have said they would rather see the Nation default on its financial \nobligations than cooperate.\n  This kind of thinking has been roundly rejected by the American \npeople. Nearly three-quarters of Americans want Congress to compromise, \neven if neither side gets everything it wants. The American people know \nwe cannot get everything we want.\n  This thinking has also been rejected by reasonable Republicans. I had \nthe good fortune of serving with the very famous American, Fred \nThompson from Tennessee. He was famous before he got here. He is a \nmovie actor. He served in the Senate admirably and went back to do his \nacting. Former Senator Fred Thompson--by the way, he is a Republican--\nurged members of his own party in an open letter to the House GOP to \nrecognize a good deal when they see it. That is what he said. ``I \nrespectfully suggest that you rake in your chips, stuff them in your \npockets, and go home.''\n  The proposal on the table would cut the deficit by $2.5 trillion. If \ntheir goal is to rein in spending, they already won. That is what Fred \nThompson said: ``If their goal is to rein in spending, they've already \nwon.'' Declare victory and leave. Republicans should know--this is Fred \nThompson--``when to take their chips and walk away.''\n  American writer Elbert Hubbard said, ``It is easy to get everything \nyou want, provided you first learn to do without the things you cannot \nget.'' That is what this is all about. ``It is easy to get everything \nyou want, provided you first learn to do without the things you cannot \nget.''\n  There are things that either side cannot get. Accept that and move \non. Republicans cannot get the short-term Band-Aid they will vote on in \nthe House today. It will not get one Democratic vote in the Senate. All \n53 members of the Senate Democratic caucus wrote to the Speaker last \nnight--the letter was hand-delivered to him--to tell him why we will \nnot vote for it.\n  The economy needs more certainty than the Speaker's proposal would \nprovide. We must not be back in 6 weeks doing the same thing I have \nbeen involved in for 7 or 8 months. We do not need to do that. \nWashington has been locked down with this debt crisis debate. The White \nHouse is not doing all they need to do. We are not doing the things we \nneed to do. We cannot come back to this in just a few short weeks. That \nis what would happen.\n  We must not be back here in 6 weeks or 6 months debating whether to \nallow our Nation to default on its financial obligations for the \nRepublican rightwing that seems to be controlling so much of what they \nare doing in the House.\n  It would be easy for Republicans to get nearly everything they want \nif only they embraced the Senate's true compromise plan and stop, as \nSenator McCain put it, deceiving the American people--his words not \nmine.\n  The question remains, will my Republican colleagues be wise enough to \nend this stalemate?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S4974-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4974-S4975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM EXTENSION AND REFORM ACT OF 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.

In just a few \ndays, the U.S. Government will no longer have the ability to borrow \nmoney to pay its bills--a situation the President and his advisers said \nwould trigger an economic Armageddon.\n  I was shocked last night when 53 Senate Democrats issued a letter \nsaying they intend to vote against the only piece of legislation that \nhas any chance of preventing all this from happening. Even more \nshocking is the fact that Democratic leaders and the President himself \nhave endorsed every feature of this legislation except one, and that is \nthe fact that it doesn't allow the President to avoid another national \ndebate about spending and debt until after the next Presidential \nelection. Every other feature of the House bill was essentially agreed \nto earlier except for one--the President wants to avoid having another \ndiscussion about deficit and debt before the election. This assurance \nis the only thing the President and Senate Democrats are holding out \nfor right now.\n  The Democrats can try to justify their opposition to the House bill \nany way they want. They can claim they are worried about a stalemate 6 \nmonths from now. They can ignore the fact that of the 31 times Congress \nand the President have raised the debt limit over the past 25 years, 22 \nof those debt limit increases lasted less than a year. President \nReagan, in 1984, signed three bills in the course of his election year \nthat raised the debt ceiling. It was not unusual. In fact, what is \nunusual is to ask for $2.7 trillion in debt limit increase. That is \nunusual. That is unprecedented.\n  So what is worse, a default now or a potential default 6 months down \nthe road? Because if those 53 Senate Democrats follow through on their \nthreat to filibuster the House bill, that is what they will be doing--\nensuring default now rather than working with us to prevent it later. \nWhy would you want to do that? The answer is, to make the President's \nreelection campaign a little bit easier.\n  It is inconceivable to me that the President would actually follow \nthrough on this threat. After all, the President's first responsibility \nis to do what is best for the country, not his reelection campaign. The \nsame goes for our friends on the other side of the aisle. It is \ninconceivable to me that they would actually block the only bill that \nwould get through the House of Representatives and prevent a default \nright now. Inconceivable. It is inconceivable to me that they would do \nthis for no other reason than to help the President avoid having \nanother debate before the election about the need for Washington to get \nits fiscal house in order. But that is precisely what we may be headed \nfor this weekend--guaranteed default or a bill that takes the specter \nof a default off the table, while giving us another opportunity to \naddress the very deficits and debts that caused this crisis in the \nfirst place.\n  Senate Democrats are playing with fire, and it is hard to conclude \nthey are doing it for any other reason than politics. So I urge our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle this morning to rethink their \nposition and join Republicans in preventing default.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S4975-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak to the need \nto come to an agreement. We need to come to an agreement on how we \nhandle the debt ceiling. We need to come to agreement on addressing our \nNation's deficit and debt.\n  Let us review where we are right now. If you look at our fiscal \nsituation, right now the Federal Government takes in revenues on an \nannual basis of $2.2 trillion--$2.2 trillion--a year, but at the same \ntime we are spending $3.7 trillion. That is a shortfall, or a deficit, \nof more than $1.5 trillion a year.\n  I look at these young people here in this Chamber--these great pages \nfrom all over the country--and I think about what that means not only \nfor us today--for our economy, for our standing in the world, for the \nsecurity of our country--but I think about what it means for future \ngenerations. What is it we leave them? Do we leave them a country that \nwas founded on the concept of freedom and liberty, that people could \npursue life on their own terms, raise their families the way they \nwanted to raise their families, live the way they wanted to live, do \nthe work they wanted to do, have an opportunity to start a business, to \nbuild a life, and be successful and pass something of value on to their \nchildren?\n  I think that is what we all want. That is the Nation we have--the \nNation we have had for over 200 years. That is the Nation we want to \npass on to these great young people.\n  So we have had tremendous debate for an extended period of time--for \na long time. Many good ideas have been brought forth by both sides of \nthe aisle, by Republicans and by Democrats, on how we should address \nthis debt ceiling agreement, how we should address the deficit and the \ndebt. Nobody has the corner on good ideas. There have been many good \nideas brought forward, but now is the time we have to realize we have \nto come to agreement. The American people want us to come to an \nagreement.\n  Today the House is considering the Budget Control Act of 2011, \nreferred to as the Boehner proposal, and they are over there working on \nit right now. As with any agreement, somebody can certainly find \nsomething to criticize. That is always true. No agreement is perfect. \nBut it does represent many of the ideas that both sides have brought \nforward as a way to come to agreement on this debt ceiling and, more \nimportantly, as a way to start to get our fiscal house back in order. \nLet's talk about it for just a minute.\n  Under the proposal, first there would be a reduction in spending, a \nsavings of more than $900 billion, and that would also provide for a \n$900 billion increase in the debt ceiling to get us past this immediate \nissue. Then, at the same time, it appoints a committee--not a \ncommission but a committee--of Senators and Representatives, 12 \nmembers--6 Senators, 3 Republican, 3 Democrat; 6 House Members, 3 \nRepublican, 3 Democrat--who are required to find at least another $1.8 \ntrillion in savings. Those savings have to be found before there is \nanother increase in the debt ceiling.\n  That is the right way to do things. That is getting the horse in \nfront of the cart, not the reverse. So they have to find those savings \nin a bipartisan way, and they have to bring those concepts back to the \nHouse and to the Senate, and the House and the Senate will have a \nstraight up-or-down vote--the elected representatives of the people \ndoing their job for the people in an open and transparent way.\n  Think about this committee for a minute. Again, there are 12 members: \n6 Republicans, 6 Democrats; 6 Senators, 6 Members of the House. They \ncan bring forward all of these great ideas that have been debated in \nrecent months. They can bring forward ideas from the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission that have gained support. They can bring forward ideas from \nthe Gang of 6 that people believe are meritorious. They can bring \nforward ideas for savings. They can bring ideas forward for reform. \nThey can bring ideas forward for tax reform that don't raise taxes but \nactually eliminate loopholes, reduce rates, create a progrowth \nenvironment, and the revenues come from a growing economy, not from \nhigher taxes. They can come forward with all of these ideas and more.\n  But the important point is they must come forward by November with \n$1.8 trillion in savings to help get us back on the right path, the \nright path to good fiscal management. The debt ceiling is not increased \nin that second step until they do. That is making sure we fulfill our \nresponsibility and do things in the right order.\n  Then this bill also provides that we have a vote on a balanced budget \namendment, and that vote on the balanced budget amendment must be \nsometime between October 1 and the end of the year. Myself and others \nhave cosponsored a balanced budget amendment, and I strongly believe \nthat is what we need.\n  I understand there are differences of opinion, but when we look at \nthe situation we recognize we need that fiscal discipline in \nWashington, DC. If we just think about it for a minute, a balanced \nbudget amendment, how does it work? Well, it works in a way that gets \neverybody involved, not just in Washington, DC, but throughout this \ngreat Nation--because what are we doing? By passing a balanced budget \namendment in the Congress, which we have to do with two-thirds of the \nSenate and two-thirds of the House, what we are doing is starting that \nbalanced budget amendment on its way traveling throughout this country \nand saying to the people of this good country: What do you want to do?\n  Why not ask the people? That is how our democracy works. Why not ask \nthem: Do you want to make sure we have a balanced budget that requires \nCongress to see that, year in and year out, we are living within our \nmeans?\n  Forty-nine States have either a constitutional or statutory \nrequirement to balance their budget to live within their means. Cities \ndo, counties, families, businesses. Since three-fourths of the States \nwould have to ratify that balanced budget amendment as well, we say to \nthem: Look, we think we need a balanced budget, and we are going to \nmake sure you have an opportunity to say what you think. I believe that \nis exactly what we should do.\n  I bring experience as a Governor. I served as a Governor for 10 \nyears, and we were required to balance our budget every single year. We \nwent to the people and we talked to them.\n  We said: Here is the plan. We don't have the dollars right now to \nfund all the things you want. This was back in 2000-2002 when we \nactually had to reduce our budget, make reductions across the board. We \nsaid: But do you know what we are going to do? We are going to make \nsure we live within our means and we create a progrowth environment, \nlegal taxes and regulatory certainty that will enable business \nexpansion, business growth, entrepreneurship, private investment, and \nget this economy growing, get jobs, get economic growth. Then with that \ngrowth we will make sure each year we fund our priorities; that we set \nsome aside, some reserve aside for a rainy day, and that we do our best \nto continue to reduce the tax burden on our hard-working citizens. It \ndoesn't happen in a week, it doesn't happen in a month, a year, or 2 \nyears. It takes time to build to the position that you want. But we can \ndo it. We have done it before.\n  If we look at the late 1980s, coming out of the stagflation of the \n1970s and the early 1980s, in the late 1980s we had stagflation--\nmeaning high inflation, meaning high unemployment, an economy that was \nmoribund, people weren't working, a growing deficit. But by creating a \nprogrowth environment and good fiscal management from the late 1980s \nover into the decade of the 1990s, we not only put people back to work, \nwe eliminated that deficit and we built a surplus. We can do it again. \nIt is all about the right approach.\n  So here we are today. Today we need to take that first step, and I \ncome back to where I started. It may not be the plan exactly the way \neverybody wants it, but it is a plan that we can approve, and it brings \ntogether concepts that people on both sides of the aisle have brought \nforward. So now we need to come together and do our work for the \nAmerican people. We need to come together and pass this agreement.\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nlooming August 2 deadline. This is when the Department of the Treasury \nestimates the Federal Government will officially hit the $14.2 trillion \ndebt ceiling. We all know we are at the point where we are because we \nhave a fundamental difference in principle on how our government should \nbe run. At the same time, most agree that our country cannot go into \ndefault, so we are in a very tough situation with a very short time \nperiod.\n  That is why I am concerned about the delay on this issue. Delay means \nharm--harm to Americans and harm to our economic recovery, especially \nas we grapple with a 9.2-percent unemployment rate, which is the \nelephant in the room. We must address jobs if we are going to have an \neconomy that is thriving and in a recovery period. A jobless recovery \nis not a recovery.\n  The administration's reluctance to resolve this crisis has brought \nthe very real potential of a downgrade in our country's triple A bond \nrating. As we get closer to next Tuesday, Standard & Poor's and Moody's \nand other rating agencies await the details of the final debt \nagreement. Then they will determine if our Nation's triple A credit \nrating will be downgraded. The implications of the rating could affect \nconsumers at a very bad time. It could include a rise in interest rates \non home loans, on small business loans, on student loans, and credit \ncards.\n  Yesterday the stock market fell nearly 200 points, a 1.6-percent \ndrop. That was the third straight day of stock market decline. It \nleaves the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 3.3 percent and nearly on \ntrack for its worst week since August of 2010.\n  The threat of a downgrade is also hurting our dollar. The dollar's \nvalue fell and hit a new 2011 low against the Japanese yen and a record \nlow against the Swiss franc.\n  Two things are clear. First, uncertainty and anxiety are prevalent, \ndomestically and in the global markets. Second, this anxiety \nunderscores the need to address our debt ceiling and deficit reduction \nsimultaneously. While the fundamental principles on which we base our \nsolutions to this crisis are vastly different, I do believe that both \nsides of the aisle in Congress and both Houses of Congress share the \nsame goal.\n  The Senate majority leader and the House Speaker have put forward \nplans. I believe we must find a common ground between the House and the \nSenate with the proposals that have been put out by the Group of 6, by \nthe majority leader, by the minority leader on our side as well as the \nSpeaker on the House side. There have been a lot of proposals and there \nhave been good parts in several of these proposals where we need to \ncome together and find the best parts that we can agree on, knowing we \nare a divided Congress and a divided government, and move forward to a \nconclusion.\n  We can get meaningful immediate spending cuts as well as caps on \nfuture spending. That would be a very important achievement. It would \nbe a major step forward because that is not where we were when we \nstarted. Spending cuts and caps on future spending would be a major \nstep in the right direction. We can allow the debt limit to increase in \nproportion to the cuts, the real cuts. We can do this without tax \nhikes, because the fact is, the idea that we can tax our way out of \ndebt has been completely repudiated. So we can cut spending, we can cap \nfuture spending, we can raise the debt limit in accordance with those \ncaps, and without any new taxes.\n  That is a significant achievement as well because certainly the \nPresident was talking about increasing taxes, increasing taxes, \nincreasing taxes when this whole negotiation began. We on our side have \nstood firm against new taxes, knowing this is a very fragile economic \ntime in our country. If we want people to be hired, if we want the \nunemployment rate to come down, we cannot saddle our small businesses \nwith new taxes.\n  We can send a clear message to the markets and to our debtors that we \ncan stop spending too much so we will not need to tax any more, and we \ncertainly do not want to borrow as much and have the drag we see on our \neconomy. Americans know that in Washington we are spending too much, we \nare taxing plenty, and we are borrowing too much.\n  There is more we can do. We will not get to a balanced budget without \nlooking at entitlements because the discretionary spending is such a \nsmall part of our total budget. Our entitlement programs are the major \npart of the need for reform. Our entitlement programs are nearly \nbankrupt. If left unchanged, our promises to current and future \nbeneficiaries will be broken.\n  Mandatory spending is the long-term driver of our debt problems. The \nFederal Government spends approximately $2.1 trillion a year on \nentitlement programs, about two-thirds of our total Federal budget. I \nhave introduced a bill, the Defend and Save Social Security Act, that \nwould put that very important program on a fiscally sound path without \ncutting core benefits or raising taxes. My proposal will cover the 75-\nyear shortfall, and anyone who is currently 58 years old and above will \nhave no effect whatsoever with the gradual increase in retirement age. \nThe beginning of the increase in retirement age would start with people \nwho are under 58, and then it would be only 3 months a year. So if you \nare 57 you would only retire 3 months later. If you are 56 it would be \n6 months later to start on Social Security.\n  The Senate majority leader and the House Speaker have offered \nproposals that call for a bipartisan, bicameral congressional committee \nto fix the fiscal imbalance in our Nation's finances. It is imperative \nthat this joint committee--if it is passed by both Houses of Congress--\nconfront entitlement reform. Entitlement reform is at the core of any \nlong-term solution to our Nation's financial problems. If we act now, \nwe can make progress in a very gradual way, and if we wait, it is going \nto be much more stark and much more problematic for people who depend \non Social Security or Medicare. The opportunity to raise our debt \nceiling is a defining moment in the future of our government. Let us \nconfront the problem today and not delay the inevitable.\n\n  The more we delay, the harder it is going to be, and we have seen how \nhard it is already. We know this has not been an easy process because \nthe talks between the White House and Members of Congress have fallen \napart. The talks between Members of Congress on both sides of the \nRotunda have fallen apart. We know this has been hard, so let's try to \nact now to stop it from being harder in the future, which it will be if \nwe don't address our entitlement reforms.\n  I support a two-step approach. Let's take the first major step--a \ndownpayment of almost $1 trillion. That is the first step for all of \nus--to cut spending by nearly $1 trillion. The second step is long-term \ndeficit reduction that will cut more spending over a 10-year period and \naddress entitlement reform. This can be done in a gradual way but \nwithout touching the core benefits, but we have to act now. If we \ndon't, it will not be able to be done.\n  The financial viability of our country is at stake. The time is \nhere--it is past here--to take the necessary steps to get our fiscal \nhouse in order, and I implore my colleagues to take those steps now.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have served in this body for 19 \nyears, and I will say I have never been more dismayed, more concerned, \nor more frustrated than I have been these past few days. Every day it \ngets a little bit worse because day by day our country grows closer to \ndefaulting on our sovereign debt. That is something which has never, \never happened in the history of this country.\n  The repercussions of this protracted and public debate on whether our \ngovernment will honor its financial obligations are already evident. \nThis is what\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\nwe know for sure: The stock market has seen several days of decline as \ninvestors sell off securities. The United States is at high risk of a \ncredit downgrade. Gold prices are climbing as people try to protect \nthemselves from a rating downgrade and a drop in the value of the \ndollar. In short, default may well have catastrophic economic \nconsequences domestically and internationally.\n  What is the message we are communicating to the world? Secretary \nClinton told me in an evening conversation I had with her--she had just \nreturned from visiting five countries. She said everybody was asking \nher: What is wrong in your country? What are you going to do?\n  This is now a worldwide crisis and one we must address. What we are \nseeing here is, in a sense, a broken government that can't take care of \nthe affairs of its people in a prudent and practical way.\n  It is absolutely amazing to me that 20 to 70 Members of the House of \nRepresentatives believe they can run the government of the United \nStates despite the fact that the Presidency and the majority in the \nU.S. Senate are controlled by another party. Essentially, they appear \nwilling to allow this great Nation to default rather than compromise \nand reach a practical solution.\n  What are the consequences of default for American families? For sure, \ndefault would raise interest rates, driving up costs for everyone. For \nsure, the cost of owning a home, buying a car, buying food, filling a \ngas tank, and sending children to college will become even more \nexpensive. It will squeeze already tight family budgets and damage this \nfragile economy. Many people predict a second dip recession. In \nessence, default causes an immediate tax increase in the form of these \nrising interest rates on families.\n  The talk of default is disrupting financial markets and will trigger \na sharp fall in the stock market, causing huge losses in retirement \naccounts and wiping out the gains of 2 years. This morning, I saw a TV \nstory about a man who was selling his mutual funds because he has no \nconfidence in our ability to resolve this crisis--not a good thing to \ndo.\n  Higher interest rates will also drive up costs for both the Federal \nand State governments because every 1 percent increase in interest \npayments for the Federal Government means an additional $100 billion \ncost to the government. A default will be devastating for State \ngovernments that would see their borrowing costs dramatically increase \nbecause their ability to borrow is tied to the interest rates paid by \nthe Federal Government.\n  The cost of borrowing for States, for municipalities, and for local \nwater districts will all rise. Let me give you an example. My own State \nof California recently took out a $5.4 billion loan from five major \ninvestment banks ahead of a possible default to ensure itself against \nrising interest rates. Here is the sixth largest economy on Earth \nworried that their interest rates are going to jump, so they take out a \n$5 billion loan from investment banks to be able to meet any increased \ninterest on obligations owed.\n  For the broader economy, default would mean hundreds of thousands of \njobs lost every year, according to the Federal Reserve. Chairman \nBernanke said:\n\n       The economy may be thrown into reverse and employers would \n     start cutting jobs if Congress fails to raise the Nation's \n     legal borrowing authority.\n\n  I have heard some say that on August 3, the Treasury will still have \nenough money to meet our obligations and avoid default. That is simply \nfalse. According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, the U.S. Government \nhas $306.7 billion in payments due in August and will take in an \nestimated $172.4 billion in revenue for the month. That is a $134 \nbillion shortfall for the month of August, so the Treasury will not be \nable to pay its bills. In other words, 44 percent of U.S. Government \nbills will go unpaid if the Federal Government fails to raise the debt \nceiling by the August 2 deadline.\n  Treasury would be forced to spend all income inflows covering just \nsix major items: interest, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, \nunemployment insurance, and defense vendors. That would mean entire \nFederal Departments would have no funds, including Justice, Labor, and \nCommerce. It would mean no funds for veterans' benefits, Active-Duty \nmilitary pay, IRS refunds, special education, Pell grants, and more. \nThere is simply no way to escape it.\n  Let me give you an example. On the next day, which is August 3, the \nTreasury will take in $12 billion in revenues, but it will still owe \n$32 billion in revenues. Let me tell you what that includes. It \nincludes $23 billion in Social Security payments. I understand 45 \nmillion checks are ready to go out during those days. It is $2.2 \nbillion for Medicare, $1.8 billion for education, and $1.4 billion for \ndefense.\n  If the debt ceiling is not raised by August 2 or if we only reach an \nagreement for a short-term extension, the already-spooked credit rating \nagencies could react unfavorably. And here is the problem: Do you want \nto go back to this same situation in 6 months and go through this all \nover again? It makes no sense. If the marketplace wants stability and \nconstancy, they are clearly not going to get it knowing this is going \nto be coming up in 6 months again.\n  Moody's has said it is possible our credit rating would go down with \na short-term increase and warned that an agreement should get us \nthrough the year 2012. All right, don't pay attention to it, but that \nwarning is out there. It is going to take getting through the year \n2012, according to at least one of the rating houses.\n  Fitch has said a deficit deal must be credible and sustainable or \nU.S. ratings could still be downgraded. Does anybody believe it is \ncredible and sustainable to do this for 6 months and be right back \nwhere we are today? I don't think so.\n  Standard & Poor's has said it may lower the country's long-term \ncredit rating if it concludes that future adjustments to the debt \nceiling are likely to be the subject of political maneuvering--not my \nwords, their words. Do you want to go through this in 6 months again \nwith the same results and creating all of the uncertainty for the 6 \nmonths between now and then? I don't think so.\n  In other words, these rating agencies have very real questions about \nthe willingness and ability of this Congress and the administration to \ntimely honor scheduled debt obligations.\n  Now, I have to say this--and I have been here for 19 years--I have \nnever seen a time when Republicans just do not want to come to an \nagreement with this President. The President, I think by any standard, \nhas bent over backward, and still Republicans walk away from the \nnegotiating table. Well, let me tell you, I have done a lot of \nnegotiations in my time with big labor strikes and work stoppages----\n  I would ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORKER. I was given an 11:10 time and saw that we were \nalternating. I have a conference call. I am glad for the Senator to \nfinish, but if she could make it even shorter than that, it would be \nappreciated.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How about 3 minutes?\n  Mr. CORKER. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest for 3 minutes? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there were 2 months of negotiations \nwith the Vice President, and Majority Leader Cantor walked out. There \nwere negotiations with the President and Speaker Boehner, and the \nSpeaker walked out. House Republicans do not like Simpson-Bowles, nor \ndo they like the Gang of 6 plan. These are the two big plans which \noffer a solution for the future. Instead, they want massive cuts to \nMedicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and discretionary spending and \nabsolutely nothing from those Americans who are doing very well in this \neconomy--actually, the top 1 percent.\n  Well, I represent 37 million people. California is bigger than 21 \nStates and the District of Columbia put together. Fifteen million to \ntwenty million people in my State depend on programs the Republicans \nwant to take a meat axe to--not a scalpel, but a meat axe--SSI, Social \nSecurity, Medicaid, and Medicare. We have gotten these numbers. We have \nlooked at them for overlapping, and I can truthfully say the\n\n[[Page S4979]]\n\nnumber is 15 million to 20 million. Well, look, I want to know how a \ncut is going to affect these programs.\n\n  We could do this if we agree to take 6 months, draft in bill language \nfrom the Gang of 6, mandate the hearings, and fast track a bill to the \nfloor of the Senate. Every Member of this body knows it is bill \nlanguage that spells out what we need to look out for. I need to look \nout for what happens to the Medicare provider tax because so many \nhospitals in my State depend on it. If it lasts until 2014, it is OK, \nbut I don't know.\n  I very strongly believe there is a solution and that reasonable \npeople can work it out, and I hope the leadership of this body will \ntalk with the leadership of the other body.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank Senator Corker for his courtesy, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, it is interesting. I have some of the same \nconcerns, maybe with different outcomes, as the Senator from \nCalifornia, but I agree we have not done our work.\n  Over the course of a little over a year, I have been traveling around \nthe State of Tennessee making citizens aware of the unsustainable \ndeficits our country has. I am sure people on the other side of the \naisle have been doing the same. After townhall meetings all across our \nState in almost every forum my colleagues can imagine--I am sure the \nPresiding Officer has done the same--people are very aware in my State, \nas they are across the country, of the fact that we are on an \nunsustainable course. We are now beginning to have investor \npublications--the Wall Street Journal this morning wrote an editorial \nabout the fact that no matter what we do regarding the actual proposals \nbefore us today, it is likely our country is going to be downgraded. \nSo, here we are, faced with a situation where the types of legislation \nwe are looking at--in both Chambers, I might add, in both Chambers--\nprobably will take us to a place where our country's debt is \ndowngraded.\n  I wish to first applaud both leaders--Senator Reid for bringing forth \na proposal today or over the last few days, and Speaker Boehner, the \nleader of the House, for doing the same on the House side. What I wish \nto say about that is while to me they don't meet the goals or don't \nmeet the test our country needs to have met at this time, at least we \nare finally talking about proposals that will reduce spending in this \ncountry and put us back on a sustainable path. So I appreciate the \nleadership of both bodies. Finally, after many months, we are on the \nright topic.\n  What I have said all along is that as we approach the debt ceiling, \nwe need to dramatically change the character of spending in this \ncountry. My concern is that our work is not quite done. The fact is \nthere is no question of the deadline coming up. Everybody agrees it is, \nat least the minimum, August 2. I don't think there is any dispute that \nwe have until August 2 to deal with this issue. I also don't think we \nhave yet come up with a solution we need to come up with to \ndramatically change the character of spending in this country.\n  What I would say is, look, our work is not quite done. The House has \na bill that basically reduces spending over the next decade by $1 \ntrillion. Candidly, I think we all know that is not a solution that is \ngoing to prevent a downgrade in this country. It does have the goal of \nkicking this to a select committee of some kind that is going to try to \nincorporate another $1.8 trillion in cuts. Candidly, that is a big step \nback from where I think we were a weekend ago, where at least on the \ncut side--even on the cut side--even the President had agreed to at \nleast $3 trillion in cuts. That is our understanding. So what we have \ncoming out of the House right now is a bill that doesn't cut as much as \nthe President had agreed to last weekend. We have on this side a bill \nthat cuts about $1 trillion after it has been scored. Again, I applaud \nthe leader of the Senate for putting forth a bill that at least begins \nmoving us in the right direction, but, again, it is $2 trillion short \nof where the President had been with leaders a week ago, or at least \nthat is our understanding, and I am pretty sure that understanding is \ncorrect.\n  We also know the general mantra adopted by Wall Street and by people \nwho are looking at our country around the world is that we need to do \nsomething that is at least a $4 trillion solution.\n  I would say to the Senator from California who just spoke, I couldn't \nagree more. We have not addressed this situation the way we should. I \ndon't think there is anything anybody--well, there may be a few--the \nvast majority of this body does not want to see our country default on \nits obligations. I don't know of anybody who wants to do that. I want \nto see dramatic changes in the character of spending for our country, \nand many people have sought that. Our work is not yet done.\n  What I would say is, let's have a short-term extension. There is no \nquestion that we do not want the sovereign debt of this country to be \ndowngraded because we default. Nobody wants to see that happen. We are \nat least finally on the right topic. We are talking about spending \nreductions. We certainly haven't done the work necessary to achieve the \ngoal we need to achieve in this body. But I couldn't agree more. Let's \nhave a short-term extension. Let's extend it another week or 2 weeks or \n3 weeks. A lot of people say, Well, the fact is that will roil the \nmarkets. I don't think it will roil the markets. I think they are used \nto us waiting until an hour before the deadline to work out a solution. \nI think that has become customary, if you will, in the Senate and in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  So what I would say is if we don't do the work now--we have a \nhistoric opportunity right now. Right now, the whole world, all of our \ncountry, all of our citizens are all frustrated. The Members of the \nHouse and the Senate are all focused on one thing and that is what kind \nof a package can we put forth to actually cause our country to be more \nsolvent at this time.\n  We are finally on the right topic, yet we haven't even, in these \naspirational bills that are laid out--we know that with all the \nactuarial assumptions that exist, with Medicare and Social Security and \nMedicaid, that if we don't touch trying to make them solvent for the \nlonger haul, we haven't even done our work. The bills before us don't \neven have as an aspirational goal--for instance, the House bill that is \ncoming over with a select committee that I know Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell have been involved in--and I thank them for their \nwork--doesn't even lay out that one of the things we are looking at is \nensuring Social Security is actuarially sound. The future of these \nyoung pages who potentially down the road--not potentially, hopefully--\nwill benefit from Social Security, I think they would like to know that \nduring this historic time we are actually looking at the real issue.\n  What I am afraid of is we are missing the opportunity for this to be \nthe seminal moment we all thought it was going to be because we don't \nyet have a product that solves the problem. The product we are looking \nat in both bodies--and I thank the leaders of both bodies for bringing \nthem forth--does not meet the test. It doesn't dramatically change the \ncharacter of spending in Washington. It doesn't even stave off a \ndowngrade in U.S. sovereign debt.\n  We are on the brink of actually doing something great for our \ncountry. And because we now have our country's focus and everybody in \nboth bodies is focused on this problem, let's have a short-term \nextension. I agree. Let's don't default. Let's move back a week or 2 \nweeks or 3 weeks. But let's don't miss this historic opportunity to do \nsomething great for our country, which is exactly what we are doing \nnow.\n\n  It is hard for me to believe, seriously, that what we have before us \nis a $1 trillion downpayment. It is also hard for me to believe, \ncandidly, that we are going to set up a select committee that is going \nto report back in 4 or 5 months when all of us know what the issues \nare. We understand the math. I know we get ridiculed a lot for the way \nwe act in this body, but I think most of us candidly pretty well \nunderstand what the solutions are. We all know nobody gets to work on \nanything around here until there is an imminent deadline. So even with \nthis committee being potentially set up by mutual discussion down the \nroad--I know there are a lot of negotiations--to me they should report \nback. I agree with the Senator from California. Let's report back at \nthe end of this fiscal year, September\n\n[[Page S4980]]\n\n30--there is no reason to wait--and if that type of bill were to pass \nwhere we have a two-stage process, let's go ahead and get the work out \nof the way.\n  I want to go back to the bigger picture for a moment and I will \nconclude momentarily. We have an opportunity right now where we have \nnever been focused in the way we are right now--in the 4\\1/2\\ years I \nhave been here--on something as important as this as it relates to us \ngetting our house in order. We have never been this focused. What I am \nafraid of, in the name of political efficacy--people saying, Hey, look, \nlet's take what we can get and get on out of here so we don't mess up \nour potential, on both sides of the aisle, for the 2012 elections--take \nwhat you have on both sides. Basically, let's think about it. For the \nother side of the aisle, the way all of the proposals before us are \nlaid out, there is no dealing with trying to make the entitlements \nsustainable, so they can run in 2012 on the entitlement issue. With all \nof the proposals laid out right now, we don't deal with spending \nappropriately, so our country is probably going to have its debt \ndowngraded, so Republicans can run on the fact that we haven't reduced \nspending enough. So if we look at it, this works well for everybody, \nexcept the citizens of our country.\n  Again, we are finally on the right topic, which is a rarity here. We \nare finally focused on the problem. We have two bills that don't go far \nenough. Again, I applaud both the Democratic leader and the Republican \nleader for putting forth proposals. We all know they don't do what they \nneed to do--either proposal. We know the aspirational goals of each \nproposal don't take us far enough.\n  I would say to all: I agree. Let's don't default. Let's don't buck up \nagainst August 3. Let's pass a short-term time extension. Let's take us \nthrough the end of August or the first 2 weeks in September, or let's \ntake a week, but let's finish our work in this body. Let's don't miss \nthis seminal opportunity where everybody in this country and everybody \nin this world is looking at how undisciplined we have been and the \nopportunity we have before us to actually be disciplined and send a \nsignal to the world that our future is not the future that Greece is \nseeing today; our future is the continuation of American exceptionalism \nall around this world. We are squandering that opportunity right now in \nthis body at a time when we are finally focused on the right topic.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer, as I always do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S4980-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4980-S4981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Senator Tom Harkin is on his way from \nthe meeting the Presiding Officer and I were just at because we both \nwant to talk more about this National Mediation Board crisis and also \nthe fact that the FAA is on hold, that we cannot do anything with it. \nWhat the House did--you see, one of the revelations of the modern era, \nwhich hopefully will last only a couple years, is that the folks in the \nHouse are willing to say ``no'' to the very end. In other words, the \nquestion I would raise is that my plan is to raise the stakes on the \nairlines, doing quite dreadful things to them, in hopes they will \nengage with the House Members to say we have to have an FAA bill.\n  As I said yesterday, all I seek is a clean bill of extension. That \nhas been done 20 times on this FAA bill. It has taken us 4 years, and \nwe have not been able to reauthorize it. There are some things to work \nout, but they can all be worked out.\n  The House sent over a message saying they did not like what we were \ndoing on the essential air service. Well, the Presiding Officer knows \nwhat the essential air service means for rural communities, which is to \nhave it in order that communities have an economic future of any kind \nat all. But, on the other hand, we have been willing to make reforms. \nIn fact, the reforms we have suggested are more dramatic reforms than \nthe House has suggested: put a cap on the number of airports--some \nquite dramatic things I actually hate doing in order to try to get \nagreement on that subject.\n  But what is more interesting is, that is not what they care about. \nMr. Mica, who is my counterpart in the House, has often said he does \nnot have a dog in the essential air service fight. Yesterday I was \nmeeting with him and Secretary LaHood, who is completely with the \nSenate in our desire to get this done and to break the intransigence of \nthe House, and my counterpart simply said--I said: Why did you send \nthat over when that is not what you care about? He said: Well, \nsometimes it is a little political thing.\n  I was not shocked by that because that is why I knew he had done it, \nbut what it says is they are willing to tank the Federal Aviation \nAdministration unless the Senate caves to their position on the \nNational Mediation Board, which would undo 75 years of labor law and \nwhich would take an extraordinary situation, which Senator Harkin, when \nhe gets here, if he gets here, is going to talk more about.\n  But the principle they want and they like is the fact that if you \nhave an election--it could be a union election, it could be any kind of \nan election, but let's say for the purposes of this it is a union \nelection--and people do not show up to vote, as is always the case. \nThen for those people who did not show up to vote, their vote is \nautomatically characterized as a ``no'' vote on the idea of certifying \nto get a union.\n  This is purely the work of Delta. Most of the legacy airlines are \nunionized. Delta is not. Delta's CEO makes $9 million a year, their top \nmanagement another $20 million a year. They could practically pay for \nthe whole Essential Air Service Program themselves. But they do not \nwant to fool around with this language to protect their antiworker \nambitions.\n  They have had four union elections in the last several years. They \nhave prevailed. The airline has prevailed in all four of those \nelections. But they still want this language changed so that if you do \nnot vote, you are put down as a ``no'' vote; that is, not to be able to \norganize. That is un-American. It is unprecedented in American history. \nAnd it goes against, as I said, 75 years of labor law. That is very \ndangerous.\n  What we have to do is to try and make it clear--frankly, the other \nairlines have been rather tepid in their support of my position. \nAirlines are a close group and they tend to stay together. They have to \nstop that. They have to make the House understand that if they persist \nin this rule, we will have a Federal aviation system that will shut \ndown altogether. I am talking about air traffic controllers. I am \ntalking about the whole deal. It is not a long process. It is a \nhorrible process. It is an antiworker process which they are dumping in \nour laps. They want to see that happen. They are willing to see that \nhappen. They will not compromise on the National Mediation Board. They \nwill not compromise. They have said that. I have often talked with my \ncounterpart over there, and he says: Well: I do not make those \ndecisions. Those are made at a higher pay grade. He uses that word. Why \ndoes somebody run for public office if they simply take orders from \nother people? Well, that is sort of the way they do things over there \nin the House, but it is extremely dangerous.\n  The truth lies in the fact that the House provision that cuts the \nEssential Air Service Program by $16 million--that is what it does. At \nthe same time, the House has been willing to let $150 million drain \nfrom the airport trust fund in less than a week. Every day we do not \nget this bill resolved, $25 million drops out of the airport trust \nfund, which is flush for now but is becoming very unflush very quickly.\n  The FAA extensions are very necessary. They are not something which \npeople walk around here talking about all the time, but if they find \nthey do not have flights to get to their homes on the west coast or in \nthe South or anywhere else, they will be very angry. People will be \nvery angry. I do not know of any alternative but to ratchet up the \npressure, to make those who are blocking this understand they are\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\ncausing a national disaster and they need to back off from that \nposition.\n  They have said they will not. Well, will that be the final solution? \nIt may very well be, and we have to understand that. But you cannot \nnegotiate something which is so antiworker. You cannot negotiate that. \nThe President has said he will veto it if it appears in the bill in any \nform. The House has voted for it. The Senate has voted against it. We \nhave been very clear that it cannot pass over here and will not pass \nover here. So why are they playing that game?\n  The airlines are not now even paying for their use of the national \nairspace system. The carriers also do not appear to care about the \nimpact on the dedicated FAA workforce that serves them--once again, \n4,000 already having been furloughed. Most of the airlines are not even \npassing any savings on to the customers they serve. Why do I say that? \nBecause they are having a tax holiday now because our extension ran \nout. So all of a sudden they do not have to pay taxes on jet fuel and a \nnumber of other things, so they are getting a lot of money. But what \nwill you do with that money? Would you keep it for yourself or would \nyou turn it over to the trust fund or would you keep ticket prices the \nsame and not raise them? Well, they keep it. Frontier Airlines, I think \nAlaska Airlines, Virgin, all have kept their fares exactly where they \nwere. They are trying to protect the consumer.\n  Delta and the other airlines are raising ticket prices as fast as \nthey can, even though, because the time has run out on the agreement, \nthey are getting endless millions of dollars. They are choosing to keep \nit and make a profit for themselves. That is unconscionable behavior in \nterms of national policy.\n  What are the real benefits to Delta from what they are doing? How \nbadly were they harmed by the decision, the NMB decision? After the \nchange, several unionization votes were held among components of their \nwork force, which I have already said. None of those units voted to \norganize. So what is their game? It is a game. It is politics. It is \ntheology. You cannot let that stand. You cannot allow people to get \nfurloughed who are serious about their jobs, who are engineers and \ntechnical people--the first 4,000. Many of them will not come back. \nThey will choose to figure: Well, they will never get this settled. \nThey will go out and find other jobs, and they will be able to get \nother jobs. It is unconscionable. It is almost you cannot believe you \nare in this situation, that you are in some ``Disney World'' somewhere \nwhere people do not take life seriously and do not take policies \nseriously.\n  I want to reiterate that the Senate appointed conferees--which is \nsort of necessary to try and reach resolution--on the very day the \nHouse sent over its FAA package for us to consider. We appointed \nconferees. More than 100 days later--1-0-0 days later--the House still \ndragged its feet. The House has still not named any conferees.\n  What am I to make of that? They are not serious about this. So if \nthey are not serious about it, do we then buckle because they are not \nserious or do we stand for what is right and what is fair for the \npeople who work for the Federal Aviation Administration and also, \nfrankly, for consumers of aviation all over this country?\n  I will tell you, you wait until some of these air traffic control \nsystems shut down, the towers shut down because there is nobody to man \nthem. Then business, American business and these airlines are going to \nunderstand how bad it is going to be. The only policy I know how to \nadopt is to try and drive home to them what they are actually doing to \ntheir own futures. They will shut themselves down if they continue on \ntheir course.\n  We can still get this process working again, but we need to get the \nFAA stable first. We should pass a clean extension, that which we have \ndone forever. All extensions are clean. Senator Corker was just talking \nabout a clean extension on something else. We should pass a clean \nextension and then get to work finding a compromise on our remaining \ndifferences.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and await the presence of Senator \nHarkin who will be speaking on this subject.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, first, I wish to thank Senator \nRockefeller for his leadership on the FAA issue. It is so important in \nrural areas. It is so important to attract and retain a workforce. It \nis so important to the local economies in large cities like Cleveland, \nCincinnati and Columbus and in smaller communities too. As Senator \nRockefeller said, our aviation system is absolutely critical for \neconomic development.\n  People in big cities might make fun of small airports that they do \nnot have all the hustle and bustle. But we do know medium-sized and \nsmaller airports matter a great deal.\n  With the refusal of the House to take up a clean extension of FAA, \nnearly 4,000 employees across the country have been furloughed and \ndozens of construction projects have come to a halt. In this economy, \nsome radicals in the House of Representatives have decided--because \nthey have a political mission and ideology that does not quite fit with \nthe majority of Americans--they are going to again hold hostage \nsomething that simply needs to be done; that is, what is called \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  As Senator Rockefeller said, these furloughed employees may be forced \nto look elsewhere for jobs to meet their mortgage payments or pay for \ngroceries--these are very skilled technicians and engineers. And what \ndoes this mean to these construction projects? FAA helps to pay, all \nover the country, for modernization of airports--rebuilding air traffic \ncontrol towers, improving runways, and making countless safety \nimprovements.\n  We have all heard stories--I do not recall that I have ever seen it, \nbut we have heard stories of the Beijing or Shanghai airports or some \nof these airports--I have not seen them in the last many years--about \nthe new technologies and the modern features of those airports. As a \ncountry we cannot afford to fall behind. We have to keep up.\n  Not passing a clean extension of the FAA bill is exactly the wrong \nthing to do. The unemployment rate in the construction industry is \nnearly double the national average. Yet we are idling cranes and we are \nidling bulldozers all because of a political mission, an ideology that \nsome Members of the House--some radical Members of the House--have \ndecided to inflict on us.\n  A clean extension of FAA has been done 20 times. All of a sudden it \nis not. I hope the House gets serious. I hope they appoint conferees \nand come to the table and work this out. I appreciate very much Senator \nRockefeller's leadership. He is making a difference on these important \nissues, and our House colleagues need to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S4981-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4981-S4982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SUPPORTING AMERICAN MANUFACTURING\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I wish to talk also about another \nissue where we should have done a clean extension--as we have done \ndozens of times in this country. In the past three decades alone, we \nhave avoided default by addressing the debt limit 38 times; 34 of those \nwere with Republican Presidents. That is almost 90 percent of the time \nwe have raised the debt ceiling--more precisely, avoided default--it \nhas been under Republican Presidents.\n  A lot of us did not like it. We maybe made a public statement saying \nwe did not like their fiscal policy, but we never stood in the way, we \nnever tried to take hostage--take the government hostage or each other \nhostage by saying--almost like children--if I do not get my way, then I \nam going to block this and I am going stop--I am going to potentially \nthrow our financial system and our economy into turmoil. What kind of \nbehavior is that for adults?\n  Then, when I hear Speaker Boehner and some of his radical kind of \ncheerleaders on the far political right say we should do this again in \n6 months, I wonder what are they possibly thinking, when we go through \nthis right now.\n  I spend a lot of time with manufacturers around my State. I love \nseeing\n\n[[Page S4982]]\n\nthings made. My State is the third largest manufacturing State in the \ncountry, exceeded in production only by California, three times our \npopulation, and Texas, twice our population. I talk to manufacturers, \nand some of them are not investing now for a variety of reasons. Mostly \nthey do not see the demand for products because the demand is still \nanemic in our society, in our economy, for companies to grow.\n  But they also talk about the uncertainty. They talk about the \nuncertainty in the economic environment. This is the worst kind of \nuncertainty we are going to inject into our economy if we are going to \nsay let's do this in 6 months. Do they think anybody in North Carolina \nor Ohio or around the State, around the country, any businesses are \nthinking: This is a great time to invest, right when Moody's and \nStandard & Poor's might downgrade us, right when we do not know what is \ngoing to happen in the next week with a potential default.\n  Do they think anybody is going to make a major investment decision \nright now? Of course, they are not. So let's do it again in 6 months? \nWhen I heard Speaker Boehner--I like John Boehner personally. He is \nfrom my State. Our offices obviously work together in places such as \nButler County, Preble County, and the Dayton-Cincinnati areas. But I \nwould have thought people would have laughed when he said: Yes, let's \ndo this again in 6 months because we do not have a jobs problem to \nworry about. Clearly, we should get this done with and focus--that \nmeans cutting the budget. I understand that. We have to work toward a \nbalanced budget.\n  We knew how to do it in the 1990s. In the early 1990s, President \nClinton--I came to the House the year he was elected President. We \nfaced a terrible budget situation and an unemployment situation. But \nyou know what. We cut spending. We increased taxes appreciably for only \na relatively few number of people, the wealthiest people in our \nsociety. We continued to make investments in education, health care and \ninfrastructure and our economy.\n  We had almost 8 years--not quite, maybe 7 years some months--of \nregular economic growth, and 21 million new jobs were created. So we \nknow how to do this. But this crowd wants to hold the government \nhostage saying, if you do not do it exactly our way, we are going to \nlet the government go to default, and once we solve that, let's do it \nagain in 6 months.\n  I just think it does not make sense. What we should be doing instead \nis focusing--I know what an important manufacturing State the Presiding \nOfficer represents in North Carolina, as in Ohio--on manufacturing. We \nare still a country that makes things. My State is particularly a State \nthat makes things.\n  The year after what is called the American Recovery Act passed, my \nState got more new jobs in clean energy than any State in the United \nStates of America. My State is a leader in aerospace. It is a leader in \nauto and steel and chemicals and cement and paper and aluminum and \nglass. Yet we are also in the kind of traditional industries, and we \nare also, as I said, a leader in solar, in Toledo, OH, and other \nplaces.\n  We are a leader in wind turbine component manufacturing, especially \nin the northeast but all over Ohio. We are a leader in aerospace, as I \nmentioned. We are a leader in biomedical and biotech, in large part \nbecause we have great universities and great teaching hospitals in, I \nwas going to say, prominently in northeast Ohio but also Columbus, also \nCincinnati, also Toledo--all over our State. Clearly, we know how to do \nthese things. But what we have seen in the past three decades is a \nshift in our Nation. Thirty years ago, manufacturing was 25, 26, 27 \npercent of our gross domestic product. Basically, one-fourth of the \ndollars in our economy were all about manufacturing.\n  That created great wealth, because the way to create wealth is to \nmake something, to grow something or to mine something, preeminently. \nSo 30 years ago, manufacturing was some 23, 24, 25, 26 percent of our \nGDP. Financial services was only 11 percent in those days. Today, it is \nalmost the reverse. Financial services makes up about 20 or 22 percent \nand manufacturing makes up only about 11 percent of our GDP and even a \nslightly smaller percent of our workforce.\n  Why does this matter? It matters because we know when we make things \nit creates wealth. Manufacturing jobs pay 20 percent more, on average, \nthan service jobs. We know the difference between retail versus making \nsteel or the difference between fast food restaurant work versus making \ncars or chemicals or glass or biotech.\n  We know manufacturing jobs have a strong multiplier effect. So if we \nhave an auto company--let me give an example. The Chevrolet Cruze is a \ncar my daughter just brought--by and large, an Ohio car. It would not \nhave happened if we had not done the auto rescue that so many of my \ncolleagues opposed for ideological reasons, not substantive, practical, \nlet's-make-it-work reasons. Nonetheless, we know the auto industry is \ncoming back and we know manufacturing jobs have increased--far too \nanemically, but they have increased over the last year.\n\n  But the Chevy Cruze, the engine is made in Defiance, OH, and the \nbumper is made in Northwood, OH, and the transmission is made in \nToledo, OH, and the steel comes out of Cleveland, OH, for much of the \ncar. The aluminum wheels come out of Cleveland, OH. The stamping is \ndone in Parma, OH. Some of the other stamping is down in Lordstown, OH. \nThe assembly is done in Lordstown, OH. There are 5,000 people working \njust on the assembly alone. So that is the multiplier effect. When we \nassemble in Toledo, we assemble the Jeep. Chrysler assembles the Jeep \nin Toledo.\n  Some 3 years ago, only 50 percent of the components for the Jeep were \nAmerican made. Today, over 70 percent are American made. So we know \nmanufacturing creates all kinds of jobs, making 20 percent more, on \naverage, than service jobs.\n  Since the beginning of the recession, though, we still see profits at \nlarge financial institutions and other service firms increase, but our \nNation's unemployment rate is still hovering around 9 percent. So when \nprofits go up for those financial services firms--and I appreciate \nJPMorgan Chase in Columbus, OH. I met with their top person in Ohio \njust this week--just moving from Cleveland to Columbus. I know the \nimportant work they do in my State. I know they provide thousands and \nthousands and thousands of jobs. That is all a good thing.\n  But I also know in an economy which is not paying attention to \nmanufacturing, we do not get the multiplier effect, we do not get the \nhigher wages, we do not get the employment growth that we might get \notherwise.\n  That is why, yesterday, Senator Rockefeller and I convened a meeting, \nwhere Senator Whitehouse, Senator Jack Reed, Senators Schumer and \nKlobuchar and Feinstein and others attended. We talked about a real \nnational manufacturing strategy. That means closing the skills gap. We \nhave a lot of jobs in places such as Iowa and North Carolina, Ohio, \nwhere they go unfilled because we do not have well enough connected \nworker training with those jobs, with the needs. We need to pursue \nbetter tax and trade policies. We need to pay special attention to \nmanufacturing.\n  Yesterday, the Senate sent to the House legislation we passed \nunanimously that said: When the government buys American flags, rather \nthan 50 percent--a requirement that 50 percent of them be made in the \nUnited States--the requirement now is that 100 percent be made in the \nUnited States.\n  Why do we not put more focus on ``Made in the USA''? It will matter \nfor us. It matters for our national pride on flags, to be sure, but it \nmatters for our communities, it matters our companies, and it matters \nfor our workers.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S4982-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4982-S4984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I meant to be here earlier when Senator\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\nRockefeller was on the floor speaking about the situation with the \nFederal Aviation Administration. However, I was unavoidably detained \nwhile chairing a hearing on the HELP Committee that just adjourned a \nfew minutes ago. I wanted to be here to discuss with Senator \nRockefeller the sad situation we are facing right now with the shutdown \nof the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  We are now in the sixth day of the defunding of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. What that means is that right now we have some 4,000 \nFAA workers who are furloughed, and tens of thousands of people out of \nwork in airport construction jobs--infrastructure. These are people who \nare not working for the government; they are working for private \ncontractors who have a contract with FAA for runway construction, \nputting in lights, safety measures, things like that. So tens of \nthousands of people are out of work in the private sector because of \nthe cutoff of FAA reimbursements to these businesses around the \ncountry.\n  It is costing the Federal Government about $25 million in tax revenue \na day--$25 million a day in lost revenue. That money would be plowed \nback into the economy to pay for aviation operations and for the people \nwho are working out there on construction jobs building runways, \nlighting systems, and things like that.\n  At a time when we have so many people who are unemployed in our \ncountry--and the underemployment rate is really somewhere between 16 \nand 18 percent--with over 23 million people in America out of work, \nwhat do the Republicans do? They hold up funding for the Federal \nAviation Administration, which puts 4,000 more FAA people on furlough \nand tens of thousands of people working on construction jobs around the \ncountry out of work. Why would the Republican Members of this Congress \ndo such a thing? Because they want to overturn a National Mediation \nBoard decision that was handed down a little over a year ago to align \nthe election procedures under the National Railway Labor Act with the \nprovisions that have always been in place under the National Labor \nRelations Act.\n  Let me explain that. Under the National Labor Relations Act, which \nhas been in existence since the late 1930s, if you have an election to \nsee whether workers want to organize a union, you count the yeas and \nyou count the nays of those who vote. If the yeas are more than the \nnays, the workers form a union. If the nays are more than the yeas, \nthey don't form a union. Under the Railway Labor Act, an odd thing took \nplace. Under that, it said that if you have an election for a union, \nyou count the yeas, you count the nays, and then all those people who \ndidn't vote, you put them in the ``nay'' column. Interesting. If you \ndon't vote, you are an automatic no.\n  What the National Mediation Board did a year ago was realign this \nusing rulemaking procedures. They said that from now on you would only \ncount the yeas and the nays. You would not assign to one side or the \nother those who didn't vote. To most of us, that just seems to make \nplain old common sense. After all, any election for your local school \nboard--and we know the turnout is pretty low; school board elections \nusually turn out maybe 20 percent of the electorate, maybe less than \nthat. Yet I submit there is probably no more important election in \nAmerica today than school board elections. I will not get into that \nright now. What if we said: In all these school board elections, take \nthe yeas, and then all the people who didn't vote, they are a no.\n  What if we did that in Senate races? That strikes home to people \naround here. Say a Senator is running for reelection, and if you are \nlucky, you get a 60-percent turnout of voters. That means the people \nwho don't vote are considered a ``no'' vote on the incumbent. Is that \nwhat we want to see? If you don't vote, that is a ``no'' vote on your \nreelection. Most people would think that is inherently unfair. It is \ninherently unfair.\n  The same is true in elections on whether workers want to form a \nunion. There are a lot of reasons people don't vote in an election. \nMaybe they are sick and they can't go vote. Maybe they can't make up \ntheir mind one way or the other. Maybe they said: Well, I see this \nside, and I see that side, and I cannot make up my mind, so I am just \nnot going to vote. Some people just say: I don't care which side wins; \nI am disinterested in this election. Thankfully, in America, we don't \nhave somebody forcing somebody to vote. So it makes common sense that \nif you don't vote, you should not be counted on one side or the other.\n  The National Mediation Board put this rule in place. They went \nthrough all the hearings, the comment period, and all the stuff \nnecessary to pass the rule. Then it was brought up in the Senate within \nthe last year under a procedure called the Congressional Review Act, \nwherein there is an expedited procedure for the Senate to take up and \nvote on a regulation as to whether we want to overturn it. It is an \nexpedited procedure, an up-or-down vote. That was brought up here, and, \nas the chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over labor, I \ndebated it with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. It was a \nfairly good debate, I thought, and we voted. The Senate voted not to \noverturn that regulation. Well, you would think that would be the end \nof it. No, you would be wrong.\n  What does that have to do with the FAA? Because the Republicans in \nthe House and some in the Senate are saying they are not going to let \nthis FAA reauthorization bill get through unless and until we overturn \nthe decision--this rule of the National Mediation Board which basically \nsays that if you don't vote in the election, you are not counted on one \nside or the other. They are holding the FAA hostage--4,000 workers \nfurloughed, tens of thousands in airport construction out of work, $25 \nmillion a day being lost in revenue that would be taken in so we could \nput these people back to work. It is all because they want to make it \nharder for workers to form a union.\n  Think about it this way. We are going to have a Presidential election \nnext year. Let's say all the people who don't vote would be tallied as \na ``no'' vote for the incumbent President, assuming he runs for \nreelection. Some of my Republican friends would probably like that, and \nI understand that. Do you think the American people would think that is \nfair, that if you don't vote, you are counted as a ``no'' vote?\n  A Federal district court--they took this to court--also rejected a \nlegal challenge to these new rules, finding that the National Mediation \nBoard was acting well within its legal authority in modernizing the \nelection.\n  We see this time and time again. It is happening now in this \nCongress. Whenever we try to make things more fair or to use a \nlegitimate procedure to address something that I think most people \nwould think would be unfair; that is, counting somebody who didn't vote \nas a ``no'' vote--when we do that, Republicans always try to find an \nend run to try to undo that.\n  We are down to about 10 percent of our labor force that is now \nunionized. My friends on the other side will not be happy until there \nare no more unions in America. They will not be happy until \nunionization is less than 1 percent, and then only a company-sponsored \nunion, not an independent union.\n  Right now, Republicans are voting to change the law in the middle of \na trial as a special favor to the Boeing company. Boeing was accused of \nretaliating against its workers for going on strike.\n  As I have pointed out in numerous talks on the Senate floor, there is \na judicial process that has been used by both labor and management for \nmore than 70 years to settle disputes. That process has been to go to \nthe NLRB--and management has done it, as well as labor--to find out if \na certain thing was wrong or if a union has overstepped its bounds or \nif management has overstepped its bounds. The NLRB tries to mediate and \nget the two sides to agree, but if they can't, a process is set in \nmotion whereby the General Counsel--who, by the way, was a career \nperson, not a political appointee, as some have said--then begins an \ninvestigation to see whether the facts as presented warrant the next \nstep, which is bringing the case to an administrative law judge.\n  That is what happened in this Boeing case. I have heard all this \nnonsense about how they are trying to take jobs out of South Carolina, \ntrying to destroy right-to-work States. That is nonsense. Right now, \nthe case is before an administrative law judge to see whether Boeing \nactually retaliated\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\nagainst its employees for their exercising a legal right to organize \nand bargain collectively as a union.\n  Did Boeing retaliate against them for doing that? I don't know. My \nRepublican friends seem to think they know. But it should go through \nthe process before the administrative law judge, and that finding can \nbe appealed by either side--management or labor--and it goes to the \nNLRB, and then they make a decision, which could be appealed to the \nFederal appeals court or circuit court. That decision can be appealed \nto the Supreme Court. Yet the Republicans want to interfere in that \nprocess and make it a political decision as to whether this case should \ngo forward. Just as they are wrong to try to change the rules in the \nmiddle of a case going forward to benefit Boeing, what is happening now \nwith the FAA is also wrong. They are trying to interfere in the \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration to change a rule \nfrom the National Mediation Board.\n  The other day, one of my colleagues was talking about when are we \ngoing to stop doing favors for the union bosses or big unions or \nsomething like that. I never thought the National Mediation Board rule \nwas a favor to a union. I always looked upon it as a fair decision, \nregulation, to make it in line with the National Labor Relations Act. \nWhy should we have two separate kinds of election procedures for \nforming a union in this country? Take it to the American people. It is \ncommon sense. I think that most people would say that someone who \ndoesn't vote shouldn't be counted as a ``no'' vote? As I said, we don't \ndo that in the National Labor Relations Act. We have had this sort of \nanomaly for years. We finally tried to get it straightened out, and \nthat is what is costing us these jobs and $25 million a day.\n\n  There is another issue they have brought up, and that is the \nessential air service at a number of small airports. We can debate \nthat. We can talk about essential air service to small airports. The \nbill would eliminate it. That is about $16 million a year--$16 million \na year--that it would save. Clearly, that is not what the Republicans \ncare about. Every week--every week--they hold up the FAA \nreauthorization, it is costing the Federal Government some $150 million \nin uncollected taxes to support our airports. So in order to save $16 \nmillion a year, they are willing to cost the government $150 million a \nweek. Boy, that is some kind of economics on the part of my Republican \nfriends. So strictly from a budget perspective, the House's \nobstructionism is not just absurd, it is grossly counterproductive.\n  Again, this is uncalled for, what they are doing, to hold up the FAA \nreauthorization. As I said, we are now going into the sixth day, and it \nis going to have an effect on air travel. It is going to have a \nprofound effect on air travel the longer this plays out. So I ask the \nHouse Republican leadership to get off of this obstructionism--get off \nof this--and let us deal forthrightly on the bill before us--which is \nthe FAA reauthorization--and quit trying to overturn this rule of the \nNational Mediation Board.\n  On essential air service, I think there are probably some compromises \nthat can be made. There are some adjustments and modifications that can \nbe made. I think that is probably so. We ought to work in good will in \ndoing that on the longer term bill. But it is not right to hold up the \nFAA reauthorization right now on either the essential air service \nobjections or their trying to overturn the decision of the National \nMediation Board.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Rockefeller for his leadership on this \nissue and for his vigorous opposition to the House Republicans' effort \nboth to eliminate totally essential air service and to try to do a \nbackdoor, end run around the National Mediation Board's rule on \nproviding for fair elections for those who seek to belong and to form a \nunion in the airline or railway industry.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, let me begin by applauding Senator \nHarkin, my colleague from Iowa, for his comments relative to the FAA \nand the need to put the people who are out of work back to work and to \nget the FAA reauthorization done. It has been way too long.\n  We have a number of people who staff the tower that deals with air \ntraffic coming into the United States north of Boston. That tower is in \nNew Hampshire. We have people out of work. We need to get them back to \nwork and we need to see this legislation done and moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S4984-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4984-S4985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DEBT DEFAULT\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I came to the floor this afternoon \nbecause the United States Government is now less than 1 week away from \ndefaulting on its obligations for the first time in our history. As we \nhave heard from economists and business leaders across the country, a \ndefault could result in hundreds of thousands of lost jobs and in \nhigher interest rates for every American, yet we are still debating \nwhether we should avoid default. It is a very dangerous game, and we \nare risking permanent harm to the American economy.\n  I want to examine one consequence of default for a minute. All three \ncredit rating agencies--S, Moody's, and Fitch--have said a default \nwould automatically result in a lower credit rating for the U.S. \nGovernment. I think we all understand the principle of credit rating. \nIt is like the credit scores on record for most of us in our personal \nlives. The better we have been about paying our debts in the past, the \nbetter our credit score. When we go to buy a house or a car, when we \nask for a loan, the bank looks at that credit score and decides how \nmuch interest to charge us. The worse we have been at paying our debts \nin the past, the lower our score and the more money we pay in interest.\n  The credit rating agencies are keeping a credit score on the U.S. \nGovernment. So far, it has been perfect. The United States has never \nfailed to pay its debts. That is why we have the lowest interest rates \nin the world, and loaning money to the U.S. Government is considered \nthe world's safest investment. With a default, that would all change. \nAnd here is the key: It would change in just minutes, and that change \nwould last for generations. If we default, the credit rating agencies \nwill lower our credit rating immediately.\n  I recently had a conversation with Martin Regalia, the chief \neconomist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In that conversation he said \nthe market reaction to default would take ``nanoseconds.'' Once we have \ndefaulted, we can never unring that bell. Our special status as the \nworld's safest investment may never return. We will have increased our \ninterest rates for decades to come and maybe even longer. JPMorgan \nChase said this week that a lower credit rating could cost our \ngovernment $100 billion a year in interest.\n  This is the worst kind of wasteful spending because that money \nwouldn't be going to investments in our economy or to secure a better \nfuture for our children. It would go to nothing. It would do nothing. \nIt would be money down the drain.\n  We have a path forward. It is the plan that has recently been \nproposed by Senator Reid. There are a lot of things about this plan I \ndon't like. I am concerned because I don't think it takes a balanced \napproach toward deficit reduction that I have long called for, and I am \ndisappointed that it lacks the $4 trillion in deficit reduction we \nneed. But I am ready to support it. And because all the cuts in this \nbill are cuts that Republicans have already supported, they should be \nprepared to support this plan too.\n  The Reid plan would cut at least $2.2 trillion of our debt while \nallowing us to avoid default through the end of next year. These two \nelements are crucial to avoiding the lower credit rating we have been \nhearing raised as a concern. We need to provide the markets with some \nlong-term certainty that will avoid default, and some proof we can deal \nseriously with our long-term deficits and debt.\n  A short-term, 6-month increase, as proposed in the House, would kick \nthe can down the road. It won't prevent a lower credit rating. We need \nto end this constant threat of default which is paralyzing our \ngovernment and our economy. The Reid plan achieves this through a \ncombination of cuts to our\n\n[[Page S4985]]\n\ndomestic spending, reduced spending on the wars in Afghanistan and \nIraq, and through targeted cuts to mandatory spending. It doesn't raise \ntaxes, and it doesn't touch Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security.\n  Again, this is not a perfect plan. I have been on the floor many \ntimes in favor of a balanced package that includes cuts to spending--\ndomestic, defense, and mandatory--but also includes increased revenues. \nThe Reid plan doesn't achieve those goals, but I do have hope that we \nwill get there eventually.\n  This is not a proposal I would have written, but I am 1 of 100 \nMembers of the Senate and 1 of 535 Members of Congress, so I don't get \neverything I want. None of us here in Congress get everything we want. \nThat is the nature of compromise. That is the nature of democracy. That \nis why the Framers of the Constitution created checks and balances in \ngovernment. That is why they created two Chambers in Congress and three \nbranches of government. When you are a leader in government, you don't \nhave the luxury of drawing a line in the sand and walking away. You \nhave to be prepared to stay at the table and to give up something.\n  I have just laid out what I and I believe many of my colleagues are \nwilling to give up in this proposal--our demand for a comprehensive \nbalanced plan to reduce the deficit. In exchange, I am willing to \naccept a plan that includes more cuts than any other plan on the table. \nThese are cuts that 40 of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave already supported. This is a plan that I think neither side is \ngoing to love but both sides should be able to accept. It is a plan \nthat gets the job done.\n  We here in the Senate and in Congress have to get the job done, so I \nurge that we come to the table, we adopt a compromise, and we put this \ndebt ceiling vote behind us.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are not in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, today the House of Representatives will \nvote on Speaker Boehner's short-term plan to raise the debt ceiling. As \nsoon as the House completes its vote tonight, or this afternoon, the \nSenate will move to take up the message they send to us. It will be \ndefeated. They know that, and the American people now should understand \nthat clearly.\n  No Democrat will vote for a short-term bandaid approach that will put \nour economy at risk and put the Nation back in the untenable situation \nwe are in today in just a few short months from now. Economists have \nsaid a short-term arrangement holds many of the same risks as a \ntechnical default. Democrats are not willing to put our economy on the \nline for something such as that. It is something we cannot do for the \ngood of the country. Our economy and the financial markets desperately \nneed stability. Speaker Boehner's bill does not provide either. It does \nnot provide stability, and it certainly doesn't help our economy in any \nway.\n  I believe it is time for the tea party Republicans to stop resisting \ncompromise. They must join Democrats and Republicans of good will to \nput the economy ahead of politics.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I wish to underscore what the leader \nhas said.\n  The bottom line is very simple. Speaker Boehner is busy twisting arms \nright now to try to get his bill passed through the House, but it is a \nfutile gesture because that bill is not going to pass the Senate. We \nhave made that clear in the letter that 53 of us signed yesterday, and \nnothing has changed. The idea that we will take Boehner's bill and pass \nit or take Boehner's bill and tweak it and pass it is not what is going \nto happen. So we would urge Speaker Boehner and all of our Republican \ncolleagues to sit down and negotiate.\n  Throwing a hot potato over to us that will not pass just delays \nthings a day, and we are simply 4 days away from one of the worst \nfinancial catastrophes that could face this country; namely, for the \nfirst time in our 230-year history, a refusal to pay the debt. That \nmeans the time for these kinds of political games and political \nposturing is over.\n  Speaker Boehner is having a rough time getting the votes over there, \nbut my guess is he will. But it will not make a darned bit of \ndifference. It will not make a darned bit of difference because it is \nnot going to pass this house, the Senate. It will not pass because a \nshort-term extension risks the same things that no extension risks: a \ndowngrade, a lack of confidence in the markets, and gridlock. We have \nseen gridlock up to now; 3, 4, 5, 6 months from now the same gridlock \nwill occur. We cannot play with this kind of risky fire.\n  So our plea to the Speaker is stop continuing to throw pieces of red \nmeat after red meat after red meat, piece after piece after piece of \nred meat to that rightwing lion in your caucus. Start taming the lion. \nThat is what you have to do because otherwise that lion will devour you \nand devour the economy of our country.\n  The kind of narrow ideological approach that we have seen in the \nHouse will not get us anywhere. The shame of it all is that not every \nMember of the House, and I don't believe the Speaker, has that \nideology, the sort of my-way-or-no-way ideology, the no-compromise \nideology, and it is time to break free. It is time to do what is good \nfor the country.\n  A short-term solution will not work. The leader has just made clear \nthat as soon as the House passes its bill, it will be defeated in the \nSenate. Let's not waste 5, 6, 7, 8 more hours. Let's start negotiating \nsomething that will save this country from potential financial \ncatastrophe now.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield to my friend from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from New York for his very lucid \nremarks and for his great leadership in trying to get through this \nmess.\n  I say to my friend, a lot of people in the country are looking and \nthinking that this is some kind of food fight; that somehow everybody \nis to blame for this here in Washington.\n  I ask my friend, the Senator from New York, isn't it true that there \nare some 50 members of the Republican caucus in the House who have said \nforthrightly that they will not vote to raise the debt ceiling under \nany circumstance? One of those, of course, being Representative \nBachmann, who is seeking the Presidential nomination on their ticket, \nsaid she would not vote to raise it under any circumstance.\n  Does the Senator know of any one Democrat, either in the House or the \nSenate, who has said they would not vote to raise the debt ceiling \nunder any circumstance? I ask the Senator, is there one? I have not \nbeen able to find one.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Iowa for the question. I \nconcur in his findings. I haven't found one either.\n  Democrats know we have different views on this side of the aisle, and \nmany of us would write deficit-reduction bills differently than some \nothers of us would. But we realize that to let the debt ceiling lapse \nwould be a disaster to not raise it. So I have not heard of a single \nDemocrat who has said the debt ceiling ought to lapse, and I have heard \nscores of Republicans, elected, official Republicans and thousands of \nothers and groups in that rightwing firmament pushing their members to \nlet this debt ceiling lapse.\n  My guess is--and God forbid it happens; and we are doing everything \nwe can to prevent it from happening--they will retract that language or \nthey will find ways to explain what they meant because their analysis \nthat it doesn't matter or it will not do much harm is, unfortunately, \ndead wrong.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield for another question. Again, \nthere is a lot of misunderstanding--and I sympathize with this--among \nthe general populous that somehow raising the debt ceiling means that \nsomehow we can go and borrow more money in the future and go further in \ndebt.\n  Isn't it true that raising the debt ceiling just simply means that we \nare going to pay for what so many of us, Republicans and Democrats, \nhave\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\nvoted in the past to appropriate money for? I ask my friend, it is like \nusing your credit card to go out and buy something, but now you say, I \ndon't want to pay the bill? I think that kind of puts it in terms that \nthe average American can understand. If you have used your credit card, \nand you have run up a debt, you have to pay the bills; otherwise, your \ncredit is going to go down, and you are going to lose your credit card, \nand you are not going to be able to do anything else.\n  Isn't that sort of what we are confronting? In the past, Democrats \nand Republicans--we all share the blame, perhaps, for having deficits. \nWe can go into the causes of that. I don't mean to do that here. But \nthe fact is, the United States of America has an obligation to pay its \nbills. The Republicans say, no, they don't want to pay the bills. \nDoesn't that sort of strike the average American as saying: Wait a \nminute. No, we have to honor our debts. We have always honored our \ndebts in this country since the Revolutionary War. Is that not the \nfact?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That is absolutely the fact. My colleague from Iowa is \nexactly correct.\n  The bottom line is, yes. What we are talking about with the debt \nceiling is debts we have already incurred. No American family has the \nluxury, once they sign up for a mortgage, to tell the bank: Well, I am \nnot going to pay you unless you do A, B, and C. No American family has \nthe luxury of telling the credit card company: Hey, unless you buy me a \nyear's supply of groceries, I am not going to pay my credit card debt.\n  Once you incur the debt, you have an obligation to pay. That is one \nof the foundations of American life. It has been that foundation since \nAlexander Hamilton argued with Thomas Jefferson, and it has served our \ncountry well.\n  The awful example that it would set if America, this great land, this \nFederal Government said: Well, I am not going to pay the debt, I am not \ngoing to pay the debt unless A, B, C, D is done--what kind of example \ndoes that send to American families, to American young people? It is \nthe opposite, frankly, of the conservative philosophy--part of which I \nagree with in this regard--that you pay your bills, that you pay your \ndebts. If you don't, there is a consequence.\n  So it is just amazing. This is the first time, I believe--check the \nhistory books--in American history where a large group in either House \nof this Congress has made it a campaign not to pay the debt unless they \nget their way on certain other issues, whatever they be. If every one \nof us did that, this country would be paralyzed. We wouldn't be able to \ndo a thing. It is leading down a road that nobody should want to \ntravel.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to ask one more question and then I would \nyield.\n  Isn't it true that we--I would say the Senator from New York has been \na leader in this and so many others here. We want to, first of all, pay \nour bills, but then we want to get our deficit under control and reduce \nour debt. To that end, on the Democratic side, I would say we have \ntried to propose a balanced approach, I ask my friend from New York, \nwho has been a leader in this area of both cutting spending and also \nraising revenue so that we are kind of all in this together.\n  We are asking everyone. We are not willing just to cut the deficit on \nthe backs of the poor or people who are out of work, the elderly on \nMedicare. We are saying everybody has to take a little bit. But we are \nalso going to ask some sacrifice from those who have much in our \nsociety; that we want to raise some revenue from those who have \nbenefited in the last 10, 15 years so much and have gotten so much \nwealth in our society. We are asking for them also to share in this.\n\n  We have proposed that, have we not, I ask the Senator? And has it not \nbeen true that the Republican side has been unwilling to ask the \nrichest people in our country to help us reduce the deficit? They will \nnot agree to any revenues. I ask my friend from New York, is that not \nthe case?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Again, my colleague from Iowa is on the money.\n  There needs to be balance. The President has stressed this. I think \neveryone on our side has stressed this. We do have a serious deficit \nproblem and a serious debt problem. We have to deal with it. I think \nthere is agreement in this Chamber, and I will give some credit to \nthose on the other side of the aisle who made this their signature \nissue in influencing policy. But if we are going to have to do that and \ndo belt tightening, shouldn't it be across the board?\n  Here is the fact of the matter: If you are a middle-class person, it \nis hard to pay for college. It is hard to pay for prescription drugs. \nIt is hard to take that paycheck and make sure it deals with all the \nneeds you and your spouse and your children have. Over the years, we \nhave established ways that the government helps with student loans or \nwith prescription drug programs or other kinds of help. It so happens \nthat the wealthy among us, God bless them, don't need a student loan. \nThey have plenty of money to pay for their children's college. They \ndon't need a prescription drug plan. Even with the high expense of \nthese prescription drugs, they can afford it. God bless them.\n  The way the wealthy benefit from the Tax Code, because they have a \nlot of money, is there are tax expenditures, tax breaks they get. They \nthink they are important. I understand that. But they are no more \nimportant than helping young people go to college or helping our \nelderly, average folks pay for their prescription drugs. If you are \ngoing to be across the board and you are going to say no revenues, you \nare going to have an unbalanced and unfair approach.\n  Let me say this: Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \ntried to scare people. This has not happened just this year but for \nmany years. They say: Democrats want to raise your taxes. That is not \nthe case if you are an average middle-class American. In fact, the \nPresident has made it a watch word, and we have religiously concurred \nand followed, that no one who makes below $250,000 a year should get \nany tax increase. That is 97 percent of all Americans.\n  So when we say we want revenues, we are talking about two things: We \nare talking about tax breaks, tax loopholes for the very wealthy, \nwhether they be individuals or corporations, and we are talking about \ntax breaks for the wealthiest among us who, under the previous \nadministration, got much greater breaks than anybody else. That is all \nwe are talking about.\n  So I would ask my colleagues, I would ask the American people to \nunderstand that. Don't be scared when somebody gets up and says they \nwant to raise taxes, that it means your taxes. It doesn't unless, God \nbless you, you have a whole lot of money or you are a corporation with \na very nice little break that may not be as necessary as, say, helping \nmiddle-class students go to college or helping the elderly get \nlifesaving prescription drugs. So there has to be balance.\n  Now, I know my good colleague from Iowa, who has spent his lifetime \ncreating government programs that help people, it pains him when he \nhears there has to be spending cuts in those programs. But I have never \nheard him say: If there are any spending cuts, I am not going to vote \nfor deficit reduction. But the mirror image on this side says: I will \nnot vote for any bill if it even has one plug nickel of revenues. That \nis not fair. That is not right. That is not balanced. It is totally \nagainst what just about every American believes, including a majority \nof Republicans. So that is why we are making this fight.\n  I will say one other thing in reference to my colleague's question. \nIt is unfair when the commentators and the people say: Well, on the one \nhand, the Democrats aren't compromising and, on the other hand, the \nRepublicans aren't compromising. I understand that we should always not \njust look at our own position and try to understand somebody else's \nposition. That is the way it works around here; otherwise, we would \nhave a dictator, a benevolent dictator. We do not. But when we are \nwilling to give on spending cuts, serious spending cuts we do not like, \nand the other side says they are not willing to give a nickel on \nrevenues, it is not each side is failing to give. It is not that each \nside is compromising a value. It is not that each side has walked about \nthe same distance to come up with a compromise. In this case--it is not \ntrue every time--my Republican friends have been unwilling to \ncompromise one jot and we have been willing to do things very painful \nto us.\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\n  I say to my friends who comment and write about this: Be fair. Let \nthe public know who is willing to move away from their hard-line \nposition for the sake of compromise, for the sake of raising the debt \nceiling, for the sake of getting our large debt and deficit down, and \nwho has refused to budge. I think the answer is pretty obvious.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S4987-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4987-S4990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE FAA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from Alaska for allowing me to jump \nahead in the queue. I will have a word to say about the issues raised \nby the Senators from Iowa and New York at the end, but I am rising to \ntalk about an issue that is actually separate. I have been out on the \nfloor week after week talking about the debt limit and debt reduction \nnegotiations, but today I want to talk about another absurd and \nneedless Washington-inflicted, what I can only think of as a mistake, \nand that is the partial shutdown of the FAA. This shutdown--while \nburied in the headlines--is affecting Colorado jobs and the economy \nacross the United States. Unable to walk and chew gum at the same time, \nCongress's inability to resolve this impasse has caused the furloughing \nof thousands of workers nationwide and put at risk several very \nimportant summer construction projects at our airports in Colorado.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate worked together to pass a long-term FAA \nreauthorization bill. This important bill, which I supported, will \nmodernize our Nation's air transportation system and reduce frustrating \nand costly delays. The American people would be astonished to learn how \nantiquated our system is right now. But the House and Senate conference \ncommittee have been unable to finalize the bill.\n  Last Friday, Congress failed to pass a short-term authorization \nmeasure to buy negotiators more time. Now certain FAA functions have \nbeen shut down. This shutdown makes absolutely no sense to the people \nin Colorado who rely on this industry for their livelihoods, their \nbusinesses, and travel.\n  I know the same is true in Alaska. It is more than that. Colorado has \na short summer construction season--probably not as short as Alaska's, \nbut nevertheless short--and many airports set aside the summer months \nto complete much-needed improvement projects, so this shutdown has come \nat the worst time for them.\n  In Loveland-Fort Collins Airport in Colorado, they are very near \ncancelling a planned runway improvement project. Loveland-Fort Collins \nis a one-runway airport. Officials had already canceled summer flights \nto accommodate a $7 million runway rebuilding project. Now they could \nbe forced to shelve the project, which was bringing around 150 jobs to \nthe area.\n  At Pueblo Memorial Airport--by the way, keep in mind this is about \nWashington's dysfunction. There are not big policy debates here. It is \nWashington turning its back on the rest of the country once again. At \nPueblo Memorial Airport, officials have said they may be forced to \ndelay a $12 million runway rebuilding project.\n  At the Durango Airport, officials are concerned that an ongoing $3 \nmillion apron rehabilitation project--which currently employs 30 \nColoradans--will receive a stop-work order next week if Congress \nrefuses to act.\n  At the Denver International Airport, one of the crown jewels in this \ncountry, officials are concerned that the shutdown will affect \nscheduled concrete and asphalt work on a runway and maintenance on \npassenger loading bridges.\n  These delays could affect the overall safety of Colorado airports and \nthey are affecting jobs right now.\n  Nationwide, an estimated 3,500 FAA workers began to be furloughed \nthis past Saturday; 27 of these workers are in Colorado. They were \neither sent home or forced to work without pay.\n  To his credit, Chairman Rockefeller recently introduced legislation \nthat would allow the FAA to continue to pay those workers during the \nshutdown. I have cosponsored the legislation. I hope the Senate \nconsiders doing it today, but we need to do more than that. We have \nbeen asked to do more than the bare minimum by our constituents. We \nhave gotten to the point around here where just keeping the lights on \nsomehow is a success. That is a pretty low bar. It is a low bar to \nHeather Hilgers of Englewood, CO. She is an engineer. Airports hire her \nto complete construction projects so they can meet FAA safety \nstandards. She wrote to my office:\n\n       Next week, if there is no one to reimburse the contractor, \n     the job has to stop. The stall is affecting engineering \n     contracts. The visible impact would be the construction \n     contractors' jobs.\n\n  Andrew Vogt of Denver, CO, is also an engineer. He wrote:\n\n       It's a frustrating experience that this whole industry has \n     gone through. We are hoping a long-term solution can be \n     achieved in short order.\n       As a professional engineer, certified construction manager \n     for airport improvement projects, there is literally no work \n     to do this year. . . . Put me back to work.\n\n  Jeff Campbell, also of Engelwood, CO--these are not government \nemployees, by the way. We are talking about private-sector employees \nwhose jobs and expectations and salaries and plans for their families \nare being put on hold by the games that are being played here in \nWashington.\n  Jeff Campbell, also of Engelwood, CO, is an aviation engineer who is \ninvolved with five projects that are being affected by the shutdown. \nOne is the failing runway at Fort Collins-Loveland. He said 150 people, \nexpecting to begin work next week, are about to be put on hold and the \nproject will have to be rebid for the third time.\n  A lot of people in Congress talk about putting people back to work. \nThey talk about fiscal responsibility. But this delay is costing \nthousands of jobs and an estimated $30 million a day in lost revenue. \nIf this shutdown continues, these losses could dwarf the entire yearly \nbudget of the EAS Program, which some claim is holding up the bill. \nCongress must not allow the debate over our debt limit or deficit to \nprevent action on a short-term FAA extension. Such inaction only proves \nonce again to the American people how broken this place is.\n  It would be a terrible shame for Members of Congress to resolve this \ndebt debate, adjourn, and board their planes home for recess without \nresolving this issue. What a slap in the face to people all across this \ncountry. On behalf of our constituents who make a much more forceful \ncase than I ever could, I implore my colleagues and Members of the \nHouse to resolve this impasse and reauthorize FAA now.\n\n\n                             The Debt Limit\n\n  With the indulgence of the Senator from Alaska, I want to take the \nopportunity to say a word or two about this debt limit discussion we \nare having right now. We face enormous challenges in our country right \nnow. Our economy is almost producing what it was producing before we \nwent into this terrible recession, but we have 14 million people who \nare unemployed. The great productive American economy has figured out \nhow to produce what it was producing before with fewer people. But we \nhave not figured out how to put people back to work. My own view is \nthat we need to look hard at our Tax Code, our regulatory code, and \nother things to make sure we are inspiring innovation and job growth \nhere in the United States and we are not just shipping it overseas and \nsaying it is too bad for everybody who is here.\n  We are at the end of a decade when median family income has declined \nfor the first time in our country's history. It never happened before. \nThe cost of health care has gone up. The cost of higher education has \ngone up. It is harder and harder for the middle class in this country \nto survive. If you are a child living in poverty in the United States, \nyour chances of getting a college education are 9 in 100 in the 21st \ncentury in the greatest country in the world.\n  There are countries all over this globe that sense weakness, that are \ntrying to out-compete us, trying to out-educate us, trying to out-\ninvest in their infrastructure while we play foolish political games. \nThey are not waiting for permission from us to out-compete us.\n  One of the single greatest assets this country has had since almost \nits founding has been our bulletproof credit rating. It has been the \nfortress that is our full faith and credit of the United States. \nFinancial transactions all over the globe, spanning decades, centuries, \nhave been financed based on the\n\n[[Page S4988]]\n\nstrength of our credit, the full faith and credit of the United States, \nand generation after generation of politicians has done everything they \ncould to protect it, as any mayor in my State, as any superintendent of \nschools in my State, would do anything to make sure they protected the \ncredit rating of their city or of their school district.\n\n  Now we face, for the first time in our country's history, a threat of \ndowngrade, a threat that our interest rates would spike. That is not a \npolitical observation; that is coming from the credit rating agencies. \nThey are not politicians. What the math tells us is that every 1-\npercent increase in our cost of borrowing adds $1.3 trillion to our \ndebt over the next 10 years, making the problems we face today even \nharder to solve.\n  The President knows I have supported for a long time a comprehensive \napproach, one that would actually make a meaningful difference to our \ndebt and to our deficit, and I will continue to fight for it, as will, \nI know, the Senator from Alaska. But it is time for Washington to move \npast these political games and reassure our capital markets that we are \nnot going to be the first generation of Senators to blow up our credit \nrating over politics, to reduce the full faith and credit of the United \nStates to rubble--for politics. I don't want to be somebody who, 30 \nyears from now or 40 years from now where somebody comes and says: Hey, \nwe detect you were once in the Senate, you were 1 of 100 people here \nwhen we compromised one of the greatest assets this country has.\n  I implore the leadership of both parties, both here and in the House, \nto work this out. Then let's get on with the tough discussion we have \nto have about our debt and deficit.\n  Mr. President, I thank again the Senator from Alaska for allowing me \nto speak ahead of him, and also for his leadership throughout this \nentire debate. He, like a number of us, has been working hard with \nMembers across the aisle to try to get a bipartisan solution that is \nbalanced and that makes sense heading toward the future. I thank him \nfor his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Colorado is \nalways so passionate on the floor when it comes to the issues pertinent \nnot only to his State and his country. He has laid out such a logical \ncase on the debt of this Nation and why we need to deal with it. I will \naddress the debt also.\n  But I came down here, like the Senator from Colorado, to talk about \nthe FAA reauthorization bill. I was not planning to come down. I was in \nmy office. As Senators, we have lots of meetings, events, activities \nand photo ops--meet and greets, they call them. People come in and say \nhello and chit-chat take a few photographs with you. They are residents \nfrom your State.\n  I was sitting there and having a great conversation with young \npeople, four of them from Girls and Boys Nation here from the American \nLegion Auxiliary: Clara Farley, from Kodiak, Joseph Mueller from Healy, \nDerick Hanna from Palmer, and Marissa Torgerson from Anchorage. Then \nthere was another young woman who was there, a young leadership \nstudent, Jocelyn Cayce from Juneau.\n  You know, to have a ``photo op'' is what they call them. We shake \nhands and take some photos. It was interesting having this \nconversation. The first question they asked me was what was going to \nhappen with the debt of this Nation. Before I elaborate on my thoughts \nand what I told them, I, first would like to talk about the FAA \nextension because they are both related. The FAA bill and what is going \non with the debt is all related. It is related because of the House \nmajority's inability to function and their inability to do their work.\n\n  The FAA is a great example. I know the Senator from Colorado \nmentioned that the conference committee has not brought out a bill. \nWhat is amazing about this is the Senate appointed their conferees in \nApril. For those who are watching, the way this works is the House \npasses a bill and the Senate passes a bill. They are not always exactly \nthe same, so they go to a joint conference committee made up of Members \nfrom the House and Members from the Senate--Democrats and Republicans--\nand they work out a compromise. The Senate appointed their Members to \nthe conference committee in April. The House has not appointed anybody.\n  The battle we are in is because of one person. There is one person \nwho has decided that 4,000 people should be furloughed--about 80 in \nAlaska--to stop projects that are critical to the safety of air \ntransportation. I can tell you there is no other State that depends on \nair transportation like Alaska, with 82 percent of our communities not \nable to be accessed by road, they are predominantly accessed by air. \nFor one person in the House to decide he wants to play politics with \naviation safety because he doesn't like something--oddly enough, the \nitems he wanted to eliminate are from States that are represented by \nDemocrats and chairmen of committees. It is unbelievable.\n  I did not come here 2\\1/2\\ half years ago to play those games. I came \nhere to do the work the people of Alaska sent me to do. Part of that \nwork was to make sure the Federal Aviation Administration actually has \na reauthorization they can operate under because they haven't had it \nsince 2007. I was elected in 2008. There have been 20 short term \nextensions of the FAA's authority while the House and Senate try to \npass legislation and work out the differences. The Senate did pass a \nbill. We did our work. We did it, and we did it with a lot of debate.\n  I sit on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee \nwith jurisdiction over the FAA. Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nHutchison, Democrat and Republican, worked in a bipartisan manner with \nall the members. The Senate passed our FAA bill. The House passed \ntheirs, and now we are waiting for the House to appoint conferees. We \nare waiting for the House to do something. Not one person. That is not \nhow this system should work. They need to appoint conferees so we can \nsit down and resolve these final minor issues. Instead the chairman in \nthe House decides he knows best.\n  Here is what happens: Yes, 4,000 FAA employees get furloughed all \nacross this country. These are people who have mortgage payments to \nmake and kids planning to go to college this fall, or maybe they are \nthe only breadwinner in their homes--but 4,000 people are furloughed.\n  There are 79 FAA employees in Alaska who have been furloughed. \nCompound that with the next piece of the equation. Part of the FAA \nreauthorization bill is to invest in our aviation infrastructure. I \nthink I will hit 100,000-plus miles this year, maybe more, 125,000 \nmiles flying back and forth from Washington to my home State, visiting \ncommunities all across my State. I pay a small fee like everyone who \nflies does. We pay for our airline tickets and a portion goes to the \nFAA, who then invests this money into making our runways and our air \ntraffic facilities safer. It is the people who fly who pay for our \naviation system, and their money goes to the FAA to pay for the \nimprovements that we use to make sure we fly safely. It is not \ncomplicated. Yet what is happening because the FAA doesn't have the \nauthority to collect this fee, is the airlines and passengers are \ngetting a tax holiday. That fee is important. I will get back to that \nfee and what has happened with that money.\n  First, without that money, we cannot do airport construction \nprojects. It is all part of the system. In Alaska it is a pretty \nimportant piece.\n  In Bethel, a project now has a stop-work order issued by the FAA \nbecause they cannot complete the project without an extension. As my \nfriend from Colorado mentioned, Colorado has a short construction \nseason, and we have a very short construction season in Bethel, Alaska. \nWe are trying to build a project that improves the approach lights to \nmake it safer for people to land at the Bethel Airport. That project \nhas been stopped. There is no other access to Bethel except by air. \nBethel is 400 miles from Anchorage, the largest city in the State, by \nair. We cannot drive to Bethel. That project has stopped because the \nHouse hasn't passed a clean FAA extension.\n  Another project makes seismic improvements to the air traffic control \ntower in Anchorage. People say it is just a tower, what does it matter? \nThe\n\n[[Page S4989]]\n\ntower is old. It needs improvements. It is not only important for \nAlaska and the people who would work on the project, it is important \nfor this country. We are the third busiest air cargo airport--in the \nsense of cargo throughput--in the world. We move products that are \nproduced in this country and around the world through Anchorage. If you \nare shipping something to Europe or Asia and you are west of the \nMississippi, the odds are you are coming through Anchorage's \ninternational airport.\n  Almost 700 wide-body jets fly through Anchorage every single week \ncarrying cargo. It is the third busiest airport in terms of cargo \nthroughput in the world. It is an economic engine. It is a job creator. \nI remember almost 25 years ago when the idea came from a couple of \ncompanies, FedEx and UPS. They said: We will look at Anchorage as our \ninternational hub because of its location. Today it is a robust \nfacility and many other airlines cargo carriers use our airport \nfacilities. It is huge.\n  Instead of the House doing their job and appointing conferees to \nresolve this issue, one person in the House decided he wanted to play \npolitics over the life-safety of our air traffic system, the Federal \naviation system, and now that project is not happening. Not only are \nthe 79 FAA employees furloughed in Alaska, but projects in Bethel and \nAnchorage are not moving forward. So that means the private \ncontractors--it is not government employees who make these improvements \nand build lighting systems or remodel the tower. It is private \ncontractors who employ people who then pay mortgages and buy cars and \nspend money in the economy and help our economy move forward. This is \nclearly a job-killing action. That is what it is. They will say some \nother reasons, but that is what it is doing. It is killing jobs, and it \nis hurting America.\n  Again, it costs more because when the construction season in Bethel \nis over in the next month or month and a half, we don't get to come \nback in November and say we are going to finish this project. We can't. \nThe weather conditions don't allow it.\n  What will happen is, next year the costs will go up because the \nprivate contractor will have to remobilize--I hear a lot from folks on \nthe other side over there in the House talk about the private sector. I \nam from the private sector. I don't know how many of those guys worked \nin the private sector, but I have. That is where I made my living, and \nthat is how my wife makes her living, from the private sector. They \nspout off about how they want to support the private sector. Well, pass \nthe FAA reauthorization legislation that the private sector supports \nand wants moved forward for the creation of more jobs and the \nopportunity to make our air safer.\n  Again, it is astounding to me how dysfunctional the House majority is \nand how they are unable to do their work. They complained a lot earlier \nthis year that the Senate doesn't do their job, and we are not doing \nour work. We are doing our work. We passed the Military Construction-VA \nbill. We passed the FAA bill. We passed several things. They go over \nthere and they die. They go over there, and they have one person who \ndecides they know best.\n  A lot of those guys ran in 2010 on the effort to open government, 72 \nhours to review bills, which is great. I have not seen it. They had \nsome Rules Committee meeting earlier last night or whatever late night \nthey did it to set the rules on what they are going to vote on in less \nthan 12 or 13 hours. I am sure that has been notified to a lot of \npeople. It is amazing they ran on the fact that they want to open \ngovernment, the system is broken, and then it is so dysfunctional over \nthere.\n  The FAA bill, as I mentioned, these airlines collect fees that then \ngo to the FAA to make sure all this happens. It is part of the fee we \npay to travel. Now the FAA is not authorized to collect it, but what \nhappened? Several of these airlines jacked up their fees to collect the \nmoney for their own. There is $200 million a week coming from consumers \ninto the pockets of these airlines for their profit, not to improve the \nsafety of the airports, which is what the money is supposed to be \ndesigned for. I will say Alaska Airlines--and I am proud to say Alaska \nAirlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Spirit Airlines are three examples of \ncompanies that did not do that. They did not jack up the price to the \nconsumer for their own bottom line. Also, remembering that those fees \nare for the purpose of improving airports and not improving the \ncorporate profits or the CEO's million-dollar-plus checks they get at \nthe end of the year for the work they do.\n  The problem is--something like this happened many years ago--we are \nnot going to be able to get those resources back to make sure these \nairports are safer.\n  I, of course, implore the airlines to do one of two things: Lower \nthose fares they jacked up or put that money aside and work with \nCongress to make sure that money goes into the fund to ensure that we \nimprove these airports. I challenge every one of those airlines that \nhave done that.\n  As a consumer who is watching this issue, you should be appalled that \n$200 million a week that you thought was going to improve the airports \nyou fly through, it is not. It is going into the pockets for profit for \nsome of these companies. Again, I point out Alaska Airlines, Hawaiian \nAirlines, Spirit Airlines are a few of the only major airlines that are \nnot doing that. I commend them for that. I commend them for doing the \nright thing by the consumer.\n  I was originally coming down and going to talk--as I got inspired by \nthe students sitting there--about the budget, but then I wanted to talk \nabout the FAA. I want to get back to the budget.\n  As I mentioned, these young people came to my office and asked the \nfirst question: What are we going to do about the debt? Great. It is \nthe question of the day. What are we going to do? We can debate how we \ngot here. Everyone got us here: Democrats, Republicans, current, past, \neverybody. We have a problem. We have a challenge. I know the Presiding \nOfficer is new. You came here to solve problems, create solutions, not \njust play the politics and push it off for another day, but actually do \nsome things. That is why people sent me here, and I know that is why \nthey sent you here: to do the job the American people expect us to do--\nI know Alaskans expect me to do.\n  There is no question in my mind why we are here today. It is because, \nagain, the House majority, I will point out, cannot do their job. They \nare unable to do their job. They are not dealing with reality.\n  Do I want to add more debt to the Nation? No. No one does. As my \ncolleague from Colorado earlier said--and I know the Presiding \nOfficer--we have been working on ideas. One thing that is unique about \nthe Senate is there is an effort here--it may not be as visible as the \npress would like to portray because they would like to see the battles, \nthat is better press. There is a lot of bipartisan discussion going on. \nThe Gang of 6, you can argue if that is good or bad, but the point is \nthree Republicans, three Democrats sat down for months. In the Budget \nCommittee, we sat down for months. We came up with proposals. We are \ntalking to Republicans. Republicans are talking to Democrats. We are \nlooking for solutions. We are trying to weed through this. The Senate \nis trying to do this. We are trying to solve this problem and create a \nsolution that moves us forward. But there are several in the House \nmajority over there who believe to drive off a cliff is good policy. I \ndon't know, I don't think that is good policy. I would rather drive on \nthe road, going somewhere. That is what we are trying to do over the \nnext few days.\n\n  As I think of the differences--and people say: Well, why don't you \njust take that deal or this deal? Here is the difference. They are \nfundamental. They are not complicated. The deal the leader, Speaker \nBoehner, has in the House is about $900 billion in reductions. It is \nshort term. It has a joint committee to look to the long term. What is \nthe Reid proposal? The Reid proposal, as it is now scored by CBO--the \nCongressional Budget Office, for those who are watching and wondering \nwhat all these things mean--is $2.2-plus trillion in reductions, almost \n2\\1/2\\ times more than the House version, and it is long term. Here is \nwhy that is important. I am not voting for anything short term. Let me \nmake that very clear to the Presiding Officer and others who might be \nwatching. If we want to disrupt and continue to disrupt this economy, \nkeep doing these shenanigans and keep doing these\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\n2-, 3-, 4-month deals, that is disastrous to this economy.\n  I have heard and talked to business leader after business leader, \nfrom associations, to individuals, to people back in my home State, and \nthey say over and over: Don't do short term. Whatever you decide, give \nus certainty--certainty.\n  The unique thing about the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House: Only we \nwould describe long term as 16, 18 months because that is all we can do \naround here. But short term, as one can imagine, is 3, 4 months. That \nwould be more disruptive to this economy than anything we can imagine \nbecause all we do as we shift it--and I can describe this because I \nunderstand this business. I have been in it. My wife is in it. Here is \nwhat happens. We will have this same debate in November, probably. Here \nis what happens in November. This is the biggest time for people who \nare buying. For retailers, this is the most important time--actually, \nback to school a little bit, but November through December is when \npeople make their expenditures and are buying things, consuming, and \nspending money in our economy. But people always like to blame \nDemocrats: It is all about government. I come from the private sector. \nAs I said earlier, that is where I made my living. It is an important \npart of our economy.\n  So here we are going to debate, create more uncertainty at the most \nimportant time, when consumers are going to try to judge what to do. \nWhat do they do? Do they spend a little bit extra for a gift for their \nfriend? Do they go on that trip they were planning? Do they make that \nextra expenditure? Yet we will have the same debate. So long term is \nimportant--again, 16, 18 months, but that is better than the short-term \nplan.\n  No businessperson has come to me--and I challenge any businessperson: \nPick up the phone. Call me. Let me know. Tell me you want a short term, \nand I will be happy to come down here to the floor and say that. I will \nmention your company name. I will tell people: This company is \ninterested in short term. I would be happy to do that. I am not going \nto get those calls because they know that is not the way to run a \nbusiness, that is not the way to run a household, and that sure as heck \nshould not be the way we run our government.\n  So there is a clear difference. For all of those people who--I get a \nlot of pro and con on this issue, calling my office, sending me e-\nmails--for all of those people who say: Hey, just vote for the Boehner \nthing, I will tell them why I will not. I want people to understand \nclearly my position. It is not about, he is a Republican, I am a \nDemocrat. That is irrelevant. It is short term. It is fewer spending \nreductions. It keeps us in turmoil. It doesn't move us forward. It is \nall about shenanigans and game-playing and politics. That is what he is \npresenting.\n  Now, maybe the Reid proposal isn't perfect. I know there are \nRepublicans who have some ideas here in the Senate who want to modify \nit. Great. But it is long term, it has more significant reductions, and \nit moves us down a path in the right direction. It is not perfect, but \nI can tell my colleagues that the idea they have over there will not \nwork for this economy.\n  I have probably spoken too long, but those kids from Juneau and Healy \nand Anchorage and Kodiak had a great question. When kids are asking \nthat question and they say to me--and I give them the same exact \npresentation. I say: Here are the differences. I give them the papers \nand say: Here, you look at it. And they say to me: Why aren't we doing \na long term, because these kids are now at an age where they are \nthinking about their future. They are not thinking about the next \nweekend; they are thinking about their future. They have a position we \ncould learn a lot from around this place, I will tell my colleagues \nthey made it very clear to me: Whatever you do, make it long term, \nbecause they are thinking about their future and where they want to be. \nIt is an incredible commentary when we have kids who have more \nwherewithal in the sense of their knowledge of what should be done in \nthe body we sit in today. It should wake us up.\n  The last thing I will note is this. I think about what my colleague \nfrom Colorado said about the value of our position in this world when \nit comes to ensuring that people understand America will stand behind \neverything we do--the debt we do, the positions we take. As a matter of \nfact, it was so important, it was written into the Constitution that we \nshould never question the ability to pay our bills.\n  For those on the other side who like to spout off, and they pull out \nof their pocket the little portable Constitution--all of us get those; \nwe all have those--and they cite the Constitution, sometimes they \nforget sections of it. I hope we don't forget this section. We should \nnever be questioned in regard to our debt. We pay our bills. We stand \nbehind what we do. That is what makes our country different from any \ncountry in this world.\n  So I challenge them to get their job done, maybe on the FAA bill, \nmaybe on this issue involving the debt, but the House needs to get \ntheir act together--the majority. Let me make that clear. The majority \nover there needs to get their job done, quit killing things over there, \nfrom jobs to legislation, and focus on the work people sent them here--\nespecially the group of 2010--but who sent me here and sent the \nPresiding Officer here--we were sent here to do a job.\n  It is outrageous to me that we cannot move forward when it is so \nsimple in the sense of a plan that gets us on a path that is long term \nand has better spending reductions. Maybe it is too logical. Maybe that \nis the problem around here: If it is too simple, too logical, it \ndoesn't work. It has to be complicated with a lot of gamesmanship is \nthe only way it works. I want to prove that wrong.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me the time to say a few words. \nHopefully, the people who are watching us and listening will hear the \nreal debate and cut through all the moment-in-time politicizing. Maybe, \nhopefully, they will hear those five kids whom I heard and will hear \ntheir concerns and what their position is.\n  So, again, I thank the Chair for the time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to former \nMinnesota Twins pitcher Bert Blyleven, who this week received his \nsport's highest honor when he was inducted into the Major League \nBaseball Hall of Fame.\n  To Bert, I offer hearty and well-deserved congratulations.\n  To the rest of the baseball world, I ask the question: What took so \nlong? In the 14 years since he first became eligible for the Hall of \nFame, we in Minnesota all assumed that, with his rare talent and Hall \nof Fame numbers, Bert was a shoo-in, and for many of those 14 years he \nwas considered the best player never to have been inducted. I am proud \nto say as a Minnesotan and a lifelong Twins fan that this year Bert \nBlyleven was officially voted into the Hall of Fame.\n  People in Minnesota all know Bert belongs on the distinguished list \nof Minnesota Twins already in the Hall of Fame, including Harmon \nKillebrew, Rod Carew, and Kirby Puckett, as well as two other baseball \ngreats who grew up in St. Paul, MN, and later played for the Twins and \nwere inducted into the Hall of Fame: Paul Molitor and Dave Winfield. \nEach of them had Hall of Fame careers, and now Bert has finally joined \nthem.\n  Bert pitched 22 seasons in the Major Leagues, 11 of them for the \nTwins, but he also took his talents to Texas, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, \nand California. During his career, he won 287 games, he struck out an \namazing 3,701 batters, and is fifth on the alltime career strikeout \nlist, with more career strikeouts than pitching greats Tom Seaver, \nWalter Johnson, Bob Gibson, Greg Maddux, Cy Young, or even his boyhood \nidol, Sandy Koufax. He pitched 60 shutouts and led the league in \nshutouts three times. He had a career earned run average of just 3.31. \nHe pitched 242 complete games, something that would be unheard of \ntoday. He played on two world championship teams: in Minnesota, with \nthe 1987 Twins and in Pittsburgh. For Twins fans, we all know Bert was \na major part of that\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\n1987 Twins world championship team which we all revere for finally \nbringing a world championship to our State. And we won again in 1991.\n  Bert mentioned in his acceptance speech on Sunday that he is the \nfirst Hall of Famer born in Holland. He moved to California as a child \nand became interested in baseball by watching Sandy Koufax pitch for \nthe Dodgers. His father Joe, also a baseball fan, built him a pitcher's \nmound in the backyard, where he developed one of the best curveballs in \nbaseball history. I would like to think if my dad had built me--no, I \ndon't think so.\n  Bert finished his playing career in 1992. In 1996, he rejoined the \nTwins in the broadcast booth, where for many years he and Dick Bremer \nhave become familiar voices to Twins fans all over the upper Midwest. I \npersonally love nothing more than watching a Twins game on TV and \nlistening to Dick and Bert, who, in my humble opinion, are an \nauthoritative and amazingly entertaining broadcast team.\n  During broadcasts, Bert has created a phenomenon using his \ntelestrator to circle Twins fans who, whether they are in the Target \nField or on the road, are holding up signs that catch Bert's interest, \nand then he will circle them. There is no higher honor for a Twins fan \nthan to be circled by Bert, and every game is packed with fans holding \nsigns that simply say ``Circle Me, Bert.''\n  It was great to see that Bert was joined at Sunday's induction \nceremony by his wife Gayle, their children, Bert's siblings, and his \nmother Jenny. During his speech, Bert spoke about his father Joe, who \ndied in 2004 of Parkinson's disease, saying, ``I know he is up there \nright now looking down.''\n  In memory of his father, Bert and his wife Gayle started the ``Circle \nMe, Bert'' Web site to raise research money for the National Parkinson \nFoundation Minnesota. That says volumes about Bert Blyleven. Bert is \nknown in Minnesota for his dedication to other charities and to the \ncommunity there.\n  So, once again, Bert, as a lifelong Twins fan, thank you and \ncongratulations. After 14 years of waiting, you are hereby ``circled'' \nby the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame, where generations of fans \nfrom Minnesota and around the country and around the world will know of \nyour career and of your amazing contributions to the game of baseball \nand to the community of Minnesota.\n  Thank you very much.

Mr. President, I think it is obvious to the world \naround us that the atmosphere here is hardly one of comfort or \nsatisfaction. The public does not see the agony of the debate that is \ntaking place, as we watch how dysfunctional the discussion about the \nnational debt has been.\n  We feel the threat to America's world financial leadership that is \nlurking around here, and it is not very satisfying to those people \nwhose homes are close to foreclosure or the people who need to be \nassured that health care is going to be there for them or that their \nchild who can learn can get an education without mortgaging their \nfuture or cannot even get a mortgage on that.\n  So we look around and we watch and we listen and we see that the \nRepublicans in the House and the Republicans in the Senate are in a \nsearch for political gain regardless of the cost to our society and our \nNation.\n  I do not make this statement casually. But after months of watching \nand listening to the targeted goal of politics over the pain that could \nfollow a default, no other conclusion may be drawn. We want to consider \nthe evidence. By way of example, Vice President Biden convened a \nbipartisan working group to find solutions to get the national debt \nproblem over with, get it resolved, and let us go on to our normal and \nneeded debate and business. After that, Republicans walked out. Walked \nout.\n  Next, President Obama offered Republicans what he called a ``grand \ndeal'' that would reduce the deficit by $4 trillion. Republicans ran \naway. Now our majority leader, Harry Reid, has proposed a plan that \nincludes more than $2 trillion in spending cuts, $1 in cuts for every \ndollar the debt limit is increased--and not even insisting on a dollar \nof revenues, which has been suggested several times.\n  But there is no way of getting through the obstinacy on the other \nside. Republicans turn their back time after time. Democrats in this \nSenate and in the White House have offered the Republicans compromise \nafter compromise. But they do not see their target. Their target is to \ndo damage to the Obama administration so that it hurts sufficiently to \ndiscount the progress that has been made for our society under \nPresident Obama.\n  Time and time again the Republicans have changed their demands to \nfind reasons to say no. Are we asking the Republicans to do something \nradical, something that has never been done before? That is certainly \nnot the case. Over the past half century, the debt ceiling has been \nraised 75 times, almost two-thirds of those occasions under Republican \nPresidents. In fact, the debt ceiling was increased 18 times under \nPresident Reagan, and 7 times under President George W. Bush.\n  Our country has never defaulted. So the question that must be raised \nis: What is different about today? Why, at a time when we already face \na real jobs crisis in this country, would Republicans plan for another \neconomic crisis? Why would they do that? Will destroying the economy \nhelp Republicans win seats next year when people across our country are \nalready expressing their dissatisfaction with the deadlock they see \nbeing displayed?\n  We heard the minority leader say his No. 1 priority is stopping the \nPresident from winning another term. What a goal that is. He is our \nPresident, elected by the people of the country. He has a term of 4 \nyears and will be up for reelection. We hope and we pray that he \ncontinues to be the President of our country. What good does it do to \ntarget the system?\n  Make known what it is they stand for. So far we have seen that they \nstand for nothing that is helpful to the average American. So what we \nneed is a chance to have an honest discussion. Insecurity reigns as \npeople grow more and more conscious about their inability to afford the \nbasics of life, jobs, health care, education. They see prices being \nraised around them as their purchasing power shrinks. Look at the price \nof gasoline. You see a perfect example of what is happening. We had one \nRepublican Presidential candidate who was asked: ``Does it strike you \nthat as the unemployment rate goes up your chances of winning office \nalso go up?''\n  Do you know what her answer was? She said, ``I hope so.'' Hope so. \nWhat an outrageous thing to say from the halls of government, the high \nhalls of government. I hope so. I hope that unemployment goes up, says \nshe, so she might have a chance to win office. How cruel that statement \nis.\n  Make no mistake, if the United States Treasury runs out of cash next \nweek, the principal burden will fall on middle-class families. But the \neffects on our total economy will be devastating as well. We may not be \nable to send out Social Security checks to seniors, benefit checks to \nveterans, the people who serve the country. Let's stop paying them? Or \npaychecks to the men and women who now bear our country's uniform in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Sorry, we cannot pay you. Is that what we are \ngoing to say?\n  Interest rates could rise almost immediately, greatly increasing the \ncost of mortgages, car loans, student loans, credit cards, you name it. \nIf middle-class Americans think their 401(k) plan suffered during the \nWall Street crisis a few years ago, imagine what will happen to the \nmarkets if the U.S. Government cannot pay its bills, or redeem bonds \nthat are ordinarily turned in for cash.\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\n  A default will lead to increased job losses at a time when we are \nstill emerging from a recession and 14 million people are now out of \nwork. And those are the relatively short-term impacts. A default crisis \nwill damage our reputation, our credit standing around the world. It \nwill call into question America's credibility, stability, financial \nleadership. It will make our bonds and our currency less attractive to \ninvestors, and we may never recover the exalted status of our financial \ninstrument.\n  But in response to this looming crisis, our friends, the Republicans, \nare digging their trenches deeper and offering little but circuitous \nroutes to avoid a more serious plan to resolve this situation. Their \nlatest trick is to propose a short-term debt limit. That increase will \nleave us in the exact same position 6 months from now so they will have \nanother opportunity to make political mischief.\n  Imagine. Imagine. All types of tricks, all kinds of devices to try \nand cut short something that can be dealt with and left behind. Let's \ncontinue trying to solve the serious problems that our country has.\n  The Boehner plan poses the same grave risk to our economy as default. \nCNN reported that the Boehner plan would probably still lead to a \ndowngrade of the United States credit rating. Christian Cooper, head of \nU.S. dollar derivatives trading at Jefferies and Company, said--he is \nan authority:\n\n       From the markets' point of view, a two-stage plan is a non-\n     starter. . . . There is significant risk of a downgrade with \n     a deal that ties further cuts to another vote only a few \n     months down the road.\n\n  It is time for the Republicans to remember that all of our citizens \nare entitled to be heard, not just the wealthy ones, not just the \nmillionaires, the billionaires, the tea partiers and the powerful, \nbecause they have positions that get attention when they make phone \ncalls here.\n  Inherent in our responsibilities is our obligation to preserve our \nstrength as a democratic society. It is time to get serious. No more \nsleight of hand. Honest discourse is essential. The other day we were \nreminded--I describe my own reaction. Shock. They had a picture of \nlovely looking young people walking away from daddy's airplane that \nthey had--whether it is a charter or owned I do not know--to go to \ncamp. I did well in business. I ran a big company. I got there because \nI got the GI bill to help me. The GI bill helped me start a company \nwith two other fellows that now has 45,000 employees--45,000 jobs--\nbecause I was able to get an education under the GI bill. It was \nfantastic. So when I see what is being prized as a front-page picture \nin the New York Times of this child, looked like a lovely child walking \nto camp from daddy's airplane--and to me, I do not object to that. If \nthey make their money the legal, responsible way, they can spend it any \nway they want. But why in the devil would they not want to contribute \nsomething to the underpinnings of this country? I do not understand it. \nWhy is there resistance from those who have made so much that they can \nhave yachts and airplanes and this and that? It is said sometimes here \nclass warfare is what we are witnessing. Class warfare.\n\n  The warfare comes from the top down, because average citizens, those \nwho work for a living, those whose jobs right now are often insecure, \nthose who watch their 401(k), their precious savings maybe dwindling as \na result of a negative change in the marketplace--saying to young \npeople and their families, sons and daughters who have the capacity to \nlearn: I wish that I could afford--says dad or mom--to send you to the \nright kind of a school that your ability suggests you can handle, but \nwe cannot afford it--we do a disservice to that family. We do a \ndisservice to country when those things happen. So I do not understand \nwhy those who have so much, made not by their own ingenuity exclusively \nbut made by the fact that we have a foundation in this society of \npeople who want to go to work every day and do the right thing. That is \nwhat holds up this facility of ours. I am not talking about the \nbuilding, I am talking about the facility this country has.\n  You cannot build a house from the ceiling down, from the chimney \ndown, and you cannot build a society from the top down. You need the \nunderpinnings. You need those people who bring their skills daily to \nwork and hold out hope for their children to succeed. That is what we \nneed. We need a regeneration of the spirit in this country of ours.\n  But it is not going to happen when the Republicans' dominant view is: \nNo, let's get Obama. That is what we have to do. Foul play. It is \nalmost like desertion. I wore the country's uniform proudly, and that \nis what we are talking about, loyalty to country. It says we need \neverybody to participate. We are not going to get it with the foul \nschemes that are being proposed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders.)

Mr. President, Senator Whitehouse and I have come to the \nfloor today to pay tribute to Governor Bruce Sundlun. He passed away \nlast Thursday. He was an extraordinary gentleman.\n  I think it is particularly appropriate that my colleague is here \nalong with me because he was the director of policy for Governor \nSundlun, and many of the achievements in the Sundlun administration \nwere directly attributed to Senator Whitehouse's extraordinary efforts.\n  Today, I am here, first, as a Rhode Islander to say on behalf of the \npeople of my State how much we appreciate the leadership, vision, and \ndetermination of Governor Bruce Sundlun. He was elected in the middle \nof the worst financial crisis in the history of our State since the \nGreat Depression--a collapse of the private credit union system. He got \nthrough that crisis as only he could. Then he went on to reconstruct \nour airport, to reform our workers' compensation system, and to make \nlasting contributions to the people of Rhode Island.\n  So I come to salute an extraordinary Governor. I also come as a \ncolleague in government. When Governor Sundlun was elected to the \nstatehouse in 1990, I was elected to my first term in the Congress. I \nwas there to observe his extraordinary intellect, determination, skill, \nand his relentless commitment to doing his best to help the people of \nRhode Island. I saw it firsthand.\n  Truly, without Bruce's leadership, we would not have weathered the \nfinancial crisis of 1991 in Rhode Island. His extraordinary grasp of \nthe financial details, his unwavering determination to do the right \nthing, not the popular thing, and his ability to withstand withering \ncriticism from all quarters resulted not only in the restitution of the \nsavings of thousands of Rhode Islanders, but essentially the repayment \nof the moneys that had to be borrowed to take care of the crisis. It \nwas extraordinary work. Frankly, I think everybody in Rhode Island \nrapidly conceded that only Bruce Sundlun could have done it.\n  I also come here, like Bruce, as a veteran of our Armed Forces, but \nunlike Bruce, who was a combat veteran. Bruce joined the U.S. Army and \nqualified as a pilot in the Air Corps in World War II. He was brave. He \nwas tough. He led his crew with great distinction on numerous bombing \nraids over occupied Europe. In one of those raids, he was shot down. Of \ncourse, he had the presence of mind to keep the aircraft as steady as \nhe could to let crewmen escape.\n  Finally, at the last moment, he himself parachuted to Earth. He was \nbehind enemy lines without any weapons except his determination, his \ncourage, and his determination, again, not only to survive but to \nreturn to the fight.\n  Through an amazing series of breathtaking episodes that read like a \nnovel, Bruce would go from village to village and seek out the priests \nin the French village, or Belgian village. He would\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\nsay in fluent French that he was an American flier and needed their \nhelp. He always received their help. He would be given assistance and \nwould be hid for a while. He told me with his great sardonic smile--\nthat he would find unusual ways to get around. He would go into the \nvillage at market time when the ladies of the village parked their \nbicycles, and he would take one of them and pedal as fast as he could \nto the next village where he could find another bike. So he covered the \nroute through occupied Europe, finally making his way into Switzerland. \nThat was a remarkable bit of courage.\n  After the war Bruce continued to distinguish himself in business, and \nin so many ways. But one thing is that he left a legacy not just to the \npeople of Rhode Island, not just a public record, but he was part of \nthe ``greatest generation'' that left an indelible image on the \nsoldiers, sailors, aviators, and marines who serve today, a fidelity to \nduty, of courage, and of determination to serve and sacrifice on behalf \nof your comrades and your country. That image continues to sustain our \nforces in the field and this great Nation.\n  To Governor Sundlun, to his family, as a Rhode Islander, I thank you. \nAs a colleague in government, I thank you. As someone who was inspired \nby your service to this country, I thank you. May you rest in peace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to follow Rhode \nIsland's distinguished senior Senator with remarks about our friend and \nour former Governor, Bruce Sundlun. As Governor, he served with some of \nour colleagues who are in the Senate today, including Ben Nelson, who \nwas Governor of Nebraska, and Tom Carper who was Governor of Delaware. \nThey served with Bruce, and he was one of those irrepressible \ncharacters they remember very distinctly to this day.\n  Bruce Sundlun had a remarkable Rhode Island life. He was the son of a \njewelry store owner, who was the son of an immigrant watchmaker. It \nturns out that he had real athletic talent. He was a track star, \nbreaking record after record around Rhode Island. It was as a \ncompetitor in that era that he first felt the sting of discrimination \nover being Jewish, and that gave him a lasting characteristic to stick \nup for the underdog.\n  As I mentioned at his funeral service, he was the opposite of a fair-\nweather friend. He became a better friend the stormier the weather got \naround you.\n  He went on, with his great generation, to defend our country and \nfight for freedom around the globe in World War II. He was a pilot of a \nB-17, the Damn Yankee, at a time when the life expectancy for bomber \ncrews over Europe was not very long. Unfortunately, his aircraft was \nshot down and crashed in Belgium. He was able to survive the crash, \nalthough, as the pilot, he was the last living person out. When he went \nback to Belgium years later, people who remembered that day remembered \nbeing astonished at the parachute that appeared out of nowhere just \nabove the ground, just before he hit, just in time to save him. But he \nwas injured and hid in the manner of the purloined letter. He hid in \nplain sight as troops swept the area looking for the survivors of the \nbomber crash. He laid out in the middle of the field in a deep place in \nthe plowed furrow where you could only see him if you got down at the \nend of the furrow and looked.\n  As the Nazi's were poking through the hay bales and prowling through \nthe sheds and looking under whatever they could find, there he lay more \nor less in plain sight. But still, he was shot down on December 1, \n1943. You can imagine how cold it was lying in that field in Belgium \nwhile the search went on around him for hours. For the rest of his \nlife, he hated the cold. There was no weather that was too warm for \nhim.\n  I remember when First Lady Hillary Clinton came to speak in Rhode \nIsland when he was Governor, he was wearing this enormous black \nsheepskin coat--very thick and warm--as he prepared to step outside of \nthe statehouse and go out on the stone deck looking out over downtown \non a cold winter afternoon. Mrs. Clinton started needling him and \nsaying how Jack Kennedy didn't need a coat and it was not really very \nfashionable and people would question how tough he was if he went out \nwith this big coat on.\n  So he ended up taking off the coat. He went outside into the bitter \ncold, made the introduction of the First Lady, turned to welcome her to \nthe podium, and out she came with a smile from ear to ear wearing his \ncoat. He loved that kind of exchange with people. I think he immensely \nloved the Clintons. He was one of the first Governors--if not the \nfirst--to endorse President Clinton, and the Clintons never forgot it.\n\n  Bruce did not get to Switzerland until May 5, 1944. He spent 156 days \nas an American Jewish bomber pilot behind Nazi lines in Belgium and \nFrance. No greater testament to this man's resourcefulness and drive \ncould be imagined than succeeding for that long in that circumstance.\n  When he came back from the war, he went to Harvard Law School and \nbecame an attorney at the Department of Justice. He was an assistant to \na Rhode Islander who became Attorney General, J. Howard McGrath. He \nbegan a successful career in the law. It was also at a time when \nPresident Kennedy came to office representing that ``greatest \ngeneration''--then a new generation--and he trusted Bruce Sundlun to \nrun his inaugural parade, which was the kind of logistics feat that \nGovernor Sundlun loved.\n  The fact that it snowed like crazy the night before didn't phase him \na bit. The entire parade went off on schedule and without incident, as \nplanned, in very inclement weather because Bruce prepared so well in \nadvance.\n  He was appointed to the board of COMSAT by President Kennedy. He was \nthe longest serving director of COMSAT, a public-private partnership \nthat helped open the skies to the space age. His business career was \nremarkable. He took a foundering airline, called Executive Jet, and \nturned it into the largest private and charter airline in the country. \nHe took a department store in downtown urban Providence, at a time when \nNew England cities were in decline, at a time when cities across the \ncountry were losing ground to the suburbs that were sprouting up around \nthem--he took this dying business, I guess you would say, and he saw in \nthat downtown department store a media empire. He went off and began \nbuying radio stations and TV stations and created this remarkable \ncompany, the Outlet Corporation, as a media empire. He also turned it \ninto a refuge from time to time.\n  In the blizzard of 1978, the State of Rhode Island was clobbered by \nsnow. People were trapped downtown for hours and hours, in some cases \ndays. He saw to it that the Outlet Company stayed open, that the \ncafeteria kept serving, and that the department store that sold \nclothing gave clothing to whoever needed it. The part of the store that \nsold bedding was spread all over the store so people could sleep on the \nbedding. He responded to a crisis better than anybody I know. It \nbrought out his best characteristics, which were certainly necessary \nwhen he was elected Governor, because on the very first day of his \nadministration, he was obliged to close more than 30 different lending \ninstitutions across Rhode Island, serving more than 300,000 of Rhode \nIsland's 1 million population.\n  He went from being sworn in, to the receiving line where he greeted \nall his happy supporters and all the welcoming officials and the well-\nwishers who came from Rhode Island, and rolled immediately from that \ninto a press conference in which he announced they had to close these \ninstitutions because the deposit insurance provider ended up having \nbeen crooked and had failed and they could not operate without deposit \ninsurance. So they had to be closed. That was a heck of a way to start \na governorship.\n  He also found out that he had inherited the biggest budget deficit \nthe State had ever seen, and we could never find a State with a bigger \npercentage deficit than he inherited. The compensation system melted \ndown, and every worker's compensation insurer said: I am leaving the \nState.\n  A lesser person might have failed under all that pressure. Not only \ndid Bruce meet all of those exigencies of the moment, he also worked \nvery hard to set a better ethical tone and restructured our State \ngovernment so that it would be lasting because most of those things \nwent wrong because of failures\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\nin ethics in the Rhode Island State Government.\n  That was a pretty remarkable added accomplishment on top of solving \nall those underlying problems. He had confidence in Rhode Island and in \nAmerica, and we were in a terrible recession. So he went to work and \ngot things done. He built a new airport terminal, he got a new mall \nstarted that would be built, he built a new hotel that allowed for the \nconvention center to go forward and so he built a new convention \ncenter. He changed the skyline of Providence. He moved one of our \nuniversities to a downtown campus. He understood that in times of \neconomic distress, activity was good and positive activity that brought \njobs was better still.\n\n  In his personal characteristics, he was a remarkable individual. He \nwas relentless, determined, and decisive when issues were presented to \nhim. With his staff, he was demanding and abrupt and terse. I asked him \nonce why he didn't bother to say hello. When a person got a phone call \nfrom him, he just started talking at them, and when the conversation \nwas over, he hung up without saying goodbye or any pleasantries. I \nsaid: Don't you think it would go a little further if you said hello \nand goodbye in your telephone conversations? He said: How much time do \nyou think I would waste in my entire life? Add up all the times you \nhave wasted saying hello and goodbye. Doesn't do anything that is \nproductive. He had that kind of attitude. But he was bold and he was \nwilling to take big leaps. I guess, back to his early days as a broad \njumper, he was willing to take big, big leaps.\n  As a staff person, he was extraordinary to work for. I have told the \nstory of opening day. A few of us were in on that news, but it had to \nbe very closely held because it would have created a run on all those \nbanks if word had leaked. So even many of his staff people had no idea \nthis was going on until he announced it. So that was kind of a shocker \nand made for an interesting time to be a staff person.\n  On another occasion, he had a couple of raccoons on his property and \nthey were bothering a den of baby foxes. He didn't want the baby foxes \nto be killed by the raccoons, so he took out a shotgun, went down to \nthe end of his property and shot the two raccoons. He then climbed in \nthe car with his State trooper and headed off to work and, of course, \nhe described the exciting episode of his morning and the trooper said \nto him: Governor, don't you realize it is against the law to fire off a \nweapon in the city of Newport? In his customarily brusque and decisive \nway, he said: Well, take me to the courthouse.\n  A trial was going on in the Newport County Courthouse, but into the \ntrial walks the Governor and he interrupts the trial and tells the \njudge: I would like to plead guilty. The judge, thankfully, said: I am \nnot going to accept your plea, I am doing something else right now. \nPlus, you don't have the benefit of counsel. To which he tartly \nresponded: I am as good a lawyer as there is in Rhode Island. The judge \nresponded: Well, a lawyer who is representing himself has a fool for a \nclient, and on your client's behalf, I tell you I will not accept that \nplea.\n  So there is the Governor's staff. The phone rings and the message is: \nYour boss is in court trying to plead guilty to a criminal offense. One \ncan imagine how that lights up a staff's day. So down we went to help \ntake care of that.\n  Another day saw the arrival of his daughter. When he was elected \nGovernor, Sundlun had three sons--Tracy, Stuart, and Peter. It turned \nout there was also a daughter, and at age 16--in midterm--Kara arrived \nand was recognized as Bruce's daughter from a relationship he had years \nbefore. She was taken into the family and is now--and was to the end of \nhis days--as beloved as any of his sons.\n  But that was an exciting day for staff members, when suddenly the \nboss turns up with a brandnew 16-year-old daughter nobody knew about \nbefore.\n  He had five wives, in addition to those four children. He led a rich, \nfull, exciting, passionate life, and I miss him very much. He died on \nThursday. He died very peacefully, with his family around him. He was \n91 years old. I think he probably put about 151 years of living into \nthose 91 years, and he left a family who loved him, a State he had \nserved incredibly well, and staff members who had their lives changed \nby their exposure to this remarkable, hard-driving, affectionate, bold \nman.\n  We are in Washington, as I close, and we are in a situation in which \none party is holding the economic future of the country hostage in \norder to force changes the American public doesn't want, wouldn't vote \nfor, and wouldn't accept if they were consulted on them. But by virtue \nof having, in effect, a gun to the head of the economy, they want to \nforce these things, such as killing off the Medicare Program.\n  Americans are wildly opposed to that in huge numbers, and when they \nfound out that was in the House Republican budget, they rejected it by \n4-to-1 margins. The response to that was to bring back something called \ncut, cap, and balance, which had hidden beneath the slogan an even \nworse cut to Medicare. They didn't learn their lesson the public didn't \nwant this, so they insisted on doing even worse and doing it by holding \nthe economy hostage.\n  That is the kind of thing Governor Sundlun would not accept. He was, \nfirst and foremost, a patriot. As hard as he worked and as much as he \nchallenged everyone around him, he always had the purpose of making \nAmerica better, making America stronger, making Rhode Island better, \nmaking Rhode Island stronger, and building toward the future. He had \nincredible confidence. The notion of holding an economy hostage and \nthreatening the well-being of people to force down their throats \nsomething they would not want would be completely alien to his \npatriotic character, and it makes me miss him a lot as we are trapped \nin this day.\n  The other party appears to be, in large part, acquiescing to this. \nGovernor Sundlun's streak of willfulness and determination to do the \nright thing, I think, is missed on the other side of the aisle as much \nas his patriotism and desire to put the well-being of people first is \nmissed on the first. So he was a man whose life and accomplishments \nmade a great difference in Rhode Island and have great relevance and \nresonance as we stand here today.\n  As I said, I miss him very much. He was very important to me, and I \nwish we had his forceful, patriotic, buoyant, and determined spirit \nwith us today.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned in my remarks the speech I gave on behalf \nof Governor Sundlun, which was delivered at his funeral service. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record those remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nEulogy for Governor Bruce Sundlun as Delivered by U.S. Senator Sheldon \n                   Whitehouse, Sunday, July 24, 2011\n\n       What a man. What a life.\n       Bruce Sundlun's accomplishments--as a record-breaking \n     athlete, as a resourceful war hero, as a superb lawyer, as a \n     successful business entrepreneur, and as political leader of \n     our state--would each on their own be significant. You could \n     probably write a book about each. Together, packed all into \n     one energetic life, it makes Bruce Sundlun one of the most \n     accomplished and remarkable men in our state's history.\n       And that's not even counting five marriages, four children, \n     three unsuccessful runs for governor, two dead raccoons, and \n     one long escape on the loose, behind enemy lines.\n       There's really just no way to fit it all in.\n       Let me step into my role as a Sundlun staffer, and ask you \n     to think just of his brief four years as governor. Hit (on \n     Day One of his administration) by an unprecedented bank \n     failure affecting 300,000 Rhode Islanders, and by the worst \n     budget deficit in state history, and by an implosion of the \n     state's entire worker's compensation system, and with the \n     urgent need to restore ethics in government, Bruce was the \n     man for that moment, and swung into his customary decisive \n     action.\n       The budget was promptly and fairly balanced and the whole \n     budget process improved.\n       Inventive solutions to repay the depositors and clean up \n     the RISDIC mess were found and implemented, and those at \n     fault were made to pay--over a hundred million dollars.\n       His worker's compensation reform moved the state from an \n     embarrassment to a model, moving what was then the business \n     community's worst problem completely off the problem list for \n     now going on 20 years.\n       As a problem solver, he had no peer.\n       And that alone would be pretty extraordinary. But there was \n     that ethics gap. So Bruce wrote Executive Order 91-One, the \n     ethics executive order that succeeding governors renewed \n     virtually unchanged. He reformed our Ethics Commission. He \n     changed the way we appoint judges, to reduce the politics. He \n     changed the way we fund elections, with a public finance plan \n     and donor limits.\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\n     Through an intense storm of legal and political opposition, \n     he opened up the pension records; putting an end forever to \n     backroom special pension bills. He got our State Police \n     nationally accredited.\n       He even cleaned up the Capitol literally!\n       All that was extraordinary--but still not enough.\n       In the worst economic times the state had seen since the \n     Depression, with a shrinking budget, he decided to extend \n     universal health care to children--and started the program \n     that became Rite Care. Against immense opposition, he built \n     our new airport terminal. He embarked on the Westin Hotel, \n     the Convention Center, and the Providence Place Mall. He \n     finished the Jamestown Bridge and built the Expressway. And \n     even that's not the end of it.\n       It was an amazing burst of activity. I will bet that almost \n     every Rhode Islander, almost every day, is somehow touched by \n     something Governor Sundlun did.\n       And through it all, he drove his staff crazy. He was \n     irrepressible, impatient, imperial, unscriptable, combative, \n     frustrating, willful, constantly threw caution to the winds, \n     impossible to keep up with--he drove us nuts.\n       And we loved him.\n       We loved him because he was bold and brave, and was warm-\n     hearted and trusting and generous, and because he was willing \n     to throw caution to the winds to do what was right. We loved \n     him because he never once had us make excuses or try to shift \n     the blame.\n       That was not his style. ``Never complain; never explain.''\n       We all remember his Bruce-isms:\n       ``Always touch base with those concerned before taking \n     action.''\n       ``How fast would you get it done if the Russians were in \n     South Attleboro?''\n       ``When you've won, stop talking, close your briefcase and \n     leave.''\n       ``Message to Garcia.''\n       ``Who, what, where, when; don't bother me with why.''\n       The phone calls, at all hours, that began with no ``hello'' \n     and ended with dial tone.\n       The road shows known to his staff as ``Dome on the Roam,'' \n     or more precisely, ``Bruce on the Loose.''\n       And sometimes just that big foxy grin.\n       We saw that his qualities of friendship and loyalty had an \n     almost physical force; that he had your back even if you made \n     mistakes (no one ever was thrown under the bus); and that he \n     was a better friend the more the chips were down.\n       Politics is full of fair weather friends; Bruce Sundlun was \n     your stormy weather friend. Politics is full of people who \n     take tiny cautious steps with their finger up constantly \n     testing the winds; Bruce stepped boldly down the path he \n     thought was right, even if that meant stepping right in it.\n       People wonder what lives on after they die. Well, Bruce, we \n     do. And every one of us has been changed: made better, and \n     stronger, harder-working and more resourceful, by your \n     vibrant elemental force in our lives.\n       We've gone on to be judges and lawyers, to run state and \n     federal agencies, to become Senators and councilmen and \n     Lieutenant Governors, banking leaders and senior partners in \n     national accounting firms, but none of us ever will be more \n     proud of anything than the simple title: ``I was a Sundlun \n     staffer.''\n       Soozie and Marjorie, Tracey and Stuart and Peter and Kara: \n     Thank you. Thank you for sharing your husband and father with \n     our state. For those who loved and were changed by him, I \n     thank you. For those who knew and were touched by him, I \n     thank you. And for those who never knew him directly, but \n     whose lives are better today because of what he did, I thank \n     you.\n       As I close, I want to take you back to a scene from that \n     wonderful movie I saw as a kid, ``To Kill A Mockingbird.'' As \n     you'll recall, Atticus Finch takes on the courageous but \n     unpopular defense of a black man wrongfully accused of rape. \n     At the end of the trial, Atticus's daughter Scout--proper \n     name Jean Louise--is up in the gallery of the courtroom, with \n     the black townspeople, who aren't allowed down on the regular \n     courtroom floor. The courtroom floor empties, but they \n     remain, and slowly stand. As Atticus packs his papers \n     together, closes his bag, and walks out, an elderly man leans \n     down to the little girl and says, ``Stand up, Miss Jean \n     Louise. Your father's passing.''\n       At the end of this service, as Bruce is taken to his \n     gravesite after 91 years of a life well and fully lived, we \n     will all stand up. And rightly so. A governor will be \n     passing.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S4995-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4995-S4996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there are currently two bills headed for \na vote to raise the debt ceiling and to reduce spending. One of those \ntwo bills from the House, Speaker Boehner's, cuts about $1 trillion in \nspending and raises the debt ceiling by $1 trillion until the end of \nthe year, approximately. That is about how long it would take to run up \nanother $1 trillion in debt. The other bill from Senate Majority Leader \nReid cuts about $1 trillion and raises the debt ceiling about $3 \ntrillion--or past the 2012 election. This is because the President said \nemphatically just a few days ago at a press conference:\n\n       The only bottom line I have is that we have to extend this \n     debt ceiling through the next election, into 2013.\n\n  So it is really quite simple. Speaker Boehner's bill lives up to the \nprinciple that I thought we had all agreed to: that every $1 in debt \nceiling increase should be tied to a $1 reduction in spending. The \nspenders get an advantage since the spending reductions occur over 10 \nyears, whereas the debt ceiling would increase immediately. But that is \nthe principle on which we have been operating.\n  Senator Reid's bill is a hoax. It uses Washington gimmicks designed \nto make it look three times as large as it is. In reality, it hikes the \ndebt ceiling $3 for every $1 in spending cuts over 10 years. The House \nbill is 1 to 1, the Senate bill is 3 to 1. We have demonstrated this \nexhaustively in a Budget Committee analysis that I don't think people \nwould dispute. And the House approach--one of the primary ways this is \naccomplished is to count the reduction in spending over the war in Iraq \nand Afghanistan that is projected to occur and has already been \nprojected to occur and count that as a spending cut. Speaker Boehner \ndidn't do that. His would look $1 trillion better also if he used those \nnumbers.\n  The House approach is honest, it is straightforward, and it achieves \n$1 in cuts for every $1 in debt ceiling increase. It allows us to \nreturn to the table in a few months to assess our progress, see what is \nhappening in the economy, and begin working toward the greater cuts \nthat are needed.\n  Senator Reid's bill relies on accounting tricks, takes the debt limit \noff the table until after the election, and exchanges a record $3 \ntrillion in debt hike for only one-third as much in debt cuts.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle signed a letter vowing \nto defeat the Boehner plan. I find this a little shocking, frankly, and \nsurprising. Is it the position of the Senate Democratic majority that \n$1 trillion in cuts over 10 years is all we need to achieve between now \nand 2013? Is it their view that $1 in cuts for every $1 in debt limit \nincrease is too steep or is it a political effort to protect the \nPresident by pushing the debt limit ceiling past the next election, \ncreating the highest increase in debt ceiling, I think, in history, \nexcept for perhaps the one that the super Democratic majority in the \nSenate slipped through during the passage of the health care bill? Is \nit this election issue that Democrats would turn down an agreement on \nand put us at risk of financial disruption of our economy?\n  So let's step back for a moment and look at the wider context. \nWashington is often consumed by political fights and blame games. It \ncan be hard to differentiate between facts and talking points. But I \nwould like to provide as honest an assessment as I can as to why we \nfind ourselves in this unfortunate situation at the eleventh hour.\n  We have a process, a statutory and legal process to arrive at a \nbudget deal every single year. It is written into the law of the United \nStates. The President is required to submit a budget, by law, each \nyear, and each Chamber is required to pass one separately and then \nagree on one together.\n  If the year had begun with a serious budget proposal from the \nPresident, we wouldn't be in this mess today. But he submitted a budget \nthat would double our debt in 10 years, while he claimed it would not \nadd to the debt and he claimed it would cause us to live within our \nmeans. Indeed, he had a substantial tax increase, very real tax \nincreases of significant amounts, but his spending increased even more \nthan that. So the net total of the President's budget was to make the \ndebt trajectory we are on not better but worse, even with the tax \nincrease. Indeed, his budget next year that he submitted proposed \nincreases for the Education Department, the Energy Department, the \nState Department, and the\n\n[[Page S4996]]\n\nTransportation Department--those double-digit increases at a time when \nwe are running the biggest deficit the Nation has ever sustained.\n  Senate Democrats have refused to pass, meanwhile, in this body--pass \nor bring up a budget for 820 days, 2 years. The majority leader said it \nwould be foolish to pass a budget. Foolish to not pass a budget?\n  So these are facts. Our colleagues who run the Senate here have \ndefied the law and sound policy all year long, and now we are paying \nthe price--a last-minute, take-it-or-leave-it, panic vote. Nobody yet \nknows what is going to be in the legislation finally because of the \nrejection of any bill that seems to be out there at this time.\n  If the White House or Senate Democrats had taken the budget process \nseriously last year and if they had presented a single credible plan to \ncut spending, we wouldn't be here at this eleventh hour. Indeed, our \nDemocratic colleagues have insisted on secret meetings that shielded \nthem from making any of their budget plans public, that shielded them \nfrom any real votes on spending and debt, and it appears those meetings \nhave failed.\n  Democrats have campaigned and sought control and a majority in the \nSenate, and they chose, in this time of fiscal crisis, not to engage in \nthe budget process in a serious way. In fact, they are apparently so \ndetermined to avoid the public budget process that the Reid bill even \nincludes language designed to circumvent the process for 2 more years.\n  So you will forgive me if I am a little concerned by all these \nattacks on the tea party. They didn't start this fire; they sounded the \nalarm. Before the last election, when Democrats controlled both \nChambers of Congress by substantial majorities, every conversation was \nabout increasing spending, more, more, more. Congress passed a stimulus \nbill--the largest single onetime expenditure ever passed by any \nCongress or any nation in history, every penny of that borrowed. We \nwere already hugely in debt. We are now borrowing 40 cents of every \ndollar. It passed. The Congress also passed the President's massive new \nhealth care entitlement. It passed the President's request for \nextraordinary increases in discretionary spending. Nondefense \ndiscretionary spending has gone up 24 percent at a time of record \ndeficits in the last 2 years. We have added $4 trillion to our gross \ndebt since the President took office. Just in the time since the Senate \nDemocrats last passed a budget, we have spent more than $7 trillion \nwithout a budget. These are the facts.\n  But after the 2010 election and the emergence of the tea party and \ncommonsense American people who knew better about what is going on in \nWashington, we have finally begun to look at Washington's spending \nproblems. Now, instead of just raising the debt ceiling with no \nspending cuts, as the White House initially and repeatedly demanded, we \nare talking about how to cut some spending.\n  People in the tea party and those who share their concerns should not \nbe the ones vilified. They are good, decent, patriotic Americans whose \nonly crime is rightly fearing for the future of their Nation. Are they \nwrong to be concerned when this Congress spends money willy-nilly every \nday, 40 cents of it borrowed? They know this is not right, and that is \nthe kind of message they have sent to us. We need to listen to the \nheart of America speaking.\n  The last point I would like to make is about the issue of compromise. \nThere have been suggestions that the Republicans have simply been \nunwilling to budge from their position. But the Boehner proposal \nrepresents only a small portion of the cuts the Republicans have \nadvocated and that they believe should be achieved. This is truly a \ncritical point and one the White House will not acknowledge. The House \nbudget that they passed, a long-term 10-year budget that would change \nthe debt trajectory of America and put us on a sound financial course \nin a responsible way, cuts $6 trillion in comparison to the President's \nrequest. The Toomey budget the Senate voted on cuts about $8 trillion. \nThe House passed a plan, which I cosponsored, that not only cuts and \ncaps spending but that requires the passage of a constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment. In fact, all 47 Republican Senators have \ncosponsored a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n\n  The $1 trillion in cuts Speaker Boehner is asking for would be, \nindeed, a modest first step, an effort to compromise and reach a number \nthat had a realistic chance of passing this body. But under his plan we \nwill return to the table after that $1 trillion increase in the debt \nceiling has been used. This is far from the level of savings I wish to \nsee, or the Republican House wishes to see. One trillion dollars is a \nbitter pill for a lot of those Members who know it is not enough. The \neconomists and others and bondholders are telling us we need at least \n$4 trillion. That just reduces the crisis nature we are in. That would \nnot come close to putting us on a path to a balanced budget over 10 \nyears. Reducing deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years when our deficits \nare going to increase by $9 trillion to $13 trillion over 10 years \nobviously does not solve our debt crisis. But $1 trillion is even much \nsmaller. That was a figure that was believed that this Senate might \naccept, so the House Members, in order to avoid a debt crisis and a \nfinancial crisis over the debt ceiling, are apparently working hard and \nmaybe they will send it over here, I don't know. They are working hard \nto try to do that. I think that is a reasonable compromise and a fair \napproach to this Congress.\n  We are going to spend around $45 trillion over the next 10 years. \nThat will add as much as $13 trillion to the gross debt. It is clear we \nhave a lot more work to do. We are going to be fighting for cuts in \nspending bills, omnibus bills, continuing resolutions, and in every \nother place we can to impose fiscal discipline on this country. We must \ncontrol spending. We must control and conquer the debt.\n  The President said he wants a balanced approach to the deficit--a \nbalanced approach. But a balance is not a tax hike that bails out the \nbig spenders who surged our spending with stimulus bills and surging \n24-percent increases in discretionary spending. He is going to bail \nthem out by raising taxes. We should never have run up that kind of \nspending. But balance is not a tax hike of that kind. Creating real \nbalance, the right balance, means shifting power away from Washington, \nplacing it in the safe hands of the American people. That is what the \nvoters said last year when they gave a shellacking to the big spenders \nand that is what we should do now, and that is what I will be working \nfor and I believe a lot of other people in the Congress on both sides \nof the aisle will be working for.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last January--probably late in the month \nI think it was--it occurred to me that as we proceeded in the direction \nof approaching the statutory limit of our borrowing as a government, \nthe discussion was becoming a little bit counterproductive in some \nrespects. One, in particular, was this constant threat we would default \non the loans we had taken out as a government, the bonds that were held \nby millions of Americans, and that a default would have cataclysmic \nrepercussions. It occurred to me that this is an unproductive \ndiscussion, in part, because no such default was ever going to happen. \nCertainly, it didn't need to happen. In the event we didn't raise the \ndebt limit upon reaching it or prior to that, we would have enough \nongoing tax revenue to cover the debt service by many multiples.\n  So I introduced legislation that would clarify this. It would take \nthis risk off the table and try to provide some clarity to markets and \nto senior citizens who are savers and who have invested their savings \nin Treasurys and to have a constructive and honest debate about what \nthe implications are of reaching the debt limit without raising it. So \nI introduced a bill that would instruct the Treasury Secretary to \nprioritize debt service in the event we\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\ndidn't raise the debt limit upon reaching it.\n  Unfortunately, the idea was dismissed by the administration. It was \nderided. It was castigated. It was described as reckless and \nirresponsible and unworkable. This idea of prioritizing the payments we \nwould make if we didn't raise the debt ceiling was dismissed out of \nhand.\n  Now we have two reports that have come out this week. One cites the \nfact that senior Treasury officials have been calling around to big \nbanks assuring them that in the event we don't raise the debt ceiling, \nwhich we will hit within just a few days, Treasury is assuring the \nbanks there will be no default; they have this covered, and they have \ntaken care of this. The scheduled interest and principal payments on \nour bonds will occur on schedule.\n  It is nice that the administration is informing the banks of this. I \nthink it would be nicer still if they would inform the American public \nand everybody who has such an important stake in ensuring that the U.S. \nGovernment not default on its debt. So that was the first report.\n  The second report came out just late last night--and it has been \nconfirmed today--which is that the Treasury has, in fact, been working \non a plan of the very nature they have been deriding and denying for \nmany months now; that they, in fact, have been developing and are \ncontinuing to refine a plan to prioritize the payments that will be \nmade in the event the debt limit is not raised by August 2.\n  I am glad they have finally come to this conclusion. I wish they had \napproached Congress and worked with us constructively many months ago \nwhen I first suggested we ought to have a plan B, but I would say it is \nbetter late than never. But now I think we ought to get this plan, such \nas it is, exposed to the sunshine of public discourse. We ought to \nunderstand what this process will be and Congress ought to have a role \nin it.\n  That is why I introduced an updated version of this bill last week. I \nhave 33 Senate cosponsors on the bill. The purpose of the bill is not \nto be a substitute for raising the debt limit. I understand if we don't \nraise the debt limit close to August 2, the results will be very \ndisruptive. We can minimize that disruption if we have a game plan, and \nwe ought to work this out. The bill I introduced with a number of \ncolleagues is a bill that identifies three very high priorities, that \nwe ought to make sure we make these payments, whether or not we raise \nthe debt ceiling. We know we will have enough money to do so, and I \nthink we have an obligation to do that.\n  The three categories embodied in our bill are, first, interest on our \ndebt. By making sure we make those payments we avoid a catastrophic \ndefault and we avoid the financial consequences which could be very \ndire. So that ought to be one of the top priorities. The second, \nequally important, is making sure we send out all the Social Security \nchecks in full and on time to everybody who has one coming. Senior \ncitizens all across America, including my parents, depend on Social \nSecurity checks, and they have earned those benefits by virtue of the \ncontributions they made into that system, in many cases, for many \ndecades.\n  The third and final item I think ought to be prioritized in the event \nwe don't raise the debt ceiling by August 2 is salaries paid to Active-\nDuty military. I think the men and women who are risking their lives \nfor all of us deserve to have the peace of mind of knowing that their \nfamilies back home will not have to wait until Congress gets its act \ntogether for them to get their paycheck in arrears. It ought to be done \non time.\n  So these three items, if we add them all and look at the amount they \nwould cost during the month of August and we compare that to the tax \nrevenue that is going to come in the door in August, these three \nexpenses are less than half the amount of tax revenue that is going to \ncome in. Clearly, and obviously, this is easily manageable--or easily \naffordable, I should say.\n  Technically, the Treasury and the Fed have some work to do, no doubt, \nto make sure this is all done smoothly. That is precisely why they \nshould have engaged with us a long time ago, so we could have had a \nconstructive period of time to work out whatever details are necessary \nso we could have as smooth a functioning process as possible--one that \nwould have the benefit of a transparent debate.\n  I acknowledge there might be other items that ought to be added to \nthe list, and we ought to have a debate on the floor to consider those \nitems. What we would end up with is a process that the American people \nwould understand, they would know, they could anticipate, and it would \nbe far more constructive. It is getting late in the day, but maybe it \nis not too late. I hope this body will take up my bill and it will have \nthat debate, we will have some kind of resolution, and we will provide \nsome guidance. I think it is part of our constitutional obligation to \nhave control over spending that occurs in our government, and this \nshould be no exception.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. If my \ncolleagues have constructive suggestions of how we can make it better, \nI welcome them, as I welcome working with the Treasury and the \nadministration, to make sure that we, in the unfortunate event--if it \nshould occur--that we don't raise the debt ceiling by August 2, do \neverything we can to minimize the disruption that will follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S4997-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4997-S4999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in 1939, we passed a law and the law \ncreated the debt ceiling. Before that law was passed, whenever the \nGovernment of the United States of America wanted to borrow money, it \nhad to come to Congress. Congress had to approve it and the President \nwould sign it. We decided then to change it. Instead, we said Congress \nwill approve a certain amount of money that the President can borrow \nand we will change it as needed. In other words, we don't have to \napprove every single bond issue, every single borrowing of the Federal \nGovernment. In 1939, that is what we did.\n  Since then, on 89 different occasions, Presidents of the United \nStates have come to Congress and said the money Congress spent I have \nto borrow to cover. We don't have enough in the Treasury. Eighty-nine \ndifferent times Presidents have come and asked for the authority to \nborrow money to cover expenses Congress approved. Fifty-five times \nRepublican Presidents; 34 times Democratic Presidents. Not once--not \nonce--did we ever default. Oh, there was a period, I think in 1979, \nwhere there were a few days of technical default, but there was never \nany conscious decision by Congress not to fund this debt ceiling and \nextend it.\n  It is ironic that Members of the Senate have come to the floor and \nsaid: I will never vote to extend the debt ceiling as long as I serve \nin the Senate. They are the same Members of the Senate who have been \nvoting for and sending to this President requests to spend money. An \nexample: the war in Afghanistan. Some of the most conservative Senators \non the other side of the aisle not only want us to wage this war but to \nstay there and keep spending money. Do we know what it costs? It costs \n$10 billion a month for us to protect our troops in Afghanistan. For \nevery $1 we spend--every $1 we spend--whether it is on the war, on food \nstamps, on missiles, on highways--but for every $1 we spend, we borrow \n40 cents. We should not be borrowing all this money, but we do because \nCongress says there are certainly things we have to do as a nation.\n\n  Many of the same Senators who have said to the President of the \nUnited States: Do not withdraw the troops from Afghanistan, keep them \nthere even longer, are now coming to the floor and saying to the \nPresident: But we are not going to join in asking for the authority you \nneed to provide that money for those troops.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has come here the second day and given \nhis take on what would happen if Congress fails to extend the debt \nceiling on August 2-5 days away, August 2. What would happen?\n  First, understand, this is a self-inflicted wound. We have created \nthis crisis. Madam President, 89 times we have extended the debt \nceiling without incident. Presidents of both parties have asked for \nthis over and over.\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\n  Who holds the record for extending the debt ceiling the most during \nhis 8-year Presidency? Ronald Reagan. Eighteen times--18 times--more \nthan twice a year, he asked Congress to extend the debt ceiling because \nunder his 8-year watch the debt of the United States tripled.\n  Who holds the record for second place on the list of increasing the \nnational debt? President George W. Bush, who, I believe, came to us \nseven or nine times asking to extend the debt ceiling.\n  It has been done by Presidents of both parties.\n  Now there is this controversy that is raging between the House and \nthe Senate about whether we extend the debt ceiling. It is a vote we \nhave done customarily without this confrontation in the past. Now we \nface it. But we have created this crisis. It is a self-inflicted wound, \nand to blame anybody else for it is just plain wrong. History tells us \nCongress not only has the authority but, I believe, has the \nresponsibility to extend the debt ceiling. It is hypocritical to pass \nbills on the floor of the Senate--to call for the President to wage a \nwar or build a building--and then not give this President the authority \nto borrow the money to do it. That is what I am hearing from the other \nside.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania comes and says: We can live with this \ndefault. We have to figure out how to manage this default. I think he \nsaid at one point it could be managed easily. Wrong, completely wrong.\n  Let me tell you what happens if we default on the national debt for \nthe first time in history. First, what does it do to the reputation of \nthe United States of America? We have a credit report too. I do not \nknow if you can get a free credit report for the government, but we \nhave one. We have a AAA rating. Pretty good, right? The best in the \nworld, the strongest economy in the world. It means when we borrow \nmoney, we borrow it at the lowest interest rate because people trust \nthe United States of America to keep its word.\n  If we borrow money and say we are going to pay it back, we have \nalways done it. We have never defaulted. We are pretty trustworthy as a \ndebtor, and creditors understand that and charge us the lowest interest \nrates.\n  If this goes through as promised by the tea party people, and we \ndefault on our national debt, for the first time in history, what do \nyou think it is going to do to our credit status? I can tell you what \nit is going to do. It is going to diminish our credit reputation in the \neyes of lenders. What happens when lenders think it is riskier to loan \nmoney? They raise interest rates. In other words, the money we borrow \nto sustain our government will cost us more. How much more? For every 1 \npercent increase in interest paid by our government on our debt, it \ncosts us $130 billion a year added to the debt. That is not $130 \nbillion worth of money for education or $130 billion worth of money to \nprotect us from terrorism. That is $130 billion to international \nbankers and countries that loan us money from this self-inflicted \nwound.\n  What else would happen? Sadly, when interest rates on our Federal \nGovernment go up, interest rates go up across our economy. It affects \nevery family, every individual, every business in America. It affects \nhow much you pay on your credit card bill, how much you pay for an \nautomobile loan, a home loan, a student loan. All of these are \naffected. It is as bad, if not worse, than a tax because it hits \neverybody.\n  It could not come at a worse time. When our economy is struggling to \ncreate jobs, with millions out of work, to think that this unnecessary, \nmanufactured political crisis, self-inflicted wound is going to hurt \nour economy in its recovery is just plain wrong.\n  Let me go to the specific point made by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. Stay tuned and listen to what he just said. He said to us \nhe has asked our government to tell us how they would manage a \ndefault--who would you pay, who would you fail to pay--and the \ngovernment has not been forthcoming, the President, with a plan on who \nwill be paid and not paid.\n  Well, we will get that plan, and we will not like it one bit. Here is \nwhy. If we do not extend our debt ceiling, in the month of August here \nare the raw numbers we have to work with. We will have $172 billion on \nhand in our Treasury to spend in August, and we will have obligations \nof $306 billion.\n  So what do you do when you have 55 percent of what you need? You make \nchoices. The Senator from Pennsylvania said: Here are my three choices. \nFirst, we pay interest on other debts we have so we do not default on \neverything. That is sensible. Secondly, he said, we pay Social Security \nbecause these folks--many of them--have no other source of income. That \nis sensible too. Then he said we ought to pay our troops in combat and \nthe military. I vote for that too. These men and women are risking \ntheir lives and they should be our highest priority. He says we can \ntalk about the rest.\n  What is the rest? I will tell you what the rest includes. It includes \nevery Medicare payment to every hospital and doctor in America. It \nincludes every payment to a disabled veteran in America. It includes \nthe decision as to whether we are going to fund Federal employees. If \nthey are not your favorite class of people--I happen to think a lot of \nthem, but many people do not--keep in mind some of the things they do \nthat we will have to decide whether we should continue doing.\n  I was at the Greenville Federal Correctional Facility 2 weeks ago. \nThe men and women risking their lives holding people in prison, \nthousands of them across the United States--pay them or not? They were \nnot on the list. They were not on the list of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  We just had a meeting where we talked about our weather satellites \ncollecting information about weather around the world, warning people \nwhen severe weather patterns are developing. Should we pay NOAA to \nmaintain those satellites in orbit?\n  As you go through this list--whether you are talking about the FBI \nfighting terrorism, whether you are talking about the men and women \nrepresenting the United States at embassies around the world, whether \nyou are talking about law enforcement, whether you are talking about \nthe intelligence agencies of the United States that watch on a minute-\nby-minute basis the activities of terrorists who would kill us--they \nwere not on the list from the Senator from Pennsylvania. He did not put \nthose on the list.\n  If we get down to a choice, and if it becomes that terrible a choice, \nunderstand this President--no President--wants to face that. They do \nnot have to. It is time for us to get this resolved.\n  When I call radio shows back in Illinois--and I will bet the \nPresiding Officer gets the same thing back in Missouri--people are fed \nup with what they see going on in Washington. They cannot believe \ngrownups in the House and Senate, paid to do this job, are failing; \nthat they are dragging this out.\n  I will tell you what I got yesterday: an e-mail from a businessman in \nChicago. He is a friend. He has a lot of businesses. He has a lot of \npeople working for him. He had a closing yesterday on a deal worth more \nthan $100 million to renovate a major building in Chicago. It would \nhave been a lot of jobs. It would have been great for our city. The \nclosing was canceled. The parties at the table said: Until Congress \ngets this figured out, we are not going to close the deal.\n\n  He sent me an e-mail and said: For God's sake, when is this going to \ncome to an end?\n  I am hearing that all over from people who are just fed up.\n  The Chicago Tribune printed an article today entitled: ``Across \nstate, businesses fret over debt ceiling showdown.'' They went through \na long list of individuals who talked about what this stalemate might \nmean.\n  As the article states, Ed Wehmer, with Wintrust Financial \nCorporation, ``worries that a prolonged stalemate could lead to a \ndouble-dip recession,'' even more unemployment.\n\n       ``The possibility of not getting a Social Security or other \n     government check will make people skittish,'' Wehmer said. \n     That could weaken consumer spending and hamper economic \n     growth. Higher interest rates, he said, would hit an already \n     stressed real estate market.\n\n  A banker in Lake Forest said: ``Could you imagine if we ran our \nbusiness like that,'' referring to what is going on in Washington. \n``These are the people who make the regulations we have to live with.''\n\n       The Illinois Hospital Association figures that its members \n     will have to absorb $8 billion in federal payment reductions \n     over 10\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\n     years as a result of the 2010 health care overhaul act. Now, \n     [they are] bracing for another blow.\n       ``We're concerned that any additional cuts to hospitals, \n     whether through Medicare or Medicaid, will have a dramatic \n     impact on hospitals and health care providers . . . ''\n\n  The Illinois Finance Authority--all of these groups look at this \nsituation and say: This makes our economy even worse. It is a self-\ninflicted, politically manufactured problem. It is a crisis which does \nnot have to exist. Should we ignore our debt? Of course not.\n  Madam President, you know I have worked on this issue for a year and \na half now with more specificity than ever in my career. I was on the \ndeficit commission the President appointed. Then I stuck around \nafterwards as six Senators--the Group of 6, we called ourselves; it was \nnot a very inspired name, but that is what we came up with: three \nDemocrats and three Republicans--and we sat down for 6 months and \nhammered out an agreement among us to reduce our Federal deficit by $4 \ntrillion over the next 10 years, with a balanced approach that puts \neverything on the table--everything--revenue, entitlements, spending--\neverything.\n  We came to an agreement. We presented our agreement to the Senators \njust 2 weeks ago. Forty-nine Senators showed up at that meeting, \nDemocrats and Republicans. It was amazing. Then we followed up and \nsaid: Are you ready to put your name on the bottom line? Will you \nsupport moving forward with this bipartisan way to deal with the \ndeficit in a responsible way that does not endanger our economy and \nmake us face bankruptcy as a nation?\n  We now have 36 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, who have signed \nup. That is a pretty good number. It shows that this is not an idea \nthat we came up with that does not have legs. Sure, we are going to \nhave to change it. We understand that. But look what happened. \nDemocrats and Republicans sat down--no cameras, no reporters--and \nworked out a reasonable way to deal with the deficit and our Nation's \ndebt.\n  What is better? Lurching from this crisis to another crisis 4 months \nfrom now, as Speaker Boehner suggests, or dealing with this in an \nhonest, bipartisan way today?\n  Madam President, I can tell you what the American people want us to \ndo--at least I think I know what they want us to do. They do not want \nus to endanger this economic recovery. They do not want us to kill \njobs. They do not want us to hurt businesses. They want us to help this \neconomy recover and create jobs. They want us to extend this debt \nceiling so we do not see interest rates going up across America at \nexactly the wrong time. They certainly do not want to see us put in a \nposition where we have to decide between paying Social Security \nrecipients and our soldiers who are in combat. That is what the \nadministration would face if this crisis that has been manufactured on \nCapitol Hill continues.\n  What they expect us to do is to earn our pay as Members of the House \nand Senate, to work hard to come up with a reasonable approach, and to \nbe willing to give a little. It is the only way you reach a compromise. \nCompromise is the nature of this political process. Those who condemn \nit--and there are some who do, who say: Never give up, stick to your \nprinciples, never change--we are not going to get a solution. We have \nto be willing to work together to give and get this done.\n  Here is what I predict is going to happen soon.\n  I predict Speaker Boehner is going to call his bill on the floor of \nthe House. We have told him in advance it is a nonstarter here. If it \npasses the House, it will come here, and it will likely be voted down. \nWe will then propose an alternative.\n  Majority Leader Harry Reid has an alternative which basically extends \nthe debt ceiling beyond next year so our economy has time to recover. \nIt cuts spending by over $2 trillion so we address our deficit. It does \nit with a list of spending cuts that every Republican has voted for so \nit is not controversial in substance. I think that is the best \napproach.\n  He creates a joint committee to deal with the long-term deficit. I \nhave been involved in those, and I think we should. I think it is a \ngood, balanced approach that solves our problem and gets us through \nthis crisis. We are likely to vote on it either tomorrow or the next \nday. But we are down to 5 days. We are running out of time. We have to \nget this done.\n  I want to tell you, any Senator who comes to the floor and says \ndefaulting on our debt and reaching the first point in our history \nwhere the credit reputation of the United States is in doubt is OK, it \nis a good political tactic, they do not understand the gravity of that \ndecision and the impact it will have on businesses and families for \ngenerations to come.\n  This notion that we can pick and choose the checks we are going to \nsend out in August when we are going to have 55 or 60 percent of what \nwe need is going to put us in an impossible position. Deciding among \nall of the valuable, important functions of government which ones will \nnot be funded--that is an impossible position for this President to be \nin. We cannot do that to him. We cannot do that to our government. We \ncannot do this to our country.\n  I hope that after the House votes today or tonight, whenever it may \nbe, that we take up the measure quickly. Let's move this forward. Let's \nget this done. Let's avoid this crisis. Let's meet the responsibility \nwe were elected to address.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Madam President, our greatest Republican President, \nAbraham Lincoln, in his drive to end slavery, said ``a house divided \nagainst itself cannot stand.'' With these few words, Lincoln is calling \nto us through the echoing halls of history. He is calling for us to put \naside our differences and to become unified into one people, one \nNation, one common purpose.\n  Mr. Lincoln recognized that the issue of slavery was tearing this \ngreat Nation apart and that it could not survive half slave and half \nfree. Slavery was the great unfinished business of our Founders. The \ninstitution of slavery was so ingrained in the infant country's past \nand future that even Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Franklin \ncould not disentangle it. I am not trying to equate carrying too much \ndebt with slavery, please understand that, but the truth remains. A \nhouse divided against itself cannot stand.\n  This house, this Nation, this Republic, is divided against itself. \nOur Founders called their effort at establishing a new Nation ``a great \nexperiment''--and it has been. Nothing like it had ever been tried and \nAmerica has been the unequaled success in all of world history. Truly, \nwe are the envy of the world. We began as 13 weak and barely united \nStates but quickly became the strongest country in the Western \nHemisphere. About 70 years after we adopted the Constitution, we \nsurvived a deadly Civil War. All the while we grew in stature and in \nfavor with other nations. Our economic power grew rapidly. American \ninfluence grew as we became the agent of democracy and capitalism for \nthe entire world. Although our military power was slow to develop, we \nfought on the winning side in two world wars and we grew into an \neconomic, military and cultural super power.\n  We are a Nation of immigrants, of many faiths, of many races and our \nnational call to union is E Pluribus Unum. Out of many, one. Out of \nmany States is forged one Nation. Out of many races is forged one \npeople. Out of many, one. The Founding Fathers had to balance the \nagrarian interests of the South and West with the industrial and \nshipping interests of the North and East. They balanced small States \nand big States. They balanced regions dominated by the frontier with \nregions dominated by the old world. They balanced Catholicism and \nProtestantism and Judaism. They balanced English\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\nculture with German culture with French culture. Out of many, one. Had \nprevious generations of leaders not achieved oneness, we would not be, \ncould not be, the great Nation we are today. The Senate was added to \nthe Constitution as a compromise. Washington, DC, was placed on the \nbanks of the Potomac as a compromise. States were added to the union as \nthe result of compromise. In this sense, America's ability to find \ncompromise has always been our pathway to greatness. Our Founders \nestablished this more perfect union with the clear-eyed knowledge that \ncame from experience that a house divided against itself cannot stand.\n  Division leads to failure. To make our democracy work, we all must \nwork together. We must acknowledge that we have differences of opinion \nand differing points of view, but we must commit to unity. The floor of \nthe U.S. Senate is the marketplace for ideas and it is a window into \ndemocracy that is a living testimony to the greatness and diversity of \nour Nation. The floor of the U.S. Senate should not be a graveyard for \nideas or innovation or promise. Campaigns should stop at the threshold \nof this chamber. What happens in this chamber is much greater than any \nsingle Senator's political fortunes, and it is much more important than \na political party's fate at the next general election. We have a sacred \nresponsibility to the people through the Constitution, and if we orient \nourselves to the next presidential election, we are failing in our \nduty. The U.S. Senate, at its core, by its nature, is where decisions \nget made. We have our ideological battles here, that is certain, but \nthis is where consensus should be achieved. The Senate should fuel the \nengine that propels us to a better future, not stall that engine.\n  All Americans should fully participate in our government. We should \nregister to vote and serve on the jury. We must volunteer in the \nschools and pay our taxes. We must teach our children about our \ncountry, their country, and prepare them for their time to lead. We \nmust tell them that our system of government is the best that man ever \ndevised and that it works. It works very well if we allow it to work.\n  This moment in history is a day where we can show our children, as \nwell as our Founding Fathers, that this is no longer a house divided. \nWe can show the world that our parents instilled in us the value of E \nPluribus Unum. America's best days lay ahead if we are mutually \ncommitted to that future. It is, however, not possible unless we set \naside our differences and work together for that common goal. My fellow \nSenators, please heed the words of Abraham Lincoln and understand that \nthere is truth of what he said, ``A house divided against itself cannot \nstand.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me speak for a few minutes about \nthe disappointment I have and I am sure many other colleagues have with \nthe situation we find ourselves in with respect to the partial shutdown \nof the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  My colleague from Colorado, Senator Bennet, was on the Senate floor \nthis afternoon and spoke eloquently about how this partial shutdown is \naffecting his State of Colorado. I wanted to talk briefly about the \nsimilar concerns I have for my State of New Mexico.\n  Frankly, some in this Congress, in my view, have lost sight of what \nthey were elected to do in Washington. Aviation is a critical piece of \nour transportation infrastructure, a critical piece of our economy. \nYet, for nearly a week now, the Congress has failed to extend the \nnecessary authorizations to keep the Federal Aviation Administration \ndoing the work that needs to be done.\n  It has been over 5 months since the Senate passed its reauthorization \nbill for aviation programs. That vote was overwhelming; it was 87 to 8. \nSo this was not a partisan bill; this was a bill supported strongly by \nboth Democrats and Republicans.\n  The bill included a number of programs important to my State of New \nMexico and to the entire Nation, including the Airport Improvement \nProgram that provides grants for the construction of runways, taxiways, \nwhich help to make airports safer. These projects also create hundreds \nof jobs in the construction industry in my State and tens of thousands \nof jobs in the construction industry nationwide.\n  One of the most important features of the Senate's bill relates to \nour air traffic control system. Our current system is universally \nrecognized as being antiquated, inefficient, and increasingly it is \nrecognized as being unsafe. The bill we passed out of the Senate \ndramatically accelerates the FAA's efforts to convert the air traffic \ncontrol system to one based on satellites and global positioning \nsystems, similar to the GPS many of us have in our cars. When \nimplemented, NextGen--the name given to this improvement of the air \ntraffic control system--will improve safety, will increase efficiency \nof operations, will reduce delays, and will save fuel and help to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Thanks to the good work Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member \nHutchison in the Commerce Committee did, the Senate passed a good bill \nto reauthorize aviation programs. That was in February. Then in April, \nthe House passed its own version nearly on a party-line vote. The House \nmajority, unfortunately, chose to include partisan and divisive \nprovisions in that legislation that were not appropriate in an aviation \nbill.\n  Let me give a little description of what those partisan and divisive \nprovisions I am referring to are. There was an editorial in the New \nYork Times this morning that summed it up well. It says:\n\n       Last year, the National Mediation Board changed a rule to \n     make it easier for airline and railroad workers to unionize. \n     Until then, workers who did not vote in union representation \n     elections were counted as ``no'' votes; after the change \n     [this is the change by the National Mediation Board--its own \n     rules] they are counted as abstentions. Pushed by the airline \n     lobby, House Republicans passed a long-term FAA \n     reauthorization bill that would have undone the rule change. \n     The Senate's reauthorization bill, passed in February, \n     maintained the rule.\n\n  In spite of this difference in the two bills, the Senate did appoint \nconferees, did begin working to resolve differences--as we should \nhave--and working out the required compromise is never easy. \nUnfortunately, now the House has decided that in order to gain leverage \nover the Senate to accept the House anti-union provisions, there would \nnot be any additional clean extensions of existing law.\n  We have had 20 extensions of existing law to just keep the Federal \nAviation Administration operating while the House and Senate negotiate \nthe final resolution of this larger bill. Unfortunately, the situation \nnow is that the Congress's failure to extend the authorization one more \ntime has shut down important aviation programs across the country, and \n4,000 FAA employees have been furloughed and forced to go without pay. \nAcross the Nation, important airport improvement projects are now on \nhold.\n  In New Mexico, $26 million in funding for over two dozen projects has \nbeen stopped. These include a new firetruck for the airport in Roswell, \nrunway projects in Raton and Santa Rosa, and snow removal equipment in \nClayton and Vaughn. In Santa Fe, work on a vital new radar system has \nbeen stopped. In Albuquerque, progress has stopped on a $10 million \nproject to replace the airport parking apron.\n  What is particularly troubling to me is that the authority to collect \nthe ticket tax has also been suspended. Why should this matter? This is \nthe money that goes into the airport trust fund and allows us to \ncontinue to make improvements and maintain our airport infrastructure \naround the country. This is funding that is used to pay for safety and \ninfrastructure projects at airports in my State and everywhere in the \ncountry. As I understand it, it amounts to about $30 million a day \nbeing lost from that trust fund. At a time when we are being told the \ncountry is falling behind in its investments in basic infrastructure, \nthis loss of funding is clearly going to have major impacts on airport \nprojects down the road.\n  People also need to realize that the fact that the FAA is no longer \nable to collect the ticket tax does not mean people don't have to pay \nthe full price they would be paying if the tax were being charged. The \nairlines, with very few exceptions, have announced they\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\nare going to continue to charge the full price for tickets and pocket \nthe extra money themselves, instead of turning it over for \ninfrastructure projects at our airports.\n\n  So here we are. It is simply, in my view, unacceptable for the \nCongress not to restore to the FAA the authority to collect airline \nticket taxes and to resume normal operations.\n  Senator Rockefeller has introduced a clean extension of the aviation \nprograms. Whatever differences there are between the two bodies in \nprovisions in the short-term extension are trivial compared to this $30 \nmillion a day the Nation is losing in funding for our Nation's airport \nprojects.\n  We all here in the Senate, in the Congress, and in the country, are \nfocused on the need to extend the debt limit, and that is the most \nurgent need we face, but in addition to that we need to restore to the \nFAA the authority to resume its normal operations and to resume \npayments into the airport trust fund. To leave for an August break \nwithout having fixed the problem of the lack of FAA authorization as \nwell would be seriously irresponsible.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the editorial from this morning's New York Times entitled ``This \nIs Called `Small' Government.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 27, 2011]\n\n                   This Is Called `Small' Government\n\n       What has happened to the Federal Aviation Administration in \n     the last few days should remind everyone of the costs of the \n     Republicans' obstructionism and their slash-and-burn budget \n     games.\n       Taxes on airline tickets expired on Friday when the F.A.A. \n     lost its operating authority, including the authority to \n     collect taxes. Passengers are rightly furious at the nation's \n     airlines, many of which are pocketing the difference. But the \n     masterminds of this fiasco are the House Republicans who let \n     this happen.\n       The F.A.A. has also had to furlough some 4,000 workers. \n     Needed airport construction projects--to maintain runways, \n     build new traffic control towers and upgrade other \n     facilities--have been halted across the country. The only \n     good news is that the air traffic control system is still \n     working because traffic controllers are paid from the \n     Aviation Trust Fund, which still has a positive balance.\n       All of this happened after House Republicans inserted a new \n     provision into a routine bill to temporarily extend the \n     F.A.A.'s operational authority. The provision would end $16.5 \n     million in federal subsidies to 13 airports in rural \n     communities. The bill passed the House. But Senate Democrats \n     balked, arguing that the right place for changing policy is \n     in the regular F.A.A. reauthorization bill--noting that the \n     temporary extension has passed 20 times since 2007 without \n     any additional provisions.\n       ``If we can't put an end to these extravagant subsidies, \n     then we will never be able to rein in spending where really \n     hard decisions are necessary,'' said Tom Petri, the chairman \n     of the House aviation subcommittee, upon submitting the bill. \n     Talk about pound foolish. When the F.A.A. lost operational \n     authority, it lost its ability to collect $200 million in \n     taxes a week. These taxes would have paid for the airport \n     subsidies in about 14 hours. There is more going on here. As \n     we have seen in many Republican-led states, an attack on \n     ``excessive'' government spending is also often a bid to \n     break labor unions.\n       Last year, the National Mediation Board changed a rule to \n     make it easier for airline and railroad workers to unionize. \n     Until then, workers who did not vote in union representation \n     elections were counted as ``no'' votes; after the change, \n     they are counted as abstentions. Pushed by the airline lobby, \n     House Republicans passed a long-term F.A.A. reauthorization \n     in April that would have undone the rule change. The Senate's \n     reauthorization bill, passed in February, maintained the \n     rule.\n       Earlier this month, John Mica, the chairman of the House \n     Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, told an aviation \n     conference that adding the airport subsidy provision to the \n     temporary bill to keep the F.A.A. running is ``just a tool'' \n     to force the Senate to give in on the union issue.\n       Next time voters hear Republicans talking about taking a \n     principled stand against government spending, they should \n     keep this sorry and cynical tale in mind.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Madam President, I follow my colleague who mentioned \nour need to prevent default. The need we have--the reason we are here \nand why there will be a vote in the House and the Senate tonight--has \nto do with the need of our Nation to prevent default, and also, of \ncourse, the need to cut spending. Our problem is that we spend too \nmuch. Americans all around the country are calling in to Members of the \nHouse and Senate and saying: Hey, let's get things under control and \nlet's cut the spending.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle, I am happy to see with the \nproposals being brought forth, are beginning to understand what my \nconstituents in Wyoming have known from the very beginning: Americans \nare not taxed too little, Washington spends too much. But the President \nseems to be more concerned about the next election than about the next \ngeneration of Americans.\n  I was astonished last week when the President was addressing the \nNation and he talked about what his bottom line was in this whole \ndebate. He said:\n\n       The only bottom line I have is that we have to extend this \n     debt ceiling through the next election, into 2013.\n\n  This was the President of the United States saying this:\n\n       The only bottom line I have is that we have to extend this \n     debt ceiling through the next election, into 2013.\n\n  Since 1962, the debt ceiling has been raised 74 times. On average, \nthe debt ceiling is usually for about 8 months. But now the folks on \nthe other side, and the President, are calling for the largest debt \nceiling increase in history and it is designed to last a lot longer \nthan 8 months--almost for a year and a half, as the President wants it \nto go into 2013; and specifically, as he said, through the next \nelection.\n  The President's Treasury Secretary has essentially said the same \nthing. He said:\n\n       We have to lift this threat of default from the economy \n     for, you know, for the next 18 months. We have to take that \n     threat off the table through the election.\n\n  Well, if the President and the Treasury Secretary get their way, they \nwill be able to ignore the single biggest threat to our national \nsecurity until after the next election. As the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff has said: The greatest threat to our national security \nis the debt.\n  The President could have gotten what he wanted last week--which is an \nincrease in the debt ceiling beyond the election--when the House passed \nits cut, cap, and balance legislation. I was one of the original \ncosponsors of that in the Senate. I was in favor of it, supported it, \nand continue to support that. Instead, the President issued a veto \nthreat. He told Democrats in the Senate to kill it. After all, they are \nstill the majority party.\n  The Senate Democrats, I believe tonight, will have the power to save \nour country's finances once again. They can do that by passing the \nBoehner plan--pass it through this body and send it to the President's \ndesk for him to sign. Instead, the majority leader has said no \nDemocrat--not one--will support this plan. It has what the President \nwants. It raises the debt ceiling. It lets us, as a nation, avoid \ndefault. But it doesn't take us beyond the election.\n  It is interesting. It would seem support by the Democrats for this \nplan would clearly signal their desire to continue working to rein in \nWashington's wasteful spending, to get our fiscal house in order. But \nthat doesn't seem to be the signal the President wants to send. The \nBoehner plan is the only plan currently on the table that can get \nthrough the House of Representatives and protect us from default.\n  Republicans have put forward plan after plan. Democrats and the White \nHouse have done nothing but criticize from the sidelines. The White \nHouse Press Secretary has even said:\n\n       Leadership is not proposing a plan for the sake of having \n     it voted up or down and likely voted down.\n\n  That is what he said. He said the Democrats have even sent a letter \nasking for a long-term debt increase. But how can we have a long-term \ndebt increase if they have no plan to get there? The White House \nSecretary claimed recently the President's plan is well-known. He said:\n\n       There is no plan that has been offered, certainly in the \n     last several months, about which more detail is known.\n\n  I say: Where are the details? I want to know how I could get this \nwell-known plan and share it with my constituents back home in Wyoming. \nHow\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\ndid the CBO score this plan that, according to the President's Press \nSecretary, is a plan about which so much detail is known? Where is it? \nWhat is the CBO score? Where is the text of it? How can we read it and \nbring it here and discuss or debate it?\n  These things don't exist--neither a CBO score nor a text--because the \nWhite House has continually refused to release a plan, even with pleas \ncoming from Congress and from the media. I can understand why the \nPresident might be reluctant, since the time he last brought a budget \nto this body it was defeated 97 to 0. Not one Democrat voted in support \nof what the President had proposed--not one. No one supported the \nPresident's budget plan.\n  There is a Reid plan being proposed. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the Reid plan cuts about $2.2 trillion from our budget \nover the next 10 years. But if you dig a little deeper, you find these \nso-called cuts are accounting gimmicks. The House Budget Committee \nlooked at the Reid plan and their assessment was not very flattering. \nLet me quote from that assessment:\n\n       Reid's plan relies on the inaccurate assumption that surge-\n     level spending in Iraq and Afghanistan is scheduled to \n     continue over the next decade.\n\n  No one in America, and I would hope no one in the White House, \nbelieves that surge level spending in Iraq and Afghanistan is scheduled \nto continue over the next decade. But the plan endorsed by the \nPresident relies on such an inaccurate assumption. Why is he trying to \nmislead the American people? The Democrats are claiming to save money \nby cutting spending that was never, ever going to be spent in the first \nplace. This is the strongest possible proof the White House is not \nrealistically dealing with the situation and is not, in my opinion, \nserious about realistically and reliably cutting the debt.\n  In fact, even if you assume the Reid plan would work, it wouldn't cut \nspending fast enough to keep up with the spending the President is \ndoing. The President wants to borrow at least $2.4 trillion to get him \nthrough the election--to get him into 2013. But the last draft of the \nfloor plan we are going to be asked to discuss cuts $2.2 trillion over \n10 years while raising the debt ceiling by $2.7 trillion. It would take \nover a decade to pay back what this President wants to borrow over the \nnext year and a half. So we would still be borrowing at a much higher \nrate than we are cutting. That is not responsible leadership. \nResponsible leadership would be to recognize the solution to our \ncountry's financial woes, and that solution is to avoid default, while \nconsistently cutting spending and balancing our books the way that \nfamilies do. That solution would require us to keep working until we \nget it right. That is the theory at the heart of Speaker Boehner's \nplan.\n  The President talks about wanting a balanced approach. That means \ndifferent things to different people. When the President is talking \nabout wanting more taxes, I think what Americans want is actually a \nbalanced budget. Speaker Boehner will bring us one step closer to that \nbalance by forcing a vote on the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I look forward to voting for a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution.\n  We live under a constitution in the State of Wyoming, and from the \nvery beginning we have balanced our budget. As a result, we have excess \nmoney and scholarships available to all students to study at our \nuniversities and community colleges, because year after year we live \nwithin our means.\n  The President talked a bit about public opinion being important in \nthis debate. Yet he is opposed to a balanced budget constitutional \namendment. In a recent Sachs/Mason-Dixon poll, 65 percent of Americans \nsay they support a balanced budget constitutional amendment. So where \nis the respect for that public opinion? The Boehner plan works because \nits authors have listened to the American people.\n  The White House refuses to seriously confront the problems facing our \nNation, and Democrats are trying to shut down the only plan that can \npass the House and save us from default. I am alarmed at their denial \nabout how to solve these problems. The President must not veto America \ninto default. It is time we pass a real plan that cuts spending and \navoids default. We don't need to wait until midnight on August 1 or \nAugust 2. We can do it, and we should do it today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the tough \nfiscal choices this body, this government, and our President now face. \nBut before I say anything else, I wish to start off with a profound \napology. I want to apologize to every West Virginian and all Americans \nfor the terrible process they have been made to endure and witness. \nWith 5 days before the August 2 deadline to raise the debt ceiling, \nthis government faces yet another crisis of its own making. Yet it is \nnot we who pay the price for our failures to govern, it is the American \npeople. To the tens of millions of American families who work hard to \ntake care of their families, I can only imagine the anger and disgust \nthey have at witnessing a broken government and a President and Members \nof Congress who can't seem to even agree sometimes on what day it is, \nlet alone on how to solve the Nation's debt crisis.\n  The American people deserve better.\n  Some will say Washington is broken and that is the best we can do, \nbut I do not believe that for one moment. Washington may be broken, but \nit will not break me, and you should not let it break you either. I \ncame to fix things, not to make things worse. I came to solve problems, \nnot to ignore them, and I came to worry about the next generation, not \nmy next election.\n  I, for one, am willing to make the tough and painful decisions that \nwill improve the lives of every West Virginian and all Americans for \ngenerations to come, regardless of what it means for my party or for \nthe next election, and I know I am not alone.\n  After our beloved Senator Byrd passed away, I chose to run for the \nSenate for one simple reason: I saw the great challenges our Nation \nfaced: exploding debts and deficits, our Nation's energy dependence, \ncostly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and a painful jobs and economic \ncrisis, and I wanted to help make things better by bringing a little \ncommon sense to Washington. I knew we had to focus on rebuilding \nAmerica and doing so meant making hard, politically difficult choices.\n  Some of my colleagues often remind me that fixing problems as complex \nas our debt crisis isn't easy. But with all due respect, it seems we \nmake it harder than it needs to be. My friends, it doesn't need to be \nthis way.\n  I did not come to Washington with the illusion that I could reinvent \nthe wheel, but I did come to help balance the wheels and make the car \nrun a little smoother.\n  Months ago, when I said I would not vote to raise the debt ceiling \nwithout a long-term fix, I thought this Congress and our President \nwould be able to tackle the issue head-on and have it done by now. As I \nmade clear on that day, the choices we make to address our debt now \nwill determine whether the vital programs we all deeply care about, \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, our veterans programs, education \nfor our children, Head Start, are there for those in need and for the \ndecades to come. However, instead of coming together months ago to \nfocus and deal with the gravity of our debt, we delayed, and we \ncontinue to delegate.\n  While I will never question someone's motivations or their heart, we \nall have a right to question the strategies of our leaders and \ncolleagues, whether they are Democrats or Republicans, because these \nstrategies have once again led us to a crisis and the brink of a \ndisaster. At a minimum, this entire process has, once again, fed a \ngrowing public cynicism that is corrosive to the very fabric of our \ngovernment, and we all bear the responsibility for that.\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\n  I truly believe we can do better. I know this to be true because we \nproved it in West Virginia.\n  When I first became Governor of the great State of West Virginia, our \nState faced similar grave fiscal concerns. After facing dismal credit \nratings for far too long and a dark fiscal future, some thought our \nState's best days were behind us. But after confronting our fiscal \nchallenges head-on in West Virginia, even during the deepest recession \nin our lifetimes, we are one of the few States in the Nation that has \nhad its credit rating upgraded the last 3 years in a row, and we had \nsurpluses for 6 years in a row during the toughest times. We did this \nin West Virginia by cutting spending but not cutting the vital programs \nor services we hold so dear. We did this not by raising tax rates but \nby ensuring that everyone paid their fair share in our State. We did \nthis by tackling waste, fraud, and abuse so as to ensure that we took \ncare of those most in need, not those bent on greed. By doing this, we \nhelped to restore confidence to the economy of our State, and that is a \nfactor we can't overestimate.\n  West Virginia may be a small State, but these are commonsense \nsolutions I strongly believe can apply right here.\n  I did not blame these fiscal challenges we had in our State on the \nmistakes made by past Governors or legislators, whether they were \nDemocrats or Republicans. I reached out to all members of our \nlegislature, whether they were on the front row or the so-called back \nrow, and I met with them and anyone who had an idea on how we best \ncould solve our fiscal problems. It required sacrifice, it required \npatience, and it required trust and respect. Can anyone honestly say \nthat with all that has taken place here? In fact, if we turn on cable \nnews right now, we will see exactly where this broken process stands. \nWe as Democrats sometimes are rushing out to attack our colleagues, the \nRepublicans, and the Republicans are rushing out to attack us, the \nDemocrats.\n  We are better than this, and for the sake of this Nation's future we \nmust do better. I owe it to all West Virginians and we all owe it to \nthis great Nation to do much better than we have. From time to time, we \nshould remind ourselves we took an oath to do just that.\n  As idealistic as it may sound, I implore this great body, each \nMember, the leaders of both bodies, the President, the two parties, and \nespecially the political committees, to put away their political knives \nand swords and let us do something that has become rare in Washington: \nPut aside the political attacks for a few months and actually work \ntogether, openly, honestly, with respect for our profound differences, \nand build a trust that will fix the big problems we face as a nation.\n  The stakes are too high to do anything else. Our Nation faces not \nonly a threat of default but of a downgrade. The credit rating \nagencies, such as Standard & Poor's, have made it clear that the United \nStates needs to cut nearly $4 trillion over the next decade or they \nwill lose the confidence in our long-term ability to pay our bills.\n  Yet in my estimation, neither of the two plans that are currently \nproposed by both Republican and Democratic leadership comes close to \npreventing our Nation from being downgraded or actually solving the \ndebt crisis we face. Each falls far short, whether it is in time or \ndollars.\n  The truth is, both of the plans being discussed and that the Senate \nmay consider, one offered by the leader of the Republican Party, \nSpeaker John Boehner, and the other offered by the leader of our \nChamber and my party, Senator Reid, do not solve the Nation's long-term \nfiscal problems as presented.\n  Make no mistake, I have the utmost respect for both of these fine \npublic servants. Both find themselves in difficult positions, and I \nknow they are trying their best to do what is right. I understand the \ndesire to prevent our Nation's default. But what we have before us are \neffectively a short-term fix and a shorter term fix. Either one might \nprevent a default, which is a good thing, but neither may prevent a \ncredit downgrade, which is a terrible thing.\n  To me, it doesn't matter if it is a Republican proposal or a \nDemocratic proposal, but including $1.2 trillion in savings from the \nwars we should not be fighting as savings doesn't make sense. Saying we \nwill save money that we haven't even budgeted or spent is akin to \nsaying that because your family bought a $20,000 car instead of a \n$50,000 car, you saved $30,000. It is even worse when we consider we \ncouldn't afford to buy any car in the first place. Most of the American \npeople understand that, and I know in West Virginia they do.\n  As for Speaker Boehner's plan, his was supposed to save $1.2 \ntrillion, but the Congressional Budget Office just took a look and \ndetermined it would save only $917 billion. So instead of fixing our \nproblem, it kicks the can down the road to 2012, which will be an \nelection year. If we think this process is ugly now, we ain't seen \nanything yet.\n  As these two proposals currently stand, I could not, in good \nconscience, support either one of them unless they include a pathway \nfor a long-term debt fix. While it is true our Nation will suffer if we \nonly enact a short-term deal, we will suffer much more if we fail to \nfix our greater fiscal problems.\n  We must solve our Nation's problems now, not in 2012 and certainly \nnot in 2013. This is not just my opinion. As many rating agencies have \nwarned and economists have predicted, every year that goes by, the \noptions on how to fix our looming debt crisis will become worse and \nworse.\n  If we are being honest, neither of these proposals, as they stand \ntoday, can prevent a credit rating agency's downgrade, an event that \nwould be as catastrophic or maybe even worse than default because I, \npersonally, know a government's climb back from a low credit rating is \nextremely long and painful.\n  To be clear, a downgrade in our credit worthiness could lead to \nselloff of stocks, Treasury securities, and U.S. dollars. Gold prices \ncould rise even higher, and interest rates could increase across the \nboard, which would not only have a devastating impact on consumers, \nsmall businesses, and local governments but would make the price of \nfinancing our Nation's debt even more costly. At a minimum, the shock \nto our Nation's confidence from our first-ever downgrade could prove \nmore costly than we could even fathom.\n  We can't let this happen. For the sake of our Nation's future, we \nmust come to a compromise that acknowledges that a long-term debt fix \nis needed and our spending is out of control and that raising tax \nrates, whether it is the rich, the middle class, and most especially \neven the poor, will not cure our spending problems.\n  But we must also come to a compromise that acknowledges that tax \nreform is not the same as raising taxes and that there is something \nmorally wrong when a large corporation, such as G.E., pays zero in \nFederal taxes while small businesses or a middle-class family pays \nmore.\n  We must also come to a compromise that finally acknowledges we simply \ncan't fight three wars for years to come while we cut services here at \nhome and we choose to keep taxes low. I have said this before, but it \nis so important. If I have to choose between rebuilding America and \nrebuilding Afghanistan, I choose America.\n  So with the clock ticking toward default, what can we do?\n  As part of any deal to raise the debt ceiling, I would respectfully \nencourage leaders in the Senate and the House and our President to find \ncommon ground by committing to a guaranteed vote on a long-term fix; \notherwise, as I said months ago, I simply cannot support a short-term \ndeal that is just a little better than the shorter term deal.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues, I will not look West \nVirginians in the eye and say: Don't worry, all is good; I saved myself \nfor the 2012 election, but you are on your own.\n  A vote on such a long-term debt fix, I would hope, could come within \nthe next 90 days or a reasonable period of time so as to prevent what I \nfear the most, a downgrade of our Nation's credit rating. I believe \nsuch a vote on a long-term fix is possible because many good people \nhave already worked hard to put together the framework and pieces of \nwhat such a long-term fix could look like.\n  Already we have seen two promising, commonsense proposals from \nbipartisan groups: the Bowles-Simpson debt commission, which presented \nits report nearly 9 months ago, and a similar framework that was \npresented last week by the bipartisan Gang of 6.\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\n  In fact, the day the Gang of 6 announced their proposed framework was \none of my better and prouder days as a Senator. For the first time \nsince I have been in the Senate, I saw Democratic and Republican \nSenators, almost equally divided, come together to put politics aside \nand agree to the principles of a commonsense solution that recognizes \nthe urgency of fixing our long-term problems.\n  No plan is perfect; no plan will be. No plan will please all, and no \nplan can. But within these two plans I believe lies the path our Nation \ncan take if we are to get our fiscal house in order. Of course, some \nwill have other ideas, whether from the right or whether from the left, \nand we should listen to them all. But I would ask each of us and all \nthe groups that undoubtedly will be mobilized to stop any fix, to think \nhard about what will happen to our great Nation if we fail and do \nnothing. What will happen to the programs we cherish, such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare, for all those people who depend on that for \ntheir only means of livelihood? What will happen to our Nation's \ndefense and to our tax rates? What will happen to the people who are \ntruly in need? What will happen to our seniors, our veterans, and our \nchildren if we choose to do little or nothing at all?\n  Finally, as the negotiations for this long-term fix proceed, I would \nhope we could all remember that if we are to negotiate in good faith, \nwe must have faith in each other. We cannot turn a fair compromise into \nthe enemy, and we can't tear each other apart with attacks if we are to \ncome together to solve our Nation's great problems. We can respectfully \ndisagree as long as we never forget to respect each other.\n  As difficult as the next few days and weeks and months will be, I \nbelieve we, the President and this esteemed Congress, have the \nopportunity to make this one of our finest hours. We have within our \nhands an opportunity where we can prove to the naysayers and the \ndoubters that the government of the people is as great as the people \nwhich it serves.\n  I, for one, am willing to do whatever I possibly can, whatever is \nasked of me; I will work hard every day, across the aisle, until we \nhave a long-term solution to our debt crisis.\n  I know no Senator or Member of Congress can do this alone. But \ntogether, putting politics aside, we can do this. For the sake of this \ngreat Nation, our children, the State I love, West Virginia, and this \nwonderful country of ours, the United States of America, I truly hope \nwe do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at least two times in the last couple of \nmonths I have come to the floor to tell my colleagues about some work I \nam doing on investigation of waste, fraud, and abuse in the Defense \nDepartment and primarily to focus them on the work of the Inspector \nGeneral's Office in regard to how they do audits. So I come to the \nfloor today to renew my call for better audit reports.\n  As a Senator dedicated to watchdogging the taxpayers' money, audits \nare a primary instrument in my toolbox. They are like a hammer and a \nwrench. They are the tools of the trade. But like other Members of \nCongress conducting oversight, I can't do audits. We don't have staff \nfor that, so we must rely on the inspectors general of the various \ndepartments to do the independent audits of the work of those \ndepartments. So today I speak about the Defense Department inspector \ngeneral.\n  The audit should be the inspector general's primary weapon for \nrooting out fraud, waste, and theft. Audits should be the tip of their \nspear, and that spear should have a very sharp point. The mere \npossibility of audit should have the fraudsters--people who commit \nfraud--quaking in their boots, but that is not the way it is, at least \nnot at the Defense Department.\n  The audit weapon belonging to the Defense Department's inspector \ngeneral is not as effective as it should be. This problem is not \nentirely the inspector general's own doing. The broken Defense \nDepartment accounting system is also to blame. It is incapable of \ngenerating accurate and complete finance and accounting data. When the \nbooks are in shambles, as they are, then there are no audit trails to \nfollow, and following the money is how we get to the bottom of things \nwhen it comes to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. Of course, \nthat makes the auditor's job doubly difficult. So the auditors need to \nadjust the audit strategy to meet the challenge that there is not a \nvery good financial management system within the Defense Department.\n  As a watchdog, degraded audit capabilities give me serious heartburn. \nIt puts the taxpayers' money in harm's way. When we have unreliable \naccounting data coupled with ineffective auditing, theft and waste can \nthrive undetected. Those concerns are the driving force behind my \nongoing audit oversight review.\n  Starting in January of 2009, I began receiving anonymous letters from \nwhistleblowers. They alleged gross mismanagement in the audit office. \nIn response, my staff initiated an in-depth oversight review. It \nfocused on audit reporting by that Inspector General's Office.\n  On September 7, 2010, I issued my first report. It evaluated 113 \naudit reports issued in fiscal year 2009. That study determined that \nthose audits, which cost the taxpayers about $100 million, were not on \ntarget. I offered 12 recommendations for getting the audit process back \non track.\n  Inspector General Heddell responded to my report in a very positive \nand constructive way. He promised to ``transform the audit \norganization.'' The newly appointed deputy for auditing, Mr. Dan Blair, \nproduced a roadmap pointing the way forward. He, too, promised reform \nand transformation and the creation of a ``world-class oversight \norganization.'' All of this, of course, was music to my ears. All \nsignals were very encouraging. But the big question before us now is \nthis: When will the promised reforms begin to pop up on the radar \nscreen? And that radar screen is our further reading of additional \naudits as they come out this fiscal year and into the future. When will \nwe see sustained improvement in audit quality?\n  To establish a solid baseline for assessing the highly touted \ntransformation plan, my staff took another snapshot of recent audits. \nMy latest oversight review is best characterized as a report card, and \nit was issued on June 1 of this year. Each of the 113 unclassified \nreports published in fiscal year 2010 was reviewed, evaluated, and \ngraded. After each report was graded, all the scores for each report on \neach rating category were added up and averaged. This created a \ncomposite score for each of the 113 reports.\n  Although 15 top-quality audits are highlighted in the report card, \nthe overall score for all 113 was D-minus. That is low, I know. Maybe \nthe score should have been a little higher. Obviously, the grading \nsystem isn't perfect. It may need some fine-tuning, and we are working \non that. But I still believe it provides a rough measure of audit \nquality.\n  Clearly, none of the 2010 reports reflected any reforms that \nInspector General Heddell put in place in December of 2010 because all \nthose reports were published 3 months before the reforms went into \nplace before October 1, 2010. That was a good 3 months before those \nreforms were approved.\n  Shortly after my report card was issued, Inspector General Heddell \npounced on it. He objected to the low score. He complained that it did \nnot adequately reflect $4.2 billion in what he calls ``achieved \nmonetary benefits'' identified in the 2010 audits.\n  To address Mr. Heddell's concerns, I had my staff ask the audit \noffice to prepare an information paper on the reported savings. That \ndocument was provided to me on June 20. I call it a ``crosswalk.'' It \ntakes me to the exact page in each report where savings are discussed \nand identified. This document lists $4.2 billion in ``identified \npotential monetary benefits'' and $4.2 billion in ``collections.'' \nThese alleged savings were uncovered in 19 reports, including one \nclassified report we didn't look at.\n  After reviewing the crosswalk, I concluded that Inspector General \nHeddell\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\nhad a legitimate gripe about the report card. The report card should \nhave included a section on savings. The first time around, we did not \ngive sufficient credit for those accomplishments. As a practical \nmatter, we gave those reports only partial credit for pinpointing \nwaste. I say partial credit because six of those reports were given top \nscores in my report card, so they did get some credit--just not enough \ncredit.\n  In order to fully assess Mr. Heddell's complaints, I directed my \nstaff to reassess the scoring process for all 18 unclassified audits. \nIn rescoring the reports, we asked ourselves key questions such as, Was \nthe audit objective aligned with the inspector general's core mission? \nDid contract audits connect all the dots in the cycle of transactions? \nDid they match contract requirements with payments? Did the audits \nanswer the key oversight question, which is, Did the government receive \nwhat it ordered at an agreed-upon price and schedule? Did the audit \nverify the exact dollar amount of alleged fraud and waste using primary \nsource payment records? I do not have time to go into this, but the use \nof primary source payment records is very important if we are going to \nfollow the money, and following the money is where we determine whether \nthere is fraud, waste, and abuse.\n\n  Other key questions we asked were: Were the recommendations tough and \nappropriate? Did they recommend accountability for waste and \nmismanagement? Did they propose workable remedies for recovering \nimproper payments? How quickly were the audits completed?\n  The answers to these questions take us right to the heart and the \nsoul of an audit--any audit, in any department. They are a good \nyardstick for measuring audit quality.\n  This is my bottom line: Were the audits hard-hitting, down-in-the-\ntrenches audits that produced results or were they softball audits with \nno redeeming value?\n  After completing the review, my staff upped the overall score of \nthose 18 reports from a D-plus to a solid C.\n  Excellence in several reporting categories pushed the scores up as \nfollows: All reports were highly relevant and were aligned with the \ncore mission. They detected and reported $4 billion in waste. Most \nreports offered reasonable recommendations for recovering unauthorized \npayments.\n  Poor performance in other categories pulled scores down as follows: \nMost reports did not verify exact dollar amounts of waste using primary \nsource payment records. I wish to emphasize again the necessity of \nusing primary source pay records. Follow the money. Most dollar amounts \nfor alleged savings were taken from untested Army budget documents. \nMost did not offer meaningful recommendations for holding responsible \nofficials accountable for waste and mismanagement. Of course, in \ngovernment, if people are not held responsible for what they do and \naccountable for what they do, then, of course, we do not see change in \nculture. So accountability and responsibility and holding people \nresponsible is very important if we are going to bring changes. Then, \nlastly, I would say, most reports were old and stale, having taken far \ntoo long to complete.\n  I wish to point this out by saying, the single biggest factor that \nkeeps dragging the scores down into the pits is timeliness or lack of \nit and, in most cases, the lack of it. The Audit Office continues to \npublish old, stale reports. Of these 18 reports we reviewed and on \nwhich I am reporting to you, they took an average of 17 months to \ncomplete. Eight took a total of 168 months to complete, and none of \nthese numbers includes the 4 to 6 months it takes to get an audit \nstarted. So we are looking at a minimum of 2 years to complete top-\nquality audits.\n  Under my scoring system, audits completed in 6 months or less earn a \ngrade A, those completed in 12 months earn a C, and those that take \nmore than 15 months get an F.\n  These 18 reports, of course, as we can see from my comments, were \nover the top. So they earned a grade of F for taking so long to finish.\n  I have said this before, and I wish to say it again. The power of \ntop-quality audit work is greatly diminished by stale information. Out-\nof-date audits have little impact--with the passage of time, records \ndisappear, particularly financial records--because following the money \nis a very important part of good auditing. People retire and move on. \nMoney cannot be recovered and no one can be held accountable, and \nwithout people being held accountable, we do not change the culture of \norganizations.\n  The new Deputy for Auditing, Mr. Blair, is part of the problem. He \nhas not set any goals for audit completion times. I hope he will do \nthat. Reasonable goals need to be established.\n  I would like to summarize. In my summarization, I would point out \nthat I wish to talk about the $4 billion that was potential waste and \nwas saved. These 18 reports clearly put the spotlight on $4 billion of \npotential waste. The auditors detected it. They reported it. They did \nexactly what they are supposed to do. That is a major accomplishment \nworthy of recognition and praise. So they ferreted out waste. They \npresumably saved the money.\n  But what happened to the $4 billion? Busting $4 billion in waste did \nnot produce $4 billion in savings. The savings touted by Inspector \nGeneral Heddell were lost, in a sense.\n  Then there is a technical lingo around government: The money got \nreprogrammed. In plain English, that means it got put to better use but \nnot necessarily saved. As seen through the eyes of this skeptical \nwatchdog, all the loose change got scooped up and shoveled out the \nbackdoor and into the jaws of the Pentagon spending machine on some \nother program. That machine is known to have an insatiable appetite for \nmoney.\n  The disappearance of the savings is part semantics. The word \n``waste'' is not in the audit lexicon. Sprinkling waste with perfume \nand calling it savings does not make it savings. Perhaps if the \nauditors started calling it what it is--waste--it might be easier to \nreach the Promised Land, but they never got there. Mr. President, 99.9 \npercent of the $4 billion got spent. Only in government could we spend \nall the money and still claim savings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5005-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5005-S5007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               DEBT LIMIT\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, later today, we will get a chance--another \nchance, I should say--to vote to raise the debt limit.\n  My understanding is, the House of Representatives has delayed the \ntime at which they are going to vote on their plan, the so-called \nBoehner plan. But at some point I suspect that vote will move forward \nand we will end up receiving that legislation from the House of \nRepresentatives, and we will have an opportunity to act on that as \nwell.\n  It will be the second bill we will vote on in the Senate that would \nraise the debt limit. The first one was the cut, cap, and balance plan \nthat was first approved by the House before being sent to the Senate \nover 1 week ago.\n  This was a three-pronged approach that would have required a \ndownpayment on our deficits by immediately cutting spending. It would \nhave put us on a path to reform entitlements and cut spending over the \nmedium term by putting a cap on spending as a percentage of our \neconomy. Finally, it would have made sure we do not keep adding to our \ndebt by approving a debt limit increase after a balanced budget \namendment to our Constitution was passed by Congress.\n  This was the Republicans' first choice as to how to deal with this \ncrisis. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats killed this commonsense bill \nwhich had the support, according to a CNN poll, of 66 percent of \nAmericans. So we did not have an opportunity to debate it, offer \namendments or get an up-and-down vote on that legislation. In the \ninterest of solving the problem before us, it was recognized that \nprobably we would have to find another approach.\n  There have been a lot of observations made by the media and others \nthat somehow the Republicans need to compromise more in this situation. \nMy\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\nonly question would be: Compromise with whom? With themselves? Because \nthey are the only ones out there who have put forward a plan. And, in \nfact, this current proposal that will come from the House of \nRepresentatives actually is a compromise. The spending reductions in \nthat proposal are two-thirds of those that were proposed in the House \nbudget that was passed by the House of Representatives earlier this \nyear. So it still addresses the fundamental problem, and Speaker \nBoehner came up with a new plan that would cut spending by $915 billion \nand create a process to reduce the deficit by $1.8 trillion on top of \nthat.\n  This is not a perfect plan. As I said, it is certainly not our first \nchoice, but it is a plan that cuts spending more than it increases the \ndebt limit, and it does it without raising taxes on job creators. In a \nlittle while the Boehner plan will hopefully join the cut, cap, and \nbalance plan as the only plan which has passed a body of Congress.\n  Senate Democrats do not have a plan to cut spending more than they \nraise the debt limit. Senate Democrats do not have a plan that can pass \na single House of Congress. Of course, this is more than the White \nHouse can say, because the White House does not have a plan, period. So \nwhen the Boehner plan comes up for a vote here in the Senate, hopefully \nsometime later this evening, I would encourage my colleagues from \nacross the aisle to support this measure.\n  They have been speaking constantly about the need to raise the debt \nlimit, and here is their chance to do so. All they have to do is vote \nfor this bill and send it to the President for his signature and we can \nput this issue to rest for the time being. Then it puts a pathway in \nplace for us to get, as I said before, to a debate about entitlement \nreform several months down the road.\n  I understand there are some concerns among my colleagues on the other \nside about how long it will be before we would need to increase the \ndebt limit again. But if you look at the past 20 years or so, 72 \npercent of the time our debt limit increases have been for less than a \nyear. So this increase is hardly out of the normal time range. If you \nthink about it, almost 75 percent of the time--almost three-fourths of \nthe time--we have raised the debt limit, we have done it for less than \na year.\n  What we are talking about here would be something that would take us \ninto next year, at which point we would have to have another vote on \nthe debt limit as we come to a conclusion about the entitlement reform \ncomponent or element of this particular legislation.\n  So this increase, as I said, is not out of the normal time range. \nMarkets are not going to care about for how long we increase the debt \nlimit. They simply care that we do not breach the debt limit and, more \nimportantly, over the long term we lay out a long-term plan to cut the \ndebt.\n  Many of us have spoken on the floor of the Senate in the past and \nindicated that the real crisis, the real issue before our country right \nnow is not the debt limit, it is the debt. It is the fact that we are \nborrowing literally 40 cents out of every dollar that we spend here in \nWashington, DC, and we continue to pile up and accumulate massive \namounts of debt that get passed on to future generations and put in \ngreat peril the economy of our country and our ability to create jobs. \nSo a longer term increase is not needed to calm the markets.\n  But what this bill does not do is raise the debt limit past the \nelections. I think that is where the real rub comes in. Because the \nPresident has made it very clear, as have some of my colleagues, that \nthis is one of their major concerns. They want to have a debt limit \nincrease that gets us past the 2012 election. That is a political \nconcern, it is not an economic concern.\n  But today it has arisen that these concerns are more than political, \nthey are personal. You see, the White House is concerned that this \nwould require Congress to approve another debt limit increase sometime \nin January, which they complain would ruin their Christmas vacation \nplans. I certainly do not want to ruin the President or anyone else's \nChristmas vacation plans, but I think it is a bit more important that \nwe prevent our country from adding $9.5 trillion to the debt held by \nthe public, as the President's budget would do. I think it is a bit \nmore important that we prevent our country from being forced to \nimplement severe austerity programs, such as they have had to do in \nEurope because of their inability to constrain spending. I think it is \na bit more important that we reform entitlements so these important \nprograms are around for our children and grandchildren.\n  Finally, I think it is a bit more important that we leave our country \nin better shape for our children than the one we received. This has \nbeen the American ethic. Each generation has sacrificed so that the \nnext generation could have a better quality of life. Today we risk \nturning that tradition on its head. If we continue to run up debts and \ndeficits such as those proposed, our children and grandchildren will \nhave an astounding burden to pay off to our country's creditors. We do \nnot have to leave them this burden.\n  We have proposed, as I said, the cut, cap, and balance plan, which \nwould make great strides in reducing this debt burden. We will have, \nhopefully later today--if not today perhaps sometime tomorrow--in front \nof us the Boehner plan, which will make significant downpayments on \nthese burdens.\n  What I would simply say is that we have consistently now put before \nthis Senate different plans we have had a chance to vote on. We voted \non the cut, cap, and balance plan. Unfortunately, it was a tabling \nmotion, it was a procedural motion. It was not an up-and-down vote, \nbecause the leader did not want us to get on that legislation and have \nan opportunity to debate and amend it and ultimately vote on it. But we \ndid have a vote on a tabling motion. Hopefully, we will get a vote on \nthe Boehner plan which, as I said, hopefully will be in front of us in \nthe not too distant future. But my point very simply is there has not \nbeen any effort put forward by our colleagues on the other side to, \none, put forward a budget which we know now has been I think 820 days \nsince the last time the Senate acted on a budget. You have to go back \nto April 29 of 2009. That was the last time the Senate voted on a \nbudget.\n  It starts there. It starts there. That is where we set our \npriorities. That is where we determine how we are going to spend the \npeople's tax dollars. So we have not had a budget. The House of \nRepresentatives passed a budget. They did it on schedule. They did it \non time. As far as I know, there are no plans here to move a budget any \ntime in the future.\n  Then we have the cut, cap, and balance plan that passed the House of \nRepresentatives, which was an attempt to deal with the debt limit \nincrease, but do it in a way that forces us to focus on the real issue, \nwhich is spending reductions, spending reforms, puts in place a pathway \nto get a result on entitlement reform, forces a vote on a balanced \nbudget amendment, which many of us think is a priority if we are going \nto get long-term spending under control, and then, hopefully later \ntoday, we are going to get a vote on the Boehner plan which will come \nover from the House of Representatives, which is yet another attempt to \nget the debt limit increased, but do it in a way that actually makes a \ndent in the long-term challenge facing this country, which again is not \nthe debt limit, it is the debt.\n  That is the problem. That is fundamentally what we have to deal with. \nIt is fundamentally a spending problem. Much has been made about a \nbalanced approach. What does the other side mean when they say \nbalanced? Usually it means we are going to take more of your money and \nspend it on more government. Many of us would support tax reform that \nwould close tax loopholes, broaden the base, if you could lower the \nrates at the same time. I happen to believe that is important if we are \ngoing to get the economy growing again and creating jobs. I think you \nwould see tremendous growth as a result of tax reform. But if you talk \nabout raising taxes to pay for even more government, that is precisely \nthe wrong approach. That is why we are in the mess we are in today, \nbecause we spend more than we take in. We have been doing it year over \nyear. We have got to learn to live within our means and to quit \nspending money we do not have.\n  Many States have amendments in their constitutions that enable them\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\nand force them and require them to do this every single year. It is \ntime our Federal Government started operating in a way that makes \nfiscal sense. I think the American people understand very clearly what \nthis is about. This is about spending. It is about getting Washington \nto live within its means, to quit borrowing 40 cents out of every \ndollar it spends, and to put this country on a path fiscally that will \nensure we do not bankrupt the country for future generations, and that \nwe get our economy back in a place where it can start growing and \ncreating the jobs we need to get people in this country back to work.\n  I see the Senator from Utah. I expect he will have some remarks about \nthis subject. There are many of us on this side, I know, who are \nanxious to vote and certainly are doing everything we can to facilitate \nthis process where we deal with the crisis before us next week, but, \nimportantly, do it in a way that addresses the fundamental issue here \nwhich is not the debt limit, it is the debt.\n  It is time Washington started living within its means, started to \nmake sure we have got a pathway in place for not only cutting spending \ntoday but dealing with the long-term issue by putting a balanced budget \namendment in our Constitution. I hope my colleagues will join us in \nthis legislation that will come before us sometime we hope later today, \nand it will be yet another attempt to address this issue. I implore my \ncolleagues here, I think we are going to get most of the Republicans to \nvote for this. I hope there will be some on the other side who will \njoin us in this endeavor. It is too important to the future of this \ncountry not to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) The Senator from Utah \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to finish my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5007-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5007-S5012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before turning to the issue of the moment, \nI want to thank my dear friend for his good remarks here on the floor \nof the Senate. He is a great leader, a great human being, and he \ncertainly outlined, I think in a fair way, some of the problems and \nsome of the solutions we might have here on the floor.\n  But before turning to the issue of the moment, the need to restore \nthe Nation's fiscal stability by reducing our deficits and debt, I want \nto return to a matter I discussed on the floor yesterday, and that is \nthe FAA reauthorization bill.\n  I must respond to some of the comments made by two of my colleagues \nearlier today regarding one of the major sticking points in our efforts \nto pass the FAA reauthorization bill. Their arguments are, to put it \nquite simply, fallacious and cannot go unanswered.\n  As you might expect, these comments were regarding the provision in \nthe House bill affecting the way votes are counted in union elections \nin the airline industry. My colleagues, the senior Senator from West \nVirginia and the junior Senator from Iowa, characterize the House's \nactions as some sort of radical endeavor, a change that lacks \njustification and common sense.\n  In fact, the Senator from West Virginia even argued that the House's \nprovisions would ``undo 75 years of labor law.''\n  These were his exact words. Well, nothing could be further from the \ntruth. In fact, the claim is so far from being accurate I simply have \nto assume that my good friend, Senator Rockefeller, simply misspoke. I \nknow this is the line the labor unions and the administration are \npeddling, but here is the truth: The House of Representatives or Senate \nRepublicans are not trying to undo 75 years of labor law, it is the \nNational Mediation Board--or NMB, I will call it--that has already done \nso in a highly partisan fashion.\n  It is the NMB, controlled by pro-union appointees of President Obama \nthat in a partisan way unilaterally undid 75 years of labor law, and \nput their finger on the scale for the unions that bankroll Democratic \npolitical campaigns.\n  I know what I am talking about. I won the American Jurisprudence \nprize for labor law. I have led labor fights on the floor for our side \nfor the last 35 years. House and Senate Republicans are only trying to \nrestore long-lasting labor law following its highly partisan corruption \nby the National Mediation Board. This is not an opinion. This is fact.\n  Put the talking points and revisionist history aside, this is what \nyou have: a highly partisan NMB changing 75 years of settled law, \nsettled labor law, to benefit the Democrats' political allies. For 75 \nyears, NMB-supervised elections required that a union receive the votes \nof a majority of the entire workforce before it can be certified. That \nhas been the law. There is good reason for it. This was not just a \nmathematical trick to disadvantage unions, as my colleagues have \nargued. It is plain common sense.\n  Let's suppose, for example, that only 50 percent of a proposed \nbargaining unit votes in a union election, and the union wins by a very \nslim majority of the votes cast. In that case, a union representative \nwould be certified with only the demonstrated support of one-fourth of \nthe bargaining unit. That is what would happen if we follow the \nlanguage the NMB fallaciously put into their ruling. One-quarter of a \nworkforce could vote to certify a union and bind every other coworker \nto have to live with that decision. Apparently a commitment to \nDemocratic and true majority rule only matters to the left when it \nsuits them. What is going on in this country is outrageous, not just at \nthe National Mediation Board but the NLRB as well. Democratic radicals, \nvery brilliant labor lawyers, who do not give a darn about what the law \nis, are now starting to change the laws by regulatory fiat.\n  Apparently a commitment to democratic and true majority rule only \nmatters when it suits certain people's politics.\n  The Senator from Iowa compared these votes to Senate and schoolboard \nelections, suggesting that only a majority of those voting is necessary \nto prevail. This is a misguided comparison. First, union elections are \nnot a choice among competing representatives. They are, instead, held \nto determine whether the workers want to be represented at all. Even \nsetting that aside, how many schoolboards are going to be empowered to \nmake decisions that affect every hour of every day an employee goes to \nwork? How many Senators are elected to serve a small, narrowly defined \ngroup of constituents? And, in the end, if your vote is not counted in \na Senate or schoolboard election, you will get another chance to vote a \nfew years down the line.\n  Employees voting in these union elections have no such options. That \nis why the law has been completely different from what my two friends \nand colleagues have said on the floor. Requiring the support of the \nmajority of the whole unit before certifying a union representative \nonly makes common sense. This is why the procedure at NMB used for \nthese elections went unchanged for 75 years. Boards appointed by \nDemocratic Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Johnson, Carter, and Clinton \nall agreed with that process that the House bill is only attempting to \nrestore.\n  In fact, the NMB appointed by President Carter unanimously ruled it \ndid not have authority to administratively change the form of the NMB's \nballot used in representation elections, and that such a change, if \nappropriate, can only be made by Congress. That makes sense.\n  Yet today we have an administration bent on greasing the rails in \nfavor of the unions, and a Democratic Senate all too willing to go \nalong with it. They are so willing that they have opted to stall \npassage of the FAA reauthorization to prevent Congress from restoring a \nsystem that served the Nation and airline industry well for decades. \nThis is another example of the administration showing its true colors. \nRather than provide certainty to travelers, the transportation \nindustry, and airports, they are holding up a long-term FAA \nreauthorization in order to benefit their union allies. It is wrong. \nThis type of thing should not go on. Nor should the National Mediation \nBoard be issuing what ought to be congressional decisions.\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\n  I wish we were not having this debate. I wish we could get this FAA \nreauthorization done. I want to get it done. I don't want anybody \nfurloughed, but these are important issues. This isn't some itty-bitty \nnonessential issue. I am not going to yield on this issue. I will not \nlet an out-of-control National Mediation Board and their patrons in \nCongress and the White House rig the rules so a small minority can jam \nunionization on unwilling employees.\n  I expect we will be debating this issue for some time. I am willing \nto have the debate in full view of the public. But, at the very least, \nI expect my colleagues to acknowledge the truth as to what has \ntranspired at the National Mediation Board. It is not the House of \nRepresentatives that has taken a radical position; it is the Obama \nadministration, and some of my colleagues on the other side should know \nbetter.\n  Let me add a couple of other things. I don't enjoy the fact that \npeople are being furloughed. But it is not Republicans who are holding \nthis bill up. It is those people demanding outrageous changes in the \nlaw by individuals who were never elected to make those changes. We \nought to fire that whole doggone National Mediation Board--or at least \nthe Democrats on the board, who don't seem to care about what the law \nis.\n  And it is the same with the NLRB. At least one of them, and maybe \nmore, could not make it through this process and had to be recess \nappointed. They could care less about what the laws are, and they want \nto change them without proper congressional approval. It is outrageous. \nIt is not something my friends on the other side should encourage. It \njust makes sense.\n  All those Democratic Presidents, until now, have honored that 75-year \nhistory of how votes should be taken in union elections. Unions win \nover 60 percent of their union elections. The system is not unfair. \nThey lose some, sure. But to stack the rules so they can win every time \nis not right either. It certainly isn't democratic. It is wrong for \nthose employees who didn't have the opportunity, or didn't vote. It is \nwrong. You can have 10 people vote in a 100-person union, and if 6 vote \nfor it, under their rule, that would change the rule for all 94 of the \nothers. That is what we are ignoring. So much for that. All I can say \nis I don't want to have anyone whining from the other side, because \nthey are the ones who are holding up the FAA reauthorization. And they \nare doing it for the most crass of reasons.\n\n\n                            The Debt Ceiling\n\n  Turning to the matter that is consuming the Nation, I want to address \nthe so-called August 2 deadline we hit next week.\n  In early April of this year, Treasury Secretary Geithner informed \nCongress that Treasury might run out of ways to stay at the debt limit \nand have enough cash to pay its bills around July 8. About a month and \na half later, on May 16, the Treasury Secretary updated his guess to \nAugust 2.\n  This August 2 deadline, which the administration has insisted is when \nTreasury runs out of sufficient cash to pay bills, was estimated back \nin the middle of May. It is only reasonable to expect that Congress \nwould be kept apprised of Treasury's cashflow status and estimates. If \nwe indeed face an economic catastrophe on August 2, it is only \nreasonable to expect warnings from those in government responsible for \nissuing such updates and monitoring threats to our financial stability.\n  We have a group in government that is charged with that \nresponsibility. It is called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, \nor FSOC, set up in the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. The FSOC is \nchaired by the Treasury Secretary and composed of members such as the \nFederal Reserve Chairman and banking regulations czars. Indeed, the \nFSOC was sold by Democrats as a body that would be able to spot threats \nto our financial system and then warn and protect us all.\n  The President, Treasury officials, the President's Press Secretary, \nand others in the administration daily warn of catastrophe, crisis, and \nthe potential for conditions even worse than we saw during the \nfinancial crisis. They seem to be channeling Dr. Peter Venkman, who, \nfaced with another catastrophe, once predicted a disaster of biblical \nproportions--human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass \nhysteria.\n  Yet through all these predictions, the FSOC has essentially remained \nsilent. That body of unelected bureaucrats either doesn't see an \nimpending threat to stability from the debt limit impasse, or from a \nratings downgrade for the United States, or it is too busy writing a \nmountain of new regulations to make a warning.\n  I sent a letter, which I wish to have printed in the Record, to eight \nvoting members of the FSOC yesterday, asking two basic sets of \nquestions. I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2011.\n     Hon.

Ben Bernanke,\n     Chairman, Board of Governors, The Federal Reserve System, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Gary Gensler,\n     Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Mary Schapiro,\n     Chairman, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Martin J. Gruenberg,\n     Acting Chairperson, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Edward DeMarco,\n     Acting Director, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Debbie Matz,\n     Chairman, National Credit Union Administration, Alexandria, \n         VA.\n     John Walsh,\n     Acting Comptroller, Office of the Comptroller of the \n         Currency, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Geithner, Chairmen Bernanke, Gensler, Matz, \n     Shapiro, Acting Chairperson Gruenberg, Acting Director \n     DeMarco, and Acting Comptroller Walsh: The President, on July \n     25, spoke to the American public about risks associated with \n     failure to raise the statutory debt limit, saying that: ``We \n     would risk sparking a deep economic crisis. . .'' The \n     President warns of a deep crisis and risks to financial \n     stability.\n       You, the voting members of the Financial Stability \n     Oversight Council (FSOC), are charged by the Dodd-Frank Wall \n     Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with the \n     responsibility to identify risks and potential emerging \n     threats to the financial stability of the United States.\n       Does the Council agree with the President's assessment that \n     possible failure to raise the statutory debt limit by \n     sometime in early August represents an emerging threat to the \n     financial stability of the United States?\n       Does any voting Council member dissent from whatever is the \n     majority view of the Council? If so, please explain precisely \n     why.\n       Neither the Minutes of the FSOC July 13, 2011 meeting nor \n     the Annual Report of the FSOC, which was approved on July 22, \n     2011, identify possible failure to raise the statutory debt \n     limit by August 2 as an imminent risk to the financial \n     stability of the United States worthy of a warning to the \n     American people, and do not come close to recent statements \n     by Treasury officials warning of ``catastrophe.''\n       In addition to inquiring about the Council's views on \n     possible risks to financial stability, I write to ask the \n     Council and its voting members about their current knowledge \n     of recent Treasury cash inflows and outflows and projections \n     of those cash flows, daily, through the month of August.\n       Treasury officials have warned that based on actual and \n     projected revenues and expenditures, along with potential \n     exhaustion of available ``extraordinary measures'' to avoid \n     breach of the statutory debt limit, the United States will \n     exhaust its borrowing authority under the limit and possibly \n     run out of available cash to pay obligations of the federal \n     government that are due.\n       Unfortunately, Congress and the American people do not have \n     sufficient information about Treasury's actual and projected \n     revenues, expenditures, and cash flows to make informed \n     judgments. Many Americans and members of Congress are, \n     unfortunately, relying on estimates and projections from \n     either large Wall Street financial institutions\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\n     or non-governmental organizations often labeled ``think \n     tanks.'' The lack of information is unsatisfactory.\n       In a May 2, 2011 letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary \n     Geithner stated that as a result of stronger than anticipated \n     tax receipts, Treasury then estimated that extraordinary \n     measures to provide headroom under the statutory debt limit \n     would be exhausted on August 2, 2011. Since that time, more \n     data have become available. Some reports since that time have \n     indicated that receipts may have been turning out higher than \n     previously expected. Further, the Federal Reserve's July 2011 \n     Monetary Policy Report to the Congress identifies that \n     ``Federal receipts have risen rapidly lately--they are up \n     about 10 percent in the first eight months of fiscal 2011 \n     compared with the same period in fiscal 2010.''\n       I recognize that receipts and Treasury's cash inflows and \n     outflows can be lumpy and are stochastic. However, the date \n     at which extraordinary measures available to Treasury become \n     exhausted, and cash inflows may prove insufficient to meet \n     incoming obligations that are due, has almost surely changed \n     from the August 2 date estimated by Treasury on May 2. Given \n     incoming data since May 2, does August 2 remain the date with \n     the highest statistical likelihood of being the point in time \n     at which Treasury will run out of extraordinary measures to \n     provide additional headroom under the debt limit and will \n     face insufficient cash inflows relative to obligations that \n     are coming due?\n       Please provide, by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time on \n     Thursday, July 28, detailed information known by the Council \n     and by any voting member on:\n       Actual revenues and expenditures through July 27;\n       Projected or actual daily Treasury cash inflows and \n     outflows for each day between July 28 and August 31, along \n     with methods used to make projections;\n       Whether, given current projections of cash inflows and \n     obligations coming due, Treasury would run out of cash and \n     not have sufficient cash available to meet all obligations \n     that become due on any date between August 2 and August 31 \n     (projections here mean point estimates, with the \n     acknowledgement that projections are inherently uncertain);\n       Any cash or liquid accounts available (presently or any \n     time during August) to Treasury, such as Treasury's $5 \n     billion liquid balance sitting idle in its Supplementary \n     Financing Program Account at the Federal Reserve, established \n     to allegedly assist the Federal Reserve with management of \n     its balance sheet during the financial crisis (the Daily \n     Statement of cash and debt operations of the United States \n     Treasury for Monday, July 25, 2011 indicates that the $5 \n     billion was available to Treasury on that date);\n       Current values of securities and other marketable assets \n     available (presently or any time during August) to Treasury, \n     including mortgage-backed-securities and other financial \n     claims amassed by Treasury during the recent financial \n     crisis, which could be liquidated and converted to cash (my \n     request is for total values, not an assessment of the \n     advisability of asset sales);\n       Contingency plans for generation of cash within Treasury in \n     the event that the statutory debt limit is not raised by \n     August 2, 2011;\n       Contingency plans of regulators of financial institutions, \n     including any plans for regulatory forebearance, in the event \n     of a ratings downgrade of United States Treasury debt \n     securities;\n       Contingency plans of the Federal Reserve System and the \n     Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the event of a ratings \n     downgrade of United States Treasury debt securities, \n     including plans related to ``breaking of the buck'' by a \n     money market mutual fund, disruptions in the tri-party repo \n     market, disruptions in payment systems or systemically \n     important financial utilities, or creation of programs or \n     facilities with broad-based eligibility under authorities \n     provided by Section 1101 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \n     and Consumer Protection Act;\n       Any private assurances by any government officials to any \n     financial institution or significant financial market \n     participant that the United States Treasury will not fail to \n     pay principal and interest on Treasury securities even if the \n     statutory debt limit is not raised.\n       As Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, with a \n     responsibility for oversight of our sovereign debt and \n     Treasury's cash management practices, I am deeply concerned \n     about the lack of information about upcoming cash flows and \n     reliance of Congress and the American people on \n     nongovernmental projections of those flows in decisionmaking. \n     Time is of the essence, and I require, as I stated, the \n     information that I have requested by 5:00 p.m. Eastern \n     Standard Time on Thursday, July 28. Please contact Jeff Wrase \n     at 202-224-4515.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Orrin G. Hatch,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one is whether they see any imminent threat \nto financial stability from the debt limit impasse, or from an \nimpending downgrade to our Nation's credit rating. Of course, we face \nwarnings of downgrades of our credit rating not merely because of the \ndebt limit impasse; we have had dozens of such impasses in recent \ndecades, with no effect on our credit rating. Yet we do face warnings \nof a ratings downgrade because of President Obama's acceleration of \ndeficits and debt along our unsustainable fiscal path and unsustainable \nentitlement promises.\n  With spending as a share of the economy up to levels not seen since \nWorld War II, and a lack of willingness by the administration to break \nits deficit spending addiction, ratings agencies have been brought to \nthe edge and warn of impending downgrades. Those downgrades would \nimmediately harm job creation, the economy, the cost of credit for \nevery American family and business, and, indeed, overall financial \nstability.\n  However, instead of a forthright discussion of this threat, the FSOC \nchose to instead bury an academic discussion of it in their annual \nreport. Let me remind everyone how important Democrats said the FSOC \nwould be as an early warning system, protecting us from the imminent \nthreats to stability. It was supposed to be a watchdog, a cop on the \nbeat combing global financial markets for imbalances and stability \nthreats, and then giving warning to everyone.\n  The President, the Treasury Secretary, ratings agencies, Secretary of \nState, Fed Chairman Bernanke, admirals, investors, former \nadministration officials across party lines--all have issued warnings \nof threats to financial stability from our fiscal crisis. Yet the FSOC \nburied whatever observation it has about our crisis in its annual \nreport.\n  Another set of questions I asked the FSOC involves Treasury's \ncashflows through August and the date at which Treasury now believes it \nis most likely to run short of cash. I asked about contingency plans \nthat Treasury, the Fed, and bank regulators have if there is a ratings \ndowngrade. Reports of meetings of Treasury Secretary Geithner, Fed \nChairman Bernanke, and New York Fed President Dudley suggest that \ncontingency plans certainly are in the works.\n  Yet as the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, the \nadministration has provided me with no information on what those plans \nmight be, in spite of my responsibility for oversight of debt and cash \noperations at Treasury. I wish I could say I was surprised, but the \nfact is, the promise of the most open, deliberative, and rational \nadministration in history has given way to a highly secretive and \npartisan operation that denies the people of this country the \nleadership they are owed.\n  Perhaps I am supposed to wait, as in the past, for news reports on \nSunday afternoon before the opening of financial markets in Asia to \nfind out what we would do if an economic catastrophe in fact unfolds.\n  It is an unsatisfactory and unacceptable state of affairs that the \nAmerican people and Members of Congress do not have updated and \nsufficient information about Treasury's cashflows and liquid assets, or \nthe contingency plans of our financial regulators. It is disturbing to \nme that in recent days Members of Congress in both Chambers have gone \nto their respective floors to discuss Treasury's cash and liquidity \nposition using information supplied either by large Wall Street \nfinancial institutions, or by nongovernmental think tanks.\n  Press reports of the U.S. Treasury's financial condition have also \nbeen relying on these sources. Why? Why do Members of Congress not know \ndetails of Treasury's projected cashflows for August? Why are we \nrelying on dated numbers Treasury gave us months ago? How can we decide \nwhether August 2, a threshold date estimated by Treasury back in May, \nis even close to some sort of deadline date for dealing with the debt \nlimit?\n  Maybe the date is July 29. I don't know, and neither the \nadministration nor the FSOC has told us. Maybe the date is August 15. I \ndon't know, and neither the administration nor the FSOC has told us. I \ndon't know. The American people don't know. This is unacceptable.\n  Wall Street firms have recently put out their own projections and say \nthat August 2 may not be relevant at all. Maybe it will be August 8 \nwhen Treasury runs into a cashflow problem. Maybe it will be August 13. \nDoes Treasury still believe August 2 is the date when cashflow problems \nare most likely to arrive, given new information on\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\ngovernment receipts since early May? If not, we need to know, and we \nneed to know how that assessment has been made. If so, then why is \nTreasury not telling us and showing us why?\n  My letter to FSOC members, which includes the Treasury Secretary, \nincludes a request for updated information about Treasury cashflows and \nliquid assets. Given warnings from the administration that there is \nspecial urgency to act by August 2, time is of the essence, so I asked \nto receive responses from the FSOC members by 5 o'clock today, which is \nnow an hour and a half ago. I have received no reply about Treasury \ncashflows and liquid assets. Nothing. Radio silence.\n  Television cameras can't be turned on in this town without capturing \nsome administration official reminding Americans about the looming \ndefault, but they are unable to provide Congress with the numbers that \nwould show when the default would happen, after all these months of \nrecommending we should know, and after warnings months ago.\n  Let me say this again. I asked for, and have not received, critical \ninformation about the state of our Nation's short-term finances that I \nspecifically requested from eight voting members of the FSOC, including \nthe Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n  I have received no response at all regarding the cash and liquid \nassets Treasury has and expects to have available. But worse than the \nrefusal by the Treasury Secretary and the FSOC members to inform us \nabout the Nation's cash position is their refusal to keep the American \npeople duly informed about the state of our finances. It is, quite \nsimply, a shirking of their responsibility to the citizens of this \ncountry. Rather than providing transparency--which we were promised--\nthe administration has chosen to scare Social Security recipients about \ntheir benefits in politicized debt-limit negotiations.\n  We are debating debt and deficit plans that involve trillions of \ndollars. Yet we only have guesses about how much cash the Federal \nGovernment expects to have in August from a nongovernment think tank \nand from Wall Street firms. This is unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, one of the most troubling aspects of this lack of \ndisclosure is the way it is affecting our Nation's seniors. I listened \nto my constituents in Utah, and many of them who rely on Social \nSecurity are very worried, and they are, frankly, scared. The Obama \nadministration has been hard at work frightening them about the \nprospects of default. More concerned about his election prospects than \nresolving this crisis, President Obama commented recently that he could \nnot guarantee Treasury would be able to make Social Security payments \nin early August.\n  Really? This fearmongering is shameful--absolutely shameful. For the \nPresident to threaten not to send out Social Security checks is a stain \non his Presidency. Those relying on Social Security benefits rightfully \ncount on timely payments. They worked hard and paid taxes, and timely \nbenefit payments are due to them. These payments can and should be \nassured, no question.\n  Why is the President using the politics of fear on our seniors? I \nthink we all know the reason. Given the information that is available, \nit appears that roughly $50 billion of Social Security payments are due \nduring August. Recent estimates from outside sources put flows in the \nTreasury of between $170 billion and over $200 billion in August from \nvarious tax receipts and other sources. That alone is more than enough \nto pay $50 billion in Social Security payments, with cash left over for \nthe $30 billion due on our debt in August and more.\n  Perhaps the President is worried about the timing of cashflows in \nAugust. Yet even if all $50 billion of Social Security payments come \ndue on August 3--and they won't--Treasury can easily get its hands on \ncash to pay those bills. According to the Daily Treasury Statement for \nJuly 26, Treasury has $5 billion sitting idle at the Federal Reserve. \nTreasury can call that up. They can call up the Fed right now and get \nthat $5 billion in cash.\n  Treasury has roughly $90 billion in mortgage-backed securities that \nit bought in the financial crisis to bail out the housing markets. It \nsold $10.6 billion of those just last month. Treasury can go out and \nsell more next week if it is worried about not having cash to pay \nseniors. It could raise almost $80 billion.\n  There are many more options for Treasury to get cash, and if the \nadministration had any concern for seniors it would have had its \nofficials working hard since at least May to ensure enough cash is \navailable in August. Treasury could easily have $50 billion of cash on \nAugust 3 to pay our seniors if it wants to do that.\n  Why, then, did the President choose to strike fear into all of our \nNation's seniors? Why would the President say to our seniors that he \ncould not guarantee there would be cash available to pay benefits in \nAugust when he can absolutely guarantee there would be cash available?\n  It seems clear the President has chosen to use fear and to scare \nseniors in order to boost his chances at reelection and to strengthen \nthe hand of our friends on the other side who are insistent on raising \ntaxes as a means of deficit reduction. If we raise taxes, I guarantee \nyou the other side will spend every dime of it. It will not be used to \npay down the deficit, and especially with a Presidential election in a \ncouple of years.\n  Using Social Security and the financial security of our seniors as \nbargaining chips in a political poker game over the debt ceiling is, to \nput it bluntly, shameful. To do so to try to raise taxes at a time when \nunemployment is 9.2 percent and trending up--and that doesn't even \ninclude the underemployment rate, which is hovering around 17 percent \nwhen you count those who will not even look for jobs anymore, and \nothers who will not work--well, it represents an odd way to express \nconcern about jobs.\n  The only reason Social Security payments would not be made in August \nby the administration would be a conscious choice by the administration \nto stiff seniors and to blame Republicans. It would be a conscious \npolitical choice, not a choice forced by the debt limit or lack of \ncash.\n  Well, Mr. President, it is time for me to conclude, but I want to be \nclear. The American public has been shortchanged by the new Financial \nStability Oversight Council that was created by the job-killing Dodd-\nFrank financial regulation act. That is one of the worst bills I have \nseen in all of my 35 years.\n  The FSOC, chaired by Treasury Secretary Geithner, has refused and \nignored my request for basic information about government finances and \ngovernment contingency plans in the face of dire warnings of threats to \nour Nation's financial stability.\n  I don't enjoy coming on the Senate floor and excoriating this \nadministration and the President and FSOC. But this is shameful. The \nAmerican people deserve transparency, and they deserve accountability. \nYet the administration and its regulators chose instead to withhold \ninformation from the people and their elected representatives in \nCongress. The refusal by members of FSOC, including the Treasury \nSecretary, to provide simple basic information about government \nfinances is unacceptable and requires investigation and action.\n  Mr. President, we have to get to where this government starts to work \nagain. We shouldn't have to rely on Wall Street for these figures or \nrely on Wall Street to know what the administration's plan is. We \nshouldn't have to rely on anybody except those who are designated to \nprovide this information. Unfortunately, they haven't done that.\n  I admit, I only gave them a few days, but they have been working on \nthis for months. I don't know about their office, but I tell you one \nthing. We get things done on time. We are at rug-cutting time on the \nfloor of the Senate and in the House of Representatives. We know August \n2 is the heralded date by this administration. Since they chose the \ndate, I think they should justify what they are going to do and how \nthey are going to do it; to make sure if we don't somehow increase the \ndebt ceiling, which I am not going to do, we at least know what their \nplan is.\n  I hope the administration will get a little more active on some of \nthese things that are so important on Capitol Hill--important to \nDemocrats as well as Republicans. We need to have the facts. We need \naccountability, we need transparency, and I am calling on the \nadministration to get on the ball.\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the urgent \nneed to act on the debt ceiling before the August 2 deadline. While I \nbelieve we have reached a defining moment as a country, which has not \nbeen wasted--we need to reduce our debt--we also can't afford to play \nRussian roulette with our economy by toying with the debt limit.\n  We have had months to work this out. Yet less than 6 days from a \npossible default that would plunge this country into a serious crisis, \nhere we stand in opposite corners of the boxing ring. The markets are \njittery, investors and businesses are deeply concerned, but, most \nimportantly, the people of this country are fed up with this political \nstalemate. They do not want their interest rates to rise, the value of \nthe dollar to fall, and they do not want to see their retirement \nsavings decimated again because some in Washington believe if they \nrefuse to compromise, the resulting crisis will score them political \npoints.\n  Ever since the economic downturn, families across the country have \nsat down at their kitchen tables to make the tough choices about what \nthey hold most dear and what they can learn to live without. We all \nknow those conversations. They have to end with compromise.\n  A poll released Monday by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that 68 \npercent of Americans say lawmakers who share their views on this issue, \non either side, say those lawmakers should compromise. So people who \nactually share a view with a particular lawmaker, 68 percent of them \nsay lawmakers should compromise, even if it means striking a deal they \ndisagree with.\n  Just 23 percent say lawmakers who share their views should stand by \ntheir principles even if it leads to default.\n  My colleagues and I don't need polls to tell us that. We have all had \nour offices flooding with calls and e-mails in the last few days from \nwell-meaning constituents with advice and from those who are mad and \nasking us to work it out. Just this morning I received this e-mail from \nDave and Cheryl of Northfield, MN. This is what it says:\n\n       Dear Amy,\n       The political positioning and wrangling over the Federal \n     Budget and debt ceiling limit has gone on long enough! It's \n     time for our elected leaders to step up and resolve the debt \n     ceiling and budget crisis in a mature, adult fashion. We \n     realize that this is easier said than done, but after \n     experiencing the shutdown of the State of Minnesota, it is \n     unconscionable to even have the possibility of the crisis \n     that we will face as a nation if we don't raise our debt \n     ceiling and begin reducing the deficit. We urge you and your \n     colleagues to do all it takes to resolve this issue prior to \n     the deadline. There has to be some compromise that can be \n     identified. Each side will need to give to make this happen--\n     let's focus on the art of compromise and get this wrapped up. \n     It's time to show the world that we are still a truly great \n     nation and can step up to resolve the challenges placed \n     before us. The greater good of the nation has to be placed as \n     a top priority. Hoping and praying for successful resolution \n     to the outstanding issues.\n\n  That is Dave and Cheryl of Northfield, MN--just citizens who sent an \ne-mail today. I wish everyone in this Chamber and everyone over in the \nHouse would listen to this today. I think it sums it up very well.\n  Outside the Halls of Congress there isn't much disagreement over the \nurgency to act or the consequences of failing to do so. There also \nisn't a lot of disagreement over the importance to our economy of a \nlong-term extension. Who seriously believes dragging this country \nthrough this again in 5 or 6 months will help our economy get back on \ntrack?\n  Economists and experts from across the political spectrum have warned \nthat a short-term approach would likely lead to a downgrade of our \ncredit rating, which would cost us billions of dollars more in interest \npayments on our existing debt and drive up our deficit. For families \nand businesses, it would mean a spike in interest rates, making \neverything from mortgages, car loans, and credit cards more expensive.\n  I think the most common refrain I hear from the business community in \nMinnesota when we talk about what it will take to spur investment and \ncreate jobs in this country is a need for certainty--certainty in the \nTax Code, certainty in expenses, certainty in our government's budget. \nLet's provide some certainty.\n  After months of debate, it is clear what sort of plan is needed to \ngarner the support necessary to get us across the finish line. We will \nall ultimately have to accept things with which we don't necessarily \nagree. It is time to get serious about advancing a deal that is both \nfair and achievable.\n  On August 2, the borrowing authority of the United States will be \nexhausted. No one benefits if we are unable to reach an agreement by \nthis deadline. Every day that passes without a deal only increases \nuncertainty in the markets and puts the brakes on economic activity. \nFailure to bring the national debt under control also threatens \nAmerica's future, but the danger of default threatens our economy \ntoday.\n  We have two options: We can either set a precedent of holding our \ndebt hostage to political maneuvering, raising the cost of borrowing \nand increasing our deficit at the same time or we can show the world we \nare serious about working together to address our fiscal challenges to \nreduce the debt, reduce the cost of borrowing, and strengthen our \nfinancial outlook. I believe the choice is clear, and I believe a lot \nof our colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that.\n  The sooner we can agree on a long-term package, the better for our \neconomy and the better for our country. It is time to put our political \ndifferences aside and work on an agenda that strengthens our economy, \npromotes fiscal responsibility, and increases global competitiveness \nbecause if we refuse to have an honest conversation, if we insist on \nusing the debate as a vehicle for rhetoric only, we will not just be \ndoing ourselves a disservice, not just be doing this institution a \ndisservice, we will be cheating our children and grandchildren out of \nknowing the America in which we grew up. If we are committed to our \ncountry and not to unmoving ideologies, we will get this done.\n  Last month, I received a lesson in what commitment as a public \nservant means when I attended the funeral of Jack Murray, who was the \nformer mayor of International Falls, MN, right on the Canadian border. \nIt is a town where they often test cars to show that they can withstand \nthe cold, but it is a hardscrabble, thriving town.\n  Mayor Murray was a decorated marine who served for 14 years as a \nmember of the city council and for 14 more years as mayor. He \nfiguratively and literally wore ``I love International Falls'' on his \nsleeve with a button he was never without. At his funeral--and he was \n89 years when he died--we heard countless stories of his commitment to \nhis city that didn't end when he retired. The priest at the funeral \ntold this story. He said that every morning, including the morning \nMayor Murray died, he would rise early and walk the streets of \nInternational Falls. He would wear his orange highway vest to keep him \nsafe, at 89, and he would have a cup of coffee and a bag for trash, and \nhe would walk the streets of his beloved town collecting trash up until \nthe day he died. He was a public servant to the end. He believed in his \ntown, in his State, and in his country. And that is an example for all \nof us now.\n  We are all public servants. We must have a commitment to the larger \ngood, to our country, and to the people we represent. None of us wants \nto see our economy crippled. Democrats don't want it. Republicans don't \nwant it. So what are we waiting for? It is time for Congress to step \nforth and show some leadership. It is time for us to work together to \nshow the American people that Washington isn't broken; that, instead, \nwe are willing to put aside our politics to do what we were elected to \ndo, to do what is right for America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are here awaiting the action \nof the House of Representatives. We don't know whether the House is \ngoing to pass the John Boehner proposal, but regardless of what they \ndo, we have the solution right underneath our noses. There have been \ndiscussions today. I have had a number of discussions with our \ncolleagues. I have had a discussion first this morning with my \ncolleague from Florida and I have had discussions with others.\n\n  It seems to me the obvious solution, since we are now at the eleventh \nhour and getting close to the 59th minute of the eleventh hour, is that \nwe take elements of the Reid proposal, the McConnell proposal, and the \nBoehner proposal. So I would suggest our leadership consider, \nregardless of what happens in the House--because the Senate is going to \nhave to act on something to get 60 votes to meet the filibuster \nthreshold in this Chamber and then send a package back to the House. I \nwould suggest it be this: that we take the Reid proposal which includes \nthe larger amount of spending cuts. Senator Reid at first said that is \n$2.7 trillion. Maybe it has been by CBO marked down to about $2.2 \ntrillion. But whatever that larger amount--clearly larger than the \nBoehner proposal, even though some would argue it is the Iraq and \nAfghanistan war wind-down savings we would get, but whatever it is, it \nis larger than the House proposal--and use that as the first cut by \nlifting the debt ceiling. But there would be a sequence of events that \nwould happen after that to avoid what the Senate Democrats do not want, \nwhich is that the markets and the rating agencies cause the debt \ninstruments--the U.S. Treasury bills--to be downgraded. There needs to \nbe certainty for those rating agencies, for the U.S. Government debt, \nand it could be achieved this way: We have a BRAC-like committee--that \nbeing a committee that would be composed equally of Republicans and \nDemocrats--that would come up with a package that would then come back \nto each House, no amendments, for an up-or-down vote.\n  The fail-safe backup, in case that committee were not able to come to \nagreement or in the event that it came back to both Houses and one of \nthe Houses did not pass it, that we would then have the McConnell \nproposal, which is that the President would request the increase of the \ndebt and there would be this procedure that Senator McConnell laid out \nthat there would be a resolution of disapproval. If there were such a \ndisapproval, then the President, of course, could veto it. In order for \nthe President's veto to be overridden, there would have to be a two-\nthirds vote. There would not be a two-thirds vote, and, therefore, \nthere is the assurance that we would have the raising of the debt \nceiling to get us through this next year and a half.\n  It seems as though it is right under our nose, if the parties will \njust realize that now is the time we have to act to find a workable \nsolution so we can get the votes.\n  If we can get, with that kind of proposal, 60 votes in the Senate, \nthen it goes down to the House, whether they pass the Boehner proposal \nor not. At the eleventh hour and the 59th minute, recognizing what is \nat stake for the country, then the House of Representatives is going to \ndo the right thing and they are going to pass it.\n  I am just a little country boy, but it seems to me sometimes we get \nso wrapped up in all the intricate details that the obvious solution is \nright there under our nose, staring us in the face. I respectfully \nrequest the Senate consider this.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5012-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5012-S5013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CRISIS IN THE HORN OF AFRICA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nongoing humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa. More than 11 million \npeople--twice the population of my State of Maryland--are now in need \nof emergency assistance to survive.\n  Large portions of the Horn of Africa region are now in the grip of \none of the worst humanitarian crises in the region in recent decades. \nNearly half of the population in Somalia is in urgent need of \nassistance, and malnutrition rates are on the rise in neighboring \nEthiopia and Kenya. Without the immediate action of the international \ncommunity, it is projected that an additional 180,000 people will \nperish in the coming months due to the drought and famine.\n  It is difficult to fully comprehend the levels of human suffering \ncurrently occurring in the region, as refugees flee famine-affected \nareas. People are literally walking for days without food and water to \ntry to reach food and safety. More than 166,000 desperate Somalis are \nestimated to have fled their country to neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia \nin recent months--approximately 3,500 people are arriving every day at \nrefugee camps in those countries compounding the already tenuous \nhumanitarian situation in the region.\n  On July 21, the United Nations declared a famine in two regions in \nsouthern Somalia. This declaration is not done lightly and is the first \ndeclared since 1992. Famine is only declared when acute child \nmalnutrition rates exceed 30 percent and more than 2 people per 10,000 \ndie per day. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, \nreports that the under-5 death rates in southern Somalia are higher \nthan 4 children per 10,000 per day in all areas and as high as 13 to 20 \nper 10,000 per day in areas of south central Somalia. Already, \noutbreaks of measles, cholera, and watery diarrhea have been reported \nin affected areas as well. Unless this is addressed immediately through \nimmunization campaigns and medical treatment, more people will perish \nfrom these preventable diseases.\n  The United States is one of the largest donors of emergency \nassistance to the region, helping more than 4.4 million of those in \nneed and providing over $431 million since last October. The actions \ntaken by our Nation and the international community in anticipation of \nthe drought last year has helped save countless lives. Through the \nFamine Early Warning System, we saw data come in, and we were able to \nmove resources into the region and implement programs to provide food \nin critically affected areas throughout the Horn of Africa. However, \nemergency assistance alone cannot solve the underlying long-term \nproblems. The United States continues to provide longer term \ndevelopment assistance through Feed the Future and other programs, \nwhich are working in the region to address the root causes of hunger \nand malnutrition.\n  USAID Administrator Shah was in Kenya last week and met with Somali \nrefugees there. He met with a woman who had traveled for 33 days by \nfoot with her two children and suffered a robbery along the way, in \norder to arrive at a refugee camp in Kenya and have access to safety, \nfood, and basic human security. He also visited with a 4-year-old boy \nwho, in the acute malnutrition wing of the hospital at the\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\ncamp, weighed only 19 pounds and was reliant on a nasal feeding tube \nand very specific feeding regimens in order to, hopefully, survive. \nThere are countless more stories like this, of people who risked their \nlives to bring themselves and their families to a safe environment.\n  This crisis has several contributing factors--most notably the worst \ndrought on record in 60 years, which has devastated crops and \nlivestock. But another major contributor to this crisis is the complete \nlack of governance in Somalia, a failed state for more than two \ndecades, and the ongoing conflict there and in particular, the al-\nQaida-affiliated Somali militia, al-Shabaab. Since 2009, al-Shabaab has \nprevented most Western aid organizations from operating in their \nterritory, and it is no coincidence that the areas of famine are areas \ncontrolled by al-Shabaab. My sincerest hope is that al-Shabaab will \nstand aside and allow international organizations to assist people in \ntheir territory, people essentially held hostage by this radical, \nIslamist group.\n  The U.N. estimates that an additional $300 million will be needed \njust in the next few months to help those affected by this humanitarian \ndisaster and that approximately $1.8 billion will be needed to fully \naddress the massive scope of this crisis and help the people in the \nHorn of Africa. Without this crucially important funding, nearly \n200,000 people could die. To date, this appeal is less than half way \nmet by the international community. The international community must do \nmore to meet this appeal.\n  This situation is a clear example of the critical importance of \nmaintaining a strong U.S. commitment to emergency food assistance. The \nHouse of Representatives passed a fiscal year 2012 Agriculture \nappropriations bill that would cut funding for emergency food \nassistance by 75 percent from just 3 years ago. This comes at a time \nwhen not only is there famine in the Horn of Africa, but around the \nworld needs are increasing as food prices remain high and the number of \npeople affected or displaced by natural disasters and conflict \ncontinues to increase.\n  The international disaster assistance level specified in the House \nState-Foreign Ops appropriations bill for fiscal year 2012 would result \nin emergency humanitarian programming reaching 19 million fewer \ndisaster-affected people than it would if the account were appropriated \nat the fiscal year 2011 level, based on average costs per person by the \nOffice of Foreign Disaster Assistance at USAID between 2006 and 2009.\n  If we cut the migration and refugee assistance and emergency refugee \nand migration accounts, as the House Foreign Operations bill does, we \nwould jeopardize U.S. support for many of the world's 48 million \nforcibly displaced people, the majority of whom are assisted and \nprotected by the international community. This includes almost 1 \nmillion Somalis. Before the current crisis in the Horn, 725,000 Somalis \nwere seeking refuge in the region. Since the onset of the current \ncrisis, 100,000 Somalis have arrived in Kenya and 75,000 in Ethiopia. \nObviously, cuts of that magnitude would lead to catastrophic \nconsequences. This could affect millions; primarily women and children \nsuffering from hunger as a result of conflict and natural disasters \nwould lose access to lifesaving food. This would significantly reduce \nAmerica's ability to address instability in volatile countries and \ndecrease its capacity to respond quickly to the needs of hungry people \naffected by conflict and natural disasters.\n  Aside from the national security implications for the United States \nin this already unstable region, the U.S. Government has a moral \nresponsibility to help the least fortunate, both at home and abroad. As \na global leader, the United States should not shy away from helping the \nleast fortunate, regardless of race, religion, or nationality. In \naddition, the United States should encourage greater international \nparticipation. It is the moral, human course of action to take, but it \nis also the smart thing to do: a more stable and prosperous Somalia \nkeeps the rest of the world and the United States more secure as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5013-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5013-S5014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL PARK SERVICE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I join Senator Mike \nJohanns and Congressman Adrian Smith of Nebraska in paying tribute to \nthe National Park Service, which will be celebrating its 95th \nanniversary this year on August 25, 2011.\n  The National Park Service currently administers 394 units across 49 \nStates and U.S. territories, including five National Park Service units \nin our home State of Nebraska. These units consist of the Agate Fossil \nBeds National Monument, Homestead National Monument of America, \nMissouri National Recreational River, Niobrara National Scenic River, \nand Scotts Bluff National Monument. In addition, the National Park \nService administers five National Historic Trails, including the \nCalifornia, Oregon, Pony Express, Mormon, and Lewis and Clark.\n  National Park areas generate $12 billion in tourism dollars to local \neconomies, creating 247,000 private-sector jobs. Within Nebraska, \nNational Park Service units generate approximately 8.8 million in \ntourism dollars and create approximately 170 private-sector jobs. And \nin western Nebraska, Agate Fossil Beds and Scotts Bluff monuments, \nalong with the Chimney Rock National Historic Site, which is an \naffiliated area of the National Park Service, generate close to $3 \nmillion in tourism dollars and create 90 private-sector jobs.\n  Nebraska has been supportive of the mission of the National Park \nService even before the agency existed. In fact, in 1914, 2 years \nbefore the National Park Service was created, citizens in the \nScottsbluff/Gering area sought to get a National Park or Monument \nestablished. Prominent local champions included elected officials and \nnewspaper editor, A.B.Wood.\n  Scotts Bluff National Monument is named for a fur trapper by the name \nof Hiram Scott who was wounded and deserted by his companions in 1828. \nHe gained immortality by making his way to a magnificent formation of \nbluffs along the North Platte River before succumbing to his wounds. It \nwas for Hiram Scott that Scotts Bluff National Monument, Scotts Bluff \nCounty, and the city of Scottsbluff have been named.\n  Scotts Bluff National Monument, which rises 4,649 feet above sea \nlevel, was an imposing landmark which guided wagon trains along the \nCalifornia, Oregon, Pony Express, and Mormon Trails. Native Americans \noriginally called this natural formation ma-a-pa-te, which translates \ninto ``hill that is hard to go around.''\n  The Summit Road to the top of the bluff was completed in 1937, \nallowing visitors to drive to experience the spectacular view of the \nvalley 800 feet below. This road is the oldest existing concrete road \nin Nebraska and includes the only three automobile tunnels in our \nState.\n  In the Scottsbluff/Gering area, numerous events to commemorate the \n95th anniversary of the National Park Service have been scheduled for \nAugust 2011, beginning with a Kick-Off Ceremony at Scotts Bluff \nNational Monument on August 12, 2011. Platte Valley Attractions, a \ncoalition of visitor venues in and around the area, is hosting a \nvariety of events and special exhibits through grants and donations \nfrom local and regional sponsors to commemorate the theme, ``Westward \nExpansion as seen through National Parks,'' including: Farm and Ranch \nMuseum is hosting westward expansion orientation films and an \ninteractive exhibit of westward expansion transportation methods.\n  Midwest Theater is hosting both the premiere of a new documentary \nfilm on the Pony Express and a film by Ken Burns on America's National \nParks.\n  North Platte Valley Museum is hosting a westward expansion map \nexhibit.\n  Western Nebraska Community College is hosting a seminar, \n``Recognizing and Preserving Westward Expansion,'' with speakers who \nare all nationally recognized in their fields.\n  Western Nebraska Community College sponsored a summer youth camp that \ndeveloped posters to help promote these commemorative events.\n  Again, on behalf of the people of Nebraska, we offer our \ncongratulations to Scotts Bluff National Monument on its Kick-Off \nCeremony and the National Park Service on its 95th anniversary.\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5014-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GENERAL JAMES E. CARTWRIGHT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to GEN James \nE. Cartwright, who is retiring after 40 years of accomplished military \nservice. Since becoming the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \non August 4, 2007, General ``Hoss'' Cartwright has testified numerous \ntimes and provided expert testimony, leadership, and advice to \nCongress, the President, and the American people regarding our Nation's \nsecurity and the future of our Armed Forces.\n  General Cartwright hails from Rockford, IL. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Iowa in 1971 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps shortly thereafter. The general served as a naval \nflight officer in the F-4 and as a pilot in the F-4, OA-4 and the F-18. \nHis flying career culminated with command of the First Marine Aircraft \nWing in Okinawa, Japan. The general is also a distinguished graduate of \nthe Air Command and Staff College and earned his master of arts in \nnational security and strategic studies from the Naval War College.\n  After an assignment as the Director for Force Structure, Resources \nand Assessment, J-8, on the Joint Staff, then-Lieutenant General \nCartwright was selected for promotion to general and became the first \nMarine Corps officer to lead U.S. Strategic Command. While at STRATCOM, \nGeneral Cartwright led the development of strategies during a rapidly \nevolving national security environment, particularly in the areas of \ncyber, space, nuclear proliferation, and missile defense. He \nreorganized the command to increase interagency cooperation and \nstreamlined operations. As a result of the changes the general \nimplemented at STRATCOM, the effectiveness of the command for the \ndeployed warfighter increased substantially to meet the new challenges \nof the 21st century.\n  During the last 4 years, General Cartwright has served as Vice \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. One of his top priorities has \nbeen to reduce the loss of American lives in combat by leveraging \ntechnology and streamlining acquisition processes to quickly iver new \ncapabilities to the battlefield. His efforts to lead the MRAP program \nresulted in a 50 percent decrease in deaths attributed to improvised \nexplosive device attacks.\n  The general can take pride in many other notable accomplishments, \nincluding the integration of technologies that enabled the destruction \nof a failing satellite by a missile for the first time and the \nsuccessful raid against Osama bin Laden.\n  During his service, General Cartwright took every opportunity to \nrecognize the efforts and sacrifice of the 2.4 million active, guard \nand reserve members of the Armed Forces and their families. He remains \nactively engaged for the benefit of our wounded warriors and always \nremembers the families of those who made the ultimate sacrifice on our \nbattlefields. General Cartwright will be remembered for his strategic \nintellect and his ability to drive innovative change. His tenure leaves \na lasting legacy to the Armed Forces. I appreciate his extraordinary \nservice to our country and wish him all the best in the next chapter of \nhis life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5014-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NAVAL AIR STATION WHIDBEY ISLAND\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

During this period, the earliest \nsquadrons of F4F Wildcats, PV-1 Venturas, F6F Hellcats and SDB \nDauntless's, also etched their place in U.S. Navy's distinguished \nhistory.\n  Naval Air Station Whidbey Island continued their legacy of excellence \nthroughout each subsequent conflict. Their patrol planes proved to be \nparamount to successful operations during the Korean War and their \ninitial deployments to Southeast Asia in 1972. Today, Naval Air Station \nWhidbey Island remains the premier naval aviation installation in the \nPacific Northwest.\n  Currently the proud home of the EA-6B Prowlers, EA-18G Growlers, P-3 \nOrions and the EP-3E Aries, I know Naval Air Station Whidbey Island \nwill continue to protect not only the Pacific Northwest, but the whole \nUnited States, for the next 100 years.\n  In recognition of the past century's naval aviation achievements, I \nwould truly like to thank the men and women both in and out of uniform \nand the veterans of Naval Air Station Whidbey Island for their service \nand sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5014-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5014-S5015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THOMAS E. ``JAKE'' FISHER\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay \ntribute to a dedicated public servant from my home State of Missouri. \nJake Fisher has devoted his professional life to helping others through \nhis work at the University of Missouri Delta Center.\n  Shortly after graduation from high school, Jake was employed at the \nUniversity of Missouri Delta Center as a farmworker I. From that \nposition, he was promoted to technician, senior technician, and \nresearch specialist. In 1986 he became the assistant superintendent. \nThree years later, Jake was promoted to Superintendent of the Delta \nCenter and continues to serve in that leadership role today.

He is a member of the \nexecutive committee of the Research Administrator's Society. Along with \nhis service to these organizations, Jake is a 32nd degree Mason and \nShriner.\n  Due to his selfless efforts, Jake has received numerous awards, \nincluding the State Farm Management Award in 1981 by Production Credit \nAssociation of Eastern Missouri. He was named ``Man of the Year in \nService to Agriculture'' by the Progressive Farmer Magazine in 1995 and \nin 1996 was granted honorary membership to the University of Missouri \nAg Alumni Association. He was awarded a lifetime membership to the \nCotton Producers of Missouri in 1997 and in 2000 received the \noutstanding staff award by the University of Missouri's College of \nAgriculture, Food and Natural Resources. In 2001, Jake was named ``Ag \nLeader of the Year'' by Missouri Ag Industries Council. He was honored \nwith the A.C. Burrows Service Award in 2009 by the Association of \nMissouri Electrical Cooperatives.

Dr. Linker dedicated his personal and \nprofessional life to helping others and was passionate about living his \nlife to the fullest.\n  Donald Linker was born and raised in Louisville, KY. He graduated \nfrom the University of Michigan and received his doctor of medicine \nfrom the University of Kentucky, School of Medicine.\n  Don served honorably in the U.S. Navy as a doctor treating marines in \nVietnam. After his service, he moved to San Francisco, married, and had \nthree children. He opened his own medical practice and after many years \nof practicing medicine, returned to school and received his master's in \npublic health from UC Berkeley.\n  Don Linker was an activist and philanthropist who was committed to \nbettering his community. He was a founding member of the Foundation for \nReed Schools in Tiburon and also served a number of other \norganizations, including the Jewish Community Federation, the American \nIsrael Public Affairs Committee, the Marin Community Federation, the \nBernard Osher Foundation, and the Buck Center for Research and Aging.\n  Don was an adventurous man with a fiery demeanor and an infectious \nspirit who loved travel and extreme sports. One of his passions was \npushing himself to the limit physically. He loved windsurfing, skiing, \nand mountain biking, and some of his greatest personal accomplishments \ninvolved those activities.\n  Don was a friend who will be greatly missed by all those whose lives \nhe touched.\n  I send my heartfelt sympathies to his family, including his son Kevin \nLinker, daughters Jodi Linker and Dana Linker, son-in-law Richard \nSteele, brother Stephen Linker and his grandchildren Lauren and Sarah \nSteele.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5015-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JORDAN BURROUGHS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to \nthe best collegiate wrestler in America, Jordan Burroughs, who is an \nAll-American from my alma mater, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n  Earlier this year Jordan was awarded the Dan Hodge Trophy, which is \noften referred to as the ``Heisman Trophy of wrestling.'' This award is \nnamed in honor of Dan Hodge, who was undefeated during his 3-year \ncareer at the University of Oklahoma. The criteria considered for the \nHodge Trophy, according to the University of Nebraska, are the \nwrestler's record, number of pins, dominance on the mat, past \ncredentials, quality of competition, sportsmanship, and heart.\n  Wrestling at 165 pounds, Jordan compiled an impressive 36-to-0 record \nthis last season and captured his second crown from the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association; his first was in 2009. Despite \nNebraska facing one of the toughest schedules in the Nation this year, \nJordan had only three matches this season which did not end by pin, \ntech fall, or a major decision.\n  Congratulations also go to Nebraska's head wrestling coach, Mark \nManning, who recruited Jordan from Winslow Township High School in \nSicklerville, NJ, where Jordan was listed as the seventh best high \nschool wrestler in the country. As Coach Manning says, ``Winning the \nHodge Trophy puts Jordan in an elite group of wrestlers and makes a \nstrong statement about him as an athlete.''\n  Most recently, Jordan Burroughs added to his list of impressive \ntournament wins by taking home his first senior international wrestling \ngold medal on July 17, 2011, at the Outstanding Ukrainian Wrestlers \nMemorial International in Kiev, Ukraine. There will be other matches \nbetween now and next year, but his ultimate goal is to compete at the \n2012 Summer Olympics in London, England.\n  From the Garden State to the Cornhusker State, Jordan Burroughs makes \nus all proud as America's best collegiate wrestler of 2011. As a former \nHusker, he will forever remain in the hearts of Big Red fans everywhere \nwho will continue rooting for him wherever his travels take \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5015-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO PAMELA LYNNE WELLER\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I wish honor Pamela \nLynne Weller, legal special assistant to Commissioner Thomas H. Moore \nat the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC. Ms. Weller is \nretiring after more than 26 years of distinguished Federal Government \nservice.\n  Pamela was born in Baltimore and has lived in Maryland for most of \nher life. She graduated with honors from the University of Maryland and \nreceived her law degree from Georgetown University.\n  Pamela began her Federal service during her last year of law school, \nwhen she worked for Senator Lawton Chiles on the Government in the \nSunshine Act, Public Law 94-409, and later for Senator Richard Stone. \nFor part of that time she actually worked for both Senators \nsimultaneously, for Senator Chiles as part of a law school program and \nas a salaried employee of Senator Stone. After graduation, she \ncontinued working for Senator Stone on a variety of important issues \nthrough the end of his term of office.\n  After leaving Senator Stone, she went to work at the Civil \nAeronautics Board, CAB, as an assistant to board member James Smith, as \nthe agency worked through the deregulation of the national air \ntransportation system, and then as it wound down its operations prior \nto being incorporated into the Department of Transportation.\n  Following nearly 10 years of continuous government service, Pamela \nwent to work in the private sector, opening her own law practice. She \ncontinued in this line of work for over 11 years, specializing in \nfamily law and real estate transactions.\n  In 1995, she went back into the public service to become an assistant \nto Commissioner Thomas H. Moore at the U.S. Consumer Product Safety \nCommission. During her work for Commissioner Moore, the longest serving \nCommissioner in the agency's history, she advised him on all agency \nactions including rulemakings, enforcement actions and administrative \nmatters. Additionally, she served as acting chief of staff during \nCommissioner Moore's 9-month stint as acting chairman of the agency in \n2001 and 2002. She also helped construct his 2007 legislative proposals \nto Congress, a number of which were incorporated into the Consumer \nProduct Safety Improvement Act of 2008, Public Law 110-314.\n  During her notable tenure at CPSC, Ms. Weller has played a \nsignificant role in protecting the public from unreasonable risks of \ninjury posed by consumer products. On numerous occasions, she has \ndemonstrated inspiring leadership and has always been considered a \nvalued employee at the CPSC.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to thank Pamela Lynne Weller for her \nhonorable service to our Nation, and I wish her a rewarding \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5015-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5015-5", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/28/senate-section/article/S5015-6", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5015-S5016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13441 WITH RESPECT TO LEBANON--\n                                 PM 16\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Security Act to \nexclude child care from the determination of the 5-year limit on \nassistance under the temporary assistance for needy families program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today too many families are at risk of \nlosing the child care assistance that helps maintain their financial \nstability and ensure the well-being of their children. That is why I am \nintroducing the Children First Act to address the growing unmet need \nfor affordable and safe child care.\n  Until now, most states were able to maintain their child care \nassistance programs through the recession due to the additional $2 \nbillion in Federal Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG, \nfunding for 2009 and 2010 from the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct, ARRA.\n  However, with only a portion of these ARRA funds being continued, and \nwith persistent state budget gaps, many states are forced to scale back \nchild care assistance for families. Some states' waiting lists for \nsubsidized child care are beginning to rise and a few states have \nstopped or plan to stop providing child care assistance to families who \nare not receiving Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, TANF, \ntogether.\n  Cuts and restrictions in the availability of child care assistance \nmake it harder for parents to afford child care and have forced some \nparents to leave their jobs and turn to welfare programs for support. \nChildren lose access to the stable, good-quality child care that \nencourages their learning and development and prepares them for school \nsuccess. And child care programs can find difficulty filling their \nclassrooms, leading them to lay off staff or close their doors \nentirely. That is wrong and we can do better.\n  Child care consumes a large portion of family budgets, and can cost \nup to $18,773 annually for full-time care depending on where the family \nlives, the type of care, and the age of the child. Child care prices \nare higher than other household expenses and typically exceed the \naverage amount families spend on food. In 39 States and the District of \nColumbia, the average annual price for child care for an infant in a \nchild care center was higher than even a year's tuition at some 4-year \npublic colleges.\n  Without assistance, many low-income families can find it impossible \nto secure child care. For example, in 2007, the median monthly income \nof families receiving child care assistance was just $16,680 a year. \nNearly half, 49 percent, of families receiving child care assistance \nlive below the poverty line and 86 percent of these families were \nsingle parent households. In these challenging economic times, it is \nespecially important to help low and moderate-income families with \ntheir child care costs.\n  The Children First Act which I am introducing today will help address \nthe growing unmet need for affordable and safe child care. It will \nhelp--States meet the significant demand for child care assistance by \nincreasing funding for mandatory child care by $500 million for fiscal \nyear 2012, $700 million in 2013, and $750 million in 2014 thru 2021, \nresulting in an increase of $3.45 billion over 5 years and $7.2 billion \nover 10 years.\n  This increase is necessary because only about one in six children \neligible for Federal child care assistance receives help and there have \nbeen no increases in mandatory' child care funding since 2007. This \nincreased funding will be used to provide approximately 212,000 \nadditional children access to safe and affordable child care as \ncompared to current funding levels.\n  The Children First Act would exclude child care from the definition \nof TANF assistance so that unemployed families who receive child care \nassistance will not have it count towards the 5-year time limit for \nFederal TANF assistance. The legislation would also ensure that the \nminimum child care health and safety standards required for providers \nreceiving Child Care Development Block Grant, CCDBG, funding also apply \nto providers who receive funding through TANF. In Massachusetts, all \nlicensed providers are required to the same health and safety standards \nregardless of subsidy type received.\n  This legislation would increase the availability of child care for \nparents who are required to work. States are currently prohibited from \nwithholding or reducing assistance to a single parent with children \nunder 6 who does not meet work requirements for reasons related to the \nunavailability or unsuitability of appropriate, affordable child care \narrangements. The Children First Act would prevent States from \nwithholding or reducing cash assistance to parents of a child with \nchildren under age thirteen.\n  Enactment of this legislation is incredibly important for my home \nState of Massachusetts which currently has approximately 24,000 \nchildren on a waitlist for child care subsidies. The high cost of child \ncare is the most significant issue facing families currently on the \nwaitlist in Massachusetts. Massachusetts families pay more on average \nthan families in all other states for child care, with the average \nprice of full time care in center based settings totaling $18,773 for \nan infant and $13,158 for a preschooler. This legislation will help \nlower the waitlist and help our children become more productive \ncitizens.\n  I would like to thank a number of organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of the Children First Act and who have \nendorsed it today, including the including the American Federation of \nState, County, and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, the Children's Defense \nFund, CLASP, the National Women's Law Center, and the Service Employees \nInternational Union, SEIU.\n  These reforms would significantly increase access to stable and \naffordable child care to low-income families and would make our \nNation's children more prepared for school and success later in life. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1437. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to carry out programs to provide youth in racial or ethnic \nminority or immigrant communities the information and skills needed to \nreduce teenage pregnancies; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Communities \nof Color Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Act.\n  Teen pregnancy is closely linked to a number of issues that affect \nthe welfare of children in our Nation, particularly child poverty. A \nchild in the United States is nine times more likely to grow up in \npoverty if their mother gave birth when she was a teen, if the child's \nparents are unmarried when they are born, and if the mother did not \ngraduate from high school.\n  The United States has the highest teen pregnancy rate of any \ndeveloped nation. Each year close to 750,000 teens in the United States \nbecome pregnant. Despite some progress in reducing teen pregnancy \noverall, many minority communities continue to struggle with \ndisproportionately high rates of teen pregnancy.\n  Over half of all Latina and African American girls will become \npregnant at least once before they turn 20. In 2009 the teen birth rate \nfor Latinas, African Americans and American Indians/Alaska Natives was \nmore than double the teen birth rate of non-Hispanic Caucasians.\n  The Communities of Color Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Act takes would \naddress teen pregnancy in communities of color by supporting teenage \npregnancy prevention programs that work with community-based \norganizations that are experienced in serving youth\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nin ethnic and racial groups with the highest teen pregnancy rates; \nusing multimedia campaigns to provide public health education and \nincrease awareness about teen pregnancy, and researching what factors \ncontribute to disproportionately high rates of teenage and unintended \npregnancy in communities of color.\n  I am proud that our country has made progress in reducing the rate of \nteen pregnancy by one third over the last decade, but our work is not \ndone. We need to strengthen our efforts, especially among the youth in \ncommunities of color who are now so much more likely to face the \nunexpected and difficult challenges of parenting before they have \nfinished growing up themselves.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Representative Lucille \nRoybal-Allard, who is sponsoring this legislation in the House, as well \nas Hispanas Organized for Political Equality, the National Campaign to \nPrevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, the Futures Without Violence, and \nthe National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in taking the next step forward in \npreventing teenage pregnancy by supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 1441. A bill to provide assistance for workforce investment \nactivities to unique populations in Alaska and Hawaii; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, Mr. Begich and I recognize that Alaska and \nHawaii's educational and workforce needs are linked to the indigenous \ncultures, learning styles, and geographical realities of our home \nStates. We would like to commend the University of Hawaii Maui College \nfor their hard work and dedication in developing a Remote Rural Hawaii \nTraining Project. Over the years, the University of Hawaii Maui College \nhas led the way in education and workforce development. Since the \ninception of the Rural Development Project in 1997, the University has \nsupported 300 hundred projects. The initial projects served over 29,000 \nparticipants. We would also like to praise Cook Inlet Tribal Council \nfor their dedication and efforts relating to workforce development for \nNative Alaskans. For example, in fiscal year 2010 the Alaska's People \nCareer center served 2,269 job seekers and they helped 58 people obtain \ntheir General Educational Development diploma. These initiatives, many \nmade possible by the unique environment created by the natural \nresources of Alaska and Hawaii, have proved to be an invaluable source \nof current and future growth of workforce development and training \nprograms. We are truly impressed by the innovative projects developed \nby these two organizations and we need continued support for workforce \ndevelopment in these unique populations in Alaska and Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1441\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Workforce Investment for \n     Unique Populations in Hawaii and Alaska Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ASSISTANCE TO UNIQUE POPULATIONS IN ALASKA AND \n                   HAWAII.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide \n     assistance to the Cook Inlet Tribal Council, Incorporated, \n     and the University of Hawaii Maui College, for the unique \n     populations who reside in Alaska or Hawaii, respectively, to \n     improve job training and other workforce investment \n     activities (as defined in section 101 of the Workforce \n     Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.)).\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may \n     be necessary for each of fiscal year 2012 and each subsequent \n     fiscal year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1443. A bill to extend certain trade preferences to certain least-\ndeveloped countries in Asia and the South Pacific, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Asia-\nSouth Pacific Trade Preferences Act to help some of the world's poorest \ncountries sustain vital export industries and promote economic growth \nand political stability.\n  This legislation will provide duty free and quota free benefits for \ngarments and other products similar to those afforded to beneficiary \ncountries under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  The countries covered by this legislation are 13 Least Developed \nCountries, LDCs, as defined by the United Nations and the U.S. State \nDepartment, which are not covered by any current U.S. trade preference \nprogram: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Laos, \nMaldives, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, East Timor, Tuvalu, and \nVanuatu.\n  They are among the poorest countries in the world.\n  Nepal has per capita income of $240. Unemployment in Bangladesh \nstands at 40 percent. Approximately 36 percent of Cambodia's population \nlives below the poverty line.\n  Each country faces critical challenges in the years ahead including \npoor health care, insufficient educational opportunities, high HIV/AIDS \nrates, and the effects of war and civil strife.\n  The United States must take a leadership role in providing much \nneeded assistance to the people of these countries.\n  Yet humanitarian and development assistance should not be the sum \ntotal of our efforts to put these countries on the road to economic \nprosperity and political stability.\n  Indeed, the key for sustained growth and rising standards of living \nwill be the ability of each of these countries to create vital export \nindustries to compete in a free and open global marketplace.\n  We should help these countries help themselves by opening the U.S. \nmarket to their exports as we have done for other developing countries \nin the past.\n  By doing so, we will demonstrate the best of American values: \nreaching out to a neighbor in need and helping him to stand on his own \ntwo feet.\n  Success in this endeavor will ultimately allow these countries to \nbecome less dependent on foreign aid and allow the United States to \nprovide assistance to countries in greater need.\n  But make no mistake. These countries will not automatically receive \nthe trade benefits provided by this legislation.\n  Our efforts to promote economic growth, jobs, and political stability \nwill fail if these countries are strangled by human rights abuses, \ncorruption, and the absence of the rule of law.\n  Instead of lifting the citizens of these countries out of poverty and \ngiving hope for a better future, we will ignore our values and sustain \nthe status quo.\n  So, this legislation has been drafted to ensure that the benefits are \ngranted on a performance-driven basis.\n  That is, to be eligible, a beneficiary country must demonstrate that \nit is making continual progress toward establishing rule of law, \npolitical pluralism, the right to due process, and a market-based \neconomy that protects private property rights.\n  So, this legislation would help promote democracy, human rights, and \nthe rule of law while sustaining vital export industries and creating \nemployment opportunities.\n  The beneficiary countries have a clear incentive to stay on the right \npath or they will lose the benefits of this bill.\n  I firmly believe that these benefits will make a difference.\n  The garment industry is a key part of the manufacturing sector in \nsome of these countries.\n  In Nepal, the garment industry is entirely export oriented and \naccounts for 40 percent of foreign exchange earnings. It employs over \n100,000 workers, half of them women, and sustains the livelihood of \nover 350,000 people.\n  The United States is the largest market for Nepalese garments and \naccounts for 80-90 percent of Nepal's total exports every year.\n  In Cambodia, approximately 250,000 Cambodians work in the garment \nindustry supporting approximately one million dependents. The garment \nindustry accounts for more than 90 percent of Cambodia's export \nearnings.\n  In Bangladesh, the garment industry accounts for 75 percent of export \nearnings. The industry employs 1.8 million\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\npeople, 90 percent of whom are women, and sustains the livelihoods of \n10 to 15 million people.\n  Despite the poverty seen in these countries and the importance of the \ngarment industry and the U.S. market, they face some of the highest \nU.S. tariffs in the world, averaging over 15 percent.\n  In contrast, countries like Japan and our European partners face \ntariffs that are nearly zero.\n  Surely we can do better.\n  By targeting the garment industry, we can make a real difference now \nin promoting economic growth and higher standards of living.\n  This legislation will help these countries compete in the U.S. market \nand lift their and let their citizens know that Americans are committed \nto helping them realize a better future for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  Doing so is consistent with U.S. goals to combat poverty, \ninstability, and terrorism in a critical part of the world. We should \nnot forget that the vast majority of the people from these beneficiary \ncountries are Muslim.\n  The impact on U.S. jobs will be minimal.\n  Currently, the beneficiary countries under this legislation account \nfor only 4 percent of U.S. textile and apparel imports, compared to 24 \npercent for China, and 72 percent for the rest of the world.\n  These countries will continue to be small players in the U.S. market, \nbut the benefits of this legislation will have a major impact on their \nexport economies.\n  At a time when we are trying to rebuild the image of the U.S. around \nthe world, we need legislation such as this to show the best of America \nand American values. It will provide a vital component to our \ndevelopment strategy and add another tool to the war on terror. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1443\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Asia-South Pacific Trade \n     Preferences Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n     least-developed countries to promote stable and sustainable \n     economic growth and development.\n       (2) Trade and investment are powerful economic tools and \n     can be used to reduce poverty and raise the standard of \n     living in a country.\n       (3) A country that is open to trade may increase its \n     economic growth.\n       (4) Trade and investment often lead to employment \n     opportunities and often help alleviate poverty.\n       (5) Least-developed countries have a particular challenge \n     in meeting the economic requirements of and competitiveness \n     necessary for globalization and international markets.\n       (6) The United States has recognized the benefits that \n     international trade provides to least-developed countries by \n     enacting the Generalized System of Preferences and trade \n     benefits for developing countries in the Caribbean, Andean, \n     and sub-Saharan African regions of the world.\n       (7) Enhanced trade with least-developed Muslim countries, \n     including Yemen, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, is consistent \n     with other United States objectives of encouraging a strong \n     private sector and individual economic empowerment in those \n     countries.\n       (8) Offering least-developed countries enhanced trade \n     preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and \n     direct investment in support of positive economic and \n     political developments throughout the world.\n       (9) Encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and \n     investment barriers will enhance the benefits of trade and \n     investment as well as enhance commercial and political ties \n     between the United States and the countries designated for \n     benefits under this Act.\n       (10) Economic opportunity and engagement in the global \n     trading system together with support for democratic \n     institutions and a respect for human rights are mutually \n     reinforcing objectives and key elements of a policy to \n     confront and defeat global terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the presentation of a United States \nflag on behalf of Federal civilian employees who are killed while \nperforming official duties or because of their status as Federal \nemployees; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Civilian \nService Recognition Act of 2011. This bill ensures that the next of kin \nof Federal civilian employees killed in the line of duty are presented \na United States flag honoring the service and sacrifice of their loved \none. This legislation is co-sponsored by Senator Lieberman and is a \ncompanion to a bi-partisan bill introduced by Representative Hanna.  \nRepresentative Hanna's bill was recently reported favorably by the \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform by unanimous voice vote.\n  Every day, Federal civilian employees serve our nation at home and \nabroad, fulfilling critical roles that protect our citizens, our \neconomy, and our freedom. Some put their lives at risk when doing so. \nApproximately 100,000 Federal civilian employees have served alongside \nthe U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last decade. Since \n1992, nearly 3,000 Federal civilian employees have died in service of \ntheir country, including 24 killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Employees \nwho make this ultimate sacrifice deserve the utmost gratitude and \nrespect from their nation.\n  U.S. law currently requires that a United States flag be presented to \nthe next of kin of deceased U.S. military veterans, but no law or \ngovernment-wide policy requires that Federal civilian employees killed \nin the line of duty be similarly recognized. Some Federal agencies have \nalready established internal practices to honor employees killed in \nservice with a U.S. flag, but others have not. Every Federal civilian \nemployee who dies as a result of their honorable service to this \ncountry should at least be recognized with the symbolic but nonetheless \nsignificant appreciation embodied in the presentation of an American \nflag.\n  The bill I am introducing today would remedy the current \ninconsistency. It requires that Federal agencies present a flag to the \nnext of kin of Federal civilian employees killed in the line of duty. \nIn the unusual circumstance where the national security, such as in the \ncase of a covert employee, or employee misconduct dictate otherwise, \nthe requirement would not apply. It is a modest but meaningful step in \nexpressing our condolences and gratitude to the families of those \nkilled while serving this country; reminding Federal employees that \ntheir service and sacrifices are appreciated; and highlighting the \nimportant role\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\nFederal employees play, sometimes at great personal risk, in promoting \nthe general welfare of this great Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1444\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
