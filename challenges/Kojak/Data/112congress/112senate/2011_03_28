Mr. President, first, I welcome you and everyone back after \nthe break we had doing work at home. I hope everyone had a productive \nweek.\n  The past week was a productive one for the most crucial and closely \nwatched discussion in Congress--our negotiations to keep the country \nrunning with a responsible budget for the rest of the fiscal year.\n  Though the Senate and House Chambers have been dark, Senators and \nMembers of Congress worked together every day last week--me, my staff, \nthe White House, and the House of Representatives, members of both \nparties, members of the congressional leadership, and members of the \nAppropriations Committees--we have all been in contact. We have worked \nhard to make progress and pursue an agreement and a budget that best \nserves the American people. Democrats' priorities and goals have not \nchanged from day one. We are committed to a long-term budget based in \nreality, not ideology. We are committed to keeping the country running, \nnot using the American people as political pawns or to score political \npoints.\n  We are more than willing to make smart cuts, but we are unwilling to \ndo so on the backs of hard-working, middle-class families and the jobs \non which they depend. We are ready to make tough choices that \nstrengthen our country and strengthen our economy but will not make \narbitrary or careless cuts that weaken it.\n  Let me briefly update the Senate on the progress of these talks and \nhow far we have yet to go.\n  On our side of the negotiating table, we have made a proposal. That \nproposal makes significant cuts but will not hurt our fragile economy. \nWe are also honest with ourselves and the country: We readily recognize \nthat in the end, we will not get everything we want. That is true of \nany fair and reasonable negotiation. We recognize sacrifices are the \ncost consensus, and we believe they are worth it.\n  But on the other side, Republicans refuse to negotiate on a final \nnumber. That is because the biggest gap in this negotiation is not \nbetween Republicans and Democrats; it is between Republicans and \nRepublicans.\n  The infighting between the tea party and the rest of the Republican \nParty--\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\nincluding the Republican leadership in Congress--is keeping our \nnegotiating partner from the negotiating table, and it is pretty hard \nto negotiate without someone on the other side of the table to talk to.\n  Republicans have to resolve their own deep disagreements before we \ncan find middle ground between the two parties. We have tried to wait \npatiently for them to do that, but our patience and the patience of the \nAmerican people is wearing very thin.\n  We have only 2 weeks before the current temporary budget expires. \nTime is not on our side. It is time, I say to my Republican colleagues, \nto get to work. Work out your differences.\n  I, once again, remind the Senate that our willingness to compromise \nis in recognition of reality. We have already voted on a Democratic \nproposal and a Republican proposal. We have seen in practice--not just \ntheory--that neither plan can pass unless it is adjusted. We all know \nneither party can pass a bill without the other party and neither \nChamber can send that bill to the President without the other Chamber.\n  Democrats have long ago acknowledged that we need Republicans to pass \na bill. But Republicans still have not admitted to themselves they need \nDemocrats to pass a bill. Cooperation and compromise are not just good \nideas. They are not political slogans. They are essential to the \nendgame. With a cooperative spirit and willingness to compromise, we \ncan move the country forward. Without them, we cannot. It is as simple \nas that.\n  I can only speak for my Democrats when I say we are ready to \nnegotiate and legislate. We are ready to do our jobs. But we cannot \nnegotiate with ourselves, and we will not negotiate through the media. \nOnce the Republicans settle their own internal disagreements and decide \nfor what they stand, we will get this done. Until that happens, the \ncountry waits, watches, and worries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/28/senate-section/article/S1880-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today, as the American naval aviators \nin the Mediterranean wait offshore to fly combat missions against the \nLibyan Army, as marines wait for the call to go ashore to rescue a \ndowned pilot, or as Air Force pilots fly combat air patrol, we are \nconfident that all military orders will be met with the same \nprofessionalism and skill we have come to expect of our All-Volunteer \nForce. The valor and loyalty of the men and women of our Nation's Armed \nForces have never been in question. Yet, despite that certainty, many \nAmericans view our military intervention in Libya with anxiety and \nuncertainty. They are wondering why U.S. forces are once again engaged \nin combat action against an Arab regime in the Middle East. They are \nwondering when this operation will end and when their loved ones will \nreturn. And they are asking another reasonable question: What is the \nmission?\n  If the American people are uncertain as to our military objectives in \nLibya, it is with good cause. The President has failed to explain up to \nthis point what follows the evident establishment of a no-fly zone over \nLibya as it was originally described. Further, the President has \narticulated a wider political objective of regime change in Libya that \nis not the stated objective of our military intervention, nor is it the \nmandate of the U.N. resolution the President has used as a \njustification for our military efforts there.\n  Now that the objective of establishing a no-fly zone has been reached \nand our NATO allies are ready to assume the command and execution of \nthis mission, it is fair to ask, what is the role of our military and \nmilitary alliance in providing support to an opposition we are only now \nbeginning to understand?\n  These concerns and questions are equally relevant here in the Senate \nand in the Congress since it is the responsibility of Congress to \ndeclare war, if it is war, and, of course, to fund our military \noperations.\n  The President stated:\n\n       There is no decision I face as your commander in chief that \n     I consider as carefully as the decision to ask our men and \n     women to use military force. Particularly at a time when our \n     military is fighting in Afghanistan and winding down our \n     activities in Iraq, that decision is only made more \n     difficult.\n\n  Yet this latest decision was taken without adequate consultation with \nCongress or sufficient explanation to the American people.\n  Since returning from South America, the President has begun to talk \nin greater detail about our involvement in Libya. For the second time, \nhe has discussed our operations in and around Libya with the \ncongressional leadership. Over the weekend, he devoted his entire \naddress to the topic, and he will speak to the American people tonight \nabout our operations in Libya. All of this is welcome and, in my view, \noverdue.\n  Before addressing what answers I hope to hear from the President this \nevening, let me address the notifications to Congress that the \nPresident made.\n  Prior to the initiation of combat activities in Libya, the \ncongressional leadership received two forms of notification of the \nPresident's decision to order Americans into harm's way. Prior to \ndeparting for his overseas trip, the President notified the \ncongressional leadership of his plans to send American forces into \ncombat action in a limited, discrete role to destroy the integrated air \ndefenses of the Libyan Government and to enable our allies to establish \na no-fly zone over Libya. The second notification was a written \ncommunication as part of his responsibilities under the War Powers \nResolution.\n  Throughout his communications with the congressional leadership, the \nPresident has emphasized that the U.S. military would not undertake \nground combat against the Libyan Army and that the American combat role \nwould be limited in time, scope, and would be used simply as a means \n``to set the conditions for our European allies and\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\nArab partners to carry out the measures authorized by the U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution.''\n  The President and his military advisers and commanders have explained \nthat the overwhelming American capabilities to destroy enemy air \ndefenses, target command-and-control structures, jam communications \nsignals, and monitor the battlefield would all be employed to allow \nNATO and the coalition to assume responsibility for the no-fly zone. It \nwas the limited nature of our combat role that encouraged me that the \nPresident was acting within his article II authorities as Commander in \nChief. And the actions by NATO over the past few days to take over \ncommand and responsibility for the no-fly zone are consistent with the \nPresident's commitment that ``limited U.S. actions will set the stage \nfor further action by our coalition partners.''\n  Here I am reminded of the important contribution of Secretary of \nDefense Robert Gates in advising the President since he came to office. \nThe President is fortunate to be able to call upon the wisdom of this \nseasoned national security expert in considering our operations in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and Libya. It was Secretary Gates who reminded the \nAmerican people of the risks inherent in military intervention. I know \nhis views will be critical as we transfer further responsibilities to \nthe coalition, and I hope the administration pays close attention to \nwhat he says.\n  This week, NATO will consider the last part of the mission that must \nbe transferred. What the United Nations resolution refers to as \nprotection of civilian personnel has included attacks on Libyan ground \nforces and strike missions conducted by American warplanes. If U.S. \nmilitary forces were to have responsibility for close air support or \nexecute additional strike missions in support of opposition forces, \nthen that, of course, would exceed the President's definition of a \nlimited, supporting role. Such a mission could last indefinitely and \nwould trigger congressional consideration of our larger role in the \nwar.\n  My expectation is that the President will explain this transfer of \nresponsibility in his speech tonight and that NATO will resolve this \nissue this week, ending our efforts there as the primary force.\n  As the commander of U.S. African Command, GEN Carter Ham has said:\n\n       Our mandate--again, our mission--is to protect civilians \n     from attack by the regime ground forces. Our mission is not \n     to support any opposition forces.\n\n  General Ham has also said:\n\n       We do not operate in direct support of the opposition \n     forces.\n\n  So as President Obama addresses the Nation this evening, like many \nAmericans, I will be listening for answers to the following questions: \nWhen will the U.S. combat role in the operation end? Will America's \ncommitment end in days, not weeks, as the President promised? What will \nbe the duration of the noncombat operation, and what will be the cost? \nWhat national security interests of the United States justify the risk \nof American life? What is the role of our country in Libya's ongoing \ncivil war?\n  The President made clear that our combat forces' role in Libya will \nbe limited in scope and duration. Tonight, I hope he will reiterate \nthat pledge or ask Congress before extending the duration or scope of \nour mission there. And, as always, our thoughts are with the brave \nyoung Americans in places such as Helmand Province and Baghdad, those \nin Japan helping the Japanese people recover from the natural disaster \nthere, and with those who are once again off the shores of Tripoli.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/28/senate-section/article/S1881-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1881-S1883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the floor of this \nChamber for the first time as a Senator. I am honored to have this \nopportunity to be a voice for Arkansans who want to change the \ndirection our country is headed so that we still have a great nation to \nleave behind for future generations, just as the greatest generation \ndid for us.\n  I am eager to carry out the traditions of this body and I am honored \nto serve alongside my distinguished colleagues. The traditions set \nforth and established in this Chamber have long been admired and often \nimitated in governments around the world. The work done here sets an \nexample of how people of different backgrounds and expertise can come \ntogether for the betterment of this country. We need to provide results \nby balancing the budget, cutting the deficit, creating jobs and putting \nour differences aside to work for the best interests of our country. I \nam up for the task assigned by the American people.\n  We are a nation of great thinkers and innovators and I am confident \nthe ideas proposed and debated here will put us on the continued path \nto success. There is no question that we have faced difficult times in \nour Nation's history. We have been tried and tested before. We have \nweathered the storms and have always emerged as a better, stronger \ncountry.\n  The debates and issues we face today are just as challenging as those \nfaced by the men and women who served in this body before us. As the \nfirst Republican elected to this Arkansas Senate seat since \nreconstruction, it is evident that Arkansans and all Americans are \nanxious for new results with new leaders to move our country into the \nfuture.\n  When I look back at the Senators who have served the great State of \nArkansas, I am inspired by their service, dedication and commitment.\n  Growing up in Fort Smith, in Sebastian County, we were taught at an \nearly age about William Sebastian. At 36, he was the youngest Senator \nin the 30th U.S. Congress after leading an already distinguished career \nas a cotton farmer, judge and State legislator.\n  Hattie Caraway broke the glass ceiling, becoming the first woman to \nserve in the U.S. Senate. She recognized the important role of \nagriculture to the State and requested a seat on the Agriculture \nCommittee. There is no doubt agriculture is still critical to the State \ntoday. My predecessor, Senator Blanche Lincoln, was the first woman to \nchair the Agriculture Committee and I am pleased to have a seat on that \nsame committee and be part of the debates and discussions as we \nformulate future agriculture policies.\n  Throughout history, our State has been represented in this body by a \ndiverse group of men and women who have put Arkansas and America first \nand I am honored to follow in their footsteps.\n  Each of these individuals had their generation's crises to address. \nWe have our own as well.\n  The American people are worried. And rightfully so. Some of them have \nto check the morning news to see if they still have a job. Still many \nother able-bodied, ready-to-work Americans have not received a paycheck \nfor months, some for years now.\n  Between November and December of last year, unemployment rates \nincreased in 72 of the 75 counties in my home State of Arkansas.\n  And these are not small hits to our communities. A plywood plant in \nFordyce, a town of 5,000 closed its doors, displacing almost 350 \nworkers. That is more than 14 percent of the town's population.\n  It is not any easier in the State's larger cities either. In Fort \nSmith, Arkansas's second largest city, a leading appliance manufacturer \nlaid off 850 employees last year.\n  Even our Nation's largest retailer, and Arkansas's largest employer, \nis not immune to this crisis. The economic downturn forced Wal-Mart to \ncut hundreds of jobs in its corporate office in Bentonville.\n  Like much of the rest of our Nation, Arkansas's job creators are \nnervous. It is hard for a small business owner to invest in their \nbusiness and create jobs if they are concerned about the negative \nimpact actions in Washington will have on their bottom line.\n  Given the right tools and circumstances, small business owners can \nand will create good paying jobs for the people of Arkansas and all \nAmericans. We need to create policies that empower the private sector. \nThat means fostering an environment that promotes economic certainty \nand encourages growth and innovation.\n  We can see results of the combined efforts of city, county, State and \nFederal leaders with Mitsubishi's decision to build a wind-turbine \nmanufacturing plant in Fort Smith. The region's business leaders spent \nmore than a year\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\ncompeting with more than 60 other U.S. cities to attract Mitsubishi, \nresulting in as many as 400 new good-paying jobs in the Fort Smith \ncommunity.\n  This is how we stimulate the economy.\n  Unfortunately, instead of taking that approach to creating a \nbusiness-friendly environment in our communities, Washington's agenda \nover the past few years has created a climate of uncertainty.\n  From past experience, I know this hampers the private sector's \nability to create jobs.\n  Before entering public service, I practiced optometry at a clinic my \nbrother-in-law and I started in Rogers, AR. Over the course of 24 \nyears, our little clinic grew from 5 employees to 85 employees and is \nnow a leading provider of eye care in northwest Arkansas. We were able \nto grow over the years because we could plot our course with some \ndegree of certainty. While no one can see the future, we could, with a \nfair degree of confidence, understand what our tax burden would be, \nwhat our energy costs would be and what our health care costs would be.\n\n  What we are hearing today from small business owners and investors is \nthe exact opposite. They are afraid to invest any capital, because they \ndon't know what their taxes will be; afraid to hire another employee \nbecause they are nervous about what that does to their health care \ncosts; and afraid to expand until they know how big their energy bill \nis going to be.\n  Compound that uncertainty with the excessive spending, and you have a \nrecipe for a disaster. While Americans tighten their belts, they watch \nin disbelief as Washington throws taxpayer money around with reckless \nabandonment.\n  The extent of this problem is documented in a recent report by the \nGovernment Accountability Office. The report highlights wasteful \nspending by revealing a number of duplicative programs within the \nFederal Government which come with a price tag estimated to be in the \nbillions.\n  There is simply no room for wasteful spending, especially when much \nof that money is not ours. Forty cents of every dollar we spend is \nborrowed, much of which is owed to countries that are not always \nfriendly to us, countries like Saudi Arabia and China, the latter of \nwhich now owns more than $1 trillion of our debt.\n  In testimony before Congress, ADM Mike Mullen said the greatest \nthreat to our sovereignty is not Iran; not al-Qaida; not radical Islam, \nit is our national debt. He is right. We simply cannot continue to \noperate at this pace.\n  We cannot continue to add billions to our already staggering national \ndebt. This year alone, the Federal Government will spend $3.7 trillion \nwhile only collecting $2.2 trillion. It does not take an advanced math \ndegree to understand that 3 is greater than 2.\n  The average American family doesn't have the luxury to spend beyond \nits means. Their government should not, and does not, either. We must \nas a nation quit spending money we do not have.\n  The only way we will get a handle on this situation is to reform the \nmanner in which we budget and allocate Federal dollars. It is time we \nput mechanisms in place to stop the government from spending beyond its \nmeans.\n  This is why one of the first bills I signed my name onto after taking \nthe oath of office was Senator Richard Shelby's balanced budget \namendment. Senator Shelby has been a champion on this front for a \nnumber of years, introducing this bill every session of Congress since \n1987. Imagine what the country would look like if it had passed when he \nfirst proposed it. Now, more than ever, it is an idea that's time has \ncome and I look forward to working with the Senator from Alabama to get \nsome sort of spending cap like a balanced budget amendment passed.\n  This is a catalyst for change. It holds us to spending limits and \nforces changes in the manner in which taxpayer money is allocated.\n  We are at a crossroads in our country. We cannot keep kicking the can \ndown the road. The ``tax, borrow, spend'' philosophy is not creating \njobs; it is only creating more debt for our children and grandchildren.\n  We owe it to the generations of Americans who have made sacrifices in \norder for our country to prosper and that means working together to \nsolve our problems.\n  No matter what political views we hold, at the end of the day we are \nall Americans who are committed to seeing our country succeed.\n  As a child, I learned that commitment from my dad who retired as a \nmaster sergeant in the Air Force. He followed in the steps of his dad \nwho served in the Armed Forces during World War I and World War II.\n  We have a great ability through the power of this office that allows \nus to help Americans with issues they are facing. For our veterans who \nreturn home, a Senate office can be a huge resource. That is what \nhelped my mom's dad when he returned home at the end of WWI. After \nsurviving being gassed as the war wound down, his lungs did not \nfunction properly and he reached out to Senator Davis to help him with \nhis disability.\n  Today, as our servicemembers return from tours in Afghanistan and \nIraq, we have the same responsibilities to the men and women who fight \nfor our freedoms and interests of our country.\n  No matter what major legislative crisis we are facing, we have a \nresponsibility to these brave men and women. And the debates that take \nplace in this body are no doubt of great importance, but so is each \nconstituent who is having trouble with a Federal agency. In some cases, \nwe are their last resort to overcome a major obstacle in their lives \nand each and every case that comes before us must be given our \nundivided attention.\n  When I was first elected to Congress as a Member of the House in \n2001, former Congressman John Paul Hammerschmidt, who represented the \nThird District of Arkansas for 26 years, gave me some excellent advice. \nHe said: ``John, always remember, now that the election is over, there \nare no more Republicans, no more Democrats, only the people of Arkansas \nand you need to take care of them.'' That is the key to good governing \nand good public service. Nobody embodied that more than John Paul. He \nwas and is a dedicated public servant and has been a wonderful mentor \nduring my time on Capitol Hill.\n\n  I think Arkansas's new congressional delegation is going to make John \nPaul proud. Certainly our senior Senator Mark Pryor has embodied John \nPaul's mantra of taking care of the people of Arkansas. I have enjoyed \nworking with Senator Pryor while serving the third district of Arkansas \nand appreciate his leadership. I believe our delegation, working \ntogether, will be able to make a difference for the people of Arkansas \nand for our Nation.\n  The Senators who served Arkansas before Senator Pryor and myself and \nthose who have sat at these very desks understood their desk never \nbelonged to them personally. It has always belonged to the American \npeople. My name, carved in the desk, will always remind me that I am \nhere to serve them. I am humbled and honored that the people of \nArkansas have selected me to work from this desk for the next 6 years, \nand I will never forget why. I am here to be their voice, address their \nneeds, and help tackle the great challenges we face as a nation. I look \nforward to working with each and every one of my colleagues to \naccomplish our mutual goals to keep our country on the path of \nprosperity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I congratulate our colleague from \nArkansas on his first speech and remark at how fortunate the people of \nArkansas are to have him here representing them. I was particularly \ninterested in the history lesson he taught us about various individuals \nwho served the State of Arkansas both in the seat he now holds and \nother positions of responsibility. Again, on behalf of all Senators, I \ncongratulate the junior Senator from Arkansas for his initial speech.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last Wednesday marked the 1-year anniversary \nof the deeply flawed health care bill. The worst aspect of that bill is \nthat it will lead to health care rationing by the Federal Government. \nThat is the delay and denial of care in order to control costs. The \nwords ``ration,'' ``withhold coverage'' and ``delay access to care'' of \ncourse are not found anywhere in the bill. But new Federal rules that \naim to reduce health care costs will inevitably result in delayed or \ndenied tests, treatments, and procedures deemed too expensive and in \nless innovation in the development of drugs, devices, and treatments. \nMany of the decisions will be based on information provided by a new \nentity called the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, \nsometimes referred to as the PCORI. That will conduct comparative \neffectiveness research.\n  Comparative effectiveness research weighs the effectiveness of two or \nmore health care services or treatments. The goal is to provide \npatients and doctors with better information regarding the risks and \nbenefits of, for example, a drug versus a surgery for a particular \nsituation. The problem is not with the merits of the research but \nwhether the research should be used by the government to determine \ntreatments and services covered by one's insurance. The health care law \nactually empowers the Secretary of Health and Human Services to do just \nthat, to use this comparative effectiveness research when making \ncoverage determinations.\n  Section 6301 of ObamaCare states:\n\n       The Secretary may [. . .] use evidence and findings from \n     research conducted [. . .] by the Patient-Centered Outcomes \n     Research Institute.\n\n  That means the government, not patients and doctors, has the power to \nmake health care decisions that affect you. A bureaucrat decides if \nyour health care is an effective use of government resources without \nregard to the patient's individual needs and medical history. The end \nresult is the government inevitably interferes with access to care. \nThat is rationing, and it is wrong.\n\n  While ObamaCare includes limited safeguards for how this research may \nbe used--appreciating the dangers involved--there is nothing that \nprohibits the government from taking it into account when, for example, \nmaking Medicare coverage decisions.\n  In fact, when asked whether the Federal CER agency should be involved \nin cost determinations, Donald Berwick, the President's recess-\nappointed head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, responded:\n\n       The social budget is limited.\n\n  Ask citizens in Britain how well the system is working in their \ncountry. Britain's National Institute for Health and Clinical \nExcellence--called NICE--routinely uses comparative effectiveness \nresearch to make cost-benefit calculations.\n  Last year, NICE rejected a cutting-edge drug, Avastin, used to treat \nbowel cancer because it said the drug's limited effectiveness for \nextending life--they said 6 weeks; but up to 5 months according to the \nchief executive of the organization, Beating Bowel Cancer--they said it \ndid not justify the cost. As Mike Hobday, head of policy at the \ncharity, Macmillan Cancer Support, told Britain's Daily Telegraph:\n\n       We think this is devastating news for cancer patients with \n     metastic colorectal cancer, especially as this drug could \n     have a significant impact on peoples' quality of life. \n     Although a few extra weeks or months might not sound much to \n     some people it can mean an awful lot to a family affected by \n     cancer.\n\n  Likewise, in August 2008, NICE recommended against coverage of four \nexpensive drugs for advanced kidney cancer. NICE considered the drugs \nclinically beneficial in specific situations but concluded they ``were \nnot cost-effective within their licensed indications.''\n  Health care in Britain is also routinely delayed. Several years ago, \nthe country's National Health Service launched an ``End Waiting, Change \nLives'' campaign--``End Waiting, Change Lives.'' The campaign's goal \nwas to reduce a patient's wait time to 18 weeks from referral to \ntreatment. That is 4\\1/2\\ months, and that is an improvement.\n  Government-run health care systems that ration care are the reason \nmany Europeans and Canadians come to the United States each year to get \ntreatments denied to them in their own countries.\n  Access to the highest quality care and the sacred doctor-patient \nrelationship are the cornerstones of U.S. health care--the very things \nAmericans value most and that the health care law jeopardizes.\n  So I will join Senators Coburn, Barrasso, Roberts, and Crapo in \nintroducing the Preserving Access to Targeted, Individualized, and \nEffective New Treatments and Services Act of 2011. That is also known \nas the PATIENTS Act.\n  The PATIENTS Act does not prohibit comparative effectiveness \nresearch; rather, it is a propatient firewall that protects patients' \naccess to high-quality care by prohibiting the Federal Government from \nusing comparative effectiveness research to delay or deny care.\n  Additionally, the bill would require comparative effectiveness \nresearch to account for differences in the treatment response and \npreferences of patients, genomics and personalized medicine and the \nunique needs of health disparity populations and it would clarify that \nnothing shall be construed as affecting the FDA Commissioner's \nauthority to respond to drug safety concerns.\n  All Americans deserve personalized treatment and should be able to \nget the care they and their doctors decide is best for them. No \nWashington bureaucrat should interfere with that right by substituting \nthe government's judgment for that of a physician.\n  The administration has repeatedly promised that the health care law \nwill not result in rationing. Well, if that promise is true, they \nshould have no problem supporting the PATIENTS Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity the \nleadership has provided for Senator Snowe and me to present S. 493 and \ncontinue to discuss this important bill. It is a very important program \nthat has actually existed at the Federal level for 20 years. It is not \na household word, but it is known very well in the small business \ncommunity. It is supported by groups such as the Small Business \nAssociation, the Chamber of Commerce, and many high-tech organizations \nbecause they know the same thing we know, which is this is a very \nimportant Federal program that actually works and is accomplishing its \nmission.\n  It is a government/public-private partnership--a government-business \npartnership--with the largest Federal agencies that actually set aside \na small portion of their research and development dollars. The amount \nis actually relatively small; 2.5 to 3 percent of all of their \ndevelopment and research dollars is set aside, and they aggressively \nlook for small businesses that are able to provide new services, \ncutting-edge technology, new methodology, new software, to solve \nproblems the government is having.\n  In the process of these small businesses solving problems for the \ngovernment--i.e., the taxpayer--the great news is some new businesses \nare developed, and they can then be commercialized into the private \nmarket, which is how this program works, which is why it is so \nbeneficial not only to taxpayers but to the market generally.\n  I am excited because we have great evidence from the studies and the \nsurveys of this program that it is meeting and exceeding its \nexpectations. It is creating thousands of jobs. It is providing an \nopportunity for small businesses to compete on a level playing field \nwith large businesses, and it is providing the taxpayer with some \ncutting-edge technology and innovation.\n  Let me give one example which is close to my heart because we ran \ninto this problem specifically and directly trying to deal with the \naftermath of Katrina. This is just one example of the kinds of new \ntechnologies that are being developed through this program. This bill, \nwhich we hope will get passed this week if we can negotiate wisely and \nsmartly on the amendments pending, will reauthorize this program for 8 \nyears. This is a long-term reauthorization, and it is important to send \na signal out to the market and to small businesses and to these \ncoalitions: We believe in this partnership. We know it can work. We \nwant to give a long lead time and an 8-year runway to lift off some of \nthese businesses and launch them and to create the kind of jobs and \nentrepreneurial opportunity we know is out there.\n  This is just one example. A Huntsville, AL, company, GATR \nTechnologies, inflatable antenna--an inflatable antenna provides \nemergency access, cell phone coverage and phone lines over satellite \nnetworks. It was first used by responders in Haiti and Hurricane Ike. \nIt provides communication support to our Special Operations Forces, to \nU.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force. It so far has created 30 jobs but has \ntremendous opportunity; last year, $7 million in sales and this year \napproximately $10 million. This technology was launched with a $148,000 \ngrant.\n  What happened to us in the aftermath of Katrina--and the Presiding \nOfficer may remember this--is that even the government's best satellite \nphones failed to work. So even with a great evacuation plan in place, \nwith a great medical plan in place, with a great response plan in \nplace, it is not worth the paper it is written on if you can't \ncommunicate it.\n  So what we found was when people landed with satellite phones, there \nwasn't enough reception base on the ground to be able to communicate. \nThe technology has advanced significantly since then, but the same \nthing happens when you are trying to get communications in a war-torn \nplace or a catastrophically destroyed place. This technology allows \nbasically a balloon to be put down onsite, substantially increasing the \ncommunications capabilities.\n  This is just one example. So an agency had a problem. It couldn't \ncommunicate. It didn't have the right kind of communication technology. \nIt puts out a small grant. Small business responds. This technology is \ncreated. Potentially, this could go on to develop into quite a large \ncompany. It might morph several times before it goes commercial, but \nthat is what this program does.\n  These jobs are being created in Huntsville, AL. We are thrilled for \nAlabama. Jobs are created through this program in every State in the \nUnion.\n  Here is another example. This is a small business from Watertown, MA. \nIt is the A123 lithium-ion battery. The advanced lithium-ion battery is \nused widely for transportation power grid and commercial and industrial \nproducts. It opened the largest lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant \nin North America, in Michigan, a place where we need to be creating \njobs. This program is doing exactly that. It has created more than 400 \njobs across the State of Michigan.\n  I think this grant initially came out of the Energy Department. The \ntechnology was initially developed at MIT, but the road to commercial \nsuccess was paved in 2002 when this company was awarded $100,000 for a \nsmall business innovation research grant. So this successfully \nleveraged this SBIR grant to take this lab and its product to the \nmarket. It employs now more than 2,000 people globally and has \nfacilities around the world.\n  So this is creating jobs for America, new technology for America, but \nthe world is benefiting from this. In fact, Senator Snowe has joined me \non the Senate floor, and she will remember when we had testimony from \nour consultant, Dr. Weissman, who testified that actually as the chief \nreviewer of this program, he has been asked to speak in many different \ncountries about its success.\n  So while people are trying to eliminate government programs that \naren't working, let's make sure this week in the Senate we take the \nopportunity to reauthorize programs that are working and that are \ncreating jobs at home and serving as a model for entrepreneurship \ndevelopment all over the world.\n  I see Senator Snowe is on the floor, so I am going to wrap up my \nopening remarks soon. I do want to review briefly. As I said, this \nprogram was designed in 1982 to harness the innovative capacity of \nAmerica's small businesses to meet the needs of our Federal agencies. \nSenator Warren Rudman from New Hampshire had a great part to play as a \nlead sponsor of this bill.\n  To date, the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small \nBusiness Technology Transfer Program have produced more than 85,000 \npatents and have generated tens of thousands of well-paying jobs across \nall the 50 States, in addition to creating jobs overseas that are a \nbenefit to America as well. This is a good return on the investment we \nmake for our economy. As I said, it has garnered high praise from well-\nrespected sources and governments around the world. It is an 8-year \nauthorization.\n  In this bill, we update the award sizes, which have not been changed \nsince 1994. Phase I awards will be increased from $100,000 to $150,000; \nphase II, from $750,000 to $1 million. We adopted the House measure \nthat allows the SBA to update these award guidelines annually instead \nof every 5 years. We also put certain amounts of caps on some of the \nawards to make sure as many businesses as possible get access to these \nawards. This is merit-based. This is not a formula distributed based on \napplications. These are based on the quality of the application, the \npromise of the technology, and also on the level of need the agency has \nfor this kind of new technology.\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\n  As I said, it creates a Federal-State technology partnership program. \nIt improves the SBA's ability to oversee and coordinate these programs. \nIt provides some administrative funding, which we thought was lacking, \nto make sure the agencies themselves have the wherewithal and the \nexpertise to really get this program maximized in its job-creation \npotential. The reason I think this is so important--and Senator Snowe \nand I have been almost singly focused on doing everything we can, \nleading this Small Business Committee, across party lines and together, \nDemocrats and Republicans--is to try to put this recession behind us. \nThis is a fight. This is not something that will happen naturally. It \nis going to be by this government in Washington and at the State and \nlocal levels creating atmosphere for businesses to prosper and jobs to \nbe created.\n  I have to say I was very pleased to get a copy of the ``Kaufman Index \non Entrepreneurial Activity,'' which I will submit a portion of for the \nrecord. I think people will be pleased to hear its opening paragraph, \nas follows:\n\n       In 2010, .34 percent of the adult population, which is 340 \n     out of 100,000 adults, created a new business each month.\n\n  That means that in America, 565,000 new businesses were created each \nmonth in 2010, approximately. That is pretty extraordinary. Every \nmonth, 565,000 new businesses were launched. We know all of them don't \nsucceed, but some of them do, and some of them grow to be huge, \nextraordinary companies. QualComm comes to mind, and Microsoft comes to \nmind. They started as small businesses and grew. The 2010 \nentrepreneurial activity rate was the same as 2009, but it represents a \nsubstantial increase from 2007 and, most significantly, represents the \nhighest level over the past decade and a half.\n  I wish I could say this particular program was responsible for all of \nthis, but obviously it is not. But it is one of the tools the Federal \nGovernment has, along with our contracting and procurement tools, along \nwith our Tax Code, along with our other incentives that we passed in \nour last small business bill--the new $30 billion lending program, \nwhich is leveraged up to 300 and potentially could leverage up to $300 \nbillion in lending to small businesses on Main Street, not Wall \nStreet--getting money to small businesses, these 565,000 small \nbusinesses that are started every month by great Americans who are \ntrying to provide a livelihood for themselves, opportunities for their \nfamilies, and strength for their communities. So for innovation and \njobs, fighting hard for them, we are trying to pass this \nreauthorization that can contribute to this substantial growth. Things \nare looking better. Trendlines are in a positive direction.\n  Let me show you some other growth lines that are very important. We \nhad a terribly substantial loss of jobs, as you know, in 2008 and 2009. \nThe President largely inherited this situation. He did not even take \noffice until half of this job loss was completed. But I think we have \nbeen working together and the President has been leading a great effort \nto turn this situation around and start creating jobs as opposed to \nlosing them. You can see this is a pretty dramatic turnaround. After \nlosing 3.6 million in 2008 and 5.5 million in 2009, we have had a net \nincrease of 1.3 million in 2010, with things looking promising in the \nfirst quarter of 2011--still moving in a very positive direction. I \ndon't know what these projections are, but I think it will be greater \nthan 1.3 million, which was last year's increase, which would be \nencouraging.\n  We have a long way to go to make up for the job loss of the great \nrecession. When Wall Street collapsed, the housing market, the real \nestate market was terribly wounded. That is a story for another day. \nBut the good news is that it looks as if we are recovering.\n  The unemployment rate is still too high in too many places in this \ncountry. That is why Senator Snowe and I are on the floor again this \nweek. That is why we are asking our colleagues to be as cooperative as \npossible. We know there are so many issues people want to talk about, \nand time is limited on the floor. In our minds, we should be almost \nsingularly focused on job creation and reducing the debt and closing \nthis deficit. By creating jobs and building businesses in the private \nsector--and this is one program that absolutely hits this mark--we can \ndo all three. We can create jobs and expand economic opportunity. We \nare making a dent in the debt, and we are closing the deficit gap by \ncreating new tax dollars that come in from hard-working Americans in \nthe private sector.\n  Mr. President, I am excited to present this bill again. We will have \na lot more information as the day unfolds. I understand we have a vote \non a different matter at around 5 or 5:30 today. Senator Snowe and I \nwill be on the floor to answer any questions Members might have. We are \nnot encouraging additional amendments. We already have 89 that have \nbeen filed on this bill. We are hoping to get some of them withdrawn \nthat are not germane to the bill.\n  We will be working throughout the week, and hopefully together we can \ngive a very strong vote of confidence to entrepreneurs who are taking \nextraordinary risks in very challenging times. The least we can do is \nget the government programs that are there for them to support them up \nand running and as strong as possible to help them in their quest to be \nsuccessful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the chair of the \nSmall Business Committee to address the pending legislation before the \nSenate, which is so essential to helping to revitalize our economy and \nmost especially the small business sector that is central to the job-\ncreation abilities in this country.\n  The programs that would be reauthorized in the legislation pending \nbefore the Senate are extremely important to the ability of small \nbusinesses to be engaged in innovation and advancement in our economy \nand the businesses they are in. It helps to assist in the technology \nand the entrepreneurial spirit that is so essential for America, which \nhas obviously been an innovative nation throughout our history.\n  The two pending programs before the Senate are very crucial. I hope, \nlike the chair, that we will be able to get to a point to consider the \nremaining amendments the Senators may have to offer so that we can move \nquickly and expeditiously to vote on the bill, so it can move forward \nand ultimately become law. The SBIR and STTR programs have had a \nlongstanding history, most specifically with the SBIR Program, \nregarding innovative research, which has been in law since 1982 because \nit has been extremely worthwhile and beneficial. It has been the \nsubject of numerous reports essentially because it has been able to \nproduce jobs and the innovation that has advanced this Nation.\n  In fact, there are two assessments--one by the National Academy of \nSciences and another report from the Information Technology and \nInnovation Foundation--both underscoring that it is imperative to \nreauthorize these programs but also demonstrating their essential value \nto our Nation's economy--most especially from the standpoint that, of \ncourse, small businesses are the job creators.\n  Two-thirds of all new jobs in America come from small businesses. \nObviously, they represent more than 99.7 percent of the employers in \nAmerica. It is absolutely critical that we do everything we can to buoy \nthis segment of the economy. The more we procrastinate in moving this \nlegislation forward, the less likely we are going to see jobs created \nin our economy and get this economy to move forward. Frankly, it is \ncritical, given the fact that we need to create more than 285,000 new \njobs per month for 5 years just to return to the unemployment levels we \nwere experiencing in 2007 at prerecession levels. We could be 10 years \naway from normal unemployment and full recovery if we do not make \nsubstantial strides in creating at least 285,000 jobs every month for 5 \nconsecutive years and, most possibly, 8 consecutive years to achieve \n5.5 percent unemployment rate. To achieve a 7-percent unemployment rate \nwould require us to create 300,000 jobs per month.\n  We experienced an uptick in job creation numbers last month of a \n192,000, but that has been the exception, not the norm, over the last \n2\\1/2\\ years. In fact, there are only 3 months in 2\\1/2\\ years in which \nwe have achieved those levels.\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\n  I am just underscoring how difficult it is going to be to create the \njobs we need in order to return to normal prerecession levels of \nunemployment. That is why the pending legislation is so critical and \nvital to this endeavor.\n  I wish to reiterate some of the anecdotal information that came to \nthe committee that, again, emphasizes the value of these programs.\n  Roland Tibbetts, the father of the SBIR Program, summed up its \npurpose most vividly when he said that ``SBIR addresses a paradox at \nthe heart of innovation funding: capital is always short until the test \nresult are in. At the idea stage, and even the early development stage, \nthe risks are too great for all but a few investors. But innovations \ncan't get beyond that stage without funding.''\n  SBIR provides the funding for promising small firms, by directing \ncritical research and development funding within 11 critical agencies \nwithin the Federal Government to perform the necessary testing and \nassess the validity of an idea and subsequently commercialize the \nproduct. As we know, small businesses are looking for the kinds of \ninitiatives that can provide the catalyst for creating that innovation.\n  It is all about taking risks. Risk means investment. There are few \nopportunities in America now with respect to having access to early-\nstage capital. The programs before us represent just that. It is \nimportant for creating the middle-class jobs we need, and the fact is \nthat small and medium-size businesses really do the majority of the \nhiring and firing, as Thomas Friedman noted in his book, The World is \nFlat. When they are hiring people, the economy is robust. When they are \nnot, it is in recession, which is precisely what we are recovering from \ncurrently.\n  We have to move these programs forward, and hopefully that \nopportunity is going to come sooner rather than later. Hopefully, we \ncan accomplish that at the end of this week because I think it is \nimportant to send the right message and a signal to give certainty and \nstability that small businesses and medium-sized businesses are \ndesperately searching for.\n  Dr. Jacobs, cofounder of Qualcomm, who testified before our committee \nin February, revolutionized the wireless communication industry. As we \nboth have noted earlier when we began debating this legislation, they \napplied for $1.5 million in SBIR funding almost 25 years ago. Today \nthey have 17,500 employees. They paid approximately $1.4 billion in \ntaxes in fiscal year 2010, more than half the cost of the SBIR and STTR \nprograms annually.\n  Dr. Jacobs noted in his testimony that SBIR funding ``allowed us to \npursue several innovative programs that otherwise would not have been \npossible.'' He went on to note that:\n\n       Cutting-edge research leads to breakthrough discoveries, \n     but in order for companies to attract private funding, they \n     need support to prove the feasibility of new and often risky \n     and unproven technologies. For Qualcomm, SBIR provided one \n     source of that critical start-up funding. . . . it was one of \n     the critical ``stamps of approval'' that allowed us to \n     successfully pursue sources of private capital.\n\n  Dr. Matt Silver, the cofounder of Cambrian Innovation, an \nenvironmental product development firm from Massachusetts, informed the \ncommittee that six SBIR awards--or, in his words, ``relatively small \ngrants''--enabled his company to attract angel and direct investment, \nhire seven employees, file several provisional patents, and develop \nrelationships with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Penn \nState for collaborative R, among other opportunities. His company's \nstory is a remarkable example of the success that can be garnered from \na relatively modest investment by Federal agencies in new and promising \ntechnologies.\n  Additionally, 2 weeks ago, the House Small Business Committee also \nheld a hearings on these programs. I would like to briefly share some \nquotes from the testimony of several witnesses.\n  Professor David Audretsch noted that the United States `` . . . is no \ndoubt more innovative, more competitive in the global economy and has \ngenerated more and better jobs as a result of the SBIR'' Program. \nAdditionally, he summarized that ``The evidence accumulated from a \nbroad spectrum of studies utilizing divergent methodologies all comes \nto the same result--the SBIR program has unequivocally made an \ninvaluable contribution to the innovative performance of the United \nStates.''\n  There are a number of specific examples of how the SBIR Program has \ncontributed to the vitality of our economy and how it has advanced the \ntechnological developments that have occurred in America.\n  Furthermore, the Government Accountability Office has reviewed \ndifferent aspects of the SBIR Program over the course of its history \nand has come to a number of positive conclusions. Specifically, the \n2005 GAO report on the program summarized that, one:\n\n       SBIR is achieving its goals to enhance the role of small \n     businesses in federal R, stimulate commercialization of \n     research results. . . .\n       . . . more than three-quarters of the research conducted \n     with SBIR funding was as good as or better than any agency-\n     funded research. Agency officials also rated the research as \n     more likely than other research they oversaw to result in the \n     invention and commercialization of new products--\n\n  And--\n\n       The SBIR program successfully attracts many qualified \n     companies, has had a high level of competition, and \n     consistently has had a high number of first-time \n     participants.\n\n  Combining those assessments that I have just cited with the National \nAcademy of Sciences's landmark 2008 study, which I have spoken about \nearlier, SBIR and STTR clearly provide remarkable benefits to the \nAmerican people. But also there is a larger picture for the Nation's \nentrepreneurs and job creators.\n  Small businesses are facing a veritable confluence of challenges from \nall sides these days, whether it is exorbitant costs through more taxes \nor crippling tax burden and regulations. There are a number of \namendments pending before the Senate that I think would be vital to \nenhancing that dimension of helping our small businesses with respect \nto fighting burdensome regulations.\n  That is why Senator Coburn and I have introduced a regulatory reform \nbill we hope we will offer as an amendment to the pending legislation \nbecause we think it is important to address the numerous regulations \nthat have imposed significant burdens on a number of businesses across \nthis country.\n  If we just look at the average cost to small businesses in America, a \nbusiness with 20 or fewer employees pays $10,585 per employee in annual \nregulatory costs. That is 36 percent higher than larger firms. \nAdditionally, our Tax Code is so complex that taxpayers and businesses \nspent 7.6 billion hours and about $140 billion trying to comply with \ntax-filing requirements in 2008.\n  I do believe it is important we make strides in the regulatory arena \nbecause it is clear that small businesses cannot move forward having to \ncomply with not only the additional costs but also the burden because \nthere are so few employees in a small business. They are saddled with \nincessant and unnecessary paperwork, as we saw demonstrated with the \n1099 filing requirement that was included in the overall health care \nlaw.\n  As we all know--and we are almost in unanimous agreement that we \nshould repeal that onerous provision, but we have not reached that \npoint. Hopefully, we will with respect to our legislation. We know \nSenator Johanns has filed an amendment to the pending bill, but we want \nto address that issue because it has provided a burdensome impact on \nsmall businesses across the country, even though it has yet to be \nenforced because it is not required until 2012.\n  The point is, businesses are already calculating the cost of having \nto comply with that paperwork. Because of the additional costs, because \nthey do not know the extent to which it is going to add to the cost of \ntheir bottom lines, they are hesitant about hiring new individuals or \nmaking investments in capital equipment.\n  The sooner we can address this issue, the sooner we can repeal it and \nresolve the outstanding issues in terms of how we are going to pay for \nit, the sooner small businesses can understand the certainty with \nrespect to this individual provision.\n  As I have conducted numerous street tours in my State, I can tell you \nthis is the one issue that comes up repeatedly because, for every small \nbusiness, they\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\nare starting to calculate how many forms they will have to submit to \nthe IRS for every $600 in business transactions. Not only is that \npaperwork burdensome but also it is going to add additional costs, not \nto mention, obviously, the fact that we are going to hire thousands \nmore in Internal Revenue Service agents just to comply with this \nparticular mandate.\n  I hope we can tackle this major problem and bring it to a final \nconclusion with respect to resolving this issue and to repeal it once \nand for all. It is regrettable it has taken so much time to get to this \npoint. I know we worked mightily to address this issue, but clearly it \nis not sustainable for small businesses. I am hopeful we can move \nforward with this effort to repeal this provision and this requirement \nthat clearly will represent, I think, a major step forward in \nunderstanding the dimensions small businesses are facing in today's \nenvironment.\n  As I stand here with my colleague, the chair of the Small Business \nCommittee, I hope we can proceed to passing this legislation. I urge \nMembers to come to the floor if they have amendments to begin to \naddress those issues so we can advance this legislation at the \nconclusion of this week because I do think it is in the best interest \nof the small business community but, more importantly, it is also in \nthe best interest of our Nation's economy, given the fact that we have \nto create jobs, and that obviously is not happening to the degree \npeople deserve in this country.\n\n  There are a number of agencies that will be part of the scope of this \nlegislation that will be setting aside the research and development \ndollars that play a critical role in innovation. It does not require \nadditional funding. It is based on existing research and development \ndollars that are already appropriated to these agencies. But it is \nsaying: Let's set it aside for small businesses to make sure they can \nhave one piece of the pie when it comes to research and development \nbecause that is where we derive most of the innovation and the \nentrepreneurship--from the small business sector of our economy. Not \nonly can it add jobs in America but, ultimately, as we saw with the \nexample of Qualcomm, we can add to the dimensions of growth \nexponentially for decades to come.\n  This is a generational issue as well because we know we have to take \nthe small steps to ultimately reach the large developments that can \noccur with the initial investments that are taken even with a modest \nsum of money. We know that is true in biotechnology, for example, which \ntakes 10 to 15 years to bring a drug online. It can require millions, \nif not billions, for pharmaceuticals to do that.\n  Again, the SBIR Program has been essential and central to that \neffort. That is why the Biotechnology Industry Organization and the \nNational Venture Capital Association also support this legislation \nbecause it can provide the initial boost that is a catalyst for the \ndevelopment of major drug therapies in this country.\n  Dr. Charles Wessner, who authored the landmark National Academy of \nSciences report, underscored in his testimony to our committee about \nthe SBIR Program and highlighted the work the SBIR Program created as a \nresult of these investments. He said:\n\n       The program brings in over a third new companies every \n     year. This is really extraordinary. It is not captured by a \n     small group. Twenty percent of the companies are created \n     because of the awards, bringing things out of the research \n     community into the market, its core function. It encourages \n     partnership with the university community. . . . Almost 50 \n     percent of the firms that get awards reach the market.\n\n  These numbers, again, demonstrate the incredible role the SBIR \nProgram plays in our Nation's capacity to innovate. That is essentially \nwhy it was created at the outset. If we look historically as to when \nthe SBIR Program was created, it was in 1982. I was an original \ncosponsor of that legislation when I was serving in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. But it coincided as well during a similarly difficult \neconomy. In fact, at that time, we were in the midst of a recession. \nNow we are struggling to emerge from a recession and trying to create \njobs. The same was true at that point in time. In fact, we were at the \nheight of it.\n  Dr. Jere Glover, who has served as the chief counsel at the SBA's \nOffice of Advocacy, testified before our committee. He concluded:\n\n       Twice before, we have seen the President and Congress look \n     at the situation where we are coming out of severe recessions \n     and decide that the SBIR program was important. President \n     Reagan in the early Congress in 1982 decided that this was an \n     important thing to do to create jobs, to help grow innovation \n     and technology. Again in 1992, Congress doubled the SBIR \n     program, with the support of President Bush. So we have seen \n     recognition in the past, when you are in a severe economic \n     time, it is time to call on small business innovation.\n\n  He urged us to do that now. I concur with his call for us to use this \nopportunity to reauthorize these critical programs that will jump-start \nour Nation's economy through small business and talents they bring to \nbear when it comes to innovation. It is something we certainly need in \nour economy today and our country. More important, it is just not \nreauthorizing a program simply for reauthorizing it or because it has \nbeen on the books but because it works, and it has demonstrated it has \nworked repeatedly throughout the history of both these programs. That \nis why I urge the Senate to move as quickly as possible to adopt these \nbills so they can become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will follow up with a few brief \ncomments. The transition is important and worth noting. I am so glad \nRanking Member Snowe made reference to the fact that the two of us are \non the floor not just to reauthorize because it is the time for \nreauthorization but because this program works, because it is cost-\neffective, and because it actually is a job creator. It creates jobs in \nthe private sector, not necessarily the public sector, although there \nare some public sector jobs associated with it that are crucial and \nimportant--people in the agencies working on identifying this new \ntechnology. But the lion's share of these jobs by far is being created \nin the private sector.\n  I wish to show what our challenge is.\n  Here you can see both President Bush and President Obama faced \nextraordinary challenges. This is the Monthly Changes in Private \nPayrolls, Seasonally Adjusted from January 2008, when this recession \nbegan, until today. You can see it is absolutely a dramatic loss of \nprivate payroll, reductions in private payroll. This represents \nsubstantial job losses.\n  But as you can see, it is just now, in April 2010-July 2010, and now \nto the present, to February of 2011--I know we are into March but this \ndoesn't have the final month or two on here--we are making tremendous \nprogress in turning this around. Again, this is the Monthly Changes in \nPrivate Payrolls. This represents the teeth of the great recession that \ncaught so many businesses, large and small, off guard.\n  There are many reasons why this recession happened, and the collapse \nof our financial markets, but that is not the subject of this debate. \nWhat is the subject of this debate is how we get out of it, how we \ncreate jobs in the private sector. Senator Snowe and I are proud to \nhave brought several bills to the floor, this being the latest, that we \nbelieve can contribute to the increase in private payroll.\n  I want to be clear, because many of our colleagues have been \nchallenging, and I think appropriately, why we can't eliminate some \ngovernment programs; why do we have to keep them all. Senator Snowe and \nI have jointly recommended the elimination of two, though relatively \nsmall, programs within the SBA, and we will be reviewing just this week \nwith the Administrator of the SBA the efficiency of their whole budget. \nIf we can find other places and other programs to eliminate that are \nnot hitting their marks, not meeting their goals, we are committed to \nworking together to do that. But this program we have reshaped, we have \nmodified, we have improved, and we are strongly and passionately \nrecommending its reauthorization for 8 years.\n  We have together reviewed nine studies of the National Research \nCouncil, studies by the Government Accountability Office to help guide \nour committee in the drafting of this bill. We have included many \nadditional policy goals and some former goals and appropriate interest \nto balance. We wanted\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nto improve the diversity of the programs geographically and otherwise \nso more States and individuals could participate. We also wanted to \nmaintain a fair playing field so true small businesses could continue \nto compete for this very small but important percentage of overall R \nWe wanted to encourage exploration of high-risk, cutting-edge research.\n  As Dr. Charles Wessner said--the lead assessment adviser on this \nprogram--if every program you give money to is working, or every \nbusiness you are awarding grants to works, you are not running your \nprogram correctly, Senators. Because this is high-risk early funding, \nwhere it is the most difficult funding for these businesses to receive. \nObviously, once they show promise, there are any number of investors \nand capital out there looking right now for good investments, \nparticularly right here in the United States. So at a certain point, at \na certain level, with certain proven technologies, there is enough \nventure capital out there to take these programs to the next level. But \nwhat is not there right now is that first dollar, that early $150,000 \ngrant that says: We think you have something of promise. Go ahead and \ntry it. They try it for a year or two, they come back, and they can get \nanother $150,000, up to $1.5 million.\n  Eventually, it may collapse because it wasn't what people thought, \nand that money is lost. But the great news is that collectively, \ncumulatively, this program makes money for the taxpayer--it does not \nlose money--although not every grant is successful. We wouldn't want \nthat. This is a fairly high-risk, early form of capital, but it is a \nsmart use of taxpayer dollars, and that is why Senator Snowe and I \nenthusiastically recommend it.\n  This program has been supported by every President. President Reagan \nwas supportive, President Bush was supportive, President Clinton has \nbeen supportive, and now President Obama has signaled his support as \nwell. So we are very proud to be able to present this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nanother report regarding the state of small business--not the entire \nreport but some parts of it that are central to this debate, sponsored \nby Network Solutions, the University of Maryland, Robert H. Smith \nSchool of Business.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The competitive health of America's small businesses is as \n     low as it has been since the Small Business Success Survey \n     began tracking at the onset of the recession. There continues \n     to be a struggle to provide capital and find new customers, \n     while there is an unprecedented lack of confidence in \n     competing with big business. Yet, small businesses are \n     starting to grow and return to the black. After reaching a \n     low point in the summer, technology investment is on the rise \n     and social media adoption continues to grow. Despite poor \n     competitive health now, owners are becoming increasingly \n     optimistic about the economy and their future business \n     success. Over a quarter plan to add staff in 2011, and if \n     they carry out their plans, will create 3.8 million jobs.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this portion of the report says, \ninterestingly enough:\n\n       After having reached a low point in the summer, technology \n     investment is on the rise and social media adoption continues \n     to grow. Despite poor competitive health now, owners are \n     becoming increasingly optimistic about the economy and their \n     future business success.\n\n  They have been taking this survey of small businesses since the \nrecession started, and the report continues:\n\n       Over a quarter plan to add staff in 2011, and if they carry \n     out their plans, will create 3.8 million jobs.\n\n  Again, it is the magic of small business. We have 27 million small \nbusinesses in America. If every one of them, obviously, created one \nadditional job, that would be 27 million more jobs. And we could use \nit. That is not going to happen, but if even a portion of them added \none job to their bottom line, we know they could have an impact. It is \nimportant for programs such as this and getting capital at their local \nbank, being able to access credit from credit cards, that have \nreasonable charges and transparent charges--which I am proud to have \nbeen a part of helping on--and it is getting access for new \ntechnologies to find a friend at the Federal Government who will step \nup and help them grow their business. We strongly recommend this \nprogram.\n  I am going to yield the floor at this time, but we do have several \namendments that are pending, and we will have to organize those votes \nsometime this week. We have over 89 amendments that have been filed, \nbut we are hoping some of the Members, if they do not feel they have to \noffer those amendments, will withdraw them. Some of them are not \ngermane to this bill and we wish to keep this bill very focused on \nsmall business.\n  I do want to join Senator Snowe in support of the repeal of 1099, \nwhich is represented by the Johanns amendment, and Senator Menendez may \nhave a perfecting amendment to that, I understand, and I look forward \nto working with Senators Johanns and Menendez to get that regulatory \nburden lifted off the back of small business. It doesn't go into effect \nuntil 2012, but small businesses around the country are quietly \nalarmed, as they should be, in my view, regarding that additional \npaperwork that would be required. There is a fair amount of across-the-\nboard support on both sides of the aisle for that repeal, and I hope we \ncan get that done sometime this week as well, either specifically \nattached to this bill or parallel to this effort, because it is a very \nimportant effort for small businesses to get that new 1099 requirement \nrepealed, as well as getting this bill passed.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/28/senate-section/article/S1888-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1888-S1891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF MAE A. D'AGOSTINO TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                     NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Mae A. D'Agostino, of \nNew York, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for scheduling \nthis confirmation vote today. Mae D'Agostino has the distinction of \nbeing the first newly considered judicial nominee this year. Every \njudicial confirmation thus far this year was of a nominee who had been \nunanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee last year. Each of \nthose nominations could, and in my view should, have been considered \nand confirmed last year before the Senate adjourned in December. Ms. \nD'Agostino appeared at a hearing in February, and her nomination to \nfill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Northern District of New York \nwas reported unanimously earlier this month. Now she is being \nconsidered by the Senate. This is an example of what we can do. It \nshould not take weeks and months for the Senate to consider nominees \nreported by the Judiciary Committee, particularly those who are \nconsensus nominees.\n  Ms. D'Agostino is a native of Albany, New York, and has spent her \ncareer in private practice in the Albany area. In addition to her legal \npractice, Ms. D'Agostino has taught at Albany Law School and the Junior \nCollege of Albany. Once confirmed, Ms. D'Agostino will be the only \nwoman currently serving, and only the second woman ever to serve, on \nthe Northern District of New York Federal bench. I thank Senator \nSchumer and Senator Gillibrand for working with the President on this \nnomination. They have worked hard throughout the process. In addition \nto Ms. D'Agostino, there remain nine other judicial nominees awaiting \nfinal Senate consideration after having been\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nreviewed by the Judiciary Committee. Two of those nominations have \ntwice been considered by the Judiciary Committee and twice reported \nwith strong bipartisan support, first last year and again in February. \nThey are Susan Carney of Connecticut to fill a vacancy on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit and Michael Simon to fill a \nvacancy on the district court in Oregon. Another has been reported \nfavorably four times Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of \nCalifornia. So in addition to the D'Agostino nomination to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy in New York, there are nominees ready to be \nconfirmed to fill two judicial emergency vacancies in California, \nanother judicial emergency vacancy in New York, a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Second Circuit, vacancies on the Federal and DC Circuit, \na vacancy in Oregon, and two vacancies in Virginia. I expect the \nJudiciary Committee will consider and report additional judicial \nnominations this week, adding to the number of judicial nominees ready \nfor final Senate action.\n  Recently the Judicial Conference of the United States reaffirmed its \nrecommendation that two additional judgeships be added to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit given its workload. That is in \naddition to the two existing vacancies. Regrettably, the unnecessary \ndelays in considering Susan Carney's nomination to fill one of those \nvacancies has left that court and the people it serves without much-\nneeded resources. It has also given right-wing pressure groups the \nchance to launch unfounded attacks on Ms. Carney full of false \naccusations and innuendo. This is a nominee who had the support of a \nmajority of the Republicans on the committee, and who should have been \nconsidered and confirmed last year. The Senate should take up her \nnomination, debate it and vote on it rather than allowing her record to \nbe smeared. That would be the fair thing to do and the right thing to \ndo. I hope we will do so soon.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many, \nand they have persisted for too long. Nearly one out of every nine \nFederal judgeships remains vacant. This puts at serious risk the \nability of all Americans to have a fair hearing in court. The real \nprice being paid for these unnecessary delays in filling vacancies is \nthat the judges that remain are overburdened and the American people \nwho depend on them are being denied hearings and justice in a timely \nfashion.\n  Regrettably, rather than reduce vacancies dramatically as we did \nduring the Bush administration, the Senate has reversed course in the \nfirst 26 months of the Obama administration, with the slow pace of \nconfirmations keeping judicial vacancies at crisis levels. Over the 8 \nyears of the Bush administration, from 2001 to 2009, we reduced \njudicial vacancies from 110 to a low of 34. That has now been reversed, \nwith vacancies first topping 90 in August 2009 and staying above that \nlevel since. The vacancy rate we reduced from 10 percent at the end of \nPresident Clinton's term to less than 4 percent in 2008 has now risen \nback to over 10 percent.\n  In contrast to the sharp reduction in vacancies we made during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years, when the Democratically controlled \nSenate confirmed 100 of his judicial nominations, only 60 of President \nObama's judicial nominations were allowed to be considered and \nconfirmed during his first 2 years. Whereas the Democratic majority in \nthe Senate reduced vacancies from 110 to 60 in President Bush's first 2 \nyears, today judicial vacancies still number 96. By now, judicial \nvacancies should have been cut in half, but they have not been. We have \nnot even kept up with the rate of attrition, putting at risk the \nability of Americans to have a fair hearing in court.\n  The Senate must do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays by \nthe Senate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. \nJudicial vacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal \njudiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a \nbacklog of cases that prevent people from having their day in court. \nThis is unacceptable. That is why Chief Justice Roberts, Attorney \nGeneral Holder, White House Counsel Bob Bauer and many others--\nincluding the President of the United States--have spoken out and urged \nthe Senate to act.\n  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the \nFederal bench in a timely manner as the nomination before us today \ndemonstrates. President Obama has worked with the New York home State \nSenators to identify this nominee, just as he has worked with Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle to identify superbly qualified nominees in \ndistricts with vacancies. All the nominations on the Executive Calendar \nhave the support of their home State Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats. All have a strong commitment to the rule of law and a \ndemonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution.\n  During President Bush's first term, we proceeded to confirm 205 of \nhis judicial nominations. We confirmed 100 of those during the 17 \nmonths I was chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office \nand by this date in President Bush's third year had confirmed 112. So \nfar in President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only been \nallowed to consider 74 of his Federal circuit and district court \nnominees. We remain well short of the benchmark we set during the Bush \nadministration. When we approach it we can reduce vacancies from the \nhistorically high levels at which they have remained throughout these \nfirst 3 years of the Obama administration to the historically low level \nwe reached toward the end of the Bush administration.\n  I have thanked the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, for his cooperation this year. I see him taking \ncredit for what he called ``our rapid pace.'' I am encouraged by his \ncommitment to ``continue to move consensus nominees through the \nconfirmation process.'' I am glad to see him echo my call to turn the \npage and end the days of tit for tat on judicial nominations. That is \nwhat I did from the first days of the Bush administration in spite of \nhow President Clinton's nominees had been treated.\n  The committee's ranking Republican often points to the vacancies for \nwhich there are not nominees. Of course, some of that is attributable \nto a lack of cooperation with the White House by some home State \nSenators. Nonetheless, I agree with the Senator from Iowa that we can \ndo little about confirming nominations we do not have before us. What \nwe can do is proceed expeditiously with the qualified nominations the \nPresident has sent to the Senate.\n  I hope that it is a sign of progress that we are today proceeding to \nconfirm a judicial nominee considered this year and reported earlier \nthis month and hope that we can continue to work to restore regular \norder in considering judicial nominations. However, I would observe \nthat it is nearly April and every judge confirmed so far this year \ncould and should have been confirmed last year. Every one of them was \nunanimously reported last year and would have been confirmed had \nRepublicans not objected and created a new rule of obstruction after \nmidterm elections. We have long had the ``Thurmond rule'' to describe \nhow Senator Thurmond shut down the confirmation process in advance of \nthe 1980 Presidential election. Last year's shutdown was something new. \nI cannot remember a time when so many consensus nominees were left \nwithout Senate action at the midterm point of a Presidency. That new \nlevel of obstruction has contributed to our being so far behind and \njudicial vacancies having been perpetuated at so high a level for too \nlong. I hope we can join together to make real progress.\n  I congratulate Mae D'Agostino and her family on her confirmation \ntoday.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on another of President \nObama's judicial nominees. Tonight's vote to confirm Ms. Mae D'Agostino \nwill be the 14th judicial nominee confirmed this Congress. It is the \n10th judicial emergency filled this year.\n  Even though I gave an update to my colleagues just 11 days ago, when \nwe had our last judicial nomination vote, I will give a short report on \nthe status of judicial nominations. To date, we have taken positive \naction on 33 of the 60 judicial nominees submitted this Congress, or 55 \npercent. We continue to have nominations hearings every 2 weeks, and \nhave favorably reported nominees out of committee at every weekly \nmarkup session.\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\n  Furthermore, nominees in committee continue to be processed much \nfaster than those nominated by President Bush. On average, President \nObama's district court nominees have only had to wait 66 days from \nnomination to their hearing. For President Bush's nominees, the wait \ntime was nearly double, at 120 days. President Bush's circuit court \nnominees waited, on average, 247 days for a hearing. President Obama's \nnominees are receiving their hearing, on average, within 72 days.\n  Even with our rapid pace, the Federal courts still hold a vacancy \nrate of almost 11 percent. Yet 54 percent of the vacancies do not have \nnominees. While we are processing consensus nominees in a fair and \nthorough manner, we cannot lower the vacancy rate if no nominee exists.\n  The seat to which Ms. D'Agostino has been nominated, vacant since \nMarch of 2006, is categorized as a judicial emergency. This vacancy \nshould never have been deemed an emergency. President Bush nominated \nnot one, but two nominees to this vacancy during the 109th and 110th \nCongresses. First, Mary Donohue, who had served as New York State's \nLieutenant Governor, was nominated in June 2006, 3 months after the \nvacancy occurred. Ms. Donohue's nomination languished in committee \nwithout a hearing or a committee vote for 435 days. Her nomination was \nwithdrawn in September 2007. President Bush then nominated Thomas \nMarcelle to the seat. He waited 155 days in the Judiciary Committee and \nnever received a hearing. The nomination was returned at the end of the \n110th Congress. In sum, the seat had a nominee for 590 days, with no \naction. This is justice delayed. I would note that both candidates had \na rating from the ABA of ``Well Qualified.''\n  It took President Obama over 20 months to finally nominate an \nindividual to this vacancy. While I am disappointed this seat has been \nneedlessly vacant for so long, I am pleased to support the nominee \nbefore us today.\n  Mae Avila D'Agostino received her B.A., magna cum laude, from Siena \nCollege and her J.D. in 1980 from Syracuse University College of Law. \nMs. D'Agostino began her legal career in 1981 as an associate attorney \nat Maynard, O'Connor & Smith. In 1985, she was made a partner. In 1997, \nMs. D'Agostino left Maynard, O'Connor & Smith to start her own firm \nD'Agostino, Krackeler, Maguire & Cardona, P.C., where she currently \npractices. Throughout her career, Ms. D'Agostino has primarily \npracticed in the area of defense litigation with a concentration on \nmedical malpractice.\n  In addition to her legal practice, Ms. D'Agostino has also taught \nlegal courses at the Junior College of Albany and Albany Law School. \nThe ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave Ms. D'Agostino \na unanimous ``Well-Qualified'' rating. Her nomination was reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee by voice vote just 25 days ago.\n  I congratulate the nominee and wish her well in her public service as \na U.S. district judge.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Schumer and Senator \nGillibrand for their work.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from New York is on the floor. I am \ndelighted to see him, and I would ask, when he is finished, if he asks \nfor a quorum call, if he might ask to have it charged against both \nsides equally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the chairman, and thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I express my gratitude and thanks to the chairman of our \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy. Senator Leahy has conducted his \nchairmanship, as head of the Judiciary Committee, with fairness and \nstrength and honor, and he has tried to bend over backwards to get our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle fair hearings and equality in \na certain sense.\n  I regret that too many of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are blocking judges. It is not fair and it is not right. I hope \nthey would heed Senator Leahy's call to avoid tit for tat and bring \nmore judges to the bench.\n  (Mr. LEAHY assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SCHUMER. As I said, I have not seen a chairman--now he is the \nPresiding Officer of the Senate for the moment--I have not seen a \nchairman try to be fairer and with more patience and more honor as \nchair of the Judiciary Committee than Senator Leahy. I hope my \ncolleagues will heed his call because he is trying to be as fair and \ndown the middle as possible at a time when we have a record number of \nvacancies in too many of our circuits.\n  I rise today to express my full support for Mae D'Agostino, the \nnominee for the United States District Court for the Northern District \nof New York. I am very hopeful we will confirm her with overwhelming \nsupport tonight, and I agree wholeheartedly with Chairman Leahy that we \nshould proceed quickly to confirm the other nominees for the many long \nvacant seats across the country.\n  Mae D'Agostino's entire career is a tribute to her skill, her \nintelligence, and her pioneering spirit. When she is confirmed today, \nshe will be the only woman sitting on the Federal bench in upstate New \nYork, and only the second in the history of the region.\n  Mae D'Agostino has earned the distinction of being one of the most \nwell respected and revered trial attorneys in the State of New York. \nWhen I suggested her name to President Obama, I was amazed--I knew she \nhad a good reputation and, of course, I had interviewed her--I was \namazed at the acclaim throughout the entire Northern District that \nnomination received. Mae D'Agostino's reputation as a fair-minded, \nhonorable, practical lawyer is incredible. I am so glad she is here \nbefore us tonight, and I believe, should we confirm her, she will be an \noutstanding judge. The capital region and the central New York area, as \nwell as the north country, are sort of exultant. That is the word I use \nto describe Mae's possible ascension to the bench tonight.\n  She was born in Albany, NY, and graduated summa cum laude from one of \nthe capital region's great institutions, Siena College, and then from \nSyracuse University School of Law. I would say to the Orange, we did \nnot get into the Sweet Sixteen, but at least Mae D'Agostino is getting \non the bench tonight. Right from the get-go, Mae established herself in \nprivate practice as a gifted and hard-working trial lawyer, taking \ncases ranging from medical malpractice to negligence to labor disputes.\n  She formed her own firm, D'Agostino, Krackeler, Maguire & Cardona in \n1997, and has remained at the pinnacle of our State's legal profession \never since.\n  Along the way, she was inducted into the prestigious American College \nof Trial Lawyers, and she has won awards that are too numerous to list \nin full for her service to her alma maters, the community, and for her \nposition as a role model for other women in the profession.\n  In 1992, Mae D'Agostino helped to organize an experimental program in \nwhich the Albany County court instructed parties in 420 cases to reach \na settlement agreement or prepare for trial. The program resulted in 50 \nnegotiators settling over 150 pending cases. This is exactly the kind \nof dedication and creativity we need from our judges.\n  I have always said that my three criteria in choosing people to \nrecommend for judgeships are excellence, moderation, and diversity, and \nMae fits all three of those to a T.\n  It is particularly fitting that Mae D'Agostino, a groundbreaking \nnominee of such impeccable judgment and intelligence, is the first of \nPresident Obama's new nominees to receive a confirmation vote this \nCongress. I hope and expect that as the Judiciary Committee moves \nthrough nominees under the leadership of Chairman Leahy and Ranking \nMember Grassley, we will be able to approve many more of them quickly.\n  We have the best and fairest judicial system in the world, but it \ndepends on good judges to populate the bench. Especially when one in \nnine spots is vacant--let me repeat that: one in nine spots is now \nvacant--nominees with bipartisan support should not languish on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Mae D'Agostino's confirmation is a big step in the right direction, \nand we all must work to make sure there are many more to follow.\n  This is a great day for Mae and her family, for the State of New \nYork, and for our great Nation.\n  Thank you.

Mr. President, I rise for a brief moment to pay tribute \nto a great career in aviation and aviation manufacturing in the State \nof Georgia and the United States. Tomorrow, Lee Rhyant, of Lockheed \nMartin in Marietta, GA, will retire at the age of 60, after giving the \nlast 11 years of his life to that plant and overseeing the remarkable \nC-130J Super Hercules, the best selling transport aircraft in the \nhistory of aviation; of overseeing the completion of the first 187 F-22 \nRaptors, the stealth aircraft of the 21st century, the backbone of our \nAir Force; and then the development of the FA-35 Joint Strike Fighter, \nall being built in part or in whole in Marietta, GA.\n  Lee Rhyant has guided that process through difficult times and he \nstood up for the Air Force and he stood up for America and he stood up \nfor those airlines, knowing they were the right thing for the American \npeople to have to ensure our defense and our strength nationally.\n  I am sure, Mr. President, you have been to Iraq. I have been to Iraq, \nAfghanistan. We have flown in the C-130s. I flew out of Baghdad 2 years \nago on one C-130 that was built in 1969 in the Marietta, GA, plant. It \nis still flying today, a great airplane built by great men and women.\n  Lee Rhyant has been the leader of that great company at Lockheed \nMartin in Marietta for the last 11 years. He came there from Rolls \nRoyce and has been a great leader in aviation throughout his 35 years \nin business--so great that 2 years ago, in 2009, he was selected the \nNational Management Associate of the Year by the National Management \nAssociation, a tremendous credit that only 35 people have received in \nthe past.\n  Lee is my friend; he is my neighbor; he is a great American. He has \nled a great company and a great community in Georgia. I rise tonight to \npay tribute to his dedication, to his commitment, and, most of all, his \ncompassion for the American people and for the defense of our country.\n  I wish him the best in his retirement, knowing that he has given to \nhis country everything he could have given and earned every day of \nretirement he is about to receive.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/28/senate-section/article/S1891-4", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1891-S1892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE 188TH FIGHTER WING\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I honor the men and women of \nthe 188th Fighter Wing for their dedication, perseverance and \ncommitment to excellence.\n  The 188th--based in Fort Smith, AR--recently received the Air Force \nOutstanding Unit Award, AFOUA, for their accomplishments over a 2-year \nperiod, beginning in October 2008 and concluding in September 2010.\n  During that time, the 188th logged over 2,700 combat hours while \nstaged in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom. During the award period, the 188th also deployed 141 members \nfor Expeditionary Combat Support for Operations Enduring Freedom and \nIraqi Freedom as well as other contingency operations worldwide. The \nunit had an exceptional score on their Air Combat Command Unit \nCompliance Inspection in 2009, acing 534 of 537 inspected areas.\n  Perhaps the most amazing and inspiring part of this story was that \njust a few years ago, the 188th was slated to lose its flying mission. \nThe 2005 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, BRAC, \nrecommended that the 188th be stripped of its flying mission and of \ntheir F-16 Falcons. The community rallied, and instead of losing its \nflying mission, the 188th earned a new one--the Flying Razorbacks \nemblem now emblazons A-10 Thunderbolt II Warthogs.\n  The unit quickly transitioned to the A-10s, beginning in 2007, before \ndeploying approximately 300 Airmen and 6 of\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\nits Warthogs for an Air Expeditionary Forces rotation to Kandahar in \n2010. The 188th never missed a mission tasking while in Kandahar.\n  The AFOUA recognizes the extent of the challenges the men and women \nof the 188th overcame in the past few years. The 188th Fighter Wing \ntruly is a Phoenix that rose from the ashes.\n  Authorized by Department of the Air Force General Order 1, January 6, \n1954, the AFOURA is awarded by the Secretary of the Air Force to \nnumbered units that have distinguished themselves by exceptionally \nmeritorious service or outstanding achievement that clearly sets the \nunit above and apart from similar units.\n  Mr. President, the 188th not only met the criteria for the AFOUA but \neclipsed it. As a Senator, and a Fort Smith-native, words cannot say \nhow proud I am of the members of the 188th for their accomplishments. \nNor are words enough to express how grateful I am, as an American, for \ntheir service. We thank them, and all our servicemen and women, for \ntheir sacrifice and efforts on our behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/28/senate-section/article/S1892-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1892-S1894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-985.

A bill to allow the Administrator of the Small Business \nAdministration to create or save jobs by providing interest relief on \ncertain outstanding disaster loans relating to damage caused by the \n2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes or the 2008 Gulf Coast hurricanes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on an \nissue that is of great importance to my home State of Louisiana: \ndisaster recovery from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of 2005; Hurricanes \nGustav and Ike of 2008; and the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010. \nAlmost 6 years after these first two devastating storms, our eyes are \nstill fixed on our shores during hurricane season as our communities \nand businesses in the hardest-hit areas continue to rebuild. The region \nis also still reeling from the oil spill and subsequent Federal \ndeepwater drilling moratorium. As Chair of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I remain focused on their ongoing \nrecovery efforts and am here today to introduce a bill that I believe \nwill help these struggling small businesses become successful once \nagain and hire new workers.\n  Charles R. ``Ray'' Bergeron and his wife's Fleur de Lis Car Care \nCenter in New Orleans, Louisiana, is one of the businesses that needs \nthis type of assistance. Small Business Administrator Karen Mills and I \ntoured the Bergerons' business back in June 2009. Pre-Katrina, Fleur de \nLis, which opened in 1988, had nine employees. After Hurricane Katrina \nhit, Mr. and Mrs. Bergeron found themselves having to take out two \nloans, one for their house and another for their small business. As of \nour visit that June, the Bergerons were down to 2 employees, not \nincluding themselves, and their business was back at about 40 percent \nof pre-Katrina sales, due in large measure to the population not \nreturning. Their neighborhood is mostly empty homes, which Mr. Bergeron \nattributes in part to high flood insurance premiums, high property \ntaxes and high homeowner's insurance.\n  When I met with them, the Bergerons had a $225,000 SBA disaster loan \nwith a standard 30-year term, which Mr. Bergeron says he will not pay \noff until he is 101 years old. And two years ago now, Mrs. Bergeron \ncontacted my office requesting SBA assistance with their loan repayment \nafter work to repair the flood-damaged roads surrounding their gas \nstation had cut access to their business for even their most loyal \ncustomers. Since the project began, Fleur de Lis' sales have been cut \nalmost in half. This latest challenge comes on the heels of the \neconomic downturn, which caused the station to lay off two employees in \n2009.\n  The Bergerons' story is one I have heard from countless businesses. \nCoupled with their recovery from the 2005 and 2008 hurricanes, and more \nrecently, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Federal deepwater \ndrilling moratorium, these businesses--the ones that took the \ninitiative to quickly reopen after the storms--are today struggling \nwith one challenge after another. Yet these ``pioneer'' businesses are \nthe ones rebuilding communities, they are the businesses communities \nneed the most because they serve as anchors. If residents see the \nBergerons' gas station or their favorite restaurant open, they are more \nlikely to come back to rebuild their homes.\n  To help ongoing recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast, and to give these \nstruggling businesses immediate assistance, I am introducing today the \nSoutheast Hurricanes Small Business Disaster Relief Act of 2011. This \nlegislation would provide targeted assistance to as many as 11,000 \nbusinesses in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas. What these \nparticular businesses have in common is that they received SBA disaster \nloans following the 2005 or 2008 hurricanes. While they have made \npayments on these loans, I have heard from countless businesses in my \nState that they could expand operations if they had additional cash \nflow. This legislation would inject immediate capital into \nthese hardest-hit businesses by giving SBA the authority to waive up to \n$15,000 of interest payments over three years, helping to create or \nsave up to 40,000 jobs.\n\n  Under this program, SBA is required to give priority to applications \nfrom businesses with 50 employees or less and businesses that re-opened \nbetween September 2005 and October 2006 for the 2005 storms or \nSeptember and December 2008 for the 2008 hurricanes. This ensures that \nSBA first helps true small businesses and those ``pioneer'' businesses \nthat were the first to re-open after the disaster. The bill also \nincludes a priority for applications from businesses suffering \nsubstantial economic harm from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill last \nyear. The program would end on March 31, 2012.\n  The Southeast Hurricanes Small Business Disaster Relief Act also \nincludes provisions to help reduce the program's impact on the Federal \ndeficit. First, the bill eliminates a duplicative program at the SBA. \nThis program, the Gulf Coast Disaster Loan Refinancing Program, was \ncreated as part of the 2008 Farm Bill. Although it was created almost \nthree years ago, the program has not received any appropriations nor \nhas the SBA utilized the authority to refinance any disaster loans. It \nis my understanding this is because the program just re-amortizes the \nsame debt of borrowers. Furthermore, any refinancing must not exceed \nthe original loan amount and differ from the original terms of the \nloan. As a result, this program is not attractive to borrowers, lenders \nor the SBA. Our bill eliminates this program and creates one that will \nwork better for all stakeholders. Next, the bill allows SBA the \nauthority to get reimbursed by the party responsible for the Deepwater \nHorizon oil spill for any interest relief provided to businesses \nimpacted by that disaster. This ensures that the taxpayers will be \nreimbursed for interest relief related to the Deepwater Horizon oil \nspill. I also note that this is\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\nconsistent with the claims process provided for in the Oil Pollution \nAct of 1990.\n  This program makes a difference because for some businesses, \ndepending on the loan term and loan amount, their total principal/\ninterest payments could run as high as $1,000 per month. For example, \nfor a $114,000 disaster loan with a 4 percent interest rate and a 25-\nyear term, a business could be paying as much as $400 in monthly \ninterest. In one year, this adds up to $4,800 and almost $14,500 in \nthree years. While this is not a lot of money for Wall Street banks or \nFortune 500 companies, $15,000 makes a major impact for a gas station \nwith two employees, like Fleur de Lis, or a neighborhood restaurant \nwith 10 employees. These businesses have seen their bottom lines shrink \nas others on Wall Street received extravagant bonuses. I, for one, \nbelieve it is time to help these Main Street businesses as they are the \nbackbone of our communities.\n  My legislation also follows legislation approved by a previous \nCongress. The prior bill came after Hurricane Betsy devastated Florida, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi in September 1965. According to Red Cross \nreports at the time, between 800,000 and 1 million people were \nadversely impacted by the hurricane. Before this storm, the only \nprevious disaster of that magnitude was the 1937 Ohio-Mississippi River \nfloods which forced more than a million people from their homes. In \ntotal, Betsy destroyed more than 1,500 homes, damaged more than \n150,000, and damaged more than 2,000 trailers. Hurricane Betsy also \ndestroyed 1,400 farm buildings and 2,600 small businesses. At the time, \nthe Senate Committee on Public Works noted in Committee Report 89-917 \nthat, ``The overwhelming magnitude of the vicious storm, surprising \neven to experienced disaster workers, was more apparent every day as \nstorm victims continued to register for long-term recovery help in \nrebuilding their lives and homes.''\n\n  As part of the review to provide Hurricane Betsy victims appropriate \nassistance, including a field hearing in Louisiana, Congress determined \nthat the massive scale of this disaster required targeted, disaster-\nspecific programs. In particular, Congress approved the Southeast \nHurricane Disaster Relief Act of 1965, Public Law 89-339. This bill \nauthorized various business, homeowner, and agricultural disaster \nassistance, including loans and temporary rental assistance. In its \ncommittee report on the legislation, which is referenced above, the \nSenate Committee on Public Works wrote, ``This bill contains what the \ncommittee believes is needed and necessary to give further aid to the \ndisaster-stricken areas . . . including special measures to help these \nStates in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of devastated areas.'' \nAmong other provisions, Section 3 of the bill authorized SBA to waive \ninterest--for loans above $500--due on the loan over a period of three \nyears, but not to exceed $1,800 in interest. The bill was signed into \nlaw in November 1965 and Congress later approved $35 million to \nimplement provisions in the Act.\n  Just as with Hurricane Betsy in 1965, in 2005, Mississippi and \nLouisiana again saw a catastrophic disaster hit their businesses, \nfarms, and homes. Everyone now knows the impact Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita had on the New Orleans area and the southeast part of our state. \nImages from the devastation following these storms, and the subsequent \nFederal levee breaks, were transmitted across the country and around \nthe world. Katrina ended up being the deadliest natural disaster in \nUnited States history, with 1,800 people killed--1,500 alone in \nLouisiana. Katrina was also the costliest natural disaster in U.S. \nhistory, with more than $81.2 billion reported in damage.\n  In Louisiana, we had 18,000 businesses catastrophically destroyed and \n81,000 businesses economically impacted. I believe that, across the \nentire Gulf Coast, some estimates ran as high as 125,000 businesses \nimpacted by Katrina and Rita. Many of these businesses, for various \nreasons, have not returned or re-opened. By mid-2007, Orleans Parish \nwas still down 2,000 employers, or 23 percent of its pre-Katrina \nbusiness level. Nearby St. Bernard Parish--which had up to 80 percent \nof its homes damaged--had the largest percentage decline of 48 percent \nfewer businesses open, according to Louisiana State University and the \nLouisiana Recovery Authority. These disasters were followed by the 2008 \nhurricanes that hit the same areas in Texas and Louisiana. With this in \nmind, on September 25, 2009, I chaired a committee field hearing in \nGalveston, Texas. At this hearing, we received a progress report from \nFederal, State and local officials on the recovery from Hurricane Ike \nin 2008. We also heard from individual business owners in Galveston who \nwere still struggling a year on from the hurricane.\n  These Galveston business owners, the Bergeron's Fleur de Lis gas \nstation, and many other ``pioneer'' businesses did choose to re-open \nand are now struggling to stay alive. As is clear from the Bergeron's \nstory, these businesses have suffered from not one disaster, but three: \nHurricane Katrina/Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav/Ike in 2008, and the \nDeepwater Horizon disaster. I believe the special program implemented \nfollowing Hurricane Betsy in 1965 would today greatly benefit \nbusinesses in these four states hardest hit by Katrina, Rita, Gustav, \nIke, and the Deepwater Horizon. While I recognize that these are the \nhardest hit states, I am also interested to hear from my other Gulf \nCoast colleagues on whether this program would benefit their impacted \nbusinesses as well.\n  In closing, I would like to note that Congress has been generous in \nproviding essential recovery funds following the 2005 and 2008 storms. \nHowever, as we approach the sixth anniversary of the 2005 disasters, we \nmust now ensure that impacted businesses can make it past this \nanniversary--preventing thousands more workers from being unemployed or \nadditional defaults on SBA disaster loans. One important way that this \nCongress can ensure that these workers remain employed and that these \nbusinesses survive, and even grow, would be to relieve some of the \ninterest on these SBA disaster loans. For this reason, I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to support this commonsense legislation which would make a \ndifference for up to 11,000 Main Street business owners and their \nestimated 40,000 employees in the Gulf Coast.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to encourage, enhance, and integrate Blue Alert plans \nthroughout the United States in order\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\nto disseminate information when a law enforcement officer is seriously \ninjured or killed in the line of duty; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to inform my colleagues \nof legislation I have introduced today to establish a national Blue \nAlert Act. This would establish a nationwide program for blue alert. It \nwould be similar to what we do for AMBER alert today. With AMBER alert, \nwhen children are abducted, we use that communication system nationwide \nto get information out about the abductor so we can get the public \nassisting law enforcement in apprehending the individuals responsible \nfor the abduction of a child. My legislation would establish a similar \nsystem of disseminating information when a police officer has been \nmurdered or severely injured as a result of a violent attack. This bill \nwould help in keeping law enforcement safer by removing these \nindividuals who have committed these horrible crimes from the streets \nsooner and holding them accountable for their acts.\n  Every day 900,000 law enforcement officers go out in our communities \nto keep us safe. They are the frontline for public safety. They put \ntheir lives on the line. Our communities are much safer as a result of \ntheir actions, so we want to do everything we can to help our law \nenforcement officers. In recent years, too many have lost their lives \nin the line of duty. We need to do something about that.\n  In Prince George's County, MD, today I joined with law enforcement \nofficers at the FOP Lodge 89 to talk about this legislation. There is a \nfallen heroes memorial located at that FOP lodge to honor law \nenforcement officers in Prince George's County who gave their lives in \nthe line of duty. Unfortunately, there are 26 individuals honored at \nthat memorial. They have lost their lives since 1937. The \nSuperintendent of State Police was also there, and we recalled State \ntrooper Wesley Brown who died in June of last year in Forestville at \nthe age of 24 serving his community. I mention Trooper Brown \nspecifically because as a result of Trooper Brown's death, Governor \nO'Malley took executive action to establish a blue alert system in the \nState. We now have nine other States that have joined Maryland--10 \nStates altogether--in establishing their own blue alert programs so we \ncan assist in the capture of those who murder or seriously injure law \nenforcement officers.\n  We need to use technology the best we can to help those who are \nserving our communities. My legislation would make that program \nnationwide. I am proud we have bipartisan cosponsors in Senators \nGraham, Leahy, Klobuchar, and Coons. It complements the work being done \nby Attorney General Holder in his Law Enforcement Officer Safety \nInitiative. The purpose here is try to keep our law enforcement \nofficers safer and keep the community safer. We think both will be \nachieved by using a blue alert system nationwide.\n  I am also pleased to say it has the endorsement of the Fraternal \nOrder of Police and the Concern of Police Survivors, COPS.

Res. 109\n\n       Whereas, in the course of peaceful protests in countries \n     throughout North Africa and the Middle East, women have stood \n     shoulder-to-shoulder with men to advance their rights;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has said, \n     ``The rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of \n     the 21st Century.'';\n       Whereas, in late December 2010 and January 2011, Tunisia \n     underwent a political upheaval, dubbed the ``Jasmine \n     Revolution,'' resulting in the fleeing of President of \n     Tunisia Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from the country on January \n     14, 2011;\n       Whereas one of the first voices of the ``Jasmine \n     Revolution'' was the sister of Mohammad Bouazizi, the young \n     man whose death led to many of the peaceful protests in \n     Tunisia;\n       Whereas, on January 25, 2011, demonstrations began across \n     Egypt with thousands of protesters peacefully calling for a \n     new government, free and fair elections, significant \n     constitutional and political reforms, greater economic \n     opportunity, and an end to government corruption;\n       Whereas women in Egypt have utilized social media to \n     galvanize support among men and women for peaceful protest;\n       Whereas huge crowds came out to protest peacefully in \n     Egypt, and women were among those that faced tear gas and who \n     pitched their tents and slept in the cold in Tahrir Square;\n       Whereas hundreds of women took part in a rally in Cairo on \n     March 8, 2011, the 100th Anniversary of International Women's \n     Day, to remind women in Egypt that they must have a voice in \n     their nation's future;\n       Whereas, on February 25, 2011, the United Nations Security \n     Council and the international community condemned the \n     violence and use of force against civilians in Libya;\n       Whereas, according to press reports, women in Libya have \n     been working behind the scenes making a profound difference \n     to promote reform and keep the momentum of the uprising \n     alive, listening to worried fathers whose sons are fighting \n     on the frontlines, keeping up with the day-to-day clashes and \n     casualty numbers, and holding meetings about health and \n     education issues, as well as participating in the \n     demonstrations themselves;\n       Whereas, according to press reports, women are among the \n     leaders of demonstrations calling for reform in Yemen;\n       Whereas women's groups in countries such as Morocco, \n     Jordan, Lebanon, and Iran have attempted to harness critical \n     support regarding legislation affecting their rights;\n       Whereas women around the world continue to face significant \n     obstacles in all aspects of their lives, including denial of \n     basic human rights, discrimination, and gender-based \n     violence;\n       Whereas women, young and old, have marched in the streets \n     of countries from Tunisia to Iran demanding freedom from \n     oppression; and\n       Whereas women across North Africa and the Middle East \n     aspire for freedom, democracy, and rule of law: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the women in North Africa and the Middle East \n     who have worked to ensure that women are guaranteed equality \n     and basic human rights;\n       (2) recognizes that the empowerment of women is \n     inextricably linked to the potential of nations to generate \n     economic growth and sustainable democracy;\n       (3) acknowledges that women in North Africa and the Middle \n     East are demanding to be included in making choices that will \n     affect their own lives and their families;\n       (4) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the \n     universal rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, \n     and freedom of association, including via the Internet, and \n     supports the calls for representative and responsive \n     democratic governments that respect these rights;\n       (5) celebrates this year's centennial anniversary of \n     International Women's Day, a global day to celebrate the \n     economic, political, and social achievements of women past, \n     present, and future, and a day to recognize the obstacles \n     that women still face in the struggle for equal rights and \n     opportunities;\n       (6) condemns any efforts to provoke or instigate violence \n     against women, and calls upon all parties to refrain from all \n     violent and criminal acts; and\n       (7) underscores the vital importance of women's rights and \n     political participation as leaders in North Africa and the \n     Middle East consider constitutional reforms and shape new \n     governments.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution calling \nfor women's rights in North Africa and the Middle East. Following weeks \nof tumult and protests in this area of the world, I could not be more \nhonored to lead my 16 female colleagues in the United States Senate in \nemphasizing the importance of women's rights and political \nparticipation. As one unified voice, the 17 of us have introduced a \nresolution calling for a renewed focus on women's rights as leaders in \nNorth Africa and the Middle East consider constitutional reforms and \nshape new governments. The resolution we introduced reaffirms our \ncommitment to representative and responsive democratic governments that \nrespect women's rights and calls on leaders to include women when it \ncomes to making decisions that will affect their lives.\n  In the course of peaceful protests in countries throughout North \nAfrica and\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\nthe Middle East, women have stood shoulder to shoulder with men to \nadvance their rights. Indeed, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham \nClinton has said that, ``the rights of women and girls is the \nunfinished business of the 21st century,'' and I couldn't agree more.\n  Earlier this year, demonstrations spread from Tunisia to Egypt, with \nthousands of protesters peacefully calling for new governments, free \nand fair elections, significant constitutional and political reforms, \ngreater economic opportunity, and an end to government corruption. \nWomen played a vital role in these movements, utilizing social media to \ngalvanize support for peaceful protest--facing tear gas and sleeping in \ntents in Tahrir Square. In fact, hundreds of women took part in a rally \nin Cairo on March 8th, the 100th anniversary of International Women's \nDay, to remind women in Egypt that they must have a voice in their \nnation's future. And today, as the people of Libya seek to overturn the \nbrutal regime of Moammar Qadhafi, women have been working behind the \nscenes making a profound difference to promote reform and keep the \nmomentum of the uprising alive.\n  However, while women have sacrificed and peacefully protested side by \nside with men in nations throughout North Africa and the Middle East, \nthere are signs that women are increasingly being sidelined from the \nformation of new governments. In Tunisia, according to press reports, \nonly two women have been appointed to the transitional government and \nin Egypt, not a single woman has been appointed to the council in \ncharge of revamping the constitution.\n  The simple truth is women around the world continue to face \nsignificant obstacles in all aspects of their lives, including denial \nof basic human rights, discrimination, and gender-based violence. Be it \nTunisia and Egypt--or Morocco, Yemen, Lebanon, and Iran--women have \nattempted to harness critical support regarding matters affecting their \nrights, which is precisely why my colleagues and I introduced this \nresolution.\n  We stand together to honor the women in North Africa and the Middle \nEast who have worked to ensure guaranteed equality and basic human \nrights, recognizing that the empowerment of women is inextricably \nlinked to the potential of nations to generate economic growth and \nsustainable democracy. Part and parcel to the success and stability of \nany government is the equal voice and participation of women. The \nspirit and devotion exemplified by women in North Africa and the Middle \nEast--and the ongoing challenges they continue to face--are both an \ninspiration to us all and a reminder that discrimination and gender-\nbased violence endures around the world. The resolution I am \nintroducing with my colleagues is meant to honor their commitment to \nensuring future generations enjoy the guaranteed equality and basic \nhuman rights for which they endeavor to this day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/28/senate-section/article/S1900-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 110--TO REQUIRE THAT ALL LEGISLATIVE MATTERS BE \nAVAILABLE AND FULLY SCORED BY CBO 48 HOURS BEFORE CONSIDERATION BY ANY \n SUBCOMMITTEE OR COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE OR ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Chambliss) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S.

A motion \n     to reconsider the vote by which the implementation bill is \n     agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n       (D) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on an implementation bill, and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the implementation bill \n     shall occur.\n       (E) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the \n     case may be, to the procedure relating to an implementation \n     bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (3) Coordination with action by other house.--If, before \n     the passage by one House of an implementation bill of that \n     House, that House receives from the other House an \n     implementation bill, then the following procedures shall \n     apply:\n       (A) Nonreferral.--The implementation bill of the other \n     House shall not be referred to a committee.\n       (B) Vote on bill of other house.--With respect to an \n     implementation bill of the House receiving the implementation \n     bill--\n       (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     implementation bill had been received from the other House; \n     but\n       (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the \n     implementation bill of the other House.\n       (4) Rules of the senate and the house of representatives.--\n     This subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of an implementation bill, and it \n     supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is \n     inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n       (j) Termination.--The Commission shall terminate on the \n     date that is one day after the date on which it submits its \n     third final report under subsection (h)(2).\n       (k) Definitions.--In this section, the following \n     definitions apply:\n       (1) Calendar day.--The term ``calendar day'' means a \n     calendar day other than one on which either House is not in \n     session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a \n     date certain.\n       (2) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Grace \n     Commission II established by subsection (b).\n       (3) Implementation bill.--The term ``implementation bill'' \n     means only a bill that is introduced as provided under \n     subsection (i)(1), and contains the proposed legislation \n     described in subsection (h)(2)(B), without modification.\n       (4) Member.--The term ``member'' means a member of the \n     Commission appointed under subsection (d)(1)(A).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 256.
