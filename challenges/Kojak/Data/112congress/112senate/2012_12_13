Mr. President, we on the Democratic side are going to \nrecognize that seven of our Senators are retiring, and that is \nunfortunate, but that is the decision they have made. As I have \nindicated on more than one occasion, parting is sweet sorrow. We had a \ncelebration last week and talked about those seven Senators and it was \ntruly a wonderful evening.\n  I have come to the Senate floor to talk about these individual \nSenators, and today I am going to talk about Senator Herb Kohl. Herb \nKohl, as has happened to other Members of this body, has had to \novercome adversity to become a Senator.\n  The history of Herb Kohl and his family touches me. He is a very \nhumble man. He doesn't talk very much, and even though we have served \ntogether for 24 years, I was stunned last week when we had a guest \nrabbi, Rabbi Kohl, from Canada. Hearing the name didn't mean much to me \nbecause it is a fairly common name. But after the rabbi finished, Herb \nKohl, this man of humility, stood on the floor and gave us all a little \nbit of his background, which we had never heard before.\n  Senator Kohl's cousin, Rabbi Baruch Kohl, served as guest chaplain \nand he offered the invocation to convene the Senate. After the \nbenediction, Herb Kohl, the senior Senator from Wisconsin, shared the \nfamily history.\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\n  Herb Kohl's father Max and Rabbi Kohl's father Jack were brothers. \nDuring World War I, when Max and Jack were teenagers, the brothers were \ncaptured by the Russian military, jailed, and forced to march more than \n150 miles, with little food, no proper clothing, and the constant \nthreat of physical violence. On occasion, they didn't have shoes, and \nthey were walking basically to Siberia is where they were headed. The \nboys' parents didn't know where they were for more than 2 years.\n  Max and Jack were then convicted by a tsarist army as spies and sent \non an epoch 5-month journey by rail across Siberia. In 1916, the \nbrothers were dumped off in a remote corner of that wintry waste. Exile \nwas frequently a death sentence. Fortunately, in this instance, it was \nnot. The brothers survived relying on the kindness of strangers, and \n2\\1/2\\ years later Max, Herb's father, made his way back to his \nhometown.\n  During their exile, young Jack looked after the even younger Max. Max \neventually--this would be Herb Kohl's father--immigrated to the United \nStates. He sent for his older brother after he had earned a few dollars \nhere in America. So the Rabbi's dad was brought to America by his \nbrother--Herb Kohl's dad.\n  The brothers' bond passed through the generations to their sons. \nSenator Kohl and Rabbi Kohl are first cousins, and it was very dramatic \nto see the connection they shared on the Senate floor. The success \nenjoyed by Max Kohl, a Polish immigrant, and later by his son, a \nSenator for 24 years, is a testament to the American dream.\n  Despite a rough start in life, Max founded a chain of Wisconsin \ngrocery stores. Herb eventually became president of the Kohl's chain, \nwith one little store, but he was a successful businessman before he \ntook over his dad's chain of stores. He became the CEO of that chain \nstarted by his dad.\n  Initially, after getting his bachelor's degree at the University of \nWisconsin and his MBA at Harvard, Herb founded a successful real estate \nand stock investment firm. At the time, he was also serving as an Army \nReservist. He took over as president of Kohl's grocery and department \nstore in 1970. He successfully grew the company for a decade.\n  But as strong as his passion for business is, Senator Kohl was an \neven greater athletic fan. He had a passion for sports. In 1985, he \nbought the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks to keep the team from leaving \nWisconsin. He couldn't stand the thought of an outsider buying the team \nand moving the team from Milwaukee, and that was the talk everybody had \nheard.\n  Everyone said Herb Kohl made a bad deal. Why did he pay so much money \nfor that basketball team? But his decision to buy the Milwaukee Bucks, \nwhich at the time some said was crazy, proves doing the right thing and \ndoing the profitable thing are often one in the same. Today, the Bucks \nare worth ten times what Herb paid for the team and they are an \nimportant pillar of that vibrant Milwaukee community.\n  Herb was also one of the original investors in the Milwaukee Brewers, \nowned by his childhood friend Bud Selig. Senator Kohl and Major League \nBaseball commissioner Bud Selig were roommates at a fraternity at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, but they knew each other when they were little \nboys. They lived in the same neighborhood. Herb and Bud still have \nlunch at Jake's Deli whenever Herb is back in Milwaukee, which is \nalmost every week. They do this on Saturday.\n  Senator Kohl is also passionate about education. He founded the Herb \nKohl Educational Foundation Achievement Award Program, which awards \ngrants and scholarships to graduating seniors, teachers, and schools \nall across Wisconsin. He donated $25 million to the University of \nWisconsin to build a state-of-the art, new athletic facility--the Kohl \nCenter.\n  Since he was elected in 1988, Herb Kohl has been a champion of public \neducation, fighting to give students the tools they need to succeed in \na modern workforce. He has also made fighting crime in Wisconsin and \nacross the Nation a priority, advancing investments in antidrug and \nantigang programs. He has worked to reduce juvenile crime and ensure \nproper funding of State and local public safety agencies, and he has \nbeen a strong voice for Wisconsin dairy farmers.\n  Herb has also been a valued member of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe Banking and Judiciary Committees, as well as a strong chairman of \nthe Special Committee on Aging. He has done so much for the aging \npopulations we have in America today.\n  He has been a leader on many different legislative initiatives. Herb \nKohl is a fine man, a wonderful human being, and I so admire and \nappreciate him. He is a distinguished Senator, a devoted representative \nof the people of Wisconsin, and his presence will be missed in the \nSenate. I wish him the very best in his retirement.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S7992-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, every time I travel the great State of \nArkansas, I meet farmers and ranchers who help feed America and the \nworld. That is just how prevalent agriculture is in my home State. It \nis our No. 1 industry and accounts for $16 billion annually to the \nState's economy. That is the reason I asked for a seat on the \nAgriculture Committee. I wanted to help Arkansas's food producers, our \nfarmers who are working to develop and implement policies to increase \nproduction, and provide them with the tools and resources they need to \ncontinue their important work.\n  There are two immediate concerns I hear as I travel the State: No. 1, \nthey want us to wrap up the work on a new farm bill. They want to know \nwhat the rules are going to be for the next 5 years as they go and \nvisit with their bankers; and No. 2, they do not want us to go over the \nfiscal cliff.\n  Arkansas farmers are concerned about what inaction on tax reform will \nmean to their livelihood. In particular, one of the areas they fear is \na rise in the already high and unnecessary tax burden they face when \ninheriting a loved one's farm or ranch. The death tax makes planning \nand passing on farms and businesses to the next generation even more \ndifficult. Oftentimes, the cost is too much to absorb, and families end \nup spending their hard-earned money on attorney's fees, selling their \nland or part of the business or assets or laying off workers just to \npay Uncle Sam.\n  If the President and the Senate majority refuse to compromise on the \ntax portion of the fiscal cliff agreement, the death tax will rise \ndramatically. Arkansas farmers will be forced to hand over to Uncle Sam \nup to 55 percent of the value of family farm estates that are worth \nmore than $1 million beginning in 2013. This would have a truly \ndevastating impact on nearly a quarter of Arkansas family farms and \nranches.\n  With 97 percent of Arkansas farms being family owned, there is great \nconcern among these agricultural producers, among our farmers and \ntimberland owners about the current inaction on the fiscal cliff or \nfiscal crisis. A good example is Allen Nipper. He operates a tree farm \nin Magnolia, AR. He wrote to me about what he rightfully calls \n``multiple taxation.'' He says:\n\n       We know our lands provide clean water and wildlife habitat \n     that benefits society in general without us expecting a \n     handout or a\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\n     payment for providing those services. But then at my death, \n     the Government wants to take up to 55 percent of the value \n     after I have invested my efforts into providing those \n     benefits. That is not right, nor is it fair.\n\n  I agree with Allen. Part of the American dream is creating an \ninheritance we can pass on to our future generations. Our farmers and \nsmall businesses deserve to pass along their investment to their heirs \nwithout having to worry about a tax. That is why I introduced \nlegislation to actually eliminate the death tax. While this idea will \nnot be included in the final tax deal, these hard-working families \ncannot afford Congress to allow the death tax to return to 55 percent. \nIt is simply unacceptable. At the very least, we need to maintain \ncurrent policy for another year, until we are able to implement and \nprovide a more permanent solution. We owe it to these hard-working \nfamilies to work together to solve this issue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about the \ndebt crisis facing this country and why I believe any deal to avert the \nfiscal cliff must address serious entitlement reform. We should not let \nthe discussion around taxes, which is sort of dominating the airwaves \nhere in Washington, distract us from the fact that Washington has a \nspending problem, not a revenue problem.\n  Every independent expert who examines America's long-term structural \nfiscal dilemma comes to the same conclusion: Entitlement programs are \nthe drivers of our national debt over the long term.\n  Those who argue that we can dig our way out of a $16 trillion debt--\nand counting, by the way--by raising taxes are ignoring reality. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office's most recent forecast, \nunder the current tax rates, revenues over the next 10 years will \naverage roughly 18 percent of GDP. In other words, Federal revenues \nwill return to their historical average without raising taxes on \nanyone. I will repeat that because I think it is an important point. \nOur tax revenues will go back to an average of 18 percent over the next \ndecade, which is the historical average, and that happens with existing \ntax policy in place, without raising taxes on anyone. In fact, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, under the current tax \nrates, revenues as a percentage of GDP will reach 18.6 percent by the \nyear 2022--a decade from now. That is more than half a percentage point \nhigher than the historical average.\n  Clearly, our budget problems are not because we have too little \nrevenue. Our budget situation today relates directly to Washington's \naddiction to overspending. In fiscal year 2007, before the recession, \ntotal Federal revenue was roughly $2.5 trillion and total Federal \nspending was approximately $2.7 trillion. Five years later, for fiscal \nyear 2012, which recently ended, total Federal revenue was $2.45 \ntrillion--basically back to the prerecession levels, about the same \nrevenue we had back in 2007--but total Federal spending was above $3.5 \ntrillion. In other words, tax revenue is back to where it was before \nthe recession but Federal spending is now $800 billion higher than it \nwas just 5 years ago, in 2007.\n  Even the Washington Post on their editorial page, which is not \nsomething I usually agree with, agrees. In an editorial entitled ``Mr. \nObama's Time to Lead on Entitlements,'' the Post argued:\n\n       Since 60 percent of the federal budget goes to Medicare, \n     Medicaid and Social Security, there's no way to achieve \n     balance without slowing the rate of increase of those \n     programs.\n\n  Speaking of entitlement programs, the Post editorial went on to say, \n``At some point he,'' referring to the President, ``has to prepare the \nAmerican people--and his own supporters most of all--for the hard \ndecisions required to put the country on a sound financial footing.''\n  Even the Washington Post agrees that we must take on the driver of \nFederal spending, entitlement spending and, second, that the President \nhas to lead on that issue. Unfortunately, the President has continued \ncampaigning around the country for higher taxes, but until he gets \nserious about leading on the issue of entitlement reforms, we simply \nwill not be able to reach an agreement to tackle our fiscal problems in \na meaningful way.\n  A look at the President's proposed tax hike demonstrates why we \nsimply cannot tax our way out of a debt crisis. The President is \nproposing $68 billion in revenue next year by raising the top tax \nrates--in the process, raising taxes on nearly 1 million small business \nowners. The White House claims this will not have a major negative \neffect on America's business owners or their employees. But according \nto the National Federation of Independent Business, small businesses \ncreated two-thirds of the new jobs in the last decade, and those small \nbusinesses are the most likely to be hit by the new tax increases, and \nthose are the small businesses that employ, by the way, 25 percent of \nthe total workforce.\n  According to a study by Ernst & Young, the President's proposed tax \nincreases will result in 700,000 fewer jobs, a nearly 2-percent decline \nin wages and economic growth that is 1.3 percent lower than it \notherwise would be. Yet despite the broad impact of these taxes on \nsmall businesses and our economy, this tax hike would only fund \ngovernment operations next year for about a week. If the President got \neverything he wanted in the form of higher rates on income, higher \nrates on capital gains and dividends--all of those things go back to \nthe higher rates--it would fund government for about a week. The \nPresident appears to have an obsession with raising income tax rates \nand claiming that it is the only way to get significant new revenues. \nBut this is not true according to the administration's own budget.\n  According to this administration's budget, the President's marginal \nincome tax rate hike on high earners will raise $442 billion over 10 \nyears. As I mentioned, if we look at just the top two rates, we would \nraise about $442 billion over 10 years. If we average that out, it ends \nup being about $40 billion a year. Yet, according to the same budget, \nthe President's proposal to limit the value of tax expenditures for \nhigher income earners by itself raises $584 billion over 10 years. In \nfact, the marginal tax rate increases alone are only one-fourth of the \ntotal $1.6 trillion in new taxes that the President has proposed.\n  So it is simply not true, as a factual matter or as a matter of \narithmetic, that we need to raise marginal income tax rates to raise \nsignificant revenue. Yet the President continues to insist that \nmarginal income tax rate increases be part of any fiscal cliff \nagreement. We have to wonder: Is it because of the arithmetic or is it \nbecause of a liberal ideology that considers higher income tax rates to \nbe the holy grail of tax policy.\n  The last thing we ought to do if we want to boost economic growth is \nto raise tax rates, especially marginal income tax rates. Marginal \nincome tax rates matter because they have incentive effects. They \naffect a worker's decision to work an additional hour. The \nCongressional Budget Office explains that phenomenon in this way:\n\n       Increasing revenues by raising marginal tax rates on labor \n     would reduce people's incentive to work and therefore reduce \n     the amount of labor supplied to the economy.\n\n  Most Americans understand this logic intuitively. If we want less of \nsomething, raise the cost of producing it by taxing more heavily. If we \nraise marginal income tax rates, we will get less income as well as the \nlabor that gives rise to that income. If we raise taxes on investment, \nwe are likely to get less investment. It is time to recognize that we \ndon't live in a static world. Taxpayers will adjust to higher rates \nand, in fact, this has already started to happen.\n  Consider that in the last month we have seen a host of companies \nannouncing special dividends or rushing to move up their dividend \npayments before the end of the year. There were 228\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\ncompanies that announced special dividend payouts in the month of \nNovember. This compares to 54 companies in the month of October and 72 \ncompanies in November of last year. So we have three times as many \ncompanies announcing that they are going to do special dividend payouts \nin the month of November as we had last year. We have to believe this \nis a direct result of the administration's plan to raise the top \ndividend tax rate from 15 percent today to 43.4 percent next year. The \ntop tax rate on dividends next year will nearly triple unless we take \naction to prevent that.\n  Rather than raising taxes on America's small businesses, we should \nreform our Tax Code in a way that encourages economic growth and \ntherefore generates new revenue. Instead of the President's approach to \nsimply redistribute revenue, we should be focused on growing the \neconomy over the long run thus increasing opportunities for wealth \ncreation for all Americans. We know this approach can work because we \nhave done it before. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 lowered rates, \nbroadened the tax base, and resulted in one of the longest economic \nbooms in American history.\n  Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson recently estimated that the gains \navailable from fundamental tax reform amount to as much as $7 trillion \nin current dollar terms. The Joint Tax Committee has projected that \nrevenue-neutral tax reform that lowered rates and broadened the tax \nbase could lead to an increase in GDP by as much as 3.5 percent in the \nlong run.\n  Mark Feldstein, former Chairman of the White House Council of \nEconomic Advisers, calculated that lowering individual tax rates by \nonly 10 percent, coupled with base-broadening measures to ensure \nrevenue neutrality, would raise over $500 billion in new revenue \nrelated to growth over the next 10 years. That is lowering individual \ntax rates by just 10 percent. Increasing the rate of economic growth is \nthe single most important thing we can do to ensure greater prosperity \nfor Americans today but also for the coming generations.\n  A recent report by Third Way, a center-left think tank, highlighted \nthe importance of raising economic growth back to the post-World War II \naverage of 3.3 percent. According to this report, increasing economic \ngrowth back to 3.3 percent starting in the year 2018 would result in \nnearly 2 million additional jobs by the year 2022 and roughly 5.3 \nmillion new jobs by the year 2030. It will result in more than $600 \nbillion in new revenue by 2022 and more than $5 trillion in additional \nFederal revenue by the year 2030.\n  Christina Romer, former Chair of the White House Council of Economic \nAdvisers under President Obama, has equated a 1-percentage-point change \nin GDP with 1 million jobs per year. Given these estimates, there \nshould be a bipartisan consensus that what we need is higher economic \ngrowth, not higher taxes. I would propose that the fiscal cliff is both \na challenge and an opportunity. It is a challenge to get the Federal \nGovernment's runaway spending under control, but it is also an \nopportunity for us to make real entitlement reforms and to put in place \na structure for comprehensive tax reform next year that will have \nenormous benefits for our economy.\n  I hope the President of the United States will soon join the \ndiscussion that many of us have been having about comprehensive tax and \nentitlement reforms. Presidential leadership on both of these critical \nissues is long overdue and is essential.\n  We cannot do big things in this country, such as entitlement reform \nor tax reform, absent Presidential leadership. President Obama has a \nunique opportunity in his second term to do some things that are \ndesperately needed for this country and to put our country on a path \ntoward fiscal solvency, a trajectory that will ensure a brighter, \nbetter, and more prosperous future for generations of Americans. In \norder to have that happen, we have to have the right policies in place, \nand those are policies that encourage jobs and economic growth.\n  The President said in his postelection press conference that his No. \n1 priority was going to be jobs and the economy. I could not agree more \nwith that statement. The way we achieve that is by getting fiscal \ndiscipline in place through budgetary restraint and by having policies \nin place that promote robust economic growth. If we look at what solves \nthese problems, the best thing we can do is to grow our economy and \nthen a lot of these debt and deficit issues become much smaller by \ncomparison. It really does come down to growth, but we simply cannot \ngrow the economy by raising taxes on small businesses, job creators, \nand people out there who are creating the jobs and impact literally \nmillions of middle-class families who are employed by those very same \nsmall businesses.\n  Millions and millions of Americans work for small businesses in this \ncountry. If the President has his way, those Americans would see their \ntaxes go up. That is not something we want to see happen in a weak \neconomy.\n  In fact, it was only 2 years ago in 2010 when the President said that \nwe ought to extend all of the tax rates because we should not raise \ntaxes in the middle of a weak economy. At that time economic growth on \nan annualized basis was 2.4 percent. Economic growth now on an analyzed \nbasis is 2. We have a weaker economy today than we did in 2010 when the \nPresident said raising taxes in the middle of a weak economy would be a \nmistake and a bad idea.\n  I agreed with him then, and I hope he will come to the conclusion now \nthat this is a bad solution. I know the President is insistent on \nhigher tax rates, but as I pointed out earlier, if we raise the top two \nmarginal income tax rates alone, we generate about $40 billion of \nrevenue next year. If we add to that capital gains and dividend tax \nrate increases, we get about $68 billion in additional tax revenue next \nyear, which funds government for just under a week. It simply does not \nsolve the problem if we are talking about fixing the deficit.\n  On the other hand, what it does do is make it more expensive and more \ndifficult for American businesses to create jobs to get Americans back \nto work, to get our economy growing again, and to make this country \nprosperous for future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to request that \nwe have unanimous consent for S. 3313, which is the Women Veterans and \nOther Health Care Improvement Act of 2012, which was unanimously \nsupported by the members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee to be moved \nout of this body today.\n  This legislation not only builds upon previous laws that we have \npassed to improve VA services for women veterans and veterans with \nfamilies, but it also brings a new focus to the need for the VA to do \nmore to help women veterans and the spouses of male veterans have \naccess to assistance for one of the most impactful and serious wounds \nof these wars, reproductive and urinary tract trauma.\n  As many of you know, the nature of the current conflicts and the use \nof improvised explosive devices leaves servicemembers far more \nsusceptible to those kinds of injuries. In fact, Army data shows that \nbetween 2003 and 2011 nearly 2,000 of our servicemembers have suffered \nthose kinds of battle injuries.\n  Like so many of our veterans, these men and women come home and look \nto returning to their lives, to finding employment, and to starting a \nfamily. Yet what they find when they go to the VA is that the fertility \nservices that are available don't meet their complex needs for these \ninjuries. In fact, veterans suffering from those kinds of injuries find \nthat the VA now is specifically barred from providing more advanced \nassisted reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilization or \nIVF. They are told when they come home that despite the fact they have \nmade such an extreme sacrifice for our Nation, we can't provide them \nwith the medical services they need to start a family--veterans such as \nSSG Matt Keil and his wife Tracy, who is here with us today. I am so \nproud of her and her courage in making sure this is available for \nfamilies like hers.\n  Staff Sergeant Keil was shot in the neck while he was on patrol in \nRamadi,\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\nIraq, on February 24 of 2007, 6 weeks after he married the love of his \nlife, Tracy. The bullet went through the right side of his neck, hit a \nmajor artery, went through his spinal cord, and exited through his left \nshoulder blade. Staff Sergeant Keil instantly became a quadriplegic. \nDoctors informed Tracy that her husband would be on a ventilator for \nthe rest of his life and would never move his arms or his legs. Staff \nSergeant Keil eventually defied the odds and found himself off that \nventilator and beginning a long journey of physical rehabilitation.\n  Around that same time, Tracy and her husband started exploring the \npossibilities of starting a family together--something that is a dream \nof so many young people in America today. Having children was all they \ncould talk about once they adjusted to their new normal. With Staff \nSergeant Keil's injuries preventing him from having children naturally, \nTracy turned to the VA for assistance and began to explore her options \nfor fertility treatments. Feeling defeated after being told the VA had \nno such programs in place for her in her situation, Tracy and Staff \nSergeant Keil decided to pursue IVF through the private sector. While \nthey were anxious to begin this chapter of their lives, they were \nconfronted with the reality that TRICARE did not cover any of the costs \nrelated to Tracy's treatments because she did not have any fertility \nissues beyond her husband's injury. Left with no further options, the \nKeils decided this was important enough to them that they were willing \nto pay out-of-pocket to the tune of almost $32,000 per round of \ntreatment.\n  Thankfully, on November 9, 2010, just after their first round of IVF, \nStaff Sergeant Keil and Tracy welcomed their twins Matthew and Faith \ninto the world--two beautiful children. Tracy told me--and these are \nher words:\n\n       The day we had our children, something changed in both of \n     us. This is exactly what we had always wanted. Our dream had \n     arrived. The VA, Congress, and the American people have said \n     countless times that they want to do everything they can to \n     support my husband or make him feel whole again, and this is \n     your chance. Having a family is exactly what we needed to \n     feel whole again. Please help us make these changes so that \n     other families can share in this experience.\n\n  That is what Tracy said to me.\n  I have heard from these severely injured veterans, and while the \ndetails of their stories vary, the common thread that runs through all \nof them is that these veterans were unable to obtain the type of \nassistance they needed. Some have spent tens of thousands of dollars in \nthe private sector, just as Tracy and her husband did, to get the \nadvanced reproductive treatments they needed to start a family. Sadly, \nothers have watched their marriages dissolve because of the stress of \ninfertility in combination, of course, with the stresses of readjusting \nto life after a severe injury, which drove their relationships to a \nbreaking point.\n  Any servicemember who sustains this type of serious injury deserves \nso much more. The bill I am here today trying to get passed will give \nthe VA broad authority to offer advanced fertility treatments to the \nmost severely wounded veterans, their spouses, or surrogates. It also \ngives the VA authority to determine how best to offer those benefits. \nIt reverses this troubling barrier to care and will bring the VA in \nline with the military, which provides these services to this same \ngroup of servicemembers.\n  This is commonsense legislation. It should pass without delay. In \nfact, the New York Times recently ran an editorial on this bill, and it \nsaid:\n\n       In more than a decade of combat overseas, the military and \n     the VA have continually had to adjust to the challenges of \n     new traumas with new treatments, as with the epidemic of \n     brain injuries and post-traumatic stress. Adapting the VA \n     health system to better meet reproductive health needs should \n     be part of that response. It is one compassionate way to \n     fulfill the country's duty to our wounded veterans.\n\n  They also noted that even this Congress should be capable of a \nbipartisan agreement to pass it, and I couldn't agree more. I can't \nthink of any reason why any Republican or Democrat won't join us today \nin getting this bill passed. This is about giving veterans, who have \nsacrificed absolutely everything, every option we have to help them \nfulfill a dream of simply starting a family. It says we are not turning \nour backs on the catastrophic reproductive wounds that have become a \nsignature of these wars. It says to all of these brave men and women, \nwho didn't ask questions when they were in harm's way, that we won't \nlet politics get in the way of our commitment to them.\n  The VA has an obligation to care for the combat wounded, and that \nshould include access to the care they need. Our women veterans deserve \nthis, our male veterans deserve this, and our military and veteran \nfamilies deserve this.\n  My understanding is that the objections have been removed, and we \nexpect this bill to be passed tonight when we clear the bills as we end \ndiscussions. I thank all of my colleagues who have stepped up to make \nthe reality of a family real to these men and women who have served us \nso well in combat, have come home with extremely serious wounds, and \nwho--because this legislation hopefully will pass this body and \nhopefully we will get the House to pass it--will then have their dream \nof having a family become a reality.\n  I am very proud to have worked on this bill in a bipartisan way to \nmove it out of our Veterans' Committee. My understanding is that we \nwill be able to clear this bill tonight and move it along its way to \nthe President for his signature and give hope to many men and women who \nserved our country to have a family once again.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor once \nagain to urge my colleagues to act on extending the production tax \ncredit for wind, otherwise known as the PTC.\n  If we let the production tax credit, the PTC, expire in the next 18 \ndays--we literally have 18 days before it does expire--that expiration \nhas the potential to cost our economy thousands of good-paying middle-\nclass jobs. We just can't let that happen. Tens of thousands of \nAmericans who work in the wind industry are depending on us to extend \nthis important tax credit and in doing so save jobs and encourage \ninvestment in more States, such as my State of Colorado and the State \nof the Presiding Officer, New Mexico. If we fail to extend the PTC, we \nrisk jeopardizing not only our economic growth but also our capacity, \nour potential, our ability to continue leading the world in the \ndevelopment and use of clean energy technology.\n  I have come to the floor over 25 times to speak about this issue, and \neach time I do, I highlight a different State and what the PTC has done \nto encourage economic growth. Today I am really pleased to be able to \nspeak about the great State of New Mexico, the State of the Presiding \nOfficer; their wind resources rank 10th in the United States. New \nMexico is an impressive example of how wind can be harnessed to create \ngood-paying jobs, support local communities, and produce American-grown \npower.\n  I wish to speak specifically about various areas in New Mexico. New \nMexico has eight counties with wind projects, as my colleagues can see \nfrom the map here. The largest one is the New Mexico Wind Energy \nCenter. It straddles Quay County and DeBaca County, which is located in \nthe eastern central part of the State, in this area here. This is a \nvery impressive project, as the Presiding Officer knows since it is his \nhome State. It opened in 2003. It runs 136 turbines and produces 200 \nmegawatts of power. Located 170 miles south of Albuquerque, it produces \nenough electricity to power 95,000 New Mexico homes, which is almost \nhalf of all the homes powered by wind in the State. So this is an \nimpressive project. The Presiding Officer has probably visited the site \nand knows firsthand.\n  In terms of jobs, wind projects employ 500 New Mexicans around the \nState, and these are really good-paying\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\njobs. We have seen all across the country that investment in wind power \nis really an investment in the middle class and support for what makes \nour country great, which is building our economy from the middle out. \nThese jobs are found across the ledger, if you will, including \noperations, maintenance, construction, and manufacturing, as well as \nthe many support sectors. Of course, we know that when we have a \nfundamental, core business such as this, it creates a ripple effect. \nThere are a lot of other small businesses that take root.\n  New Mexico--and I don't have to tell the Presiding Officer, but I \nwill tell him anyway--has two outstanding Senators, outstanding \nleaders, and they are Senator Bingaman and Senator Tom Udall. Those two \nSenators have championed the renewable energy sector, and they \nunderstand the significance of the production tax credit.\n  I particularly wish to mention Senator Bingaman, who is the chairman \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He has continued to \npress the Congress on the need to extend the PTC. I know we are going \nto see a package come forward that will have other clean energy tax \ncredits in it. I am a member of the Energy Committee as well. I have \nthat great honor. I really want to tell all of us in the country that \nwe are going to lose a renewable energy champion when Senator Bingaman \nretires in just a few weeks.\n  Let me turn back to the potential in New Mexico for wind energy \ndevelopment. As I understand it, to pass this means that if we fully \ndevelop the wind resource in New Mexico, we could provide nearly 75 \ntimes New Mexico's current electricity needs. That is an enormous \nnumber. It is why we need, by the way, a grid upgrade, because when New \nMexico harvests all that wind, we are going to send that energy to \nplaces such as Tucson and Phoenix, probably into Texas, and maybe all \nthe way to the west coast.\n  Let me turn back again to the need to extend this tax credit. If we \ndo not extend it--again, we have just over 2 weeks to extend it--we \nrisk not only losing jobs but the momentum we have developed toward \nachieving true energy security and economic growth.\n  Already, because of inaction in the Congress over this last year, we \nhave seen Americans laid off in the wind energy industry. Clean energy \nplays a crucial role in creating new jobs and electricity production. \nWe cannot risk losing more good-paying American jobs. Some studies \nsuggest that if we let the PTC expire, we are going to lose half the \nwind energy industry, which would fall from 75,000 jobs to something on \nthe order of 37,000 jobs. This is not acceptable.\n  We cannot let the production tax credit expire. We need to pass it as \nsoon as possible. It is simple: The PTC equals jobs. We need to pass it \nas soon as possible.\n  Think about countries such as China and Germany. They are continuing \nto expand their wind industries and renewable energy sectors. If we do \nnot support our wind energy industry here and the wind manufacturing \nfacilities, we are effectively offshoring and exporting those jobs. Our \nglobal competitors are not hesitating. They are encouraging wind power \ndevelopment, and they know the longer we fail to act, literally, the \nmore wind they can steal from our sails.\n  So enough is enough. This is an American industry. It needs to \ncontinue to be an American industry. But we risk everything--literally \neverything--if we let the PTC lapse in 18 days. So let's focus on this \nmade-in-America potential. Through it, we can obtain energy \nindependence, we can ensure energy security, and we can keep jobs in \nNew Mexico and Colorado and Minnesota and New York--every State in our \ngreat country. So let's not wait any longer. Let's continue to build \nthis clean energy economy right here in the United States. Let's do it \ntoday. The PTC equals jobs. Let's pass it as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge a fiscal \ncompromise that will allow us to avoid negative and very real \nconsequences of the approaching fiscal cliff. Every day that passes \nwithout a deal only increases uncertainty in the markets and puts the \nbrakes on potential economic activity. Failure to bring the national \ndebt under control threatens our country's future.\n  In the weeks following the election, the message was clear from the \npeople of this country. They want the people in this Capitol, they want \npeople in Washington to come together to find reasonable, balanced \nsolutions to our Nation's problems.\n  We need to show the country we are serious about working together to \naddress our fiscal challenges--reducing the cost of borrowing and \nstrengthening our financial outlook. The sooner we can agree on a long-\nterm, balanced deficit reduction package, the better for our economy \nand the better for our country. It is time to put political differences \naside to work on an agenda that strengthens our economy, promotes \nfiscal responsibility, and increases global competitiveness.\n  I have always said that we need to make things in America, that we \nneed to invent again, and that we need to export to the world. We are \nstarting to do that again. I see it all over our State, where \nfortunately our unemployment rate is better than a lot of other States. \nIt is about 5.8 percent, but we can do even better. One of the keys to \ndoing better is not only focusing on exports, on education, it is also \nbringing down this debt in a balanced way, in a way that will not \nsuddenly jar our economy and put us over the edge but in a way that in \nthe long term means businesses, the people of the world can look at it, \nthe businesses can look at it and say: They are serious about this. \nThey are doing this in a measured, balanced way, but they are going to \nget this done.\n  If we refuse to have an honest conversation, if we insist on using \nthe debate only for a vehicle for political rhetoric, we will not just \nbe doing ourselves a disservice, we will be cheating our children and \ngrandchildren out of knowing the America we grew up in, the America in \nMinnesota, where one smalltown businessperson can start a business and \ngrow and grow and grow and employ their kids and their grandkids, where \na farmer can build a farm that employs people throughout the town, \nwhere someone in New Mexico can get an idea for wind energy or solar \nenergy and start a new business. That is what this America is about.\n  In 2011 we came together and put in place discretionary spending caps \nthat will reduce our debt by over $1 trillion in the coming decade. We \nalso agreed to find another $1 trillion in savings before December 31 \nof this year.\n  While significant spending cuts are a necessary part of a balanced \nsolution, any plan to responsibly lower the deficit cannot come from \ncuts alone. Revenue must also be part of the solution. I have \nappreciated that several of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have acknowledged this, that revenue must be part of the \nsolution. Now we have to put words into action.\n  I think the most common refrain I hear from the business community at \nhome when we discuss what it will take to spur investment and create \njobs--what they talk about is certainty. They need certainty. They need \ncertainty if they are a farmer. We need to include the farm bill in \nthis package so they know what they need to get for their crop \ninsurance. They need certainty if they are a businessperson and \ndeciding whether they should invest in new equipment, and they need to \nknow exactly what the tax consequences and other consequences of that \ninvestment will be.\n  So on the revenue side, in addition to the cuts I just discussed, \nwhat does that mean on the revenue side?\n  First, it means extending the tax cuts for middle-class America. In \nMinnesota, 2 million families and small businesses will see their \nFederal income taxes increase by an average of $1,600 unless the \nmiddle-class tax cuts are extended. This means a lot for a family \ntrying to decide whether they can afford a student loan to send their \nkid to college this fall or a business owner looking to invest in their \ncompany. It means a lot.\n  Second, this means returning to the Clinton tax levels for people \nmaking over $250,000 a year. Let's go back to that time. Under those \nrates, the economy created nearly 23 million jobs. Small businesses \ngenerated jobs at\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\ntwice the rate during the Clinton years than they did under the years \nof the Bush tax rates.\n  But we do not have to look as far back as the 1990s to see the impact \nof extending tax cuts for 98 percent of all Americans versus extending \nthem for those making over $250,000. At a recent Joint Economic \nCommittee hearing, I pointed out that extending tax cuts to households \nmaking under $250,000 would increase real GDP by 1.3 percent and \nincrease employment by 1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. By \ncomparison, expanding the tax cut extension to include taxpayers making \nover $250,000 per year would only add an additional one-tenth of 1 \npercent to GDP. That is very little bang for the buck than what you get \nby extending them for the middle class. So that is one of the reasons \nwhy we are so focused on looking at this in terms of extending those \ntax cuts for people making under $250,000 and then going to the Clinton \nlevels for people making over $250,000.\n  What is the other reason? The other reason is pretty obvious. That is \nwhat I started with. We have to bring our debt down. When you look at \nhow much this would save just by going back to the Clinton levels for \npeople making over $250,000, it would save nearly $700 billion over the \nnext 10 years, and when interest payments are included, that number \ncould easily exceed $1 trillion.\n  How many times have we heard economists say that we should look at \nthe neighborhood of $4 trillion in reduction in debt over 10 years to \ngive the world confidence in our country? So that is $1 trillion of it \nright there simply by going back to the Clinton tax levels for people \nmaking over $250,000.\n  You have another $2 trillion--$1 trillion of which we already agreed \nto--that you can do in spending cuts. I believe the other $1 trillion \nyou can get by closing loopholes and making some changes that will not \nbe on the backs of the middle class and seniors and veterans in this \ncountry--things such as the oil subsidies, such as looking at the home \nmortgage deduction, which is incredibly important, but perhaps we could \nlimit it to $500,000 of the value of a home. So if you buy a $1 million \nhome, that is great, you get a home deduction for up to $500,000 of the \nvalue of the home. Those are a couple examples.\n  That is the last part we are most likely not going to get to in the \nnext 2 weeks, which is closing loopholes and ending subsidies, but \nright now we have to look at the Bush tax cuts and what we can do to \nextend them for the middle class and then get $1 trillion in debt \nreduction, with a downpayment on that debt reduction going into next \nyear, as well as the spending cuts we need to make. The downpayment on \ndeficit reduction would send a strong signal that Washington is serious \nabout getting our Nation's fiscal house in order.\n  Finally, in addition to the spending cuts and revenue measures I \nspelled out, in order to ensure that our country remains competitive, \nwe must move toward tax reform. One of the ways we can ensure business \ngrowth and more jobs is to create incentives to invest here in the \nUnited States and spur innovation, and that is by simplifying the Tax \nCode, by closing some of these loopholes I discussed, and by reducing \nsome of the business rates and paying for reducing those business rates \nby closing those loopholes and ending some of the tax subsidies.\n  We know that is not going to be an easy task, but I believe we are up \nto it because Americans are up to it. They are up to it every single \nday when they go to work, when they make it sometimes in a very \ndifficult situation, with one, two, three jobs, having difficult profit \nmargins. They make that decision every day, and the least we can do in \nthis Chamber and in Washington, DC, and in the House of Representatives \nis to get this done.\n  It is time we get serious about advancing a deal that is both fair \nand achievable. If we are committed to our country and not to rigid \nideologies, we will get this done. None of us want to see our economy \ncrippled. We have finally seen it stabilize, and in States such as mine \nwe are beginning to see it grow again.\n  We just found out we had a huge increase in November home sales in \nMinnesota. There are positive signs across our country. But the way we \nget this in the direction we want to go, which is moving forward in a \nstrong way, not just a stable way, moving forward to make sure we bring \ndown our debt in a balanced way--we do not want to see things go \nbackwards; Democrats do not want that, and Republicans do not want \nthat--it is time for us to work together to show the American people \nthat Washington is not broken, that, instead, we are willing to put \naside our politics to do what is right for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleague, the Senator from Colorado--my cousin, but he is more like a \nbrother--to highlight the importance of clean energy, renewable energy. \nThe Senator just spoke a little bit earlier about renewable energy, \nclean energy, and wind energy. I wish to express my support for the \nextension of the wind production tax credit.\n  Mark Udall, he knows well--as do I--how important this is. I wish to \ncommend him for his efforts on the floor--and his persistent efforts--\nto try to get this done. I came to the Chamber to discuss wind \nincentives earlier this year. I urged then and I urge now an immediate \nextension. We need this before the end of the year. We need to provide \ncertainty for wind projects and employees.\n  But here we are again. We have not gotten it done yet. We are going \nto have to keep working. As the Presiding Officer and the Senator from \nCalifornia know, we work on the floor, we work off the floor, we are \nworking behind the scenes to try to get this done. We need to get this \nextension.\n  This vital tax credit for wind is set to expire in 18 short days. \nThat would be a huge mistake to let it expire. Many projects would be \ndelayed, thousands of jobs would be lost. Clean energy jobs have been a \nbright spot in our economy. We have seen wind energy capacity in \nAmerica grow to the equivalent of 75 large powerplants. It is still \ngrowing. We added the equivalent of 106 large powerplants' worth of \nwind power in 2011. We see this on this chart. We are going to add even \nmore this year.\n  This chart shows some interesting facts about wind power in New \nMexico. We already have enough wind power installed in New Mexico to \npower 200,000 homes. We have 20 times more capacity in the planning \nstages. Then look at this projection: New Mexico has wind potential \npower 75 times more than the State's electricity need, with the right \ntransmission lines--and I think this is something we also want to work \non together--getting a good grid in place, a smart grid, and getting \nthe areas of the country hooked up that have wind energy to be able to \nmove it around. With the right transmission lines, New Mexico is set to \nbecome a major wind power exporter.\n  Wind power already supports 500 jobs in New Mexico. Wind farms mean \npayments for farmers and ranchers in New Mexico during times of \ndrought. They mean a local tax base support for rural schools. They \nmean a brighter future for our economy. We are seeing real growth, real \npotential. But progress depends, in part, on us continuing the support \nfor this tax credit. The tax credit has been extended seven times by \nPresidents and Congresses of both parties. It was enacted under a \nDemocratic Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush. \nIt was extended in 1999 by a Republican Congress and signed by \nPresident Clinton. In 2005, it was extended under President George W. \nBush as a part of the bipartisan energy legislation drafted by Senator \nBingaman and Senator Domenici of New Mexico.\n  I do wish to say we are going to miss Senator Jeff Bingaman, our \nchairman on the Energy Committee. He has done a remarkable job of \nputting clean energy at the front and center of our\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\nagenda. Then this tax credit was most recently extended in 2009 as part \nof President Obama's Recovery Act. So renewable energy has enjoyed \nlongstanding bipartisan support, and the wind tax credit has been a \ngreat success.\n  The cost of wind power has fallen dramatically, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows. It has fallen dramatically over the years. For example, \nGE's wind power costs have dropped from 15 cents per kilowatt hour to \nnear 5 cents in the last 10 years. Wind is becoming cost competitive \nwith fossil fuels. On some days, it is the cheapest electricity \navailable. Let me repeat that because that is important because we hear \narguments out there that this is expensive. But on some days, it is the \ncheapest electricity available.\n  The Department of Energy estimates we could receive 20 percent of our \nelectric power from wind alone by 2030. But we need to stay the course \nand support a policy with proven benefits. We will not need this \nincentive forever, but we should not eliminate it overnight. Wind \nresources are widely available in the West, the Midwest, and often \noffshore.\n  Support of the wind tax credit is diverse. Wind power benefits a wide \nvariety of Americans: farmers and ranchers who lease their land, tax \nrevenues for rural school districts, iron workers, steel workers and \nengineers and everyone who wants to breathe clean air. Other \ncountries--China, India, Japan, and Germany--see these benefits too. \nThey also want the job growth. They also want the energy security. They \nare acting aggressively to take leadership of the clean energy economy.\n  Our workers and entrepreneurs can compete with anyone on a level \nplaying field. But the Congress is tying one hand behind their backs by \nleaving important incentives such as this in jeopardy. Let us continue \nthe bipartisan support for the wind tax credit. Let us work together \nand get the job done for our economy, for our energy independence. Let \nus continue to invest in clean energy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise for one final time to address the \nSenate. My remarks will be brief. Actually, I just want to say one \nthing: Thank you. I wish I could say it with the eloquence of one of my \nfirst friends in the Senate, Senator Dale Bumpers, who told his stories \nand always made his case pacing these aisles like a lion tethered to a \nspecially made, extra long microphone cord, or with the breadth of \nvision of the late Senator Robert C. Byrd, who sprinkled his classic \nMother's Day or Fourth of July speeches with memorized poetry and his \nvast command of history, or with the fire of my dear friend, the late \nSenator Ted Kennedy, who would bellow to the rafters his passion for \nthe America that could be and then call on the Senate to make it so.\n  What a privilege it has been to serve with such men and so many other \nmen and women who have made up this body over the last 24 years. You \nhave been my friends, advisers, sometimes adversaries, always worthy, \nand my inspiration. I thank you. My colleagues in this body are, to a \nman or a woman, thoughtful, hard-working patriots. We do not always \nagree, understandably. But every Senator I have met is pursuing a \ncourse he or she believes is best for the Nation and advocating \npolicies he or she believes are best for their States.\n  When I have come to any of you with my ideas about what is best for \nthe Nation or my State, you have listened respectfully, counseled \nwisely, and helped whenever you could, and so I thank you.\n  The Senate is often referred to as a family, and that is certainly \nhow I feel about my staff, many of whom are gathering today to say our \ngoodbyes. Perhaps what I will miss the most on leaving the Senate is \ncoming to work every day in Washington and in Wisconsin with such a \nbright, creative, and dedicated group of people constantly focused on \nwhat is best for our Nation and my State, challenging and pushing me to \nbe the best Senator I could be. You cannot be a cynic about the future \nof this country when you work in an office such as mine and have the \nprivilege to interact with generations of intelligent, civic-minded, \nand loyal staffers.\n  I thank them all for making a hard job not just easy but enjoyable \nand for serving the people of Wisconsin tirelessly and exceedingly \nwell.\n  My final thanks go to the extraordinary people of Wisconsin. Thank \nyou for letting me pay back, in part, the great debt my family owes to \nthe State that took in my immigrant mother and father and allowed our \nfamily, including my brothers, Sidney and Allen, and our sister \nDolores, to grow and thrive. Thank you for taking a chance on me in \nthat first election 24 years ago and renewing my contract three more \ntimes. Thank you for trusting me with your problems and concerns, your \nhopes and dreams.\n  Please know we have listened to you carefully and fought for you \nalways. Every Wisconsinite who wanted it, Democrat or Republican, rich \nor poor, farmer or city dweller, got full consideration in my office. \nWhether it was arranging a Capitol tour, finding a lost Social Security \ncheck, pushing for legislation to reform the Federal dairy program or \nreviving the shipbuilding industry in Marinette, WI, every Wisconsinite \nhad an ally and an advocate in us.\n  It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve these 24 years in \nthis hallowed institution, alongside my fellow Senators and my staff \nand as the voice for the people of Wisconsin. For that, I thank you all \none last time.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with the close of the 112th Congress, our \ngood friend and colleague Senator Herb Kohl is retiring after four \nterms of dedicated service to this body, the people of Wisconsin and \nthe United States. As a Senator, Herb Kohl has shown the same \ndedication and work ethic that previously allowed him to build his \nfamily-owned business into a nationally known brand name. Indeed, \nduring his 24 years in this body, he has been a classic workhorse \nSenator, as opposed to a show horse Senator. Few Senators have been \nmore willing to shun the limelight and share the credit in order to get \nimportant things done for the people of this country.\n  Senator Kohl is also a proud and principled progressive. His work in \nthe Senate brings to mind the great words of the late Senator Hubert \nHumphrey:\n\n       The moral test of government is how its government treats \n     those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who \n     are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are \n     in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the \n     handicapped.\n\n  Senator Kohl has been respected as a leading advocate on children's \nissues. For instance, he authored legislation to expand the school \nbreakfast program and has been a strong supporter of child nutrition \nprograms. He also authored legislation requiring that handguns be sold \nwith separate child safety locks.\n  Of course, as chair of the Special Committee on Aging, he has led the \ncharge in the Senate on issues affecting older Americans, something \nespecially important in my State of Iowa.\n  In particular, I salute Senator Kohl for authoring the Physician \nPayment Sunshine Act, which was included in the Affordable Care Act. \nThe Sunshine Act, which was the focus of a series of hearings chaired \nby Senator Kohl, will require transparency and disclosure on payments \nmade to doctors and surgeons by drug and medical device companies.\n  Senator Kohl has been our leader in improving the safety and quality \nof nursing homes, ensuring criminal background checks for employees in \nnursing homes, and working with CMS to institute new and meaningful \nquality ratings for nursing homes.\n  Senator Kohl and I worked together, in my capacity as chair of the \nHealth,\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on legislative reform of the \nPension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and its outside board.\n  Senator Kohl also deserves enormous credit for his committee's \nindepth hearings and reports identifying financial scams and abuses \ntargeting seniors and the elderly.\n  Herb Kohl is a good friend, and he has been an outstanding Senator. \nHe has accomplished many things during his four terms in the Senate. \nBut I can think of no greater accolade than to say, simply, that Herb \nKohl is a good, decent, honorable person with a passion for social and \neconomic justice and a determination to make life better for ordinary \nAmericans.\n  I join with the entire Senate family in wishing Herb the very best in \nthe years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S7999-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7999-S8000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to rise to express my deep sadness \nabout the events in Michigan. Denied the chance to participate in their \nown government, Michigan workers have been the victims of backroom \npolitical trickery, and they have lost much in a short period of time. \nIt is also a sad day, however, for our entire country because Michigan \nis only the latest battleground in a much larger war on workers' \nrights. If we lose this great battle, the casualty will be the American \nmiddle class.\n  I have always said and believe that strong unions are the foundation \nof a strong middle class. When union membership was at its peak in this \ncountry, we all grew together. The middle class grew and prospered. \nEveryone, from the richest CEO to the minimum wage worker, benefited \nfrom our Nation's prosperity when labor union organization was at its \npeak.\n  Michigan's economy has always been a shining example of that shared \nprosperity, where an autoworker who put in a hard day's work could earn \nenough not only to buy one of the cars he made but to buy a house, send \nhis kids to college, take a nice vacation, have a good retirement, and \nlive the American dream.\n  As unions have declined in this country, the middle class has \nsuffered. Those at the top earn more and more, while ordinary working \npeople are seeing the American dream slip out of their reach.\n  It is not just union workers who are losing ground because unions \ndon't only benefit their members. They benefit each and every American \nworker, regardless of whether one has ever held a union card. It is \nunions that fought for all the things we sort of take for granted. It \nis unions that fought for the 40-hour work week, a fair minimum wage, \nlaws against discrimination, and laws that keep workers safe on the \njob. It is unions that are fighting today for Medicare, Social \nSecurity, job training, and other programs that help working families \nsucceed.\n  I think it is important to go back to, truly the founding father, if \nyou will, of the American labor movement, Samuel Gompers. He was asked \nonce, ``What does labor want?'' Here is what he said:\n\n       What does labor want?\n       We want more school houses and less jails; more books and \n     less arsenals; more learning and less vice; more leisure and \n     less greed; more justice and less revenge; in fact, more of \n     the opportunities to cultivate our better natures.\n\n  That was Samuel Gompers, and he went on to say:\n\n       Where trade unions are most firmly organized, these are the \n     rights of the people most respected.\n\n  Historically, we know that is true. Perhaps, most important now, \nAmerica's labor unions are the last remaining voice strong enough to \nspeak out for those who are not rich and not powerful. That is why they \nare under attack. Unions are under attack because they are one of the \nfew remaining groups strong enough to stand up to the powerful, the \nvery wealthy interests that want to run our country and ship our jobs \noverseas.\n  Last Thursday, Governor Snyder of Michigan called a press conference \nwith the Republican leaders in the Michigan House and Senate and \nannounced their plans to force through a change in Michigan laws for \nthe so-called right-to-work law.\n  By the end of that same day, Republicans had introduced and passed \nright-to-work bills. There was no real debate. There were no hearings. \nTo make matters worse, they manipulated the process to prevent the \nvoters in Michigan from ever reviewing their actions. Why do I say \nthat? Because Michigan law allows voter referendums on most laws but \nhas an exception for appropriations bills. So the Republicans in the \nlegislature attach their antilabor provisions to an appropriations bill \nto deny voters in Michigan the chance to even be heard on it.\n  But here is the key thing about the American people, when we are \nfighting for our families and our children's future, we will not be \nbullied, nor will we be silenced. This week's events in Michigan \nillustrate this so powerfully. Ordinary working people with bills to \npay, kids to feed, and worries on their minds are taking time out of \ntheir busy lives to stand together, shoulder to shoulder, to say enough \nis enough.\n  This is not, again, just about organized labor. There are huge stakes \nfor the middle class in the ongoing Republican assault on the right of \nAmerican workers to organize and bargain collectively. There is a very \ndirect connection between this war on unions and the harsh reality that \nAmerican workers' incomes have effectively stagnated and even declined \nin recent decades, even as corporate profits have skyrocketed.\n  In an important column earlier this week, the Nobel Prize-winning \neconomist, Paul Krugman, points out that even as the economy has \nstruggled, corporate profits are at an alltime high. Moreover, as \nProfessor Krugman points out, ``profits have surged as a share of \nnational income, while wages and labor compensation are down. The pie \nisn't growing the way it should--but capital is doing fine by grabbing \nan ever-larger slice, at labor's expense.''\n  As this chart shows, corporate profits have been rising rapidly for a \ndecade in dollar terms, but wages have been stagnant, barely keeping up \nwith inflation over time. In dollar terms, total wages have been \nincreasing slightly, but that is because of inflation and the size of \nthe workforce. A growing number of workers are dividing up their share \nof the pie. But corporate profits have been skyrocketing, almost \ntripling over a decade. Therefore, the worker's share gets smaller and \nsmaller.\n  This is what this second chart shows. It is kind of a little \nconfusing, so I will explain it. If we look at a longer period of time \nin terms of the gross domestic product, what we see is that from the \n1950s till 2000, wages and corporate profits moved back and forth \nrelative to each other. But since the 1980s, we see a picture of \ncorporate profits increasing and exploding over the last decade. At the \nsame time, wages and salaries have been on a steady downward slope as \nthe economy has grown. As I said, this pattern has accelerated \ndramatically over the past decade.\n  So let's take a look and try to make some sense out of this chart. \nHere are wages as a percent of the gross domestic product. If we look \nback at the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, up to about 1980, we will see that \nlabor's share was right around 50 percent, give or take a little bit--\nright around 50 percent of GDP--and corporate profits basically kept in \nline with its share. Beginning in 1980, wages--the red line--started \ngoing down and corporate profits started their huge climb. But for the \nrecession, where they took a dip, we can see the huge increase now in \ncorporate profits as a percent of GDP has more than doubled from its \nlow point in the recession of a decade ago. It has reached its highest \npoint in over 70 years. Wages have fallen down to below 44 percent of \nGDP.\n  So as a percent, we can see that corporate profits have skyrocketed \nbut not wages, and this is what is happening: More and more of the pie \nis going to corporate profits, and less and less is going to wages. \nThat is the squeeze that is going on. If we look at unions and trade \nunions during this same period of time, we see, beginning right in \nhere--beginning early in the 1980s, right in here--the huge attack on \norganized labor, the eroding of labor's rights in many ways, and so \nwages started going down.\n  These are not just wages of union people. These are wages of all \nworking people--all working people. That is why I say it is not just \nunion members who have benefited from the strength of organized labor; \neveryone in the\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\nmiddle class has benefited from it. Throughout most of the 20th century \nlabor unions led the push for higher wages, for pensions, health care \nbenefits, and safer working conditions. The gains won by unionized \nworkers served to lift wages, benefits, and working conditions for \nnonunionized workers as well. Millions of middle-class Americans who \nnever thought about joining a union have received very considerable \nbenefits from the labor movement.\n  I always ask people: How did we get the 40-hour workweek, time-and-a-\nhalf overtime, paid vacations, worker safety? This didn't happen \nbecause management voluntarily gave it. People struggled for this. They \nfought for this, marched for this, and many got beat up, lost their \njobs and their livelihoods fighting just for a 40-hour workweek or for \ntime-and-a-half overtime or paid vacations. Yet it has benefited the \nentire middle class of America. That is why I say when the Republicans \nare doing an open assault on organized labor, they are assaulting the \nmiddle class of America. They are dragging down the middle class of \nAmerica.\n  As the war on unions has succeeded in dramatically shrinking the \nshare that is unionized, this has reduced the ability of most workers \nacross the entire economy to negotiate increases in wages and salaries. \nThe result is the growing imbalance--skyrocketing corporate profits at \na time when personal income is stagnant or declining. The fruits of the \nexpanding economy have accrued overwhelmingly to corporations, their \nexecutives, executive pay, and shareholders, leaving workers behind.\n  Despite skyrocketing profits, and despite the fact that corporations \nand shareholders have taken the lion's share of income from the growing \nGDP, corporations are still demanding lower rates of taxation and huge \nadditional advantages regarding corporate taxes. So corporations get \nmore and more of the GDP at the same time they say: We don't want to \npay any more taxes; we want to pay less taxes. Corporations paid an \naverage effective rate of just 7.9 percent in 2011--7.9 percent. Now, \nwasn't it Mr. Romney, the Republican nominee, who said corporations are \npeople too? Well, I bet a lot of people in this country would like to \npay 7.9 percent of their income in taxes. But the corporations are \nstill not satisfied. They want even lower rates, even as the middle \nclass and the poor are asked to make major sacrifices--major \nsacrifices--as we address the so-called fiscal cliff and the real \ndeficit that we do have.\n  Very high income Americans get most of their income from capital \ngains and dividends. The tax on that type of income is now 15 percent--\nthe lowest percentage since the 1930s. I repeat: Since the 1930s, the \nlowest percentage on capital gains and dividends is right now, at 15 \npercent. But until 2003, dividends were taxed at the same rate as \nregular income. Now dividends are getting the same very generous \ntreatment as capital gains, while regular income rates are now 35 \npercent.\n  So just think about that: It wasn't until 2003 when we said, OK, \ncapital gains, dividends, 15 percent. Before dividends were always the \nsame rate as regular income. So who gets that? The wealthy. Average \nworking people don't have significant dividends or capital gains.\n  Republicans claim that economic calamity will occur if those rates go \nup. But let's look at recent history. When the 1993 tax bill passed, \nevery Republican here voted no. Many Senate Republicans predicted \neconomic calamity if it passed. I was here. I remember those debates. \nYou can look it up in the Record. However, in the 5 years after the \npassage of the Clinton tax bill in 1993, 14 million jobs were created. \nContrasting that, in the 5 years after the 2001 tax bill passed--that \nlowered the regular rate to 35 percent--only 4 million jobs were \ncreated.\n  Now, I am not saying raising taxes creates jobs, but raising tax \nrates does not kill jobs either. As we address the fiscal cliff, \ncorporations and high-income individuals can afford to pay a greater, \nfairer share of Federal revenue. In recent years, they have seen their \nincomes grow by huge sums. It would be grossly unfair to shift the \nburden to the middle class, which has already been deprived of its fair \nshare of the growing economic pie in recent decades.\n  Mr. President, people in Washington are obsessing about what they \ncall the fiscal cliff. Well, we do indeed face fiscal challenges in the \nfuture. But I am more concerned about the crisis of America's middle \nclass--a middle class confronted by stagnant or declining wages, with \njobs being shifted overseas and with traditional benefits, such as \npensions and health insurance, being taken away.\n  There is no doubt the debate over collective bargaining rights will \ncontinue--in Michigan and across the country--for months, probably \nyears to come. While there is little I can do standing in the Senate to \ndirectly help the people of Michigan today, I wanted to come to the \nfloor to tell them a lot of us stand with them, and we will stand with \nthem tomorrow. A great injustice is being committed in the State of \nMichigan--again, not just against union members but against the middle \nclass.\n  I think we have to recognize what is happening in this country: an \nassault on union workers, on collective bargaining, and the assaults we \nhave seen by my Republican friends on the National Labor Relations \nBoard, the National Mediation Board--anything to take away from workers \ntheir right to bargain collectively.\n  When you are a minimum-wage worker or just above, and you are working \nat Walmart, how much power do you think you have against the Walton \nfamily or their corporate executive? What, are they the second or third \nrichest family in the world now? Do you think you have some bargaining \npower? You don't have anything. But if you are unionized, and you have \nall of the union members with you, now you can bargain. Now you get on \na more even keel with wages and capital to make sure wages and capital \ndon't get too far out of kilter.\n  That is simply what has happened. Too much of our GDP in the last 30 \nyears has gone to capital and not enough to labor. When that happens, \nmiddle-class America suffers. When middle-class America suffers, we all \nsuffer because we know from history, from our American experiment, the \nAmerican economy grows best from the middle out, not from the top down.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I feel sorry for those workers who were \ncaught off guard in Michigan. I feel sorry for the middle class in \nMichigan--those whose rights are being undermined. But we stand \nsteadfast in our support for the rights of working people and for the \ninherent--the inherent--right of people to be able to join together to \nform an association or a trade union and to bargain collectively for \ntheir wages, hours, and conditions of employment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to address legislation \nthat is under consideration--the extension of what is known as the TAG \nProgram. The acronym stands for the transaction account guarantee. I \nwish to discuss this a little bit and give the reasons for my \nopposition to the extension of this program.\n  First, a little bit of history about this. Many people are familiar \nwith the FDIC Insurance Program. It is a longstanding program that \nprovides a limited guarantee on bank deposits. Actually, for a very \nlong period of time--I think it was over 25 years, starting in 1980--\nthe limits on the dollar amount of a balance that would get this FDIC \nguarantee was $100,000. That limit was raised for all accounts to \n$250,000 during the financial crisis of 2008, and then subsequently \nthis new program was created, this Transaction Account Guarantee \nProgram, which provides an unlimited guarantee. There is no limit \nwhatsoever for a large category of deposits--not all deposits but all \nnon-interest-bearing transaction deposits, which is a long way of \nsaying pretty much checking accounts, although it\n\n[[Page S8001]]\n\nwould include other things. As you might imagine, there are many large \ncorporations, municipalities, and very wealthy individuals who have \nthese large accounts, and today those accounts are guaranteed without \nlimit. The proposal we have is to extend this guarantee which is set to \nexpire on December 31, to extend it for 2 more years.\n  Let me be clear about one thing right off the bat. This is a \ntaxpayer-provided guarantee. The taxpayers are on the hook for these \ndeposits. If anybody has any doubt about that, I refer them to the \nFDIC's Web page. The home page of the FDIC's Web site states very \nclearly that ``FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of \nthe U.S. Government.'' That means the taxpayers, so American taxpayers \nare on the hook for the full amount of these transaction guarantees.\n  Let me explain why I think this is problematic. The first reason is a \nsimple one. We are not in a financial crisis anymore. We have a \nmiserable economy, but we certainly do not have a free-fall fiscal \ndisaster, with financial institutions collapsing. We do not have the \nfall of 2008 anymore. There is actually quite a lot of stability in \nfinancial institutions. You could have a very interesting debate about \nwhether this was ever a good idea, but I do not understand how you can \njustify it now in an environment that does not even faintly resemble \nthe crisis circumstances of 2008. If we are going to extend it now for \n2 more years when there is clearly no need for it, it certainly seems \nto me to suggest an interest in making this a permanent feature of the \nAmerican banking system--permanent, unlimited guarantee, the \nsocialization of deposits in this country, which I think is a terrible \nidea.\n  Second, this is a big contingent liability for taxpayers. There is \nabout $1.5 trillion in deposits right now that fall into this category \nand is being guaranteed and would continue to be guaranteed if the \nguarantee were extended.\n  It is also worth noting that this mostly benefits the big banks. It \nis big banks, not surprisingly, that have a disproportionate share of \nbig accounts. In fact, the 19 largest banks hold two-thirds of all the \ndeposits and accounts that are guaranteed under the TAG Program, so \nthis is a nice big help to a lot of big banks.\n  I would argue that there is something maybe even worse than all of \nthis about this. I believe the very existence of the TAG Program \nactually increases the risk of bank failures, and here is the reason \nwhy. In the absence of these unlimited guarantees, a corporation or a \nmunicipality or a wealthy individual or an institution making a large \ndeposit--an amount that exceeds the limited FDIC's traditional \nguarantee--such an institution is going to do its due diligence on the \nstrength of the bank. It is going to want to understand that this bank \nis properly run, that it is prudently managed, and that due diligence \nis a discipline the market imposes on the banking system. The banks \nhave to prove to potential depositors that they are well run, that they \nare sensible and prudent and are not taking too much risk in order for \nthe depositors to be confident they will ever be able to get their \nmoney back. So that is a very important mechanism that imposes a \ndiscipline that helps to keep banks doing what is prudent.\n  With this unlimited transaction guarantee, nobody has to worry about \nwhether the bank is well run because the government, the taxpayer is \nthere to return all their money if the bank messes up. That removes \nthat very important discipline and in the process I think actually \nincreases the risk that more financial institutions, more banks would \nin time fail because they are not held to a higher standard by their \ndepositors and that therefore the taxpayers would be picking up an even \nlarger tab than what some might project.\n  I argue that the premiums systematically underfund this program. \nThere are premiums that are charged to the banks in return, but banks \nwould be adamantly insisting that they have the option to opt out if \nthey were not being subsidized. The fact is, it is being subsidized. So \nthe taxpayers are not getting, in my view, an adequate premium for the \nrisk they are taking--not that they should be in the business of taking \nthat risk in the first place.\n  The last point I would make about the banks is that I don't think \nthis is good for the banks themselves because this is the kind of \ngovernment program that inevitably leads to a lot of people in this \ntown thinking they have the right to force the banks to do whatever \nthey want them to do, including giving away goods, and it is justified \non the grounds that it is reasonable for us to ask of these banks \nsince, after all, we the taxpayer, we the government provide them with \nthis guarantee. So I think this is not in the interest of the banks \nthemselves.\n  I am sympathetic with the argument that some of my friends in the \ncommunity banking world have made, the argument that with Dodd-Frank, \nwhen we codified too-big-to-fail, we created a whole category of large \nfinancial institutions and we designated them--we use a different \nacronym--we call them systemically important financial institutions. \nMost people see that as another way of saying too big to fail. Having \ncodified that, our community bankers argue that that gives these banks \nan unfair competitive advantage in attracting depositors.\n  I am sympathetic to that argument, but I would argue, first of all, \nthat it is seldom a good idea to counter one bad government policy with \nanother one. Compounding errors usually takes you in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Second, what we need to do is reform Dodd-Frank. We need to do a lot \nin reforming Dodd-Frank, in my view. That is the right way to deal with \nthis perception of a competitive advantage. We ought to be providing a \nlot of regulatory relief for community banks, and I say that as someone \nwho has been actively involved in the community banking industry \npersonally.\n  I also suggest that there are other ways community banks can, in \nfact, successfully compete against the large banks, other than with \nthis guarantee of deposits.\n  My last point is that last year we ran a deficit of $1.1 trillion. \nThis coming year, unfortunately, it looks as though we are likely to do \nsomething like that again. This bill violates the Budget Control Act, \nthe cap, the limit we put on spending. It exceeds that, and it creates \na new amount of spending above and beyond what was contemplated. I \nthink that is a huge problem in and of itself. So I oppose this \nlegislation on the substance of it, but in particular I am objecting to \nthe fact that it does exceed this budgetary authority.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I intend to raise a budget \npoint of order. If that is now, I will do it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8001-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 3637, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3637) to temporarily extend the transaction \n     account guarantee program, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 3314, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3315 (to amendment No. 3314), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid motion to commit the bill to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs, with instructions, Reid amendment \n     No. 3316, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 3317 (to (the instructions) amendment \n     No. 3316), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 3318 (to amendment No. 3317), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, the pending measure, S. 3637, the \nTransaction Account Guarantee Act, exceeds the Banking Committee's \nsection 302(a) allocation of new budget authority and outlays deemed by \nthe Budget Control Act of 2011; therefore, I raise a point of order \nagainst this measure pursuant to section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 \nof\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending measure, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12 \nnoon will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees prior to a vote on the motion to waive the budget point \nof order.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I support the budget point of order that \nhas been raised, but let me just make a point. I had an amendment that \nwould have kept this budget point of order from being a problem. The \nreason we are where we are is that both Republicans and Democrats had \namendments to this bill, and the ones we put forth would have solved \nthis budget point of order, but because my amendment has not been \nheard, the Senator from Pennsylvania has raised this budget point of \norder, and the fact is that I hope it will be sustained. But what is \nthe shame of all of this is that both Democrats and Republicans had \namendments to this bill. I think the amendment I put forth would have \ncarried the day. It would have allowed the FDIC to actually charge \nenough money in the difference for these transaction accounts so we \nwould not have the budget point of order that has been raised. But the \namendment has not been heard. The leader filled the tree, and therefore \nno amendments--not Republican amendments, not Democrat amendments--\ncould have been heard.\n  The other amendment I had that would have helped even more or added \nto this solution is we could have made this program voluntary so that \nif there are community programs around the country that wanted to \nparticipate in this program, they could have done so on a voluntary \nbasis.\n  So there are two amendments--one that would have forced the FDIC to \nactually charge enough money to make this account actuarially sound, \nand that amendment is not being heard, and an amendment to allow this \nto be voluntary so that if there are community banks that are \nstruggling and feel as though they need to protect these accounts and \nstill keep them in their banks, they could have paid the actuarially \nsound amount to make that occur. But neither one of those amendments \nhas been heard.\n  I would say to everybody in this body who is tired of this place not \nworking because neither side of the aisle has the opportunity to vote \nfor amendments, to have amendments heard and voted on, I say to both \nsides of the aisle that we absolutely should vote to uphold this point \nof order and hope that when we come back next year, both Republicans \nand Democrats will have the opportunity to represent their constituents \nback home by offering amendments that can actually be voted on in this \nbody.\n  I thank the Senator for raising the point of order. I wish we could \nhave made this work for our country in an appropriate way, but what we \nare going to have today is just a simple vote.\n  I will just say this--and I probably shouldn't--the only reason we \nare voting on this amendment is that my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle know Dodd-Frank has hurt community bankers throughout this \ncountry. They are trying to throw a bone out to community bankers \nacross this country, and they are trying to get us to vote against it. \nThat is not the way this place should work.\n  I have amendments that would have fixed this bill, made it work for \ncommunity bankers, and we could have gone forward. The only reason we \nare doing it this way is because my friends on the other side of the \naisle know the provisions in Dodd-Frank are hurting community bankers \nand they are trying to throw a bone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Tennessee \nwould yield to me on this very point.\n  Mr. CORKER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nmaking this point. I have an amendment to this bill that I would like \nto have had heard. It strikes a middle ground between the unlimited per \naccount liability and the $250,000 we have traditionally had. It is a \nmodest compromise as well as an alternative, and it will not be \nconsidered because of the very practice my friend from Tennessee has \nmentioned.\n  It is not only our amendments--I just came in on the tail end of the \nSenator's remarks--but there are Democratic amendments which deserve to \nbe heard on this bill. Senator Udall has an amendment--he is a member \nof the majority party--and it is a well-reasoned amendment that \ndeserves to be considered and heard. The distinguished majority leader \nhas chosen to fill the amendment tree and offer only his select \namendments, and now I am deprived from the ability that I think a \nrepresentative of several States should have; that is, to bring forth \nan idea and have it heard. I might not be able to get a majority on it \nand Senator Udall may not prevail, but we deserve to be heard.\n  This has been the greatest deliberative body in the world--at least \nthat is what I heard before I came over from the House of \nRepresentatives--but it has not turned out that way. The majority \nleader time and time again fills the amendment trees, thereby \npreventing any of the other 99 Senators from offering amendments.\n  The Congressional Research Service has identified 40 instances in \nwhich opportunities for debating and offering amendments had already \nbeen limited by the Senate majority leader by filling or partially \nfilling the amendment tree.\n  I have one more point and then I will yield back to my friend from \nTennessee. We are going to miss the services and the independence of \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Maine, Ms. Olympia Snowe. I think \nanyone in this body would have to admit Senator Snowe has been \nevenhanded, bipartisan, and often nonpartisan. She has objected to this \nvery practice by this very majority leader, and I think it is \ndestructive to the overall process of the Senate.\n  In the specific words of retiring Senator Olympia Snowe: First and \nforemost, the Senate should have the ability to debate more than the \nthree amendments the majority leader is allowing. It is therefore \nimperative that Senate deliberations on the Defense bill be conducted \nwithout limitations and in a manner that allows for the consideration \nof all related amendments that Senators may wish to offer.\n  I have been aggrieved that my little amendment is not going to get \nanymore debate than these few moments right now. I know the Senator \nfrom Tennessee feels the same way, and undoubtedly Senator Udall would \nprefer a vote and debate on his amendment. We can fix the Senate. We \ncan get back to the leadership we had under Mansfield and Mitchell of \nMaine and Lott of Mississippi and other majority leaders. We can move \nlegislation along but not if we continue this abuse of the process by \nfilling the amendment tree.\n  I will be voting with the distinguished Senator from Tennessee and \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania on the point of order because we need to \ndraw a bright red line there. Perhaps we can get on this issue at some \nother point. I hope the Senate can get back to an orderly debate on \nmatters of substance.\n  I thank my friend, the Senator from Tennessee, for yielding on that \npoint.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for \nhis comments, and I will yield the floor to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  I have a couple more comments, and when appropriate, I will make \nthem.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nallowing me to make a couple points. These are very well-made points \nabout having the opportunity to actually debate and try to improve a \nbill on the floor. One of the things that disturbs me is that I see a \npattern that is playing out today, and this is not the first time. This \nis just part of why we have not had a budget resolution for 3 \nconsecutive years. The majority party does not want to have to come \ndown and actually cast votes.\n  If there is a budget resolution on the floor, there surely will be \namendments. We all come from different places, have different ideas, \nand we want our constituents to have a chance to get their\n\n[[Page S8003]]\n\nsay. The majority party apparently does not want to have to cast votes. \nI think that is part of why there has not been a single appropriations \nbill on this floor, and that is just a shocking abdication of our \nresponsibility.\n  Here we are in mid-December, and while the committee has voted this \nout--if not every appropriations bill, the vast majority of them--not a \nsingle one has been brought to the floor. We have seen this happen on \nbill after bill. I hear the criticism that Republicans will not allow \nthe body to get on the bill. The motion to proceed passed; the cloture \nmotion passed. We are on the bill. Despite that, there is no \nopportunity to have a meaningful, substantive debate about ways this \ncould be improved and changed. It is not possible because the \ndistinguished majority leader refuses to permit it. In my view, that is \nthe dysfunction of this body; it is a pattern, and it is a problem. I \ntoo had a couple of amendments I would like to have had an opportunity \nto discuss.\n  I wish to make one other point. On the few occasions when the \nmajority leader has actually permitted an open amendment process--the \nfarm bill, postal reform bill, and Defense authorization come to mind--\nwe would start with a huge, long list of amendments. Then people say: \nThere are too many. I will give up some of mine. We got to a manageable \namount, we dealt with them, and actually all three of those bills \npassed. The process works when it is allowed to take place, but this is \nnot a very good function.\n  The last point I will make is to urge my colleagues to remember when \nwe are running trillion-dollar deficits as it is, the last thing we \nought to do is increase the size of those deficits with a taxpayer \nbailout of banks, and that is what this ends up amounting to.\n  I urge my colleagues to sustain this point of order.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I will be a little more brief this time. I \nthank the Senator for the point of order that he made and also his \ncomments. We have some people on our side of the aisle who I know--due \nto things that have happened in this body previously--have had some \namendments. I know some people feel as though we are harmful to banks \nwhich they may have supported in the past and maybe this is a way to do \nsomething that sort of makes it even, if you will.\n  I will just say to my friends on this side of aisle that may have \nsome of those feelings, we have two amendments--there are actually \nmultiple amendments--that will make this bill work. One amendment would \ncause the FDIC to charge the rate necessary to take into account the \nlosses that are going to occur. I think it might pass by unanimous \nconsent. I cannot imagine why people in this body would not like the \nFDIC to have to charge the appropriate amount.\n  Secondly, it would make this program voluntary. There are a lot of \nbanks that candidly don't want to participate. They don't want to pay \nthe fee. We can make this voluntary.\n  To my friends on this side of the aisle, I just want to say: Look, if \nwe could hear these amendments, we could make this bill work for \neverybody. I don't like these kind of guaranteed programs, generally \nspeaking, but I would be willing, if my amendment is passed, to support \nthis bill.\n  I wish to go back to the last point. A point of order has been \nraised. The way this bill is now constructed, it violates the Budget \nControl Act. This body has voted to uphold budget points of order on \nsome pretty tough issues.\n  I think the point the Senator from Pennsylvania is making is we are \ngoing to violate a budget point of order to create a bailout for banks. \nI don't know. In my opinion, that is not exactly what we need to be \ndoing. We can fix this if we could hear our amendments to make it so it \nis not a bailout for the banks by just making it actuarially sound and \nknow they are covering their costs themselves, but the majority leader \nwill not let us do that.\n  Candidly, I hope my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle would \nvote to uphold this budget point of order, knowing that if we could \nconsider all the amendments today, we could actually make this sound. I \nhope we would unify the body and say to the majority leader: Enough \nwith filling the tree and not allowing the Senate to operate. Let's get \nbeyond that.\n  Again, I hope we will support the budget point of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the way we arrived at this point is the \nCongressional Budget Office, our chosen authority on budget matters, \nhas concluded that the legislation violates the budget, and they \nsubmitted analysis to that effect that has been provided to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, an honorable chairman \nof the committee. He and his staff have examined it, and they concluded \nthat it does. They have advised the Parliamentarian.\n  Senator Toomey has now raised the budget point of order, and based on \nthe report from the chairman of the Budget Committee, the \nParliamentarian will rule that this legislation spends more than we \nagreed to spend under the Budget Control Act limitations and will \ntherefore sustain it. The people who are promoting the legislation will \nseek to waive the budget, ignore the fact that it violates our spending \nlimits, and pass the bill anyway. I think that is bad.\n  We have had a series of these votes. It is time for the people who \nadvance legislation in the body to be careful, and when they submit \nlegislation that it stays within the budget. When they block this \nlegislation, it violates it.\n  In August a year ago, Congress agreed to certain spending \nlimitations. It was not enough in my view, but there were some \nnoticeable limitations. We would still spend more every year but limit \nthe growth. Regardless, it was limited. There was a limit on how much \nwe could spend. Whether it is up or down, it limited it, and this would \nbe in violation of it.\n  I wish we could get to a point of where the legislation was fixed \nbefore it got to the floor and was in compliance with the budget.\n  I say to my colleagues, as ranking Republican on the Budget \nCommittee, we can get the score. CBO will give us the score. There is \nplenty of opportunity to have this information before the vote and \nbefore the bill comes before the floor.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to the motion \nto waive the budget point of order.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I would like to continue the \ndifficult task of saying goodbye to Senators who will not be with us in \nthe next Congress. Sadly, that includes Senator Scott Brown of \nMassachusetts.\n  Senator Brown came to us already something of a political legend. In \njust a few short years, he leaves behind an outsized legacy. We all \nremember how Scott rose to national prominence in the election \nliterally heard about around the world. After the death of Senator \nKennedy, there was an open seat in Massachusetts and a special election \nto fill it. Few people even entertained the thought of a Republican \nwinning. And for good reason. Few States are as synonymous with \npolitical liberalism.\n  Democrats outnumber Republicans in the State 3 to 1, and the entire \ncongressional delegation is composed of Democrats. But supported by his \nwife Gail and their daughters, along with some key early allies, \nincluding our own Senator McCain, Scott appealed to the State's \npolitical independents, ran a flawless campaign, and won. As he put it \non election night, he beat the odds and the experts, and the people \nbecame the machine. I think the 2006 GMC Canyon that Scott drove around \nduring the election should actually go to the Smithsonian.\n  We all remember that night, and, in particular, Scott's acceptance \nspeech. Most people focus on what he said about his daughters, but the \nspeech itself was a masterpiece. It perfectly summed up the political \nmoment, and it captured something essential about Scott's success; that \nis, the notion that no politician has a right to his or her seat; that \nwe are all here to serve our constituents.\n  Every day I hold this office, Scott said, ``I will give all that is \nin me to serve you well and to make you proud . . . [and] most of all, \nI will remember that while the honor is mine, this Senate seat belongs \nto no one person and to no political party, and as I have said before, \nand you said loud and clear today, it is the people's seat.''\n  Scott lived up to his promise. He captured the imagination of the \nentire country when he corrected David Gergen by telling him the so-\ncalled Kennedy seat was, in fact, the people's seat. He carried that \nmessage straight to Washington.\n  I remember Scott telling me in our very first meeting that I could \nnot count on his vote, that I would have to earn it. I told him he \ncould do whatever he pleased. While he has not been here long, he has \ncertainly made his mark. I have seen a lot of politicians in my day, \nbut few have been as talented as Scott Brown. He is a unique talent. I \nhave no doubt we will see him back in Washington someday in the not too \ndistant future.\n  The truth is, Scott's victory was not the first time he had done what \nothers thought impossible. As a young man, he knew poverty first hand, \nand a broken home, and even took to shoplifting to feed himself and his \nsister. Yet Scott overcame these early challenges. As is often the \ncase, he owes a lot of it to an adult who saw his potential early on.\n  In Scott's case, that adult was Judge Samuel Zoll. When Scott showed \nup in his chambers one day, Judge Zoll saw a troubled but decent young \nman who needed a friendly nudge.\n  ``We had a long talk about [the] talent I thought he had, and I \ndidn't want to see him squander it,'' Judge Zoll later recalled.\n  Scott, of course, remembers it a little differently, saying the judge \n``verbally kicked [his] butt.''\n  The judge ordered Scott to write a 1,500-word essay about \ndisappointing his family. After reading it, he told Scott he would give \nhim a break this time, but if he ever stole anything again--anything--\nhe would be sent to jail. Judge Zoll's lesson stuck so deeply that the \ntwo men remained friends until Judge Zoll's death last year.\n  Scott went on to be a baseball star in high school and in college, \nearning the nickname ``Downtown Scotty Brown.'' That was for his \naccuracy with a 3-point shot. Then he went to law school, the Army \nNational Guard, held city and State political office, where he was 1 of \njust 5 Republicans in a body of 40 in the State senate and then the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Senator Brown also famously found time to do a little modeling in his \nyouth, and it was through this work that he met his wife Gail. I have \nhad the pleasure to get to know Scott and Gail well over the last 3 \nyears. They have two daughters and make an absolutely wonderful family. \nI am sure Gail, Ayla, and Arianna are very proud of Scott and just as \nsad as I am to see his tenure cut short. But they should be proud of \nthe fact that Scott has accomplished a lot in 3 short years in the \nSenate.\n  He led the charge to repeal a burdensome withholding tax that hurt \nsmall businesses. He crafted legislation for crowdfunding, which \nallowed job creators to raise startup funds for their businesses over \nthe Internet with less redtape, and he introduced legislation to ensure \nthat children's hospitals have access to discounts on orphan drugs that \nare used to treat rare diseases. All of these bills are now law.\n  As a 32-year member of the National Guard, Senator Brown takes a \nspecial interest in our men and women in uniform and their families. He \nintroduced legislation to give businesses incentives to hire veterans, \nwho, sadly, have\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\nhigher unemployment rates than the national average. He introduced and \nsaw to passage legislation creating the Office of Service Member \nAffairs to protect troops who are often targeted by financial fraud and \nscams. He saw to the passage of legislation making it easier to void \ngovernment contracts with businesses found to be funneling taxpayer \nresources to terrorist groups. He fought for National Guard members and \ntheir families to receive their fair housing allowance when deployed \noverseas.\n  Although his work in the Senate has come to an end, I am sure Scott \nBrown's work in public service, in whatever capacity, will not. He is \nstill a young man with a bright future ahead of him. I, for one, am \nvery much looking forward to seeing how he uses his talents next.\n  From the statehouse to the Senate, from the modeling shoot to the \nbasketball court, Senator Scott Brown has always made his own success. \nI do not think he knows any other way.\n  Scott, it has been an honor serving with you. You not only made \nhistory, you made a difference. You should be proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the real-world \nconsequences of failing to achieve a fair and balanced solution to \navert the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that would otherwise \noccur at the end of December--the end of this month.\n  Failing to continue unemployment insurance, allowing taxes to rise on \nmiddle-income Americans, and cutting Federal spending too much and too \nsoon during a struggling economic recovery could, as the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated, cause a new recession.\n  This is a fate we can and should avoid for people in my State and \nacross the country. Indeed, families in Rhode Island are still getting \ntheir economic footing and cannot afford another economic setback. An \neconomic downturn will erase the strides we have made so far to \nstrengthen our economy and exacerbate the widening income inequality, \nwhich Americans sense and recognize in an economy that all too often \nseems stacked against them. Instead, we must work toward a compromise \nthat is fair, helps the middle class, creates jobs, and strengthens and \naccelerates our economic recovery.\n  As I see it, widening income inequality and the sense that future \ngenerations will not see the same kind of economic security as my \ngeneration is one of the most pressing challenges facing our Nation. \nOver the past several decades, top earners have taken a bigger and \nbigger chunk of income while wages have stagnated for far too many \nAmericans.\n  From 2000 to 2007, incomes for 90 percent of workers rose by about 4 \npercent, while the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans saw income \ngains of 94 percent. The vast majority of Americans have seen wage \ngains that are barely enough to keep their heads above water, while a \nvery small number of top-income earners have seen an extraordinary \ngrowth in income.\n  In 2010 alone, about 20 percent of all income went to the top 1 \npercent. We are now back to income inequality levels similar to just \nbefore the Great Depression. Such wide disparities are unsustainable, \ncreate economic instability and threaten our social fabric.\n  In the past, when income inequality has reached these kinds of \nlevels, Democrats and Republicans have both recognized its \ndestabilizing impact and worked together to reward success while \nproviding meaningful opportunities and a sense of fairness for all \nAmericans.\n  I believe there are straightforward ways we can begin to reverse this \nescalating income inequality--ways which are true to the founding \nprinciples of our Nation. After all, we have done it before. From the \nend of World War II and well into the 1970s, incomes grew rapidly \nacross the United States and economic prosperity was broadly shared. As \nour economy grew, every level of America shared in that growth.\n  By making education affordable, fostering innovation and job \ncreation, and providing economic security to retirees through Medicare \nand Social Security, our country went from a paralyzing Great \nDepression to an economic superpower. We were able to accomplish such a \ndrastic transformation because we were willing to consider revenue as a \nway to invest in the future and promise economic security to our \nseniors.\n  Focusing spending on policies that work and balancing revenue is at \nthe core of this debate. I have made tough choices in the 1990s that \nbalanced the budget, generated a surplus, and supported robust job \ncreation. In January of 1993, the unemployment rate stood at 7.3 \npercent, and by January of 2001 that rate had been reduced down to 3.9 \npercent. That period of record growth also saw a substantial decline in \nthe poverty rate. In 1993, 15.1 percent of Americans were in poverty, \nbut thanks to job growth and an expanding economy based upon a balanced \napproach to deficit reduction--including revenue and reduction in \nexpenditures--poverty fell to 11.3 percent in 2000.\n  But the unpaid wars of the Bush administration, excess tax cuts for \nthe wealthy, and a financial crisis brought on by lax regulation under \nthe Bush Presidency erased those hard-fought gains of the 1990s. As a \nresult, we have seen education become more expensive, Federal \ninvestments that support economic prosperity for all have been reduced, \nand economic gains have been concentrated at the top. Meanwhile, in \nspite of repeated claims, lower tax rates for the wealthiest haven't \ndriven job creation and economic growth. We have had record low income \ntax rates; yet now we are struggling with one of the worst unemployment \ncrises we have seen since the Great Depression.\n  I believe the election has shown Americans want us to return to the \nprinciples that work for the benefit of everyone, not just a select \nfew. With that in mind, the path forward should be clear.\n  We should continue tax cuts for income up to one-quarter of a million \ndollars and reduce the deficit by nearly $1 trillion. We should \ncontinue extended unemployment insurance for 2 million people who will \nlose it otherwise. We should prevent further immediate cuts to Federal \ninvestments in things that keep us safe, grow our economy, and enhance \nthe lives of Americans, whether it be infrastructure, workforce \ntraining or research and development.\n  What we should absolutely not do is make changes, hasty changes, to \nSocial Security and Medicare that would undermine the promise of \neconomic security to seniors, not just this generation of seniors but \nsucceeding generations of seniors. Fairness, opportunity, respect for \nthe rules, and a sense of security in retirement, those are the \npriorities that can't be lost as we debate the budget.\n  So I am disheartened to hear that Republicans are holding the middle \nclass and the entire economy hostage in order to preserve nearly $1 \ntrillion in additional tax cuts for the top 2 percent of Americans, \nwhile at the same time proposing detrimental changes to Social \nSecurity, Medicare and Medicaid. I believe this is an untenable \nposition and one I hope my colleagues on the other side will soon \nabandon.\n  Moreover, the Republican proposal does not provide immediate, short-\nterm aid to 2 million Americans out of work and looking for employment. \nThese were men and women who were working, and as a consequence of the \neconomic difficulties over the last few years have lost their jobs. \nTheir proposal would not, as the President's plan does, put Americans \nback to work, not just by continuing benefits in terms of unemployment \ninsurance but by putting Americans back to work improving our roads, \nbridges, and transportation infrastructure.\n  Unfortunately, in the past, too many on the other side of the aisle \nhave stymied efforts to accelerate the recovery like blocking jobs \nlegislation that was paid for by asking millionaires to pay Clinton-era \nrates on income over $1 million. They have endorsed proposals that \nwould transform Medicare into a voucher program and Medicaid into a \nblock grant, which would merely shift health care costs to seniors and \nStates rather than address underlying cost drivers and inefficiencies.\n\n[[Page S8006]]\n\n  So it is not surprising Speaker Boehner has put forth a significantly \nflawed proposal, in my view, that would jeopardize our economic \nrecovery, undermine the middle class by not providing immediate support \nfor our recovery, and do very little to achieve real deficit reduction.\n  While the President, in contrast, has put forward a clear and \nspecific plan, the Speaker's proposal is light on details related to \ndeficit reduction. It is, I sense, another sign that the Republican \nParty is out of touch with the majority of Americans who favor the \nPresident's approach. We have had an election in which voters made it \nclear that if we are going to propose major policy changes, then those \nproposals must be real and credible. Americans want us to be candid and \nhonest with them as we make these difficult decisions.\n  We can disagree about policy--we do that all the time--but it is hard \nto disagree about simple arithmetic. The Speaker, for example, has \nproposed $800 billion in taxes through ``limiting deductions and \nlowering rates,'' also known as ``lowering rates and broadening the \nbase.'' But as many nonpartisan analysts have shown, the numbers don't \nadd up. ``Lowering the rates and broadening the base'' just means tax \ncuts for the wealthy and higher taxes for the middle class because \ndeductions for home ownership, charity, State and local taxes would \nhave to be severely limited for most Americans in order to pay for the \ntop rates and avoid further growing the deficit.\n  It is not only the math that doesn't add up, but it is also their \nassumption about job creation and the economy. Historical data shows \nreductions in top tax rates have had little impact when it comes to \ncreating jobs and boosting growth. But tax cuts do, according to the \ndata, increase income inequality.\n  In contrast, the President and Democrats have been clear with the \nAmerican people that we can't afford nearly $1 trillion in additional \ntax breaks for the top 2 percent--which do little for job creation and \nexacerbate income inequality. We should let the top two marginal tax \nrates expire. Democrats have already passed legislation in the Senate \nto do that. And again, to be clear, letting the top marginal tax rates \non income over a quarter of a million dollars expire would still mean \nall Americans get a tax cut for income below that level.\n  Moreover, Speaker Boehner, in his proposal, again raises the specter \nof increasing the Medicare eligibility age and reducing Social Security \nbenefits. While raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 \nbeginning in 2014 would result in $125 billion in Federal savings, it \nwould basically shift all those costs onto State governments and the \nprivate sector.\n  To help illustrate this cost shift, the Kaiser Family Foundation \nexamined what would happen during the first year the policy would take \neffect, 2014. In that year, individuals would not qualify for Medicare \nuntil age 65 and 2 months. This change would trigger $5.7 billion in \nFederal savings. However, spending on the part of State governments, \nemployers, beneficiaries and individuals and families slated to \npurchase health insurance through new health insurance exchanges would \ndouble--to the tune of $11.4 billion. Indeed, increasing the Medicare \neligibility age is a shell game that will just shift costs and do \nnothing to bend the proverbial cost curve.\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle wish to reduce the \ndeficit by $125 billion, there are better ways to do it. We can start \nby closing egregious loopholes that benefit companies that shift jobs \noverseas or benefit oil and gas companies.\n  And there are ways to reform Medicare and Medicaid without shifting \ncosts to beneficiaries and making the goal of a secure retirement \nharder to achieve. Indeed, the Affordable Care Act makes a downpayment \non deficit reduction with a sensible and thoughtful approach to \naddressing the underlying drivers of health care costs. And we can do \nmore in this regard. We can eliminate overpayments to Medicare \nAdvantage plans. We can allow the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to negotiate directly with companies on the cost of \nprescription drugs in Medicare--or, at the very least, increase rebates \nin programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n  We should not look to Social Security to solve our fiscal deficit \neither. Social Security will continue to spend less than it takes in \nuntil 2033. And even if we don't do anything to address this very long-\nterm issue, beneficiaries would still receive 75 percent of their \nexpected benefits, according to the law. Moreover, Social Security is \nnot a driver of the deficit. If we make any changes to the program, \nthey must be done, I believe, outside the debate on the deficit and \ndirected at extending the life and solvency of the Social Security \ntrust fund in order to keep our commitment, not only to this generation \nof seniors, but to succeeding generations of seniors.\n  Shoring up Social Security can be achieved in several ways, for \nexample, by broadening the taxable wage base. The last time Social \nSecurity was reformed in 1983, the cap on taxable income covered 90 \npercent of earnings. Now the cap only covers 85 percent of income and \nis steadily decreasing. The first thing we can do is begin to restore \nthe original intent of the program and we can do that by lifting the \ncap on wages over $250,000.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side would hear the same message \nwith respect to some of their proposals regarding Medicaid. Medicaid is \nalready a rather efficient program. Medicaid actually costs less per \nbeneficiary than private insurers to cover similar people with similar \nhealth issues. Medicaid spending has grown at a slower rate for \nbeneficiaries than private insurance. Changing the financing structure \nof Medicaid is just another example to score a political victory at the \nexpense of some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\n  I hope to work with all my colleagues, on both sides, to strengthen \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. But now, with only 3 weeks \nleft, it is not the time to make hasty and drastic alterations to the \nfoundation of economic security for seniors and for their families. \nBecause when we talk about seniors, we are also talking about their \nsons and daughters who would have to step up and fill the gap if we \nmade unwarranted changes to Medicare and to Social Security.\n  Many of these Republican proposals don't sound particularly serious. \nThe revenue and deficit reduction targets are deceptive and, worst of \nall, it seems to be more sloganeering, not problem solving. Our goal \nshould be improving the economy and reversing the stark trend of income \ninequality that has been exacerbated by this great recession and \nprolonged unemployment.\n  We should not cut the deficit on the backs of the middle class and \nseniors. We only have a few weeks before various provisions of the law \nwill begin to cut into our economic growth. The loss of unemployment \ninsurance, for example, will be immediately harrowing for the 2 million \non unemployment insurance; middle-income families will be squeezed more \nand more as their taxes rise and government spending in critical \nprograms is slashed, all because some on the other side are more \nconcerned with protecting tax breaks for the wealthiest.\n  Economists believe this kind of economic contraction could lead to \nanother recession, where once again low- and middle-income families \nwill feel the brunt of the downturn and have the hardest time making up \nlost ground during the ensuing recovery.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues drop their attempts to cut the \ndeficit on the backs of 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small \nbusinesses in order to provide additional tax cuts to the wealthiest 2 \npercent of Americans. I hope my Republican colleagues drop their \ndemands to make drastic and hasty changes to Medicare, Medicaid and \nSocial Security. I urge them to pass the Middle Class Tax Cut Act, \ncontinue unemployment insurance, and work with us to develop a rational \nalternative to sequestration. This approach is fair to the middle \nclass, will grow our economy and create jobs, and will help turn around \nincome inequality in our country.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8007]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business and that I be allowed to consume as much time as \nneeded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today with an infinite \nappreciation for the institution of the U.S. Senate as well as a \nprofound sense of gratitude as I prepare to conclude my 18 years in the \nSenate and my nearly 40 years in elective office on behalf of the \npeople of Maine.\n  It has been difficult to envision this day when I would be saying \nfarewell to the Senate, just as it was impossible to imagine I would \none day become a U.S. Senator as I was growing up in Maine. But such is \nthe miracle of America, that a young girl of a Greek immigrant and \nfirst-generation American, who was orphaned at the age of 9, could in \ntime be elected to serve in the greatest deliberative body the world \nhas ever known and become the third longest serving woman in the \nhistory of the U.S. Congress.\n  So in contemplating how to begin my remarks today, I was reminded of \nthe words of the renowned American poet and son of New England, Ralph \nWaldo Emerson, who said:\n\n       Cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing \n     that comes to you, and to give thanks continuously. And \n     because all things have contributed to your advancement, you \n     should include all things in your gratitude.\n\n  That perfectly encapsulates how I am feeling on this day--thankful \nand blessed. In that light, I first and foremost want to thank the \npeople of Maine for allowing me to be their voice, their vote, and \ntheir champion for 16 years in the U.S. House of Representatives and \nfor three terms in the U.S. Senate. One of the definitions of the word \n``trust'' is ``a charge or duty imposed in faith or confidence.'' And \nto have had the trust of Maine people, who have placed their faith and \nconfidence in me, is an honor of indescribable magnitude. Indeed, \nserving my magnificent State over the past 34 years in the Halls of \nCongress has been the greatest privilege of my life.\n  I also want to thank my amazing husband, Jock McKernan, who is with \nus today and who, as you know, was a former Congressman and former \nGovernor of Maine. In fact, when Jock was Governor while I was serving \nin the House of Representatives, we used to joke that our idea of \nquality time together was listening to each other's speeches. But \ntruly, we have shared a passion for public service and quite a unique \njourney together, with 56 years between us in elective office, and we \nhave never regretted a single moment.\n  I am also pleased to say he is joined today by our very wonderful, \nlongtime friends, Dan and Sharon Miller from Maine.\n  On this occasion, I also think of my family, without whom none of \nthis would have been possible. I have often joked that the secret to my \nelectoral success is coming from such a large extended family--some of \nwhom we started on campaigns at birth, I might add. But they have been \na source of boundless love and support over the years, through the \nstruggles as well as the celebrations, and I thank them from the bottom \nof my heart.\n  It is also impossible to serve for this long and at this level \nwithout dedicated and exceptional staff, and during my tenure in the \nHouse and Senate, I have had nearly 400 people on my staff who have \nhelped to make all the difference for me, for Maine, and for \nWashington. Here we have had tremendous support with the invaluable \nguidance and efforts on the part of my staff through the extraordinary \nevents of more than three decades, and they have represented the very \nbest and brightest the Nation has to offer. They are here today in the \nback of the Chamber and up in the gallery, and I applaud them time and \ntime again. In fact, we had a wonderful reunion of all of my staff, and \nI realize it just simply would not have been possible to have been on \nthis legislative journey without them.\n  The same is true of my staff in Maine, who have not only been my eyes \nand ears but also my stalwart surrogates in assisting Mainers with \ntheir problems and in navigating the Federal bureaucracies. Like me, \nthey have never been inclined to take no for an answer, and in so doing \nthey have touched literally thousands of lives, helping to soften the \nhardest days and brighten the darkest.\n  I thank and commend the stellar staff of the Senate, from all of \nthose ensuring the operation of the Senate here on the floor, to the \ncloakroom staff, the legislative counsel, to all of our pages who are \nhere from all across America, to all those who actually keep the \nfacilities running, and certainly to the officers who are on the front \nlines of Capitol security, protecting our visitors and all of us. You \nhave my deepest admiration for your immeasurable contributions to the \nSenate and to our country.\n  I want to express my gratitude to the minority leader for his \ngracious remarks about my service. Senator McConnell has worked \ntirelessly in leading us through extremely challenging moments for the \nSenate and for the country. His longevity of legislative experience has \nmade him a true asset to this body, for our Republican caucus, and I \nhave the most heartfelt respect and appreciation for his contributions \nto his home State of Kentucky and to this country.\n  To my friend and colleague Susan Collins, I want to thank her for her \nvery kind and extremely generous words on the floor last week. Public \nservice was imbued in Senator Collins from her earliest days in \nCaribou, ME, where, incredibly, both her parents, Don and Pat, were \nformer mayors of the city. I happened to have served with her father \nDon when he was also in the State legislature. For the past 16 years, \nSenator Collins has provided exemplary representation not only for \nMaine but for America with her voice of reason, pragmatism, and \nthoughtfulness, and Maine will truly be in outstanding hands with Susan \nCollins as our senior Senator.\n  I am also indebted to my great friend Senator Mikulski, the dean of \nthe women in the Senate and for all women, for the warm and wonderful \ncomments she made yesterday on the floor. I have known Barbara for more \nthan 30 years, beginning with our mutual service in the House of \nRepresentatives. She is truly a dynamo who has always brought to bear \nan unyielding tenacity that has consistently been reflected in her \nvigorous advocacy for those she represents.\n  As I said, in 2011 she became the longest serving woman in the \nSenate, and there is no one I would rather have surpassing the length \nof service of Maine's legendary Senator, Margaret Chase Smith, than \nSenator Barbara Mikulski. What a reflection on her legislative stature \nthat she has now assumed the mantle of longest serving woman in the \nhistory of the U.S. Congress.\n  To our Presiding Officer, I would say that I have enjoyed serving \nwith her as well in this august Chamber and getting to know her. I know \nshe will do well into the future, and I have enjoyed working with her \nover the years.\n  I see two of my colleagues here: Senator Isakson, who is my neighbor \nin the Russell Office Building--a gentleman in every way. He has been \nmagnificent to work with. And, of course, my colleague Senator \nMurkowski from Alaska, who has made some great contributions to the \nSenate with her consensus-building, her dedication, and her exceptional \nabilities. I want to thank them because I have certainly enjoyed \nworking with them and getting to know them.\n  To all of my Senate colleagues, past and present, this Chamber would \nsimply be another room with fancy walls without the lifeblood of \npassionate service and dedication you bring to this institution and our \nNation.\n  We all have our stories about where we came from, about what shaped \nour values and aspirations and why we care so much about public service \nas a vehicle for securing for others the American dream, for all who \nseek to embrace it. In my instance, my own legislative journey \ncommenced when I was elected to fill my late husband's seat in the \nMaine House of Representatives. I felt then, as I have throughout my \ncareer, that our role as public servants, above all else, is to solve \nproblems. I\n\n[[Page S8008]]\n\nhave often reflected on my 6 years in the State house and the State \nsenate in Augusta, ME, because that is where I found politics and \npublic life to be positive and constructive endeavors. Once the \nelections were over, my colleagues and I would put the campaigns and \nthe party labels behind us to enact laws that genuinely improved the \nlives of Mainers.\n  I also inherited a legacy of bipartisanship and independence from \nSenator Margaret Chase Smith, who is best remembered for her remarks \nmade during only her second year of her first term in the U.S. Senate \nwhen, with truly uncommon courage and principled independence, she \ntelegraphed the truth about McCarthyism during the Red Scare of the \n1950s with her renowned ``Declaration of Conscience'' speech on the \nSenate floor. In 15 minutes she had done what 94 of her colleagues--\nmale colleagues, I might add--had not dared to do, and in so doing \nslayed a giant of demagoguery.\n  So when people ask me why I may be challenging a particular party \nposition or why I don't simply go with the flow, I tell them: Please \ndon't take it personally. I can't help it, I am from Maine. That is \nwhat Maine people truly expect from their elected officials--they \nexpect you to do what you believe is right for the right reasons and in \nthe right way. We have seen that reflected time and again, not only \nwith Margaret Chase Smith but in the distinguished service of great \nSenators who have preceded me from Maine, from Ed Muskie to Bill Cohen \nand the former majority leader of the Senate, George Mitchell.\n  Throughout my tenure, I have borne witness to government's incredible \npotential as an instrument for that common good. I have also \nexperienced its capacity for serial dysfunction. Indeed, as I stated in \nannouncing I would not seek a fourth term in the Senate, it is \nregrettable that excessive political polarization in Washington today \nis preventing us from tackling our problems in this period of \nmonumental consequences for our Nation.\n  But as I prepare to conclude my service in elective office, let me be \nabundantly clear: I am not leaving the Senate because I have ceased \nbelieving in its potential or I no longer love the institution, but \nprecisely because I do. I am simply taking my commitment to the Senate \nin a different direction.\n  I intend to work from the outside, to help build support for those in \nthis institution who will be working to reestablish the Senate's roots \nas a place of refuge from the passions of politics, as a forum where \nthe political fires are tempered, not stoked--as our Founding Fathers \nintended. Because the Senate in particular is our essential legislative \nmechanism for distilling the vast diversity of ideologies and opinions \nin America, so that we might arrive at solutions to the challenges we \nface.\n  The fact is, we are a can-do country, infused with an irrepressible \ncan-do spirit. It is in our blood, and in the very fiber of who we are. \nIt is in our hardworking families, and in the limitless \nentrepreneurship and innovation of our people. And it is profoundly \nreflected in our heroic men and women in uniform--whose unflagging \nbravery and professionalism I have been privileged to witness firsthand \nthroughout my tenure in Congress as they answer the call in places like \nIraq and Afghanistan, with many having made the ultimate sacrifice so \nthat we may live and that freedom may always ring.\n  Here in this chamber, I have spoken with many of you who came here to \nget things done, to solve problems and achieve great things for our \nNation. I have heard you lament the inability to accomplish more in \ntoday's polarized atmosphere. And as I have traveled throughout Maine \nand America--even overseas, people ask me, has it always been this way?\n  I tell them, I am so passionate about changing the tenor in Congress \nbecause I have seen that it can be different. It has not always been \nthis way. And it absolutely does not have to be this way.\n  I have been in the Congress long enough to have experienced firsthand \nwhat can be accomplished when individuals from various political \nbackgrounds are determined to solve a problem. For instance, when I \nfirst came to the House of Representative in 1979, I joined the \nbipartisan Congressional Caucus on Women's Issues, which I ultimately \ncochaired for 10 years with Democratic Congresswoman Pat Schroeder. We \ncertainly did not agree on everything, but with only 17 women in the \nHouse and Senate, we simply could not afford to draw political lines in \nthe sand when it came to matters of importance to women.\n  So when we spoke on these issues, we spoke as women, not as \nRepublicans or Democrats. That is what drove our agendas at the \ncaucus--and, together, we started to make a real difference for women. \nThat was a time in America when child support enforcement was viewed as \nstrictly a woman's problem, a time when pensions were cancelled without \na spouse's approval, a time when family and medical leave wasn't the \nlaw of the land, and a time when, incredibly, women were systematically \nexcluded from clinical medical trials at the National Institutes of \nHealth--trials that made the difference between life and death.\n  As Senator Mikulski eloquently described yesterday in this chamber, \nshe was waging a battle for equity in women's health research in the \nSenate while Pat Schroeder, Connie Morella and I were fighting in the \nHouse. At a pivotal juncture, Senator Mikulski launched a key panel to \nexplore this shocking discriminatory treatment which further galvanized \nnational attention. And in the end, together, we produced watershed \npolicy changes that, to this day, are resulting in life-saving medical \ndiscoveries for America's women.\n  In the House, we often worked across party lines to craft our Federal \nbudgets, in sharp contrast to today's broken process where we cannot \npass a budget in 3 years, even with unprecedented deficits and debt. \nWhen President Reagan was elected in 1980, he knew he had to build \ncoalitions to pass budgets that would address the tumultuous economy. \nAnd the result was that the moderate northeast Republican group called \nthe Gypsy Moths and the conservative-to-moderate Democratic group \ncalled the ``Boll Weevils'' negotiated budgets together, to help \nreconcile our political and regional differences and in a model for \nbipartisanship, all of us spent days and weeks fashioning budgets, \nliterally going through function by function.\n  Arriving at compromise was not easy by any means. It never is. But \nthe point is, we can undertake the difficult work, if we choose to do \nso.\n  I was able to make a difference even as a member of the minority \nthroughout my entire tenure in the House, by reaching across the \npolitical aisle. And in 1995, when the voters of Maine entrusted me to \nbe their voice and their vote in the U.S. Senate and I was finally \nserving in the majority, I believed this kind of cooperative \ndisposition would remain an indispensable commodity in meeting the \nchallenges of the times.\n  That is why I joined the Senate Centrist Coalition shortly after \narriving in the Senate, which had been formed by Senators John Chafee \nand John Breaux during the 1994 health reform debate to bridge the \npolitical divide. After Senator Chafee passed away in 1999, Senator \nBreaux and I thought it was an imperative that we revive the Coalition \nto help foster bipartisanship following the divisiveness of the Senate \nimpeachment trial. And following the landmark Supreme Court ruling in \nBush v. Gore that adjudicated the presidential election, and an evenly \nsplit Senate with 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats, Senate leaders Lott \nand Daschle joined with nearly one-third of the Senate at a meeting of \nthe coalition to explore how to move forward in a bipartisan fashion.\n  And it is precisely this kind of approach that is crucial, because it \nis only when we minimize the political barriers that we can maximize \nthe Senate, allowing it to become an unparalleled incubator for results \nthat truly matter to the American people.\n  It was a cross-aisle alliance that produced the so-called E-Rate \nprogram in 1996. This was a landmark law ensuring every library and \nclassroom in America would be wired to the revolutionary resources of \nthe Internet, which one publication has ranked as fourth in a list of \ninnovations and initiatives that have helped shape education technology \nover the past generation.\n  My good friend and colleague Senator Rockefeller, with whom I have \nbeen privileged to work on so many issues, was doggedly determined to \nenact this\n\n[[Page S8009]]\n\nbenchmark initiative. In typical fashion, Jay was not going to take no \nfor an answer--which made us perfect partners and co-authors, as I was \nequally determined. And by working with Members of both parties who \nwere willing to hear the facts and judge on the merits, we overcame the \nhurdles and the E-Rate program was born.\n  During the 2001 tax debates, Senator Blanche Lincoln and I as members \nof the Finance Committee joined together to increase the amount of the \nchild tax credit and make it refundable, so that low income families \nwho didn't earn enough to pay Federal taxes could still benefit from \nthe credit. Ultimately, our measure was enacted, becoming only the \nsecond refundable tax credit ever, and ensuring the child tax credit \nwould assist an additional 13 million more children and lift 500,000 of \nthose children out of poverty.\n  I also think of how my friend, Senator Landrieu who is sitting here \nin the chamber as well, and I formed the Senate Common Ground Coalition \nin 2006, to rekindle cross-party relations. And not only have Mary and \nI made history as the first women to serve simultaneously as chair and \nranking on a standing committee, but we have worked together on \nnumerous measures that are assisting America's greatest jobs \ngenerators, our small businesses.\n  In a shining example of what is possible with civility and bipartisan \nteamwork, Senator Ted Kennedy and I coauthored the landmark Genetic \nNondiscrimination Act--to stop insurance companies and employers from \ndenying or dropping coverage based on genetic tests, so individuals \nwould not forgo those potentially life-saving tests. At that juncture, \nDemocrats were in the majority--and traditionally, the chair of a \ncommittee takes the lead name on legislation. But Ted approached me and \nsaid essentially that, because my work on GINA had made it possible, it \nshould be ``Snowe-Kennedy'' not ``Kennedy-Snowe''--a magnanimous \nlegislative gesture from the legislative lion of the U.S. Senate. And I \nam proud to say GINA passed in 2008 and has been referred to as ``the \nfirst major civil rights act of the 21st century.''\n  So there are templates for working together effectively in the U.S. \nSenate on behalf of the American people. But on occasion, it is the \nvery institution of the Senate itself that is preserved when we stake \nout common ground.\n  Even in the highly charged atmosphere of the presidential impeachment \ntrial, we made the process work. During a gathering of the Republican \nCaucus, I advocated that we hold a bipartisan meeting in the Old Senate \nChamber, to generate agreement between the parties on the conduct of \nthe trial. The Senate had been about to decide the guidelines of the \ntrial on a purely partisan basis, but by convening both parties, we \nwere able to chart a logical, reasonable and judicious course.\n  In 2005, I joined the so-called ``Gang of 14,'' comprised of 7 \nRepublicans and 7 Democrats and spearheaded largely by Senators John \nWarner, John McCain, Robert Byrd, and Ben Nelson. The group was formed \nto avert an institutional crisis as a result of repeated, systematic \nfilibuster of President Bush's judicial nominees that had been a \ncorrosive force on the Senate. In response, the Republican majority was \nseeking to break the logjam by exercising the so-called ``nuclear \noption,'' that would have jettisoned longstanding rules requiring 60 \nvotes to end a filibuster.\n  That 60 vote threshold had always been a bulwark protecting the \nrights of the minority, but would have become just a simple majority \nvote. Yet, just as we were about to cross this political Rubicon, the \nGang of 14 forged a pact based on mutual trust, that we would only \nsupport a filibuster of judicial nominees under what we labeled \n``extraordinary circumstances,'' and we would oppose the ``nuclear \noption,'' an agreement that embodied the very manifestation of the \npower of consensus building.\n  So as this body contemplates changes to its rules in the next \nCongress, I would urge all of my colleagues who will return next year \nto follow the Gang of 14 template and exercise a similar level of \ncaution and balance. Because what makes the Senate unique, what \nsituates this institution better than any other to secure the continued \ngreatness of our Nation, is that balance between accommodation of the \nminority and primacy of the majority. And regardless of who is in the \nminority, any suppression of the ability to debate and shape \nlegislation is tantamount to silencing millions of voices and ideas--\nwhich are critical to developing the best possible solutions.\n  I have mentioned all of these examples as illustrations of the \nboundless potential of the Senate--and that our problems are not \ninsurmountable, if we refuse to be intractable. It is not about what is \nin the best interests of a single political party, but what is in the \nbest interests of our country.\n  As far back as the fledgling days of our Nation, our Founding Fathers \nwarned of the dangers of undue allegiance to political parties--a \npotential that Alexander Hamilton and James Madison specifically cited \nin the Federalist Papers. Now, one study by three political scientists \npegs Congress at its highest level of polarization since the end of \nReconstruction in 1877. It is true that, in the intervening years, we \nhave had no duels to settle disagreements and no canings on the Senate \nfloor as occurred in the earlier years of the Senate--although there \nwas a physical brawl on the Senate floor in 1902. Yet, the fact we are \nstill more polarized now than at any moment in 140 years speaks \nvolumes.\n  So instead of focusing on issues as the Senate was uniquely \nestablished to do, we've become more like a parliamentary system where \nwe simply vote in political blocks. And we have departed and diverged \nfrom the Senate's traditional rules and norms in a manner that is \nentirely contradictory to the historical purpose of the Senate and the \nrole of the Founding Fathers intended for the Senate to play.\n  The very name of our institution, the Senate, derives from the Latin \nroot senatus, or council of elders, where the council of elders \nrepresented the qualities of experience and wisdom and not just some \nexperience and some wisdom in a deliberative body, but more experience \nand more wisdom in the highest deliberative body.\n  For thousands of years, and for the Greeks and our Framers alike, the \nSenate has stood as an assembly where the lessons of individual \nexperiences were translated by measured wisdom into stable collective \njudgments. Therefore, understanding through patience, appreciation \nthrough tolerance, and consensus through moderation are all required to \nreach such judgments and to do the work of the people. Indeed, I would \nargue it is only by recognizing and striving to meet the institutional \nideals of the Senate that we can aspire to fill our obligations to \nthose we represent.\n  We all take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same. I have \nalways believed this oath necessarily included a duty to support and \ndefend the Senate as an institution and the integrity of its \ndeliberative process. That requires the ability to listen before \njudging, to judge before advocating, and to advocate without \npolarizing. It also includes a capacity to differ with one's own party, \nand even to reach agreement and compromise with another party when \none's own party is unable to prevail. Such leadership necessarily \nrequires all Members to recognize their individual duty to serve the \npeople best by serving our Chamber with the highest standards of \nconsideration, deliberation, and explanation.\n  Former Supreme Court Justice Souter once said, and I am paraphrasing: \nAll of the Court's hard cases are divisive because one set of values is \ntruly at odds with another, and the Constitution gives no simple rule \nof decision. For, in truth, we value liberty as well as order, we value \nfreedom as well as security, and we value fairness as well as equality.\n  So in the tough cases judges have a hard job of choosing not between \nthose things that are good and those that are evil, but between the \nmany, and often competing, good things that the Constitution allows. \nJustice Souter could have been talking about the work of the Senate and \nthe often difficult choices we too are required to make. This \nobservation accepts the intrinsic competition that defines these \ndifficult choices but resolves to rely on reason, meaning, and the \nreputational integrity of the process to make and explain the ultimate \ndecisions.\n  Indeed, the Justice concluded his remarks by saying he knew of ``no \nother\n\n[[Page S8010]]\n\nway to make good on the aspirations that tell us who we are--and who we \nmean to be--as the people of the United States.''\n  We have witnessed the heights the Senate is capable of reaching when \nit adheres to its founding precepts. Just think about how we came \ntogether in the aftermath of the catastrophic events of September 11 to \nsecure our country and to help heal our Nation. Just think about the \nmajor debates of the 20th century on such watershed issues as the \nestablishment of Social Security, Medicare, and the Civil Rights Act. \nNone of these profound advancements would have been woven into the \nfabric of our society today if they had been passed simply on party-\nline votes rather than the solidly bipartisan basis on which each of \nthem was enacted.\n  I am not claiming there was some kind of golden age of bipartisanship \nwhere everyone all sang from the same legislative hymn book, and I am \nnot advocating bipartisanship as some kind of an end unto itself. That \nis not the point. What I am saying is we have seen how cooperation in \nthe past has resulted in great achievements, which likely never would \nhave occurred if bipartisanship had not intervened as a means to \nattaining those most worthy ends.\n  Our grandest accomplishments in the Congress were also a reflection \nof the particular compromises and level of urgency required by the \ntimes in which they were forged. Recently, New York Times columnist \nDavid Brooks summarized this concept well when he wrote that there are \npolicies that are not permanently right and that ``situations matter \nmost. Tax cuts might be right one decade but wrong the next. Tighter \nregulations might be right one decade, but if sclerosis sets in then \nderegulation might be in order.''\n  As we confront the impending confluence of issues known as the fiscal \ncliff, we are at a moment of major significance that requires the \napplication of the principle that Brooks describes. For the sake of the \ncountry, we must demonstrate to the American people that we are, in \nfact, capable of making the big decisions by putting in place an \nagreement and a framework to avoid the fiscal cliff before we adjourn \nthis year.\n  We are surrounded by history perpetually in the Senate as well as \nthroughout the Capitol. How could we not be inspired by it to rise to \nthis occasion? Indeed, if you know history, you understand the very \nstory of America's most formative days was defined by an understanding \nthat effective governance requires the building of consensus, and such \nconsensus is achievable even after the exercise of passionate advocacy, \nwhich, in conclusion, brings us back to the creation of a document we \nall cherish and revere; that is, our United States Constitution.\n  Madam President, 225 years ago, 55 leaders from divergent geographic \nand philosophical backgrounds converged on the city of Philadelphia to \ndraft a new structure of government to strengthen our fledgling \ncountry. These were no shrinking violets. They had risked their lives \nand fortunes to establish a new nation under God, indivisible, with \nliberty, and justice for all.\n  They were strong-willed and unabashedly opinionated. They disagreed \nand argued about a great many matters, both petty and consequential. \nThomas Jefferson even considered Virginia, and not the United States, \nas his country. Yet by September of that year, 39 of the original \ndelegates signed the most enduring and ingenious governing document the \nworld has ever known, the Constitution of the United States.\n  It didn't happen because 55 people who shared identical viewpoints \ngathered in a room and rubber-stamped their unanimous thinking. It \nhappened because these visionaries determined that the gravity and the \nenormity of their common goal necessitated the courage to advance \ndecisionmaking through consensus.\n  I worry that we are losing the art of legislating. When the history \nof this chapter in the Senate is written, we don't want it to conclude \nit was here that it became an antiquated practice. So as I depart the \nSenate that I love, I urge all of my colleagues to follow the Founding \nFathers' blueprint in order to return this institution to its highest \ncalling of governing through consensus. For it is only then that the \nUnited States can ascend to fulfill the demands of our time, the \npromise of our Nation, and the rightful expectations of the American \npeople.\n  Thank you, Madam President. May God bless you, and may God bless the \nUnited States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, for those of us in the Chamber, and \nthose of us listening, that was one of those beautifully crafted and \nbeautifully deliberated and eloquent statements not only about a \nMember's service as a Member of the U.S. Senate, but a vision of the \nworld we created and what we can be again. It is so appropriate for the \nparting words of the Senator, who is truly among the great that has \nserved here.\n  I have had the great pleasure of working with the Senator from Maine. \nAs she very graciously pointed out, we served together on the Small \nBusiness Committee. We were the first of two women to chair a major \ncommittee for an entire Congress.\n  There are Members here--Senator Mikulski and others--who served for \nmany years with Senator Snowe. For the minute that I have before others \nspeak, I just wanted to say that she has served for over 34 years in \npublic office. Her integrity is beyond reproach. She served with \nintelligence and grace that is widely admired, not just on Capitol Hill \nand in her home State of Maine, but broadly throughout the United \nStates and the world. Her capacity for hard work and tedious \nnegotiations on important matters is inspiring to us all. She has been \na clear and clarion voice for women and girls in Maine, the United \nStates, and around the world, for their legal rights, their economic \nadvancement, and their social advancement.\n  Above all, as we just heard, she has been a clarion call for common \nsense and common ground. She was literally involved in every major \neffort in the last 30 years to find common sense and common ground in a \nplace that is getting harder and harder to find those two qualities \nevery day. So it is with a deep sense of regret that I, for one, am \ngoing to have to say goodbye to her as a colleague and a Member of the \nSenate.\n  I want her to know that I will continue--and I know many of my \ncolleagues feel this way--to work as closely with her in any capacity \nof her choice to continue to be a great voice for compassion, \ncompromise, and common sense.\n  The people of Maine are losing a great Senator. The United States is \nlosing a unique talent that has served this country and this \ninstitution so magnificently. We wish her the best, and we say a \nrespectful goodbye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, yesterday I had the honor of \naddressing the full Senate to pay a more amplified tribute to the \ngentlelady from Maine. I will miss her dearly and deeply. We have \nserved both in the House and the Senate together. We have done real \ngood things, including one of our finest bipartisan efforts in the area \nof women's health in getting women included in the protocols \nappropriately, the scientific way at NIH when we were excluded. We \nhelped to advance the whole issue of more money for research for breast \ncancer and other diseases that are generally specific to women.\n  I will never forget the day when Good Housekeeping called and said \nthat Senator Snowe and I were going to get an award. I immediately \ncalled my family and told my sisters that I had won the Good \nHousekeeping Award. Well, they thought that was hilarious. I have many \nawards for speaking, longest serving, but not Good Housekeeping. When I \ntold them I was getting the award with Senator Snowe, they knew it had \nintegrity, credibility, and was well deserved.\n  So I just want to, from the bottom of my heart, not only thank the \npeople of Maine, who will express their gratitude for her service. She \nhas a duty-driven approach, an uncommon sense to get the job done in a \nway that is inclusive and has benefited our entire country whether they \nbe small business or the little people whose voices are never heard.\n\n[[Page S8011]]\n\n  So we wish her God bless, Godspeed, and we hope to see her speaking \nout exactly on what she did today, a call toward citizenship and more \nbipartisanship and less partisanship.\n  God bless you, Senator Snowe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8011-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AMERICAN STEEL\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak \nabout another sad situation in the State of Maryland. Today we got the \nterrible, sad news that it looks as though Bethlehem Steel, our \nbiggest, largest, most famous steelyard, is going to close, and it is \ngoing to close forever.\n  Throughout the entire 19th and 20th centuries and through to today, \nBethlehem Steel hired people, making it one of our largest employers, \nto build steel for our great iconic projects and to help build America. \nIn its heyday in 1957, 30,000 steelworkers were there. They thought \nthey had lifelong jobs in helping build steel. It was the largest \nsingle employer in Baltimore for decades. It made steel for everything \nfrom Campbell Soup cans to National beer cans. It built steel for \nrefrigerators, toasters, and thousands of other products. During the \nwar, Bethlehem Steel was part of the arsenal of democracy in which it \nbuilt Liberty ships.\n  I am very close to the people at Bethlehem Steel. Members of my own \nfamily worked in this steel mill and they worked very hard. People who \ncame into my father's grocery store worked at Bethlehem Steel. They \nthought they had a job that would last forever because America would \nneed steel. It doesn't look that way, because even though those workers \nthought America would always want American steel, we looked the other \nway when foreign imports began to drive down our prices and drive down \nour steel mills.\n  We have to begin to rethink what we are doing in this area. America's \nsteel and steelworkers protected the United States and our freedom.\n  At Sparrows Point they rolled gun barrels, made steel for grenades, \nshells and landing craft for airplanes and ships. We have to remember \nwhose steel it was that truly built America. But do my colleagues know \nwho the last owner was; not the most recent but the ones before that? \nThe Russians. I am not against Russia, but I am against Russia owning \nAmerica's tools of production.\n  What will happen to America if we need more steel to go to war? What \nabout needing steel when we build our infrastructure? When American \nsteelworkers built the great new Golden Gate Bridge with American \ntaxpayers' dollars, the steel came from China. What are we doing to \nAmerica and what are we doing to our manufacturing?\n  I think we need a wakeup call. We are busy holding up the entire \nCongress protecting tax breaks for billionaires. When are we going to \nstart looking out for American jobs? When we are talking about this \nfiscal cliff, we are not talking about having the jobs component in it. \nWhen are we going to start talking about tax breaks so we can have an \ninfrastructure bank, so we can rebuild America using American products? \nWhy is it when we say we want it made in America, some call us \nprotectionists? I welcome the label of ``protectionist.'' I am going to \nprotect American jobs. I don't want them on a slow boat to China or a \nfast track to Mexico.\n  I might not ever get my steel mill back and Baltimore might not ever \nhave those jobs back, but we have to get serious in our country. What \nare our priorities? We have to start rewarding those industries that \nmake products in this country. Right now, our whole code is oriented to \nprotecting people who make money off money. Let me tell my colleagues, \nwe are already getting a big wakeup call in America.\n  I have fought for more than 25 years to reverse this tide against \nAmerican manufacturing and for American steel and I am going to keep on \nfighting. But right now, as we go on debating this fiscal cliff, we \nhave to make sure we protect the safety net. If my colleagues went with \nme to Dundalk and to Sparrows Point, people would tell us they want \ntheir job, and if they can't have their job, could they please have a \nsafety net that protects them in terms of unemployment insurance and \nhealth care benefits so they have a bridge to get their family over \nthis very hard time. I worry that during this fiscal cliff debate we \nare going to lose those benefits, but I will tell my colleagues that I \nwill fight to not go over the fiscal cliff.\n  In the meantime, I say to the men and women at Bethlehem Steel: Thank \nyou for what you did. You built America. You helped save America. You \nhelped save Western civilization. We are going to try right now to save \nyour safety net benefits. Go to that hall where you can apply for those \nbenefits. They are still there. We still want to make sure you are \neligible, but we want not only a safety net to get you over the hard \ntimes, we believe the best safety net is jobs in American \nmanufacturing.\n  I am going to yield the floor, but I will not yield the fight for \nAmerican jobs.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today, the Senate will finally be allowed \nto vote on the nominations of Judge Frank Geraci to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District \nof New York and Lorna Schofield to fill a vacancy on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Southern District of New York. Both of these nominees \nwere voted out of the Judiciary Committee virtually unanimously before \nthe August recess and should have been confirmed months ago.\n  By now, no one should be surprised that it has taken so long to have \na simple up-or-down vote on two consensus nominees, even though one \nwould fill a judicial emergency vacancy and the other would fill a \nvacancy on one of our Nation's busiest courts.\n  There is an editorial in today's New York Times that explains the \nslow pace of confirmations, and I ask unanimous consent to have the \neditorial printed in the Record after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The editorial notes:\n\n       A significant reason for the slowdown has been the partisan \n     opposition of Republicans to appeals court and even to trial \n     court nominations, even though almost none of the nominees \n     have backgrounds that raise ideological issues. The \n     Republicans have time and again used the filibuster, the \n     threat of filibuster, holds on nominations and other tactics \n     to confirmations.\n\n  This is the new practice that Senate Republicans adopted when \nPresident\n\n[[Page S8012]]\n\nObama was elected. They delay and obstruct judicial nominations for no \ngood reason. There are currently 13 circuit and district court nominees \nstill pending on the Senate Executive Calendar who were reported before \nthe August recess and should all have been confirmed before the recess. \nMost are consensus nominees. All have the support of their home State \nSenators, including their home State Republican Senators.\n  The Federal Bar Association wrote a letter earlier this week to \nSenate leaders that said:\n\n       [W]e write to urge you to promptly schedule floor votes on \n     pending, noncontroversial United States circuit court \n     nominees and district court nominees who have cleared the \n     Judiciary Committee with strong bipartisan support and who \n     await a final up-or-down vote. The high number of existing \n     judicial vacancies--81, of which 35 constitute judicial \n     emergencies--underscores the need for prompt attention by the \n     Senate in fulfilling its Constitutional responsibilities.\n\n  They are absolutely right. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthat letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have a constitutional responsibility to advise and \nconsent, and we must also help our courts uphold their constitutional \nresponsibility to provide speedy justice.\n  The judges whose confirmations Senate Republicans are delaying are \nnot nominees they will oppose on the merits. They are by and large \nconsensus nominees.\n  Senate Republicans' obstruction on these important nominations is \nespecially damaging at the end of the year. Starting in 2009, Senate \nRepublicans broke from longstanding tradition and prevented votes on \neight judicial nominees as the Senate adjourned at the end of the year. \nIt took until September 2010 for the last of those nominees to have an \nup-or-down vote. Senate Republicans did the same thing--their new \nversion of a pocket filibuster--to 19 nominees in both 2010 and 2011. \nThis forces the Senate to waste time in the new year working on \nnominations that should have been confirmed the year before. This year \nit took until May to confirm the 19 left from last year. That is why we \nhave confirmed only 23 nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee \nthis year, and that is why we face this current backlog of 18 nominees \nand an additional 4 who had a hearing earlier this week and could also \nbe considered and confirmed before adjournment.\n  One of the nominations Senate Republicans are holding up is that of \nJudge Robert Bacharach to the Tenth Circuit, whom they filibustered \nearlier this year. Senator Coburn, one of his home State Senators, \nsaid: ``He has no opposition in the Senate . . .. There's no reason why \nhe shouldn't be confirmed.'' His words apply to almost all the judicial \nnominees being delayed.\n  When George W. Bush was President, Democrats cooperated in moving \njudicial nominees quickly through the committee and to a confirmation \nvote at the end of the year. I did so whether I was chairman or the \nranking member. I have said that I am willing to do the same for the \nnominees who had their hearing yesterday and expedite committee \nconsideration of their nominations so that they can be voted on this \nyear. By way of example, in 2008 we confirmed five of President Bush's \nnominees just 3 days after their hearing. We have often been able to do \nthis at the end of a Congress, and this year should be no exception--\nespecially given the high level of judicial vacancies plaguing our \nFederal courts.\n  Yesterday, the Judiciary Committee had a hearing for four more of \nPresident Obama's outstanding, consensus judicial nominees. Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle appeared to endorse nominees to vacancies \nin their home States. Representative Paul Ryan, the Republican \ncandidate for Vice President, appeared to testify in favor of a nominee \nto fill a vacancy on the District Court for the District of Columbia. \nSo did Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. After Congressman Ryan's \nendorsement, the committee's ranking Republican member quipped that \nafter hearing Congressman Ryan ``we could just vote you out right \naway.'' He is right. The Senate should confirm her and the others \nwithout delay. That is how we used to proceed as we approached the end \nof a Congress. We used to expedite confirmations of consensus nominees. \nNow Senate Republicans insist on stalling proceedings and slowing \nthings down and carrying large numbers of them over into the next year \nand needlessly delaying them for months and months.\n  I remind Senate Republicans that the Senate confirmed an Alabama \nnominee to the district court within 2 days of his vote by the \nJudiciary Committee just a couple of years ago. There have literally \nbeen hundreds of judicial confirmations within 14 days of our Judiciary \nCommittee hearing, including more than 600 confirmed since World War II \nwithin just 1 week of their hearings. In contrast, obstruction by \nSenate Republicans has caused President Obama's district court nominees \nto wait an average of 102 days for a Senate vote after being reported \nby the Judiciary Committee. This destructive practice of delaying for \nno good reason must end.\n\n  From 1980 until this year, when a lameduck session followed a \nPresidential election, every single judicial nominee reported with \nbipartisan Judiciary Committee support has been confirmed. According to \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, no consensus nominee \nreported prior to the August recess has ever been denied a vote--before \nnow. That is something Senate Democrats have not done in any lameduck \nsession, whether after a Presidential or midterm election.\n  Senate Democrats allowed votes on 20 of President George W. Bush's \njudicial nominees, inc1uding 3 circuit court nominees, in the lameduck \nsession after the elections in 2002. I remember, I was the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee who moved forward with those votes, including \nof a very controversial circuit court nominee. The Senate proceeded to \nconfirm judicial nominees in lameduck sessions after the elections in \n2004 and 2006. In 2006 that included confirming another circuit court \nnominee. We proceeded to confirm 19 judicial nominees in the lameduck \nsession after the elections in 2010, including 5 circuit court \nnominees. The reason that I am not listing confirmations for the \nlameduck session at the end of 2008 is because that year we had \nproceeded to confirm the last 10 judicial nominees approved by the \nJudiciary Committee in September and long before the lameduck session.\n  That is our history and recent precedent. Those across the aisle who \ncontend that judicial confirmations votes during lameduck sessions do \nnot take place are wrong. It is past time for votes on the 4 circuit \nnominees and the other 13 district court nominees still pending on the \nExecutive Calendar. We should expedite confirmations for the four \nconsensus nominees who had their hearing yesterday. Let's do our jobs \nso that all Americans can have access to justice.\n  Lorna Schofield is nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court for \nthe Southern District of New York. She has served as a Federal \nprosecutor and since 1988 has worked at the law firm Debevoise & \nPlimpton LLP, where she was a partner for two decades and where she \ncurrently serves as of counsel. She serves as chair of the litigation \nsection of the ABA, where she has actively promoted pro bono \nactivities, including programs for children's rights and litigation \nassistance for military personnel. The ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary unanimously gave her its highest possible rating of \n``well qualified.''\n  Judge Frank Geraci is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy \non the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. Since \n1999 Judge Geraci has served as a Monroe County Court judge, and since \n2005 he has also served as an acting supreme court justice on the New \nYork State trial court. Judge Geraci has presided over 555 civil \nproceedings that have gone to judgment. He has also served as both a \nState and Federal prosecutor.\n  Both of these nominations have the support of both their home State \nSenators. They were voted on by the Judiciary Committee 5 months ago \nand stalled unnecessarily since then for no good reason.\n  If we are willing to follow Senate precedent and to protect \nAmericans' access to justice, we should vote on the nominees being \ndelayed. Many are nominees whose nominations have been pending for many \nmonths, and many of\n\n[[Page S8013]]\n\nthem would fill judicial emergency vacancies. I see no reason why the \nSenate should not confirm them before the end of the year. We should \nallow these nominees to get to work on behalf of the American people.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n                    Judges Needed for Federal Courts\n\n       There has been a severe breakdown in the process for \n     appointing federal judges. At the start of the Reagan years, \n     it took, on average, a month for candidates for appellate and \n     trial courts to go from nomination to confirmation. In the \n     first Obama term, it has taken, on average, more than seven \n     months.\n       Seventy-seven judgeships, 9 percent of the federal bench \n     (not counting the Supreme Court), are vacant; 19 more seats \n     are expected to open up soon. The lack of judges is more \n     acute if one considers the growing caseload. The Judicial \n     Conference, the courts' policy-making body, has recommended \n     expanding the bench by 88 additional judgeships.\n       President Obama must make fully staffing the federal courts \n     an important part of his second-term agenda--starting with \n     the immediate Senate confirmation of the 18 nominees approved \n     by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       A significant reason for the slowdown has been the partisan \n     opposition of Republicans to appeals court and even to trial \n     court nominations, even though almost none of the nominees \n     have backgrounds that raise ideological issues. The \n     Republicans have time and again used the filibuster, the \n     threat of filibuster, holds on nominations and other tactics \n     to block confirmations.\n       The Democratic majority, led by Senator Harry Reid, can \n     speed up the process by limiting use of the filibuster. He \n     can do so by pushing for a simple majority vote at the start \n     of the January session to alter Senate rules so that every \n     judicial and executive-branch nominee is assured an up-or-\n     down vote within 90 days. Without that change, many judicial \n     nominations will founder.\n       Even if that rule change is made, the process of \n     identifying, vetting and approving judicial candidates will \n     need greater attention. Senators, who by custom recommend to \n     the president candidates for federal trial judgeships in \n     their states, should put in place more effective steps for \n     making timely recommendations (like setting up merit \n     selection committees) and making a choice within a reasonable \n     period, like within 60 days of an opening.\n       The White House and the Justice Department, meanwhile, need \n     to commit more resources to keeping up with those \n     recommendations, to verify and nominate candidates for \n     confirmation within, say, 60 days of receiving names. And the \n     administration must be similarly prompt in identifying and \n     nominating appeals-court candidates.\n       In a critically important court like the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, three \n     unfilled vacancies and a fourth expected this winter, out of \n     11 judgeships, hobble the court's ability to make expeditious \n     rulings in significant cases about regulation of the \n     environment, financial markets and other social and economic \n     matters. Many statutes channel review of such cases to the \n     federal courts in the District of Columbia for their \n     expertise about administrative law and for geographic \n     convenience.\n       The circuit court is a stark example of the broken \n     appointment process and the harm caused by the Senate's \n     inability to do its job.\n       Mr. Obama and the Senate should also look to broaden the \n     diversity of the judges they appoint. In his first term, Mr. \n     Obama commendably named a higher share of women (44 percent) \n     and a higher share of minorities (37 percent) than any \n     president before him.\n       Most of the appointees were already judges, prosecutors or \n     private lawyers, with few public defenders or public-interest \n     lawyers from outside government. Expanding the breadth of \n     experience would help ensure that federal courts have jurists \n     who have some real-life understanding of the myriad issues \n     that come before them.\n       The Constitution requires the president, with the Senate's \n     advice and consent, to fill federal judgeships. That duty has \n     been terribly neglected and needs to be an absolute priority \n     in the coming year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                           Federal Bar Association\n                                 Arlington, VA, December 11, 2012.\n     Hon.

The \n     high number of existing judicial vacancies--81, of which 35 \n     constitute judicial emergencies--underscores the need for \n     prompt attention by the Senate in fulfilling its \n     Constitutional responsibilities.\n       We also strongly encourage cooperation among Senators to \n     avoid undue procedural delays that slow the judicial \n     confirmation process and compound the vacancy crisis.\n       Thank you for your past efforts and for your consideration \n     of our views on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Karen Silberman,\n       Executive Director.\n     West Allen,\n       Chair, Government Relations Committee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in support of each of these \njudges, both fine citizens of New York. First, I will speak about Judge \nGeraci.\n  I rise in strong support of an outstanding nominee for the Federal \nbench in the Western District of New York, Judge Frank Paul Geraci, \nJr., to the Federal district court in the Western District of our \nState, which serves two large metropolitan areas, Rochester and \nBuffalo. These cities are large, vibrant centers of the commercial and \nlegal communities of our State. In fact, each metropolitan area has a \npopulation of over 1 million residents.\n  Judge Geraci has been an important and respected part of this \ncommunity for his entire life. Born in Rochester, he graduated from \nMcQuaid Jesuit High School. He left New York long enough to earn both \nhis undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Dayton in \nOhio, staying within the Jesuit fold, I might add, by attending that \ninstitution. He returned to Rochester and immediately leapt into public \nservice, working for 5 years in the Monroe County District Attorney's \nOffice and rising to become chief of the Special Investigations Bureau. \nJudge Geraci then contributed another 4 years of distinguished service \nto Rochester as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Western District. In \n1988, he left and founded his own law firm.\n  I was particularly impressed, as I got to know Judge Geraci, by the \nfact that while he was in private practice, he also served as a \nmediator and expert in alternative dispute resolution. I have come to \nbelieve, as a Senator from a State with among the heaviest caseloads in \nthe country, that an important part of managing a docket is getting \nparties to talk to each other before they are staring at an imminent \ntrial date.\n  It is likely that few nominees know this truth better than Judge \nGeraci. Over and above his dispute resolution experience, he has been a \njudge in the city of Rochester, in Monroe County, and on the bench of \nthe New York State Supreme Court for 20 years.\n  I have served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for my entire time in \nthe Senate--since 1998--and I served on the House Judiciary Committee \nfor 18 years before that.\n  Rarely, if ever, have I encountered a candidate who so perfectly \ncombines judicial experience, judicious temperament, and complete \ndedication to his community as Judge Geraci.\n  Taken together, the breadth and depth of his professional experience \nin both the State and Federal system, civil and criminal, make him a \nperfect fit for the Federal bench in Rochester. But Judge Geraci's \nsterling qualifications do not stop there. His dedication to his \ncommunity, it is no exaggeration to say, is legendary. When you mention \nhis name, people say: Of course, what a great and obvious choice.\n  Monroe County is small enough that members of the bar all know him \nbut large enough that many lawyers, like Judge Geraci, do have the \nopportunity to have varied and deep experience. Judge Geraci has worked \nfor the bar and bench on issues such as criminal case management and \njury diversification. He has served on boards and governing bodies of \ndiocese Catholic schools. He even has conducted court tours, coached \ngirls' basketball, and served as the president of the local Little \nLeague.\n  Judge Geraci has earned the admiration of the people of western New \nYork and, in turn, they deserve no less than an accomplished lawyer of \nhis intelligence and magnanimity to serve on the Federal bench. I thank \nthe Presiding Officer for the opportunity to discuss such a fine man.\n  I will conclude with one final observation. The seat for which Judge \nGeraci is about to be confirmed has been vacant since March of 2009, \nmaking it a judicial emergency vacancy. His is one of 13 remaining \njudicial\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\nnominations on the calendars, 11 of whom have received bipartisan \nsupport in the Judiciary Committee. I hope we can continue to move \nthese other nominees.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  (Mr. Franken assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, I have a second nominee to speak \nabout. We are voting at 2:15, as I understand it, so there is plenty of \ntime to wax on the fine qualifications of both of these new additions \nto the bench.\n  I am extremely pleased to rise today in enthusiastic support of the \nnomination of Lorna Schofield to the Federal bench in the Southern \nDistrict of New York at the other end of our State.\n  I have had the privilege to recommend a number of truly outstanding \nnominees to become judges in New York--in fact, 15 nominees--and Ms. \nSchofield is among the best. She is the embodiment of three qualities I \nsearch for in judicial nominee candidates: excellence--they should be \nlegally excellent, no hacks; moderation--they should not be too far \nright or too far left because then they want to turn the law to their \nown purpose rather than interpret it; and diversity--I try to bring \ndiversity in every way to the bench in terms of race, gender, sexual \norientation, and religion because that is for the good of America.\n  First, her excellence. Her professional resume puts her right at top \nof her field. She went to Indiana University for her undergraduate \nstudies and then came to New York to study law at one of the Nation's \nbest law schools, NYU Law School, where she graduated as one of the top \n15 students in her class. She went on to serve the public as an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York and then \nto join a top law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton. She has been there for 25 \nyears.\n  Ms. Schofield has a wealth of practical experience, having \nrepresented and advised all manner of clients in the ``real world'' of \nNew York City--businesses large and small and individuals. As a true \ngeneralist, she has tried a wide variety of cases, and her professional \naccomplishments and accolades are numerous, including serving as the \nhead of the litigation section--the largest section--of the American \nBar Association. She was, in fact, a pioneer in this position as the \nfirst Asian American to hold this prestigious post.\n  Second, on the point of moderation, when I met Ms. Schofield, I was \nstruck by the fact that she has one singular agenda: preservation of \nthe rule of law. Indeed, her professional work has been devoted to the \ngeneral improvement of the practice of law and to zealously \nrepresenting her clients in the best and most ethical traditions of the \nprofession. Evidence of her moderation can be found in the support she \nhas across the political spectrum. Both Democrats and Republicans have \ncalled me to tell me what a great judge she would make. She has done \neverything from teaching trial advocacy to performing pro bono work for \nthe Women's Prison Association.\n  Finally, diversity. I like to have diversity on the bench. Ms. \nSchofield's personal background and life experience will help broaden \nthe perspective of the Federal bench. Most notably, if confirmed, she \nwill become the first Filipino judge, man or woman, to sit on the \nFederal bench. So the great nation of the Philippines, which \ncontributes so many immigrants and then citizens to our country, can be \nvery proud that Ms. Schofield has risen to this high post once she is \nconfirmed.\n  In conclusion, I believe she will make a terrific judge, and I look \nforward to her confirmation today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, can you tell me how much time is remaining \non this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                            THE FISCAL CLIFF\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it has become disturbingly clear that \nPresident Obama does not mind whether or not we drive off the fiscal \ncliff. Just last week his own Treasury Secretary, Secretary Geithner, \nsaid the White House was ``absolutely'' prepared to go off the cliff \nunless Republicans agree to raise marginal tax rates. In other words, \nduring a period of high unemployment--the highest since the Great \nDepression--the President is willing to risk another recession in order \nto increase taxes on small businesses and the people we depend upon to \ncreate jobs.\n  How much revenue will the President's tax hike generate? Well, by \nraising the top two rates, it would produce only about $68 billion in \n2013. I say ``only'' because in relationship to the gap between how \nmuch money the Federal Government is spending and how much money this \nwould generate, it is relatively small. If we factor in the various \nstimulus tax expenditures the President wants to extend, the net \nrevenue falls below $55 billion.\n  Again, President Obama is so desperate to secure this revenue that he \nis willing to risk another recession. Meanwhile, he is asking for more \nstimulus spending, along with the authority to raise the debt ceiling \nwhenever he chooses. His idea of compromise appears to me to be pretty \nsimple: Republicans should give him everything he wants in return for a \nmeaningless promise that the White House will somehow, someday get \naround to reforming and preserving Social Security and Medicare. I ask, \nis that really a balanced approach? Well, I think the answer is self-\nevident. Of course it is not.\n  Until the President supports real reforms to preserve and protect \nMedicare and Social Security--something he himself has acknowledged is \non an unsustainable fiscal path--until he is willing to come up with \nreal ways to rein in Federal spending, where right now we are spending \n46 cents out of every $1 in borrowed money, the Federal Government is, \nuntil he comes up with a plan on both of those issues--reining in \nspending and reforming Medicare and Social Security to preserve them \nfor future generations--he is not offering a serious plan for long-term \ndeficit reduction.\n  After all, we have a $1.1 trillion annual deficit. I know we have \nbecome a little bit numb to the numbers we have been using. We used to \ntalk about $1 million being a lot of money. Then there was $1 billion. \nNow there is $1 trillion. Someone said, tongue in cheek: Don't tell the \nFederal Government what comes after a trillion because we will end up \nspending it.\n  If you have a deficit of $1.1 trillion a year, as we did in 2012, \nthen raising taxes by $68 billion or $55 billion does not get you very \nfar. In fact, it would fund the Federal Government for about a week--1 \nweek. That tax increase would also damage economic growth, upon which \nwe depend in order to create jobs, to bring down the unemployment rate, \nand to put the 20 million-plus people who are either unemployed or \nunderemployed back to work.\n  Here are some numbers the President does not talk about:\n  On top of our $16 trillion national debt, we have more than $100 \ntrillion in unfunded liabilities. Those are promises we have made to \nfuture generations that Medicare and Social Security will be there for \nthem, even though there is not money to pay for those liabilities.\n  The Federal Government is already spending about $220 billion a year \non interest payments alone. Under President Obama's latest budget \nproposal, the annual cost of servicing our debt would reach $804 \nbillion in 2022--an amount greater than total U.S. defense spending in \n2012. We all know that interest rates are also at historic lows because \nof the action of the Federal Reserve. If they were to return to their \nhistoric norms--the 4- and 5-percent range--you can easily see how our \ndebt would spin out of control and there would be very little room to \nspend money either on safety-net programs or on national security.\n  One more point. The President often says his tax increases would \nmerely restore the top tax rates that prevailed when Bill Clinton was \nin the White House. But that is demonstrably false. Thanks to new taxes \nunder ObamaCare, including the new 3.8-percent surtax on investment \nincome, the top rates would be significantly higher than they were \nunder the Clinton administration. And, of course, you are not just \ntalking about Federal taxes. People all around the country have to pay \nState, local, and Federal taxes, many of whom would end up paying the \nmajority of their paycheck in taxes.\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\n  Here is the reality: Tax cuts did not create our fiscal problems, so \nit is axiomatic that tax increases will not solve our fiscal problems \nalone. We can and we should reform our Tax Code so that it helps \npromote stronger growth and higher revenues. The President's own \nbipartisan fiscal commission, Simpson-Bowles, made a proposal to do \njust that when it comes to corporate taxes. But ultimately the only way \nto prevent fiscal Armageddon is through major reforms of Medicare and \nSocial Security and reining in Federal spending.\n  As we debate various strategies for avoiding the fiscal cliff, it is \nimportant for us to remember that our actions--or inactions--will have \nreal-world consequences for millions of Americans. Many folks here in \nWashington seem too casual about the possibility of a massive tax hike \nand what that would do to our economy. Indeed, some of my Democratic \ncolleagues apparently think they could quickly undo all of the tax \nincreases that would fall on middle-class workers. In reality, it would \nnot be that simple. Just ask any small business owner trying to meet \npayroll and plan for the future.\n  Everyone knows, as I said to start with, we are experiencing the \nweakest economic recovery since World War II and the longest period of \nhigh unemployment since the Great Depression. If you ask me, this is \nthe worst possible moment for a huge tax hike--something the President \nhimself acknowledged when he agreed to extend the so-called Bush tax \ncuts in 2010 when the economy was growing slower than it is today.\n  Too many of my colleagues across the aisle seem to be comfortable \nwith threatening the possibility of a recession by driving off the \nfiscal cliff only to extract more revenue for the Federal Government--\nby the way, not revenue necessarily used to pay down the debt or to \nsustain and preserve our programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, but to \nexpand spending even further. I hope cooler heads will prevail.\n  One final thought. When I talk to people all across the country, who \ntell me they are watching us here in Washington to see what we are \ngoing to do, it is the uncertainty that is freezing them into place and \npreventing them from starting new businesses, growing existing \nbusinesses, or making investments that will help grow the economy.\n  The saddest part about this is how manufactured this crisis really \nis. All of these decisions were kicked off until after the election \ninto this so-called lameduck session, and this crisis, this fiscal \ncliff crisis, was manufactured, as I say. We should have tackled these \nchallenges a long time ago to give American families and American \nbusinesses the certainty they need in order to plan for the future. \nInstead, we have created a highly volatile situation in which everyone \nis preparing for the worst. It is hurting investment. It is hurting job \ncreation. Above all, it is hurting millions of Americans who are still \nunemployed or working part time. And it is completely and totally \nunnecessary.\n  Whatever the outcome of these negotiations, I hope we will all \nresolve to never let this happen again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes, 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond very briefly to my \ncolleagues from Texas. The fiscal crisis was not manufactured, it was \nenacted--enacted into law, a law passed with the support of both \npolitical parties in the hopes that we would never, ever reach this \nday. We can still avoid it, and we should. I hope cooler heads will \nprevail and we will reach some bipartisan agreement because I think all \nof us agree it would be a negative impact on our economy if we, in \nfact, go over the cliff. I sincerely hope there will be a good-faith \neffort on both sides. But this fiscal cliff was created by law passed \nby Democratic and Republican leaders and sent to the President.\n  So this is clearly something we envisioned as the last straw. Let's \nhope it is one that we will avoid.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am a little confused. I do not know whether the \ndistinguished majority whip is talking about the expiring tax \nprovisions on December 31 as being manufactured or a bipartisan \nagreement or--what part of this did we have a chance to vote on and \ncreate in a bipartisan fashion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It was a bipartisan vote on the Budget Control Act, which \nspelled out how we would reach this terrible moment if the \nsupercommittee failed. I sincerely hope we never reach this moment, \nthat there is a good-faith effort by both parties to avoid it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. If the Senator would yield for one last question, my \nunderstanding is that the fiscal cliff is going to be caused by the \nexpiring provisions of various tax provisions that have been in place \nfor 12 years, the so-called Bush tax cuts that expired 2 years ago that \nwere extended on a bipartisan basis in a negotiation with our friends \nacross the aisle. That is what I am referring to as the fiscal cliff.\n  I do understand, and the Senator is correct, we also have the second \nbody blow to the economy that is going to be in combination with these \ntax increases, $1.2 trillion in cuts that, as I understand it, is the \nsequester, which is what the Senator is referring to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would call the Senator's attention to our vote on \nAugust 2 when he and I both voted for the Budget Control Act. The vote \nwas 74 to 26, with a substantial number of Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle, that brought us to this moment in the negotiations. We all \nhoped we would never reach this moment. We can still avoid it.\n  I yield the floor and yield back all remaining time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. We yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Lorna G. Schofield, of New York, to be \nU.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I will not object to the request made by \nthe Senior Senator from Washington, and I do not object to the policy \nprovisions in this bill. However, I must point out that this bill \nindiscriminately diverts Overseas Contingency Operations funds, which \nare necessary to ensure resources, equipment, and supplies are \navailable to our servicemembers deployed across the globe. This is not \nhow the provisions of this bill should be paid for. Taking away funds \nintended for our men and women who are currently serving could, in \ntime, place some of the veterans that this bill intends to help at \ngreater risk. This legislation could also divert funding intended for \nthe security of our Ambassadors, Foreign Service Officers, and other \nState Department officials, placing them at additional risk.\n  Quality healthcare for those who have honorably served our country is \nsomething that I think all Senators, including me, support. If the \nprovisions of this legislation are a priority for this body, we should \nbe deliberate in determining how we should pay for them. The Senior \nSenator from Washington has put forward a thoughtful bill that merits \nconsideration, but I think this body would prefer to consider other \nmeans to pay for new programs that do not divert funds intended to keep \nour troops well-equipped and safe.\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not intend to object to the request \nof the Senator from Washington, and I do not object to the policy \nprovision of this bill at this time. But I strongly object to the \nSenator seeking to fund these new veterans benefits out of the \nDepartment of Defense budget that funds the needs of our military men \nand women serving in combat overseas.\n  The cost of Senator Murray's bill, provided by the Congressional \nBudget Office, is $568 million over 5 years. To cover that cost, \nSenator Murray proposes to strip $568 million from wartime funding for \ntroops in Afghanistan over the next 5 years without even considering \nthe impact of that cut on their safety and security. This is \npreposterous. This bill assumes that Congress will still be passing \nemergency spending bills for Afghanistan 5 years from now, and somehow \nour troops will be able to bear the risk of having hundreds of millions \nsiphoned from their critical needs for a program that has nothing to do \nwith the war they are currently engaged in. Every dollar requested in \nthe defense budget for our combat forces will be needed to keep them \nadequately equipped, armed, and engaged in defeating the enemy and \ncoming home with honor.\n  The proposed offset for this new program is an irresponsible budget \ngimmick designed to shift the funding burden for these new benefits \nfrom VA to DOD. Funding for the DOD Overseas Contingency Operations \nfund is within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, and \nshould be considered by the full Senate, rather than slipped into a \nreported bill at the last minute without debate or discussion.\n  I also am surprised that Senator Murray, a vocal supporter of \nimproving the welfare of our troops, would actually propose cuts to \nfunding for our combat troops without even assessing the impact of \nthose cuts. The job of making that assessment lies within the Armed \nServices Committee's jurisdiction, and I will seek to ensure that the \nSenate has an opportunity to make that assessment before passing any \nlegislation that attempts to shift defense dollars from the direct \ncombat needs of our Armed Forces to any new benefits or policies.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported amendment be considered; the Murray amendment, which \nis at the desk, be agreed to; the committee-reported amendment, as \namended, be agreed to; and that the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3336) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                     Purpose: To provide an offset.\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 8. FUNDING.\n\n       Amounts for a fiscal year to carry out this Act, section \n     7330B of title 38, United States Code, as added by section \n     2(a), section 1787 of such title, as added by section 4(a), \n     and the amendments made by this Act shall be derived from \n     amounts made available for an overseas contingency operation \n     in that fiscal year, if amounts were made available for an \n     overseas contingency operation in that fiscal year.\n\n  The committee-reported amendment in the nature of a substitute, as \namended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 3313), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (S. 3313), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3313\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee-reported title amendment be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand that any related statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The title amendment was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to amend title 38, \n     United States Code, to improve the reproductive assistance \n     provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to severely \n     wounded, ill, or injured veterans and their spouses, and for \n     other purposes.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate has just passed legislation \nthat will bring into focus a real need for the VA to help women \nveterans and the spouses of male veterans access assistance for one of \nthe most impactful and serious wounds of these wars--reproductive and \nurinary tract trauma.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the nature of the current conflict we \nare involved in and the use of improvised explosive devices leave our \nservicemembers far more susceptible to very serious injuries, such as \nreproductive and urinary tract trauma. Army data shows that between \n2003 and 2011, we had 2,000 servicemembers suffering from these kinds \nof injuries. Like so many of our veterans, these men and women come \nhome and want to return to their lives, to find employment and to start \na family. But today, when they go to the VA, the fertility services \nthat are available don't meet the very complex needs of these serious \ninjuries. In fact, veterans who have suffered from these injuries find \nthat the VA is specifically barred from providing more advanced \nassisted reproductive techniques, such as in vitro fertilization. They \nare, in fact, told--despite the fact that they have made such an \nextreme sacrifice for our country--that they can't be provided with the \nmedical services they need to start a family.\n  One of those veterans I have come to know is SSG Matt Keil and his \nwife Tracy, who are here with us today. Staff Sergeant Keil, whom I \ntalked about this morning, was shot in the neck while he was on patrol \nin Ramadi, Iraq, on February 24, 2007, just 6 weeks after he married \nTracy. Staff Sergeant Keil instantly became a quadriplegic. Later, when \nhe came home and they wanted to start a family, Tracy and Matt were \nfaced with the fact that they could not access IVF services through the \nVA, which meant they had to pay $32,000 out of their own pocket.\n  Mr. President, the bill we passed today means those families who are \ncoming behind Tracy and Matt won't have to go through the same fight to \ntake care of something that is so vital to so many American families; \nthat is, having a family of their own. This is an important step we \nhave taken today in passing this out of the Senate. I am hopeful that \nthe House will take it up and pass it. And I assure Tracy and Matt that \none day, when this bill is signed into law, they will have made a true \ndifference for those families who come behind them, and for that I am \neternally grateful.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to commend Senator Murray before she \nleaves the floor for her tireless dedication to America's Armed Forces, \nfor her commitment to our veterans and her passion for addressing their \nvery real and very human needs, and for bringing examples from her home \ncommunity as well as from our country at large of just how much we owe \nour veterans and in just how many different ways they face challenges \nas they try to move forward with their lives after their service for \nus. I wanted to thank her and recognize the Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8018-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8018-S8019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                376TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, one of the best things about a good day in \nthe Senate is when we get a chance to visit with friends from home. \nEarlier today, I had a chance to visit with the Hopkins family. They \nrun a small business in Delaware. And I have had the great joy of \nspending time with our U.S. Congressman, John Carney, our incoming \nspeaker of the house, Pete Schwarzkopf, and friend Quin Johnson today. \nAll of this has brought to mind something I wanted to speak to for a \nmoment, if I might.\n  I rise today to mark the 376th anniversary of a great American \ninstitution that is critical to our safety here and abroad--the \nNational Guard.\n  The National Guard goes back to the citizen soldier tradition of our \ncolonial-era militia of citizens who took up arms or who came together \nfor collective action in times of natural disaster or of threat. The \nNational Guard today, 376 years later, still has that dual mission--to \nserve our communities by responding to domestic emergencies and to \ndeploy, when needed, to serve and protect our Nation overseas. While \nthey do all this, they also often hold down full-time civilian jobs. In \ntheir daily lives, National Guard troops are teachers and police \nofficers, firefighters and office workers. When called upon by their \nGovernor or Commander in Chief, they change their uniforms and report \nfor duty as civilian soldiers.\n  In my home State, our Delaware National Guard is on the front lines \nevery day, whether keeping our streets safe after a storm, deploying to \nIraq or Afghanistan, or traveling to other parts of the country to help \nour citizens recover and cities rebuild in the wake of a natural \ndisaster. Organized and managed so capably by Major General Frank \nVavala, the Delaware National Guard has the capability to keep us safe. \nThey transport people and supplies on land and through the air. They \ndefend our Nation in cyber space. They support law enforcement's fight \nagainst illegal drugs. They are on the scene of any suspicious chemical \nor biological event, and they enable friendly forces to communicate \nwith each other in war zones.\n  When duty calls, the Delaware National Guard is there. The 153rd \nMilitary Police Company, for example, was deployed to Iraq, where they \nlogged hundreds of combat patrols on some of the most dangerous streets \nin the world and trained Iraqi police officers in all aspects of their \nprofession. In January, this unit will deploy again, this time to \nAfghanistan.\n  The 126th Medical Aviation Battalion was deployed to Afghanistan, \nwhere they flew 400 priority medevac missions for over 500 critically \ninjured patients, about half to unsecured landing zones outside of \nsecure walls or fortified structures.\n  These are just two examples of the many ways the Delaware Guard \nprotects our Nation overseas. But they are also vital to our security \nhere at home. When there is a blizzard, the National Guard uses their \nhumvees and heavy trucks to transport Delawareans with medical \nemergencies. When Superstorm Sandy struck last month, 120 soldiers \ntraveled with heavy equipment to assist with recovery efforts in New \nYork and New Jersey. When Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in \n2005, two C-130 aircraft left from New Castle airports the next day \ncarrying the first of what would be 400 troops from Delaware who \nassisted with gulf coast recovery efforts.\n  The National Guard is resourceful, ready to serve, and they go \neverywhere they are called. These are truly citizen-soldiers.\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\n  When I was the county executive of New Castle County, Delaware, we \nhad as many as seven different county employees at different times \ndeployed overseas, many of them police officers called up for their \nNational Guard service--folks who are the epitome of serving at home \nand serving abroad. So it is with a very personal sense of the needs \nand the challenges when I thank those employers who recognize that even \nwhen they are not at their desks, even when they are not contributing \nto their employer, our National Guard members are making a vital \ncontribution to our community and to our country.\n  Tomorrow morning I am going to the Pentagon, where I will talk with \nleaders there about critical needs in an age of ongoing budget \nausterity. One of the priorities I am fighting for is a responsible \ninvestment in our National Guard. These heroes deserve more than our \ngratitude, they deserve our rock-solid commitment to ensuring they have \nthe resources they need to do their jobs.\n  The National Guard plays a unique dual role in our security--as first \nresponders and as a reserve force for foreign conflicts. We have to \nmake sure they have the equipment and support for both their military \nmissions and their domestic missions.\n  I am proud this year the President signed into law legislation that \nwould give the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a seat at the table, \na seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I was glad to work to help build \nbipartisan support for this bill because I believe the Joint Chiefs \nneed someone at the table who has seen the full capabilities and range \nof operations and the unique challenges and resources of the National \nGuard firsthand.\n  So 376 years after its founding, the National Guard continues to grow \nand evolve to meet the security challenges of the United States in the \n21st century. I believe the Guard of the future must continue to \nfulfill both sides of their vital dual mission. Additionally, it must \nbe a place where highly skilled soldiers and airmen can continue to \nserve their country while also working in and serving civilian \ncommunities. The Guard can and should be a bridge between the military \nand civilian response to threats facing the United States, not the \nleast of which are cyber attacks and terrorism.\n  On this anniversary, the National Guard remains essential to the \nsafety and security of Americans at home and abroad, and today I would \nlike to thank the soldiers and airmen of the Delaware National Guard as \nwell as the entire National Guard family at home and abroad for their \nservice and dedication to our country. Thank you, and happy birthday.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8019-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8019-S8020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FISCAL CLIFF\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I rise because middle-class \nfamilies are counting on the House of Representatives to do the right \nthing between now and the end of the year, which is just 19 days away. \nThe House needs to pass the middle-class tax cuts we sent them back in \nJuly.\n  Families need help. When we talk about the fiscal cliff, the most \nimportant one is what families are struggling with every day, and we \nhave just 19 days until the taxes on middle-class families will go up \nby an average of $2,200 if the House of Representatives doesn't act. We \nneed to make sure that 98 percent of the American public is protected \nfrom tax increases. As we know, we passed the Middle Class Tax Cut Act \non July 25. So far, the House has not acted. Nineteen days. They have \n19 days until the end of this year in order to act. Time is running \nout.\n  Now, we know there is a larger discussion going on that is incredibly \nimportant--how we put together a deficit reduction plan for our \ncountry, a long-term plan for fiscal solvency and for our economy. By \nthe way, we will never get out of debt with close to 12 million people \nout of work, so we better be focused on jobs and the economy, as I am \neach and every day.\n  We know we need a larger plan, but when we look at the three legs of \nthe deficit reduction stool that everybody talks about, there has been \naction on two of them. There needs to be action on the third as we go \nforward to put together the final plan. The first step was an agreement \nwe made last year to cut spending by about $1 trillion. So that was the \nfirst piece, the spending cut reduction. Secondly, we needed to find \nsavings in Medicare, which has lengthened the Medicare trust fund by 8 \nyears. We know there is more that can be done as we look at savings \ngoing forward. We passed over $700 billion in savings by protecting and \nstrengthening benefits for seniors by cutting overpayments to insurance \ncompanies and making other reforms to strengthen the system and create \nmore efficiencies.\n  We have seen step 1 on spending reductions of $1 trillion. We have \nseen step 1 on ``entitlements,'' as we speak of it, which is Medicare \nsavings coming the right way, not by cutting benefits or raising the \nMedicare age, which I strongly oppose but, instead, by creating savings \nby cutting overpayments to insurance companies and other efficiencies. \nBut what happens on the third leg of the stool, which is the \nrequirement that the wealthiest among us come to the table and be part \nof the solution on revenue? That is the third leg of the stool. We \ncontinue to see no willingness to take action there.\n  We find ourselves in a situation where in 19 days the average \nAmerican will see their taxes go up by, on average, $2,200 because the \nHouse of Representatives has been holding middle-class families hostage \nto their own politics. What are we talking about when we talk about \n$2,200? I asked folks around Michigan: What does that mean to you? One \nconstituent said that is 4 months' groceries. Four months of feeding \nher family is what we are talking about if the House of Representatives \ndoes not act.\n  Mr. President, $2,200 would buy 650 gallons of gas. For the average \ncommuter going back and forth to work every day, that gets them back \nand forth to work for 3 years on the tax increase that middle-class \nfamilies are facing if the House does not act.\n  Mr. President, $2,200 will buy families in Michigan 550 gallons of \nmilk for their families. We are talking about a lot of money that is at \nstake for families.\n  In many cases that number is higher than $2,200, and House \nRepublicans are holding families across this country hostage at \nChristmastime over a fight about whether millionaires and billionaires \nin this country should pay a little bit more to solve our long-term \ndeficit problem.\n  It is unbelievable to me that we continue to see this kind of \ninaction coming from the House of Representatives. We all know this can \nbe done in just a few moments. We can send a very strong message to 98 \npercent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, that they \ncan go into the Christmas season knowing they are going to continue to \nget tax cuts in the new year.\n  I can assure you, in times when families are struggling now, when \nthey want to provide a good Christmas for their families, we are seeing \nthings like layaway--layaway is back because families are having to use \na longer time to pay for toys and clothes and other things for their \nchildren for Christmas. Mr. President, $2,200 is a lot of money. There \nis a lot of uncertainty right now because the House of Representatives \nhas not acted. It is time to get this done.\n  Everybody says they support the bill we passed. We have a growing \nchorus of colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle in the Senate \nand in the House--we have business leaders and people across the \ncountry--who all agree we are never going to be able to address our \ndeficit reduction problems without those who are wealthiest among us \nhelping to solve the problem. That is all this is about.\n  The House needs to get this done. Then we know there is a larger \npiece. All three legs of the deficit reduction chair need to be \naddressed, but now the only one where nothing has been done is asking \npeople who are most blessed economically to chip in a little bit more.\n\n\n                           Right-To-Work Laws\n\n  If I might add one more thing that relates to something else \nhappening in Michigan that goes to the heart of the issue about whether \nwe are going to have a middle class in this country, and that is what \nthe Governor and the\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\nRepublican State legislature have done in passing the most divisive \npiece of legislation I can remember in my lifetime in Michigan. It is \ncalled right to work. It is really a right to have a race to the \nbottom. It is not about economics, it is about politics, plain and \nsimple.\n  Instead of coming together and doing the right thing, we see the \nState legislature pursuing a political attack. Over and over, families \nin my State and across America, middle-class families, are being asked \nto sacrifice, to bear the burden for whatever is happening. They are \nfed up, and they have every right to be.\n  There are huge crowds at the Michigan State Capitol Building in \nLansing showing how frustrated, how angry people are that one more \ntime, in an age where we have Citizens United and the Supreme Court \nsaying corporations can give not only unlimited dollars to campaigns \nbut secret money; in an age when the House of Representatives in \nWashington is willing to protect millionaires from chipping in to solve \nour deficit problem at all costs, even holding middle-class families \nhostage--over and over again, working people are saying: What is going \non here? We will not have an economy if we do not have a middle class, \nif people do not have money in their pockets to be able to buy things, \nto be able to drive the economy, to be able to take care of their \nfamilies.\n  In Michigan it is one more blow to the whole process of whether we \nare going to have voices of working people at the table in the \nworkplace able to effectively negotiate good wages, good benefits, safe \nworking conditions, and know that everybody in the workplace who \nbenefits from that is going to chip in to be able to make sure that \ncontinues.\n  We know all across the country we can either have a race to the \nbottom or a race to the top. When we see wages going down in places \nwhere this kind of legislation has been on the books across the \ncountry, we know what has been done in Michigan is going to be one more \nstep in creating that race to the bottom. We see wages for union and \nnonunion workers go down when we have that kind of a race to the \nbottom. We see health benefits and pensions decrease. We see lower \nconsumer spending because middle-class families have less money in \ntheir pocket.\n  These kinds of laws hurt families. It is not about economics or \nfreedom, it is about raw politics. Workers need to have confidence they \nwill have a voice in the workplace and they will have a decent wage and \nbenefits they can count on to be able to have a good life for \nthemselves and their families.\n  That is really what this is all about in so many ways, where families \nare under attack right now. Middle-class people, trying to hold it \ntogether, people trying to figure out how to get into the middle class, \nwho have been knocked down over and over. It is time to stop saying the \nwords ``middle class'' and actually believe and act as if it is \nimportant to our country--because it is. It is essential if we are \ngoing to have a quality of life and an economy and have families who \nknow that the American dream is not just a couple of words, but they \nhave the ability to create the American dream for their families.\n  We have 19 days for the House of Representatives to pass the middle-\nclass tax cuts that we sent to them in July, July 25; 19 days before \nfamilies see their taxes go up and they believe one more time, at least \nin the House, that they do not get what is happening to families.\n  I strongly urge the Speaker and Republican leadership to bring up \nthis bill right away, get it done, and let families know they will have \neconomic certainty--at least related to their taxes going into the new \nyear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if the rough and tumble of Chicago \npolitics is not where you would expect to find a slightly built \nCatholic nun, you have never met Sister Sheila Lyne. Sister Sheila has \nbeen an icon in Chicago health care for almost half a century. For \nnearly 10 years in the 1990s she made history as Chicago's public \nhealth commissioner.\n  For 15 years before her work as Chicago's top public health officer \nand for another dozen years afterwards, this smart, visionary \ncourageous woman also served as president and CEO of Mercy Hospital & \nMedical Center, a legendary institution that has helped care for poor \nfamilies on the South Side of Chicago since before the Civil War. As \npublic health commissioner, Sister Sheila was never afraid to tackle \nthe powerful. Her decisions were based on conscience, and an iron will. \nShe was once arrested for ignoring a judge's order to test every child \nin a Chicago public school for lead poisoning because she believed the \nedict was unnecessarily broad and could hurt children and deplete her \ndepartment's limited resources. She was out of jail 2 hours later.\n  The first time she took over as president of Mercy Hospital, in 1976, \nMercy was bleeding money and on the verge of closing. Sister Sheila's \nbusiness savvy and innovative management ideas helped put the hospital \nback in the black. In 2000, following a series of management blunders, \nMercy was losing $40 million a year and once again about to go down for \nthe count. Sister Sheila stepped down as Chicago's public health \ncommissioner and returned as Mercy's president and CEO to lead the \nhospital's turnaround effort. Once again, she succeeded with a series \nof shrewd business decisions, innovative reforms, and determination. A \nyear ago, Sister Sheila helped engineer the sale of Mercy Hospital to \nTrinity Health, the tenth-largest health system in the Nation and the \nfourth-largest Catholic health system.\n  Last week, at the age of, as she says, ``76\\1/2\\''--she insists \nincluding the half--Sister Sheila announced that she will step down as \npresident and CEO of Mercy Hospital as soon as her successor can be \nnamed. While she will remain with Mercy as senior adviser to Mercy \nFoundation, the hospital's philanthropic arm, her departure as Mercy's \npresident and CEO will bring to a close one of the most remarkable \ncareers in Chicago health care in our lifetimes.\n  Sheila Lyne was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, one of \nthree children of Irish immigrants who met in America. She attended \nLittle Flower Elementary School and Mercy High School. She joined the \nSisters of Mercy, a Catholic religious order, in 1953. She earned a \nmaster's degree in psychiatric nursing from St. Xavier College and an \nMBA from the University of Chicago and served three years as an \nassistant professor at the University of Iowa before joining Mercy \nHospital in 1970. In 1976 she became Mercy's president and CEO.\n  In 1991, Mayor Richard M. Daley appointed her city health \ncommissioner--the first woman and the first non-physician ever to hold \nthat job. The department's responsibilities ran the gamut from \ninspecting restaurants, to monitoring and controlling epidemics, and \nprotecting the public against the spread of infectious diseases. Its \nclinics receive a million patient visits a year and are the ``family \ndoctor'' to more Chicagoans than any other single entity.\n  HIV and AIDS were taking a devastating and rising toll on the city \nand the nation, and gay and lesbian groups protested Sister Sheila's \nappointment strongly, fearing she would allow Church policies to \ndictate public health decisions. Sister Sheila surprised her critics by \ntaking on the cause of fighting AIDS, increasing care and prevention \nfunding from $4 million to $40 million and promoting aggressive, even \ncontroversial prevention efforts. She gained national acclaim for her \ninnovative programs to improve the health of poor women and children.\n  When she learned that the department had no way to know which areas \nof the city faced particular problems, she set up an epidemiology \ndepartment. Data from that department helped her department to focus \nand improve its efforts. She visited elementary schools, pregnancy \ncrisis centers, welfare clinics, homeless shelters and senior centers \nthroughout the city, listening to people's stories in order to better \nunderstand their lives--and always looking for better ways to combat \nthe city's health challenges.\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\n  When she started, the infant mortality rate in some poor Chicago \nneighborhoods was lower than in many developing nations. Sister Sheila \nrecruited two women in the Robert Taylor Homes, a large public housing \ncomplex, asked them to find pregnant residents and escort them to one \nof the department's eight free-standing clinics for prenatal care. \nDuring her tenure, she reduced the city's infant mortality rate by 39 \npercent.\n  She sent a van to circulate through Chicago's poorer neighborhoods, \nproviding immunizations for children and dramatically increasing the \npercentage of kids who are up to date on their shots. She created a \ncitywide plan--hailed by the Centers for Disease Control--as a model to \ncombat what she called the insidious public health epidemic of domestic \nviolence. She created special programs to reach minority and immigrant \nfamilies and established an Office of Lesbian and Gay Health, only the \nsecond such office in the Nation.\n  Sister Lyne received many honors, including the Excellence in Public \nAward from the blue-ribbon panel of Chicago's business and industry \nleaders.\n  Dr. Joanne Smith, president and CEO of the Rehabilitation Institute \nof Chicago, recently praised Sister Sheila and said she was one of \nthose leaders who, when she gets behind something, is a train that is \ndifficult to stop.\n  Three years ago Sister Lyne helped prod the Illinois General Assembly \nto pass a groundbreaking new law capping how much hospitals could \ncharge uninsured patients, so that instead of being the only people who \nare billed the full sticker price, their bills are closer to what other \npatients pay.\n  She comes to the office 7 days a week--usually by 7 a.m.--half walks \nand half jogs 3 miles a day. Some days she trades the walk for the \nelliptical and Stairmaster. She is 76\\1/2\\ years old. She speaks of \nMercy Hospital as a mission and believes that health care is a public \ngood. She is, in her own words, ``so grateful and so privileged that I \nhave been able to be a part of making things better.''\n  However, she is troubled and frustrated by all the unmet needs. When \nasked what changes she has seen in health care in the last half \ncentury, she replies very simply: Not enough. She asks pointedly: Who \ndoesn't deserve health care?\n  In closing, I want to read a short excerpt from the Chicago Sun-Times \neditorial. Here is what they said:\n\n       Some people fight for the poor and dispossessed by marching \n     on the castle, torches high. Others, fighting the same fight, \n     cross the drawbridge and work from the inside, maneuvering \n     the levers of power, mastering the arts of management and \n     poll politics.\n       Sister Sheila Lyne . . . is the second kind of activist, \n     remarkably so, having done much to make Chicago a more caring \n     city for half a century.\n\n  The editorial went on to say:\n\n       Sister Sheila . . . says it's time she calls it quits, but \n     we suspect we'll see her again. She is of a generation of \n     Catholic sisters, and of a particularly steely order--the \n     Sisters of Mercy--who tend to work until they can't work \n     anymore. They are smart, educated women who run things. They \n     are tough and ramrod straight. And we would rather they never \n     retire. Certainly not this one.\n\n  Well, anyone anywhere who questions the catholicity or the \nChristianity of American Catholic nuns needs to meet Sister Sheila, a \nwoman who has given her life to the least of our brethren.\n  Loretta and I and countless Chicagoans of three generations feel \nexactly the same way. Sister Sheila Lyne's passionate devotion to \nhealth care and justice has made Chicago a healthier and better city, \nand we are all in her debt.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons).

Mr. President, every week I hear from students across my \nState and around the Nation who are struggling with student loans. \nCongress has acted on important legislation to help students with these \nloans by keeping the interest rate of Federal subsidized student loans \nat a low 3.4 percent, but we need to do more for borrowers and their \nfamilies because the private student loans have become burdensome and \nunmanageable.\n  While other types of consumer loan debt are decreasing, there is one \ncategory that is increasing, student loan debt. Student loan debt is \nmore burdensome than other debts. Lenders often will not work with \nborrowers; take it or leave it. As we all know, student loans--because \nof the action of Congress--are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Only in \nextremely rare circumstances when the debtor can establish undue \nhardship is a student loan dischargeable from a bankruptcy.\n  Undue hardship is a court-defined term, and most courts use a three-\npart analysis called the Brunner test that was created by the Second \nCircuit in 1987 to determine whether a student loan can be discharged \nin bankruptcy. The Brunner test requires that to establish ``undue \nhardship'' and receive a discharge of a student debt, a debtor must \nshow ``that the debtor cannot maintain a minimal standard of living if \nforced to repay the loan.'' Second, that this state of affairs is \nlikely to persist for a significant portion of the loan repayment \nperiod; and, third, that the debtor made good-faith efforts to repay \nthe loan.\n  This test--and especially the second part--is almost impossible to \nsatisfy.\n  Back in March I chaired a hearing in the Judiciary Committee on \nstudent loans and bankruptcy. One of the witnesses was Deanne Loonin of \nthe National Consumer Law Center. Ms. Loonin testified that the ``undue \nhardship system is random, unfair and costly'' and that ``effectively \nit has become no choice at all for those who most need it.''\n  Ms. Loonin noted that the second prong of the Brunner test ``forces \nborrowers to prove a negative--they must somehow prove that their \nfuture is as hopeless as their present.''\n  In 2004 the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals noted that courts have \napplied the Brunner test to deny discharge under even the most dire \ncircumstances. That is because in many jurisdictions courts have \nconstrued that second prong of the Brunner test to require borrowers to \nshow ``certainty of hopelessness.''\n  On August 31, the New York Times ran an article about the Brunner \ntest and this ``certainty of hopelessness'' standard. It was entitled \n``Last Plea on Student Loans: Proving a Hopeless Future.'' The article \nsaid:\n\n       Lawyers sometimes joke about the impossibility of getting \n     over this high bar, even as they stand in front of judges. \n     ``What I say to the judge is that as long as we've got a \n     lottery, there is no certainty of hopelessness,'' said \n     William Brewer Jr., a bankruptcy attorney in Raleigh, N.C. \n     ``They smile, and then they rule against you.''\n\n  The New York Times discussed a 2008 undue hardship case in my State \nof Illinois--in deep southern Illinois. The debtor, David Whitener, was \nvisually disabled, unemployed, and living on about $900 a month of \nSocial Security disability payments. The bankruptcy court rejected the \nundue hardship request finding that he had not proved ``certainty of \nhopelessness.'' Whitener's lawyer, Steve Stanton of Granite City, said \nof the case:\n\n       I didn't even have the client pay me. In all of the cases \n     in 30 years of bankruptcy work, I came away with about the \n     worst taste in my mouth that I've ever had.\n\n  Not only is it almost impossible to prove the hardship required by \nthe Brunner test, most student borrowers are not even able to afford to \ntry. That is because debtors have to bring a separate court case in \naddition to the bankruptcy case in order to seek this exception. That \nmeans paying a lawyer for another case and likely for an appeal.\n  How can it be that the deck is so stacked against students who \nborrowed to go through school? How can ``certainty of hopelessness'' be \nthe standard for borrowers to obtain any relief in bankruptcy court. \nThis harkens back to the debtors prisons of Europe and England. Charles \nDickens would have a ball with this standard.\n  Congress needs to address this issue. Right now there is $150 billion \nin outstanding private student loan debt that is crushing many \nborrowers--$150 billion. I have a bill, the Fairness for\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\nStruggling Students Act, that would once again permit private student \nloans to be discharged in bankruptcy as they were before 2005. Mark my \nwords, there is no good reason why private student loans should be \ntreated differently in bankruptcy from any other type of private \nunsecured debt.\n  This 2005 change in the law was a special interest favor. It was \nnever justified, never debated, and cannot even be explained today. \nFiling for bankruptcy is never a walk in the park, and it should be the \nlast resort for anyone, including student borrowers. But many private \nstudent loans have outrageous terms forced on kids--or just barely \nbeyond being kids--and their families. Students are saddled with those \nloans. Many of them would not even understand the standard of \n``certainty of hopelessness'' that is required before there is any \nrelief in bankruptcy court. The problem is not going away; it is \ngetting worse. The student debt, when they start to default, just grows \nin size.\n  One of my recent e-mails came from a victim of one of these for-\nprofit schools. The initial debt this student had after the student \ndropped out of the for-profit school was about $80,000 in private \nloans. Because the student could not get a job, the debt just grew. It \nis now $103,000. The student lives in the basement of the family home \nand has no hope. She cannot borrow any money for a car to go back to \nschool or for any purpose. She is stuck, and it is not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy.\n  Bankruptcy reform would help borrowers like Malissa Peloquin. She \nleft Westwood College--one of the most notorious for-profit schools--in \n2007 with $75,000 in student loan debt. It is a debt that Westwood \nCollege advisers and counselors had lured her into. Her Federal loans \nhave an interest rate below 4 percent, but her private student loans \nare at more that 11 percent.\n  Malissa has never defaulted on her loans, but with three kids, she \nstruggles to make the payments every month. She fears that she will \nlose her home because the home payments are difficult to keep up \nbecause of the student loan debt.\n  Her mother, who is 65 years old, cosigned two of her daughter's \nstudent loans just to help her.\n  Malissa worries what will happen when she cannot pay. Will they go \nafter her mother? We know they do. In the past there have been reports \nabout garnishing Social Security checks on the parents and grandparents \nwho cosigned student loans when the student defaulted.\n  Malissa has considered filing for bankruptcy, but she knows that \nprivate student loans are not dischargeable as set by this outrageous \nstandard. She said if she could go back in time, there is no way she \nwould have ever taken out those loans.\n  How many young people 18, 19, 20 years old sit across the desk from \nan admissions officer who pushes the papers in front of them and says: \nIf you sign these papers, you will be in class next week. How many \nthink: I have been told, as long as I can remember, go to school, get a \ndegree? They anxiously sign them never thinking that they are building \nup a debt in many cases that will dog them for life.\n  We need to help borrowers such as Malissa who are struggling. I hope \nmy colleagues will take a serious look at this. This is totally unfair. \nThe for-profit college industry is disgraceful. Remember three numbers: \n12 percent of all the students after high school go to for-profit \nschools; 25 percent of all Federal aid to education goes to for-profit \nschools; and 47 percent of all student loan defaults are of the \nstudents at for-profit schools. It tells us the story.\n  They drag these kids deep in debt, hand them worthless diplomas, \nwatch them default, and then lives ruined by what students thought was \nthe right decision early in life. Who is responsible for it? The \nCongress? The President? The government? Check all of the above. We \nhave created this circumstance that costs $32 billion a year, money \nthat we send to these for-profit colleges. If they were a separate \nFederal agency, for-profit colleges would be the ninth largest Federal \nagency in Washington, DC. They receive subsidies from 85 to 95 percent \nof all of their expenses directly from the Federal Government. Calling \ntheir employees Federal employees is not a stretch. They are all paid \nfor by the Federal Government as are their advertising and marketing \nexpenses.\n  When we put this all together, it is rotten. The students who are \ncontacting my office, and many other Senators, are crying out for help \nand relief. If we cannot help these young people after the exploitation \nof the for-profit schools and others, shame on us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 1981, in his first inaugural address, \nPresident Reagan said:\n\n       Government is not the solution to our problem; government \n     is the problem.\n\n  I came to the Senate 2 years later in 1983 with the firm belief that \nin most cases his statement was wrong. I believed then and I believe \nnow that the Federal Government can be a constructive force for good, \nin protecting and maintaining the civil liberties of all Americans, in \nmaintaining and strengthening our economy, protecting our environment, \nand in helping Americans live productive and fulfilling lives.\n  As I look back over the last 30 years, many of the arguments that \nhave consumed our time at the Senate, whether on questions of spending \nor taxes or regulation or fiscal policy, those questions have divided \nbetween those who saw government as the problem and those who believed \nit could and should be a constructive force for helping the American \npeople deal with problems. I consider myself firmly in the second camp. \nIn each of the major areas of national concern, I would like to be able \nto report progress for the country since I arrived in the Senate. \nUnfortunately, the record of progress is not so clear. In many areas, \nwe have made progress, but there are also instances where we have lost \nmore ground than we have gained. As issues continue to be reconsidered, \nI am reminded of the well-known statement that ``success is never \npermanent in Washington.''\n  With regard to our Nation's security from foreign aggression, the end \nof the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union were clearly the \nmost positive developments we have seen in the last 30 years. If the \nend of the Cold War was the most positive national security development \nI witnessed since coming to the Senate, the invasion of Iraq to bring \nabout regime change in that country was the biggest national security \nblunder. That blunder cost our Nation dearly in service men and women \nkilled and injured and in resources that should have been used to \nstrengthen our economy here at home. Last month, I was stopped by a \nwoman from northern New Mexico who thanked me for my service in the \nSenate and particularly for my vote against granting President Bush the \nauthority to take our country into that war.\n  The Nation's fiscal policy is very much the focus of the Senate's \nattention during these final weeks of the 112th Congress. On this \nissue, again, we have made one step forward during the time I have been \nin the Senate, but, unfortunately, we have taken two steps back. I \narrived in the Senate in January of 1983, a period of large deficits \ncompared to anything the country had experienced for several decades. \nThose large deficits grew and persisted through the Reagan Presidency.\n  In 1990, a democratically controlled Congress and President George \nH.W. Bush made a significant step forward, reining in those deficits \nwith the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of that \nyear, 1990. That law created the statutory pay-go requirement. It also \nincreased marginal rates for the wealthiest Americans, and I was proud \nto support the measure. In 1993, another major step was taken when, at \nthe urging of President Clinton, Congress enacted the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of that year, 1993. Again, that measure both raised \ntaxes and constrained spending. It was denounced by many in the Senate \nas sure to throw the economy into recession. In fact, the opposite \noccurred, and the economy prospered. As\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\na result of these policy changes and the strong economy of the 1990s, \nwe enjoyed a period of balanced budgets and even surpluses in 1998, \n1999, 2000, and 2001.\n  Unfortunately, those surpluses were not to continue. President George \nW. Bush urged Congress to cut taxes and Congress was all too willing to \noblige, and although I didn't support the 2001 or 2003 tax cuts, they \nwere passed. At about the same time we were cutting taxes more than we \ncould afford, we were also going to war in Afghanistan and in Iraq and \nadding a new drug benefit to Medicare. No provision was made to raise \nrevenue or cut spending elsewhere to pay for any of these mammoth \nundertakings. Of course, the cost of health care, both the cost to \ngovernment and to families and businesses who purchased private \ninsurance, continued to grow at too rapid a pace. So the result was a \nreturn to large deficits and, of course, those large deficits grew \nsubstantially larger because of the recession that began in December of \n2007.\n  Today, we are trying to strengthen our economy while at the same time \ntrying to reduce projected deficits. That long-term deficit reduction \nwill, once again, require higher taxes as well as new constraints on \nspending, and I hope that even in these final days of this 112th \nCongress, we can reach agreement to proceed.\n  As regards health care, in the longstanding fight to provide \nAmericans with access to affordable health care, we have seen \nsignificant progress. In 1997, we enacted the Children's Health \nInsurance Program which resulted in nearly 8 million American children \nobtaining access to health care. Of course, in 2010, we adopted the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This unfairly maligned \nlegislation has the promise of moving us much closer to the goal of \nuniversal health care, and I am proud to have worked with my colleagues \nin the writing of that legislation and in seeing it enacted. Now that \nthe recent election is behind us, I hope the efforts to repeal that \nlegislation are at an end. I also hope the two parties can find ways to \nimprove the legislation with a particular focus on better controlling \nthe growth and the cost of health care.\n  In addressing the various energy challenges facing the country, \nagain, there is progress to report. In 2005 and 2007, Congress enacted \nmajor Energy bills. Those bills moved us toward a better and more \ncomprehensive national energy policy. Those bills promoted an adequate \nand more diverse supply of energy. They increased the efficiency and \neffectiveness of how we use energy in our economy. They promoted strong \nmarket reforms and consumer protections for electricity, and they \nstruck a balance between meeting our energy goals and lessening \nenvironmental impacts of energy, including overall greenhouse gas \nemissions. As a result of that balanced approach, we have arrested what \nhad been an increasing dependence on foreign oil. Coupled with \ntechnological advances that have opened new sources of supply, we are \nheaded to greater levels of energy independence than we had thought \npossible even as recently as 7 years ago.\n  The bipartisan consensus that allowed us to enact those bills has, \nunfortunately, eluded us in the current Congress. I hope in future \nCongresses there will reemerge a recognition that climate change is a \nreality and that our policies to meet our energy needs must also deal \nresponsibly with environmental issues, including the damage caused by \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  As regards our Nation's policy on education, the good news is we seem \nto have moved past the period where the Republican nominee for \nPresident announced a commitment to eliminating the Federal Department \nof Education. President Clinton deserves great credit for making the \nsupport, particularly of higher education, a priority of his \nPresidency. President George W. Bush deserves credit for making a \nserious effort to reform and improve elementary and secondary \neducation. Although that effort to improve elementary and secondary \neducation has not succeeded as many of us who supported it had hoped, I \nremain persuaded the Federal Government needs to persist in trying to \nplay a constructive role in improving education in this country.\n  The States and local school districts deserve great credit for \ndeveloping and adopting the Common Core Standards, and I hope future \nCongresses will strongly support the steps and the funding needed to \nupgrade student performance by implementing those standards. President \nObama and his administration have demonstrated their strong commitment \nto this goal.\n  In addition to these areas of concern I have mentioned, we have seen \nsome progress in maintaining and advancing the science and engineering \nenterprise in this country. As the Cold War came to an end, we \nsuccessfully found ways to better integrate the strengths of our \ndefense laboratories into the civilian economy, through technology \ntransfer and partnering. We have also seen some important increases in \nfunding for research, particularly in support of the life sciences, and \nthat growth has stagnated in recent years. It needs to continue and be \nreplenished, but as we continue that support, we must also recognize \nthe need to do more to support research and development in the physical \nsciences and in engineering.\n  One significant advance I was proud to support was the establishment \nof ARPA-E, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy within the \nDepartment of Energy. That effort to identify breakthrough science and \nengineering initiatives to meet our energy challenges holds great \npromise for our Nation and for the entire world.\n  We have also seen progress in providing increased protection for \npublic lands. One particular bill in that area was the omnibus public \nlands bill that was passed in 2009. It added wilderness protection to \nover 2 million acres, designated 1,100 miles of wild and scenic rivers, \nand added more than 2,800 miles for the national trail system. I was \nproud to be part of the effort to enact that legislation.\n  Finally, I will make a few comments on the way we in the Congress \nconduct our own business. Any fair assessment has to conclude that in \nthis area, we have lost ground in the last two decades. Public opinion \nof the performance of Congress is at an alltime low and it is not hard \nto see why. I will mention three obvious ways in which the functioning \nof Congress has worsened.\n  First is the willingness of some in Congress to shut down the \ngovernment. In 1995, we saw the leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives demonstrate that they consider refusing to fund the \ngovernment as an acceptable bargaining ploy in their efforts to prevail \nin disputes with President Clinton and Democrats on spending issues. \nSince 1995, that threat to withhold appropriations has been made \nseveral more times. As we saw then, shutting down the government is \ncostly, it is wasteful, and it is harmful to Americans. I hope this \nirresponsible threat will soon be viewed as unacceptable.\n  A second way the malfunctioning of Congress became clear was when in \nAugust of 2011--just less than 18 months ago--the Republican leadership \nin Congress determined that another tool at their disposal was the \nability to refuse to increase the debt ceiling. By doing so, they could \ndeny the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to borrow money to \nmeet the obligations the government had already undertaken. To my \nknowledge, this was the first time the congressional leadership of one \nof our major parties had stated their willingness to see our Nation \ndefault on its debt.\n  This threat to force a default on the obligations of the Federal \nGovernment resulted in the sequester of government spending, which is \nscheduled to begin January 1. It also resulted in a downgrading of U.S. \ndebt by one of the leading credit rating agencies.\n  We now hear renewed threats to use this so-called leverage as a way \nto demand cuts in Medicare and in Social Security. Once again, I \nbelieve this is an irresponsible action I hope Congress will get \nbeyond.\n  Of course, a third way in which the functioning of the Senate--not \nthe full Congress but the Senate--has worsened is the abuse of Senate \nrules allowing unlimited debate or filibuster. As the Senate currently \noperates, a threat of filibuster is used routinely to obstruct the \nSenate from doing its business, even when the issue before the Senate \nis relatively uncontroversial. Many times following a delay caused by \nobstruction, an overwhelming number of Senators will vote for the \nlegislation or\n\n[[Page S8024]]\n\nthe nomination which the Senate has been delayed in considering. In the \nnext Congress, I strongly encourage my colleagues to make the necessary \nchanges in Senate rules to limit the ability of one or a few Senators \nto obstruct the Senate from doing its regular business. My colleague \nSenator Udall of New Mexico is on the floor with me. He has been a \nleader in this effort to get these rules changed, and I commend him for \nthat.\n  So the record of our progress both as a country and as a Congress \nover the last 30 years has been mixed. There is progress to report. I \nhave mentioned some of that. There are also many missteps and failures \nwe need to acknowledge.\n  My conclusion remains that many of our challenges as a nation can \nonly be met with the help of a strong and effective national \ngovernment. There are times when the actions of the government are more \na problem than a solution, but there are many more occasions where \nenlightened action by the government is important and even essential.\n  I consider it an honor and a privilege to have represented the people \nof New Mexico in the Senate for the last 30 years. I thank the people \nof my State for their confidence in electing me and supporting me \nduring the time I have served here. I thank the very capable and \ncommitted men and women who have worked on my staff, both in Washington \nand in New Mexico, during these 30 years. I thank all my colleagues \nhere in the Senate for their friendship and help to me during this \nperiod. Of course, I thank my wife Anne and our son John and his wife \nMarlene for their support that has allowed me to serve in the Senate.\n  To all my friends and colleagues who will be here in the next \nCongress and in future Congresses, I hope you can find the common \nground necessary for our country to effectively move forward and meet \nits challenges. The endeavor is a worthy one, and I wish you every \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with a difficult \ntask: to honor a great Senator and a great friend, Senator Jeff \nBingaman.\n  This is difficult for two reasons. First, Senator Bingaman is not one \nto call attention to himself, and, second, he does so as briefly as \npossible. On both counts--let me just say now--I am going to fall \nshort.\n  Jeff is that rare combination of character--brilliant and humble. For \nJeff, it is about the work, not about his own ego, not about a monument \nto himself. For three decades in the U.S. Senate, he has been making a \ndifference, for the American people and for our home State of New \nMexico.\n  Public service is a noble profession--when it isn't swamped by money, \nwhen it isn't held hostage to hyperpartisanship. Jeff is the best \nexample I know of the nobility of politics. The origin of the word \n``noble'' is ``nobilis''--well-known--from the latin ``noscere'' to \ncome to know. Jeff, who is a scholar, probably knows that. I had to \nlook it up. But, knowing, making sense of the world, using that \nknowledge to make the world a better place, that is what public service \nis supposed to do, and that is what Jeff Bingaman does.\n  By Washington standards, Jeff is a man of few words. And when he \ncomes to this floor to speak, we listen. If I am at my desk in my \noffice, I will turn up the television, I will stop what I am doing, \nbecause I know that he will say something insightful, something worth \nknowing, something worth thinking about.\n  When Jeff came to the Senate 30 years ago, this was a different \nplace. There was a new President. There was a fierce battle of ideas, \nof ideology, of where the country needed to go. Principles did not \nmatter any less then than they do now. But folks worked together. They \nclashed, but they also compromised.\n  We all know what has happened since then. Washington has become more \nand more polarized. But, time and again, Jeff Bingaman has been a voice \nof reason, of doing what is best for our country--no grandstanding, \njust hard work, paying attention to details, getting problems solved, \ngetting the job done. He is an inspiring role model.\n  In his own quiet way, Jeff does something essential: He challenges us \nto think a little harder, look further down the road, see how we can \nmove our country forward, not just today, but far into the future. He \ndoesn't look for the limelight. He looks for solutions. And his \naccomplishments make for a very long list.\n  He has been a truly great chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. He has done so much to protect our natural \nresources, to build a clean energy economy, for jobs, for the \nenvironment. I was proud to work with Jeff on the first \nrenewable electricity standard in Congress. He led the Senate bill, and \nI led the House bill. And, as always, I learned from his example: \nsteady, focused, and reasonable.\n\n  We will continue to carry the torch on renewable and clean energy \nstandards in Congress, following in his footsteps. But today, we can be \nproud that 30 States--including New Mexico--have enforceable renewable \nstandards. Together, these cover the large majority of the U.S. \npopulation.\n  Jeff also shepherded the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the first \ncomprehensive energy bill in 13 years. a ``do it all'' energy bill that \ncovered renewables, nuclear, clean coal, and oil and gas.\n  And 2 years later, he took the lead in the Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act of 2007. That bill was an even more ambitious effort than \n2005. As the National Journal reported, it was ``the most sweeping \nenergy efficiency legislation ever put into law.''\n  On both of these bills, Jeff worked in a commendable, bipartisan \nfashion with Senator Domenici, a Republican from New Mexico. He also \nachieved these compromise bills with a Republican House in 2005, a \nDemocratic House in 2007, and both were signed into law by Republican \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  The public lands package of 2009 was another great achievement. Jeff \nreached across the aisle for compromise and protected 2 million acres \nin nine States as new wilderness areas, and more than 1,000 miles of \nrivers and streams--one of the greatest land protection laws ever. It \nwill benefit generations to come, and it is part of the legacy of Jeff \nBingaman.\n  We are spending time these days debating the failings of the Senate, \nthe gridlock, the partisanship. In contrast, Jeff's committee has been \na leading light of cooperation and compromise. When other committees \nlost their bipartisan way, the Energy Committee kept steady. I believe \nthe standard he set will shape future energy and natural resources \npolicy in years to come. I hope it guides us next year.\n  When this body has looked for answers, so often it has turned to \nJeff. No surprise that he was one of the Gang of 6 to negotiate health \ncare reform. When real solutions are on the agenda, Jeff will have a \nseat at the table.\n  Jeff was also one of the key negotiators in the No Child Left Behind \nAct, and he pushed for the Technology for Education Act and the America \nCOMPETES Act--raising standards for all students, increasing \nopportunity for all Americans. Because he knows that investments in \neducation and technology and training are crucial, crucial for the jobs \nof the future, crucial for our country.\n  Education, health care, jobs, energy, and the environment--Jeff has \nbeen a leader in all these areas. And what comes through over and over: \nhe never forgets the people who brought him here. He never forgets that \nwhat we do here is about families, is about communities, is about \nmaking a better future for our children and grandchildren. That is what \ndrives him, and that is what has made him such a great Senator.\n  One of the things I admire most about Jeff Bingaman is his courage. \nYou know where he stands, and he is not afraid to go against the \ncurrent. He was one of 23 Senators who voted against war with Iraq. As \nhe said later: ``I think that was the right vote, but it was not a \npopular vote.''\n  I have valued his counsel on many occasions. It has been an honor to \nserve with him. He is going to be missed--not just for his good humor, \nnot just for his friendship, but, more\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\nimportantly, for his character and wisdom. On both sides of the aisle, \nhis absence will be felt.\n  With typical humility, Jeff would be the first to say he has a great \nstaff, and he does. When I first came to Congress, on the House side, \nJeff and his staff reached out to me, and to my staff, always available \nto help, always ready to work together, to try and do what is best for \nour State and our Nation.\n  And, finally, I know Jeff would also say, he could not have \naccomplished so much without the support of his amazing wife Anne. They \nmet at Stanford Law School, and have walked side by side, equal \npartners, ever since. Anne Bingaman is as remarkable as her husband, \nand he would very likely insist more so.\n  My dad once said that the measure of someone isn't about winning \nelections or awards or honors. It is what the people who know you best \nthink about you. For those of us who know Jeff Bingaman, he is the real \ndeal.\n  Jeff Bingaman has lived a life of service--substantial, enduring, \nnoble service. I have no doubt that--though he is leaving the Senate--\nhe will find other ways to serve, and New Mexico and our Nation will be \nthe better for it.\n  Jeff, thank you. Thank you for your leadership, for your friendship, \nand for your always wise counsel. As you and Anne begin a new chapter \nin your lives, Jill and I wish you the very best.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague, Senator \nUdall, for his overly generous comments and indicate that 30 or 40 \nyears from now when he retires from the Senate, I will be glad to make \nsimilar comments about his service. I could make similar comments about \nhis service already based on the time he has served our State as \nattorney general and in the Congress and now in the Senate, but he does \na tremendous job for New Mexico and for the entire country here, and it \nis an honor for me to get to serve with him. This will be 4 years that \nwe will have completed as the two Senators from New Mexico, and it has \nbeen a great pleasure for me to have a good friend and a very capable \nSenator to work with. So I again appreciate the overly generous \ncomments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Madam President, I spoke about Senator \nBingaman. I know the Presiding Officer is on his committee and she \nfeels the same way about him and all the work he has done. It is going \nto be a sad day for all of us when he exits at the end of this year, \nbut he is a pretty remarkable leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8025-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORDER OF PROCEDURE--S. 3637\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Madam President, in less than 1 month, American taxpayers \nface the greatest tax increase in our Nation's history. It did not have \nto come to this.\n  The President claimed he wanted a balanced approach to deficit \nreduction. He told the American people throughout his campaign we \nneeded to balance tax increases with spending cuts in order to tame our \ndeficits, stop taking on water and, of course, reduce our debt.\n  Many Republicans objected to this approach on empirical grounds. \nThere is no denying the principal source of our debt crisis is on the \nspending side. But elections have consequences and many Republicans \nhave now stated a willingness to meet the President halfway. They are \nwilling to concede some revenue increases in exchange for entitlement \nreforms--revenue increases, not rate increases.\n  But the President now says never mind all those campaign promises \nabout a balanced approach. He has taken nearly all meaningful \nentitlement reforms, including many he previously endorsed, off the \ntable. He has abandoned revenue increases and spending cuts for deficit \nreduction and replaced that balanced approach with a plan to raise \ntaxes and increase spending.\n  This is not what he told the American people he stood for, but I \nwould go so far as to say that if he did campaign on this, he would now \nbe looking for new employment. This bait and switch is beyond cynical, \nparticularly when he knows the Republicans have a strong and \nempirically grounded opposition to revenue increases.\n  So far, we have focused primarily on the economic impact of the \nincreased marginal tax rates the President is demanding. But it would \nbe wrong to discount the coming tax increase on individual capital \ngains, should we go over the cliff or if the President gets his way. \nThe evidence seems clear. Any capital gains tax increase is \ncounterproductive to real economic growth and job creation. Allowing \nthese rates to go up puts ideology, partisanship, and class warfare \nahead of sound economic and tax policy. For almost the entire history \nof our income tax system, we have had preferential tax treatment for \ncapital gains.\n  From 1921 through 1987--and then again after 1990--long-term capital \ngains have been taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. The short \ntime, approximately 3 years, the preferential treatment for capital tax \ngains was not in effect was due to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The 1986 \nact is considered by many to be the gold standard for tax reform, and \nelimination of the preferential tax treatment for capital gains is \nconsidered by many to be one of the major accomplishments of the 1986 \nact.\n  It is important to recall, however, that elimination of preferential \ntax treatment for capital gains in 1986 was coupled with a significant \nreduction in tax rates for individuals, and the lack of preferential \ntreatment did not last long. Today, the top tax rate on capital gains \nis 15 percent. If Congress fails to act and we go over the fiscal \ncliff, the tax rate on capital gains will increase to 20 percent on \nJanuary 1, 2013. In today's fragile economy, with unemployment still \nhovering around 8 percent, we should not be raising taxes on capital \ngains.\n  Two years ago, a study by the American Council for Capital Formation \nshowed that increasing the capital gains tax would cause measurable \ndamage to the economy. The study estimated that if the capital gains \ntax was increased to 20 percent from 15 percent, real economic growth \nwould fall by 0.05 percentage points per year and jobs would decline by \nabout 231,000 per year. If the rate is increased to 28 percent, real \neconomic growth declines by 0.1 percentage points per year and 602,000 \nfewer jobs are created each year.\n  The fiscal cliff is only part of the story. In less than 1 month, a \nnew 3.8-percent tax on net investment income of single taxpayers \nearning more than $200,000 and married couples earning more than \n$250,000 will go into effect as part of the so-called Affordable Care \nAct. As a result, the capital gains for upper income taxpayers is \nalready scheduled to increase by almost 4 percent. We should not add \nanother 5-percentage-point tax increase on top of that.\n  Upper income taxpayers will face a 23.8-percent tax on capital gains \nin 2013 if Congress fails to act to prevent a rise in the capital gains \ntax. Sometimes the magnitude of these numbers is lost on folks. They \nmight think that is only a jump from 15 percent to about 24 percent, \nnot that big a deal.\n\n[[Page S8026]]\n\n  I would like to state just a few points. That represents a 59-percent \nincrease from current law. During the fiscal cliff negotiations, some \nhave posited that all that is at stake is a return to the tax rates of \nthe Clinton era. That is not what is happening with the tax rate on \ncapital gains. During the latter part of the Clinton era, a Republican \nmajority in Congress was able to get an agreement on cutting the top \nrate on capital gains to 20 percent at that time. If the tax rate on \ncapital gains remains at the 2012 rate of 15 percent--coupled with the \nnew 3.8-percent tax on net investment income--capital gains will be \ntaxed at 18.8 percent, very close to the Clinton-era rate.\n  A 5-percent increase in the tax on capital gains to 20 percent, \ncoupled with the increases imposed by ObamaCare, will result in a rate \nof 23.8 percent, well above the tax rate on capital gains at the end of \nthe 1990s. We should not go down this road. This is said specifically \nby the Senator who, along with Senator Lieberman, pushed very hard for \nthese lower capital gains rates. There was a Hatch-Lieberman bill that \nwas instrumental in bringing rates down to the current level.\n  There are a number of arguments on behalf of preferential tax \ntreatment for capital gains. For example, there is the lock-in effect. \nSince capital gains are only taken into account when realized by a sale \nor exchange, investors can avoid paying the capital gains tax by simply \nholding on to their capital assets. As a result, the capital gains tax \nhas a lock-in effect, which reduces the liquidity of assets and \ndiscourages taxpayers from switching from one investment to another. \nThis impedes capital flows to the most highly valued uses and is, \ntherefore, a source of economic inefficiency. The higher the rate, the \ngreater the disincentive to make new investments.\n  The preferential tax treatment for capital gains also counters the \ntwo levels of taxation of corporate income. A large amount of capital \ngains arises from the sale of corporate stock. When a corporation earns \nincome, it pays taxes on that income. When a shareholder sells stock, \npart of the gain on the stock might be due to the earnings of the \ncorporation, resulting in a double tax of corporate earnings. A low \ncapital gains tax leads to increases in savings and investment, \ncorrects the income tax law's bias against savings, corrects the lack \nof indexing capital gains for inflation, and increases the incentives \nfor risk-taking.\n  The tax rate on capital gains can also be viewed as a compromise \nbetween an income tax system and a consumption tax system. In a pure \nincome tax system, capital gains would be taxed the same as any other \ntype of income. In a consumption tax system, capital gains would not be \ntaxed at all. Taxing capital gains at 15 percent can be seen as a \nreasonable compromise of income tax and consumption tax principles.\n  An increase in the capital gains tax rate will increase the \ndifference between what an investment yields and what an individual \ninvestor actually receives. This is known as the tax wedge. The higher \nthe tax wedge, the fewer the number of investments that will meet the \nminimum rate of return required by an investor, known as the hurdle \nrate. In short, higher rates equal fewer investments.\n  So far I have only spoken about the coming increases in capital gains \ntaxes. I know people who are hurriedly selling their stock portfolios \nnow to pay the lesser capital gains rate and after the 1st of the year \nwill buy back the same stock, though it will have a higher basis at \nthat point.\n  The impact of the fiscal cliff on the taxation of dividends is even \nmore severe. Unless Congress acts, dividends will be taxed at a rate as \nhigh as 43.4 percent come January 1. This is because, starting in 2013, \ndividends will be taxed at 39.6 percent under current law, and then the \nObamaCare surcharge of 3.8 percent will be tacked onto that.\n  Many seniors depend on dividend income. To increase their dividend \nincome taxes to around 40 percent, especially at a time when any bonds \nthey hold essentially yield nothing, hollows out the nest eggs of \nretirees. Unless we address the fiscal cliff, the taxation of dividends \nwill go from 15 percent to 43.4 percent literally overnight. This is a \ntax increase of 189 percent--excuse me--yes, it is 189 percent. I \nthought for a minute it was 18.9 but, no, it is 189 percent.\n  It is hard to believe but nevertheless true that many Democrats, \nincluding the President's Treasury Secretary, have expressed a \nwillingness to go over the fiscal cliff, when Americans are facing tax \nincreases of this magnitude.\n  We are in the midst of a sluggish economic recovery. The President \nand his allies in Congress seem bent on raising taxes, regardless of \nthe impact tax hikes will have on future economic growth or income \nsecurity of seniors and pension holders. They would have us believe \nthere is no relationship between tax rates and economic growth. If that \nwere true, we wouldn't be seeing major companies scurrying to grant big \ndividends now, before the year ends and taxes potentially skyrocket--\namong which is the Washington Post. I read the other day they are going \nto do their dividends now before the end of the year, before all this \ntaxation occurs after the end of the year.\n  The coming capital gains tax hike is just one of many tax hikes \nfacing the American people if Congress refuses to act before the end of \nthe year. I think the numbers make a pretty compelling case that \nraising the capital gains tax rate, particularly when ObamaCare will \nalready raise that rate by nearly 4 percent, will do serious damage to \nour economy.\n  I might add, I don't blame anybody for paying their dividends this \nyear--in advance of next year. I don't blame them at all. I certainly \ndon't blame the Washington Post for doing it. But if you think tax \npolicy doesn't affect how things are done in this country, then you \ndon't know what from what.\n  Let's just say I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting an \nextension of the current capital gains and dividends tax rate.\n  The other day I talked about the estate taxes, or what we call death \ntaxes, and how stupid it is to do what the Democrats want to do with \nregard to death taxes--make them so high so there is a double taxation \non families, and especially ranchers, which will go up 24 times the \nnumber of last year's ranches and farms that will be hammered by these \nhigher death taxes.\n  There is a reason it is good to keep tax rates lower, and I hope none \nof my colleagues on either side, really, but certainly on the \nRepublican side, will agree to raising tax rates because we know once \nthey are raised, our friends on the other side are just going to spend \nthat money. They will not use it to pay down this $16.4 trillion \nnational debt we have. We are a few bucks short of $400 billion in that \nfigure, but we are getting there. It will be $17 trillion before the \nend of this year, and then it will go up even faster after that with \nwhat the President plans to do to this country.\n  We have to wake up. We have to quit listening to the political talk, \nand we have to start looking at the economics. We have to start looking \nat what works in taxation and what doesn't. Frankly, we have a long \nhistory of what works, and we also have a long history of what doesn't. \nWe are about to embark on all kinds of programs that don't. I don't \nwant to see that happen. I hope we will fight against these things. I \nhope those who really do represent the people will start representing \nthem instead of just asking for more and more money so they can spend \nmore and more and get this country even more and more in debt.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8026-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8026-S8028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WIND ENERGY TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I have two items I would like to \nbriefly mention. The Nation is consumed by the fiscal cliff. From all I \ncan tell, the Presidential limousine is moving very rapidly toward the \nfiscal cliff with the President's foot on the accelerator. I am still \nhopeful we will get a budget agreement that will help us get the \neconomy moving again, but at a time like this, of course, what we all \nneed to be doing is thinking about saving every possible penny to fix \nthe debt.\n\n[[Page S8027]]\n\n  This government in Washington, DC, is borrowing 42 cents out of every \ndollar we spend. That is why I come to the floor to point out a \nproposal that has been made to fleece the taxpayers out of an \nadditional $50 billion over the next 6 years. This is a proposal that \nis as brazen as a mid-day bank robbery on Main Street. It is a proposal \nby the wind developers of America to say to the taxpayers: Please give \nus $50 billion or so more dollars over the next 6 years to phase out \nthe Federal taxpayer subsidy for wind power.\n  Why is this a brazen fleecing of the taxpayers? First, this taxpayer \nsubsidy began in 1992, 20 years ago, as a temporary subsidy for a new \nform of energy. Of course, windmills are not really new. We have had \nthem for hundreds of years. But the idea was to give them a little \nboost so they could get bigger and perhaps help us supply electricity.\n  It was intended in 1992 that this would only be a temporary tax \ncredit. But as President Reagan used to say: There is nothing that \ncomes as close to eternal life as a government program. So this \ntemporary taxpayer credit has been renewed time after time after time. \nIt is 20 years old. Now, after billions of dollars and 20 years, wind \npower is, according to President Obama's Energy Secretary, a mature \ntechnology.\n  The Congress has decided that Federal taxpayer subsidies for wind \npower should end at the end of this year. Everyone knows that. This is \nno surprise. It has been out there for a while, so businesses can plan \non this. In other words, it is time for wind power, the Congress has \nsaid, to take its place in our free market system and compete with \nnatural gas, compete with nuclear power, compete with hydropower, \ncompete with solar power---compete with other forms of power producing \nelectricity. After all, we produce and use about 20 to 25 percent of \nall the electricity in the world, and we want to make sure we have \nplenty of it and that it is a reliable supply at a low price.\n  Yet along came the wind developers who have benefited from this \ngiveaway for 20 years--I say giveaway because, according to the Joint \nTax Committee and the United States Treasury, from 2009 through 2013 it \nhas cost the taxpayers $16 billion to subsidize windmills in America. \nPut that in a little perspective. The federal government spends only $6 \nbillion a year on all energy research. We could be spending it there. \nWe could be reducing the debt. Instead, we are continuing to subsidize \nthis mature technology.\n  But the brazenness of those who have been receiving this giveaway \nmoney--it is hard to imagine how it could be exceeded by a so-called \nphase-out proposal. They announced: Phase us out over the next 6 years, \nthrough 2018. In 2013 the credit would be 100 percent. We would have \nthe credit for next year at the same level it is this year. That's \nestimated to cost about $12 billion. That is twice the amount of money \nwe spend each year on energy research in America. Then, in 2014, they \nwant 90 percent of the previous full tax credit, and then 80 and 70 and \n60 and nothing after 2018.\n  I have not had a chance for the Congressional Budget Office to \nevaluate how much this phase-out would cost, but it is tens of billions \nof dollars. One estimate is $50 billion new taxpayer dollars at a time \nwhen we are borrowing 42 cents out of every dollar to keep doing \nsomething that is already phasing out on its own terms. We cannot \nafford that. We simply can't afford that. We cannot afford 1 year more \nof the wind tax credit--that is $12 billion--on top of the $16 billion \nfor grants and the production tax credit from 2009 through 2013.\n  Second, it is interfering with the marketplace. The subsidy to wind \ndevelopers is so great they are actually paying distributors of \nelectricity, in some cases, to take their wind power, which undercuts \nother forms of electricity on which we rely. Why is that so important? \nWe cannot rely on wind power, because it only works when the wind \nblows. It often blows at night when we really do not need it. We have a \nwind farm in Tennessee. It is the only one in the Southeastern United \nStates. Why? Because the wind doesn't blow much in the Southeastern \nUnited States.\n  In Tennessee, somebody has a big contract with extra subsidies by the \ngovernment to put these gigantic towers on top of our scenic mountains. \nAnd how much electricity does it produce? Not very much. Of course, \nthese turbines only generate electricity about 19 percent of the time, \nand it produces even less electricity when we actually need it. You can \nfly over it or drive by these giant windmills at 4 p.m. in the \nafternoon in the summer when everybody has their air conditioning on \nand they need electricity, and not a single windmill is turning. You \nmight go at night and it is turning, but they don't need the extra \nelectricity at 7 or 8 or 9 o'clock at night. That is the problem around \nthe country. It is a puny amount of unreliable, expensive electricity.\n  The idea that the United States of America, using 20 to 25 percent of \nall the electricity in the world, would produce the largest amount of \nclean and reliable electricity by windmills is the energy equivalent of \ngoing to war in sail boats when nuclear submarines are available.\n  Let's let wind power, after 20 years, find its place in our market. \nThere are clearly places where it should be fine. But there is no need \nto subsidize it from the Federal Government; to cause the ratepayers of \nTennessee, for example, to pay more to import electricity produced by \nwind from South Dakota when we should be using those dollars either to \nlower our rates, to pay for air pollution control equipment, and to \nbuild nuclear power plants--of which we have several in the Tennessee \nValley. They are clean--they emit no sulfur, no nitrogen, no mercury, \nand no carbon. That is the cleanest form of reliable energy we have in \nthe United States.\n  There may be some places where windmills work, but not along the tops \nof the Tennessee mountains or even in the valleys of Tennessee. The \nidea of continuing to waste $50 billion of taxpayer money over the next \nseveral years to subsidize a mature technology at a time when the \ngovernment is going broke is as brazen as a bank robbery in the middle \nof the day on Main Street. I hope we put a spotlight on this $50 \nbillion giveaway. I hope it becomes the poster child for what is wrong \nwith spending in Washington, DC. I hope the Congress will come to its \nsenses this month and next month and say no to those who come forward \nwith their hand out for this $50 billion giveaway.\n\n\n                             The Filibuster\n\n  Madam President, on Tuesday I spoke about the filibuster. I \ninadvertently made a mistake I would like to correct. When I was \nlooking at the history of filling the tree, which is the gag rule that \nthe majority leader uses to stop Republicans from offering amendments--\nwe just saw it again today. We had a banking bill. There was a budget \npoint of order that killed the bill. We had a couple of amendments on \nthe Republican side that would fix the budget point of order, and then \nwe could have passed the bill. But the majority leader imposed the gag \nrule, he filled the tree, and here we are.\n  I was talking about that, and I said that Senator Robert Dole was the \nfirst leader to fill the tree, and I was wrong about that. I was \nreading some information that the Congressional Research Service had \ngiven me, and I did not read it right. When the CRS went back and \nlooked at its information, it would appear that in 1980, Senator Robert \nByrd used this filling of the tree on the Tonnage Measurement \nSimplification Act, H.R. 1197.\n  That reminds me of a story Senator Baker used to tell me when he was \nsuddenly elected majority leader in 1981, and Senator Byrd became the \nminority leader unexpectedly. Senator Baker went to Senator Byrd and \nsaid: Senator Byrd, I will never know the rules as well as you do. I'll \nmake a deal with you. I won't surprise you if you won't surprise me.\n  Senator Byrd said to Senator Baker: Let me think about it.\n  He thought about it overnight and said: It's a deal. And they worked \nthat way for 4 years. Senator Byrd knew the rules.\n  In 1980, apparently, at least so far as the research shows, he was \nthe first one to use this arcane procedure of filling the tree. Filling \nthe tree sounds very strange, but it is very simple. It means the \nmajority leader can use it to cut off debate over here.\n  If you bring up a banking bill, and it has a budget problem, and one \nof us\n\n[[Page S8028]]\n\nsays we can fix that problem, that we have an amendment, if he has \nfilled the tree, we cannot offer amendments. If some Senator--let's not \npick on the majority leader--brings up a bill, and, let's say, it is an \nappropriations bill and it does not include money to rebuild the Center \nHill Dam or the Wolf Creek Dam--which is not safe at the moment--and I \nwant to stand up and say, Madam President, my constituents would like \nto see some money to make this dam safe because if it fails it will \nflood Nashville--if the tree is filled, I cannot do my job.\n  On our side of the aisle we do not like filling the tree. We are in \nthe minority, and we believe the majority has the right to set the \nagenda and that we in the minority have the right to offer amendments. \nThe good news is a number of us on both sides of the aisle are working, \nwith the knowledge of the majority leader and the Republican leader, to \nsee if we can make some suggestions privately to Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell that they can consider and, hopefully, agree that \nthey are good suggestions, and as we begin the new year we will be able \nto move bills to the floor.\n  I know the majority leader would like to be able to do that more \neasily, and maybe some of the fault for that is on our side. We on our \nside, then, would have a right to do what the minority especially wants \nto be able to do, which is to offer amendments, because this body is \nestablished for the purpose of protecting the rights of the minority.\n  The Congressional Research Service is looking further into the \nrecord, but we do have a record of how majority leaders have used this \nprocedure from 1985 to the present. This data supports my larger point \nwhich is--what was used rarely is now used too frequently.\n  According to CRS, these are the numbers. Since 1985, Senator Bob Dole \nfilled the tree, used the gag rule, seven times; Senator Byrd used it \nthree times; Senator Mitchell used it three times; Senator Lott, when \nhe was majority leader, used the gag rule 11 times--that is, cut off \namendments--Senator Daschle only one time; Senator Frist 15 times. \nThose are the majority leaders. So since 1985 all of those majority \nleaders used it a combined 40 times.\n  Our current majority leader, Senator Reid, has used it, as of \nyesterday, 69 times since he became leader in 2007. This trend, this \ngagging the minority, is the primary cause of the Senate's dysfunction.\n  I wanted to correct the record. I made a mistake, and I am glad to \ncome and correct it. I don't want Senator Dole to get the credit for \nthat when it appears Senator Byrd actually figured it out. I want to \nconclude with an optimistic point. I think most of us--and I would \ninclude the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire in the chair \nbecause we have been together in discussions, bipartisan discussions \nwhere we have talked about this--most of us believe we are fortunate to \nbe here. We know we are basically political accidents. Since we are \nhere we want to do our jobs. We would like to advocate the things that \npeople sent us here to do.\n  So if we have a bill, and we are in the majority, we would like to \nget the bill on the floor. If we have something to say, an amendment, \nif we are in the minority, we would like to have a chance to offer that \namendment. So what a number of us are doing, we have been talking about \nhow we can do two simple things: How can we make it easier for the \nmajority leader to get bills to the floor? And how can we make it \neasier for the minority especially to be able to offer amendments?\n  If we can do those two things at the beginning of the year, I think \nthe Senate will begin to function much more effectively. It will be a \nbetter place to work. We will get our job done in a better way. There \nwill be less finger-pointing, and there will be more results. There \nwill be a change in behavior, which is what we need instead of a change \nin rules, and it will inspire the confidence of the people of the \nUnited States about the kind of job we are doing.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders).

Mr. President, I rise to say what an important day it \nis for the U.S. Coast Guard. Our communities benefit from the services \nprovided by the men and women who have answered the call to serve. The \nreason I say that is because we have passed a bill that gives 43,000 \nActive-Duty Coast Guard members the support they need.\n  It is a worthy tribute to a force of men and women who in 2011 alone \nsaved 3,800 lives across the United States, confiscated 166,000 pounds \nof cocaine, and secured over 472,000 vessels before they arrived at our \nports. This will give the Coast Guard the funds it needs to upgrade \nequipment and purchase the right vessels for carrying out every \nmission.\n  This kind of work exemplifies the heroes such as CPO Terrell Horne of \nCalifornia. Officer Horne died in the line of duty last week while \nchasing down drug smugglers off the coast of California. Our thoughts \nare with his family, friends and the Coast Guard.\n  His actions and service remind us of the dangerous tasks the men and \nwomen of the Coast Guard do on a daily basis, and that is why it was so \nimportant that we passed this reauthorization bill.\n  We could not have done this reauthorization without the many hours \nSenator Begich put in to help get it across the finish line. He knows \nhow important the Coast Guard is to the men and women in the Pacific \nNorthwest and to my State, Washington.\n  The Coast Guard is part of our maritime culture in the Pacific \nNorthwest, and this bill helps the Coast Guard watch over our people, \nour businesses, and protect our coastline.\n  I would like to expound on three provisions that were particularly \nhelpful for us in the Northwest. One, this legislation helps to protect \nthe Polar Sea, an icebreaker based in Seattle; two, it helps us clean \nup tsunami debris that is already hitting the west coast; and three, it \nanalyzes the potential risk of tar sands supertankers, tankers and \nbarges in our waters off Washington State.\n  In October of this year, I visited Vigor Shipyards in Seattle where \nour heavy-duty icebreaker fleet is currently serviced. These ships are \na testament to American shipbuilding prowess and ingenuity, and, \ninspecting them up close, we can see they are the most critical tool \nfor the United States in our economic security and national security in \nthe Arctic. We see that building icebreakers means jobs to Washington \nState, and that is why in this final package, the importance of these \nships--the Polar Sea in particular was prioritized. The Polar Sea was \nin danger of being scrapped before we passed this bill.\n  There is no denying that we need to build a new icebreaker fleet for \nour Arctic economic future, and for the Coast Guard and Navy Arctic \nmissions. But, these specialized vessels will take up to 10 years to \nbuild. In the meantime, we want to make sure U.S. companies can \ncontinue to develop business in the Arctic and keep U.S. Arctic \noperations running. It is very fitting that the icebreakers that work \nfine now are not dismantled.\n  This legislation prevents the Polar Sea from being scrapped and helps \nus protect the resources we need to serve interests in the Arctic. This \nbill stipulates that we won't scrap our current icebreakers if it is \nmore cost-effective to keep them, and it will make sure our icebreakers \nare seaworthy so the crews don't go out on faulty equipment. These \nships won't go away unless it can be proven that it makes financial \nsense to replace them.\n  Last January, the world watched as the Healy icebreaker successfully \ncut through a path in the Arctic Sea to deliver fuel to Nome, AK. The \nHealy is primarily a research vessel but was forced to do the job \nbecause our two heavy-duty icebreakers were not currently in active \nstatus; they were being repaired.\n  This bill also ensures that the Polar icebreaking fleet will continue \nto be based in Seattle. Refurbishing a large icebreaker, such as the \nPolar Sea, can take roughly 5 years and employ 300\n\n[[Page S8029]]\n\nworkers. For us, this means shipbuilding jobs, it means an impact in \nkeeping smaller shipyards in Washington State busy, and it means \nkeeping icebreakers that help save places such as Nome, AK, by cutting \npaths through the ice.\n  However, that is not the only thing in this legislation that I am \nproud we got a decision on. Our economy in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, \nCalifornia, and Hawaii has been threatened by hundreds of thousands of \ntons of debris washing ashore as a result of the tragic tsunami in \nJapan nearly 2 years ago.\n  That is why this legislation asks NOAA to take a closer look at \ntsunami debris and makes sure we are putting an accurate assessment in \nplace to protect the west coast. If NOAA decides tsunami debris is a \nsevere marine debris event, then they will need to present a specific \ncoordination plan developed to meet that threat. And they will need to \nwork with local governments, counties, and tribes to ensure there is a \ncoordinated effort to protect our economy and environment from tsunami \ndebris. In the Northwest we have already seen ships, docks, and various \nother forms of debris float ashore. Oftentimes, our local communities \nhave had to pay more than their share of the burden and expense of \ncleaning up the tsunami debris.\n  With over 165,000 jobs and nearly $11 billion in our coastal economy \nfrom fishing, to tourism, to various activities, we want to make sure \nthat tsunami debris does not hurt our coastal economies. All we need to \ndo is ask the mayor of Long Beach, who said, ``An uncoordinated or \nunmanaged response to this debris event is a blow that Long Beach and \nthe Columbia-Pacific region cannot endure.'' This is about getting a \nplan in place for local communities to coordinate, to have \nopportunities to work together, and to remove debris as cost-\neffectively as possible.\n  Third, this legislation has important language protecting Washington \nwaterways in very precious parts of the Pacific Northwest. Recently, \nCanada announced that over the next decade they would double the \nproduction of the Alberta tar sands oilfields. Today, fifteen billion \ngallons of oil is already shipped through Washington waters. A spill in \na heavily populated area, around the San Juan Islands or in the waters \nof the Strait of Juan de Fuca could cause billions of dollars of damage \nand harm businesses throughout the region. The response cannot be, \nespecially if the spill occurs in Canadian waters, don't worry, just \ncall the Americans.\n  I am proud this legislation looks at the potential threat caused by \nsupertankers and whether they are equipped to respond to a spill that \ncould occur from corrosive tar sand oil. Thanks to this legislation, \nthe Coast Guard will have to prepare a study that will analyze how much \nvessel traffic will increase in the region due to the proposed increase \nin tar sands oil production and transportation, whether the movement of \ntar sands oil would require navigating through our fragile waters, it \nwould look at the oil spill response plans and response capability in \nthe U.S. and Canada's shared waters, identify the tools needed to clean \nup this kind of an oil spill and estimate the cost and benefits to the \nAmerican public of moving this oil through our waterways. And, this \nassessment has to be completed in 180 days.\n  I want to make sure our fishing fleets, our restaurants, our resort \neconomy, and everything that is so important to us in the Northwest, is \nprotected.\n  This legislation is good news for coastal communities, for jobs in \nWashington State and across our country, and I wish to thank both the \nchair and the ranking member of the subcommittee and full committee for \nmaking sure we have given the Coast Guard the resources it needs to \nprotect our economy, keep our public safe, and protect our environment. \nWe have much more work to do, but in a Congress that is down to its \nwaning days, it is important that this legislation has seen action and \nis on its way to the President's desk.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8029-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8029-S8031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LIMITING SPENDING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, something special happened earlier \ntoday. An important principle is being established in the Senate, and \nthat principle is that we will adhere to the budget agreement we made \nwith the American people 16 months ago. In other words, we agreed, in \nat least certain accounts, to have a limit on spending. Spending will \nstill increase every year over 10 years, but not as much as it would \nhave increased. We agreed that we would abide by the limit and we would \nnot spend more than that.\n  We have had four consecutive bills brought to the floor of this \nSenate--cavalierly, I would suggest--directly in violation of the \nspending limits we agreed to just a little over a year ago. As a \nresult, I or some other Member of the Senate made a budget point of \norder. That budget point of order said that the legislation before us \nviolates the budget limits, it spends too much, and we object.\n  Each time, our Democratic leadership moved to waive the budget point \nof order. To forget the budget. To spend above the budget. To not worry \nabout the budget. Just spend the money because this is a good bill, \nthey said. It has good proposals, and anybody who opposes it is against \nthese good proposals.\n  So we now have had four votes and for all four of those votes, the \nSenate has said: No, we are not going to waive the budget. We are going \nto live within the agreement of spending we reached just last year.\n  There is no reason these bills couldn't have been brought in within \nthe budget. There has been no reason they shouldn't be within the \nbudget. Some were not over the budget spending by much, but we have to \nadhere to that principle. I have been very proud that Members of this \nSenate in sufficient numbers have said: No, we are going to honor the \npromise we made to the American people, and we are going to do that, \nand we are not going to bust the budget.\n  So I think it is sending a message, and the message needs to be \nreceived.\n  Initially, the spin in this body has been, Oh, Senator Sessions and \nhis objectors don't want any good legislation to pass. They are just \nusing the Budget Act to block it.\n  But I think we are changing that now, and I think the American people \nare going to see what has happened. We have had seven votes on the \nbudget. The last four have been successful in enforcing the budget. I \nthink the American people are going to start asking, why are you, \nSenator, voting to waive the budget every single time? Didn't you agree \nto certain spending limits? Every time a bill came up, why did you vote \nto spend more than you agreed to spend, spend more than you told us you \nwere going to spend?\n  I think that is the message that ought to be coming out of here. I \nwill go a little further. If somebody has to have legislation passed, \ndon't blame the people who raised the budget point of order; blame \nyourself if you don't bring it to the floor in a way that does not \nviolate the budget. That is important. I think that is being \nestablished now, and that is what I think we should expect of anyone \nwho wants to move legislation in the U.S. Senate. If a Senator wants to \nget the vote and get the legislation passed, be sure they comply with \nthe agreement we made.\n  What agreement was that? Sixteen months ago, in August, the debt \nlimit had been reached, and it was put off and delayed, and we got to \nthe very last minute, and they reached this secret agreement--not \npublicly as it should have been, but we reached an agreement, and the \nagreement included at least some limits on spending. I didn't like the \nway it was done, but it did propose certain limits. It exempted 98 \npercent of Medicare spending from being cut. It exempted the food stamp \nprogram. Medicaid was totally exempted from any cuts. But many parts of \nthe budget were controlled, had their spending levels controlled by the \nbudget. As a result, the agreement was passed and the debt ceiling--the \nlimit on the amount of money that can be borrowed by the U.S. \nGovernment--was raised by $2.1 trillion.\n  We are now borrowing about 40 cents of every dollar we spend, and the \nCongress can limit, as the Constitution provides, how much the U.S. \nGovernment can borrow. We had just about reached that limit. Spending \nwas going to have to drop 40 percent--right across\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\nthe board, perhaps, unless the debt limit was raised. So we raised it \nso we could continue to borrow. But the promise was that over 10 years, \nthe level of spending would be reduced by the same amount that we \nraised the debt limit.\n  So we raised the debt limit by $2.1 trillion, and spending was \npromised to be reduced over the next 10 years by $2.1 trillion. Now we \nhave already spent that $2.1 trillion. I hate to tell my colleagues but \nby January and February, this body is going to be right back here \ndealing with the question of hitting the debt limit again. This year, \nit looks as though we will have another deficit well over $1 trillion. \nIn fact, the first 2 months of this calendar year were extraordinarily \nbad--almost $300 billion in debt in the first 2 months. If we continued \nat this rate, the deficit would be the largest ever in the history of \nthe Republic. So something needs to be done about that.\n  We made an agreement the last time we increased the debt limit. For \nus to go back on that, to not follow the budget agreement before the \nink is dry on it--before barely a year is gone--to continue bringing up \nbills that violate that agreement, then the American people would have \na right to have no confidence in us and to wonder what is going on: You \npromised us you were going to reduce the growth of spending, and as \nsoon as the shoe starts getting a little tight or the belt starts \nsqueezing, you cut and run, Senators.\n  So far, at least in recent weeks, we have been doing rather well on \nthis path of saying we will adhere to the budget agreement. I think on \neach one of the votes, we have had some Democratic support, but it is \nmostly Republicans that have held to the budget.\n  Where are we today? We are talking about the fiscal cliff. The \nPresident campaigned around this country, and he said: I have a \nbalanced plan, and that balanced plan is going to have so much in \nspending cuts and so much in tax increases, and it needs to be \nbalanced. You Republicans have to have more tax increases. Our country \nneeds to get itself on a sound financial path. And I have a deficit \nreduction plan.\n  He ran a television advertisement in the last months of his campaign \nthat said: I have a plan to pay down the debt. Earlier this year, his \nbudget director came before the committee and would not disavow the \nclaim that the President has a plan to pay down the debt. I would just \nsay that is one of the greatest financial misrepresentations ever, that \nthe President of the United States would tell the American people: \nDon't worry, elect me, I have a plan to pay down the debt. He has no \nsuch plan--nothing close to it.\n  Under the score of the Congressional Budget Office, over the next 10 \nyears, we will add $9 trillion in debt to the deficit of the United \nStates.\n  That is almost $1 trillion a year for 10 years in additional debt. It \ngoes down some in the midyears, but in years 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, the \ndeficits go up every year. That is not what I thought the President was \ntalking about or, I think, the American people thought he was talking \nabout when he said: I want a plan that will pay down the debt. I am \ngoing to raise taxes and we are going to pay down the debt and we will \nhave spending cuts also.\n  What is it we now know about his plan? This is the essence of it, as \nshown on this chart I have in the Chamber. This chart is an outline of \nthe President's deficit reduction plan. This is what the President is \nproposing to do. He started off a few weeks ago at $1.6 trillion in new \ntaxes. Now he is talking about $1.4 trillion, I understand. That is the \nlatest iteration of the tax increases: $1,400 billion in tax increases.\n  Where will that money go? Will it change the debt course of America? \nWill it put us on a sound path? Can we go home at night and say: Wow. I \nam glad they finally got their act together.\n  Let's examine what they are proposing. They are proposing to spend \nabove the BCA, Budget Control Act, limits I just talked about that we \nagreed to only 16 months ago. Those limits include the sequestration of \n$1.2 trillion in spending. Those limits are in law. The law would have \nto be changed to avoid these cuts. The President proposes to change the \nlaw and to eliminate $1,200 billion of those cuts--$1.2 trillion off \nthe table--that is 60 percent of the cuts that were agreed to when we \nraised the debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion. It would wipe out 60 percent \nof it just like that. That is new spending above the law in effect \ntoday, busting the limits I just mentioned. Busting the limits that we \nhave been successfully enforcing.\n  In addition to that, he has no funds to pay for the doc fix, also \nknown as the sustainable growth rate for doctor payments. If we do not \nfix the sustainable growth rate, physicians will have a 25 percent or \nso cut in their reimbursement rates for doing Medicare work. For many \nof them, it is half the work they do. Such a reduction could not be \ntolerated, so it has to be fixed and the President knows that. It costs \nabout $400 billion to fix it but the President provides no money for \nthat. That cost must be added to the spending in his plan.\n  The Social Security contribution holiday, or payroll holiday, is \nanother is more spending he doesn't include, that has to be accounted \nfor. If we do not pay as much into Social Security as we would \notherwise, then the U.S. Treasury has to borrow that money and put it \ninto the Social Security trust fund. People get more money in their \npaycheck but less money goes into Social Security. That is another $110 \nbillion in spending in the President's plan.\n  The Administration wants to spend $50 billion more on transportation \nand $30 billion more on an unemployment insurance extension.\n  Overall that totals $1,790 billion in new spending in the President's \nplan. Do they have any reductions in spending? Yes. They are talking \nabout $400 billion in mandatory spending reductions. Most of that, \napparently, will be reducing--maybe $300 billion of it--payments to \nproviders in Medicare and Medicaid--providers: that is your doctor and \nyour hospital--cut them some more. They were already cut deeply when \nthe President's health care law passed. Whether that will ever stick, I \nhave my doubts.\n  But let's assume it does stick. That would mean the President's plan \nresults in $1,390 billion in higher spending--$1.39 trillion. Remember \nhe wants new higher taxes of $1,400 billion. Recall, under the current \npath, under the current spending limits in the Budget Control Act, we \nare increasing the debt by $9 trillion over the next ten years. Under \nthe President's plan, whereby he raises taxes $1.4 trillion and raises \nspending $1.39 trillion, we would add to the debt $8.99 trillion. What \ndoes it mean? It means we are going to have a major tax increase and \nvirtually the same amount of new spending--no net cut in spending but a \nmajor new increase in spending of $1.39 trillion. That is a fact, and \nit is a very troubling fact.\n  I would add one more thing. I see my colleague is here. I believe the \nPresident of the United States should not lull the American people into \nbelieving that he has a plan that is going to pay down our debt or get \nus on a sound financial course. He has two goals, it seems to me: raise \ntaxes and raise spending. That is exactly what this plan does. It has \nno reform of Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid or food stamps--the \nlargest and fastest growing entitlement programs we have--no plans to \nfix any of that. He refuses to talk about that, saying anybody who \ntalks about that just does not like old people and does not care about \nAmerica.\n  We need some leadership. We need some honesty. We need a President of \nthe United States who will look the American people in the eye and \nexplain to them we are living beyond our means. We do not have the \nmoney to continue to borrow 40 cents of every $1 we spend. We cannot \ncontinue on this path, as expert after expert has warned us.\n  I will just say, I am proud that, again, today this Senate--at least \na good, solid minority--stood firm--and said: No, we are not going to \nwaive the budget. We are going to stand by the limits on spending that \nwere part of the Budget Control Act.\n  But I am not pleased how this whole process is going right now with \nSpeaker Boehner and the President. It looks like it is not likely to \nlead to any changes in our debt course. Even after raising taxes $1.4 \ntrillion, if the President had his way, we will still be on basically \nthe same debt course. How can we allow this opportunity to get away \nfrom us? We are going to raise taxes big time yet not use any of it, in \neffect,\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\nto pay down debt. The question is, will we reduce the annual deficits \nthat will average almost $1 trillion a year for the next 10 years and \nget worse in the outer years?\n  We have to deal with that. There is no escape from that. There is no \nway we can get around it. Any mature person who loves this country \nknows we have to confront it. It cannot just be done by raising taxes. \nWe are going to have to reduce spending in this country. Cutting \nspending is not going to hammer the economy. We do not have to throw \npeople in the streets, but we need a sustained effort to reduce the \ngrowth in spending in this country. If we just do that, we would \nsurprise ourselves that we could get on a sound course before too many \nyears.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8031-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8031-S8032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about \nMedicare. My esteemed colleague from Alabama just talked about Medicare \nreform. The Presiding Officer and I--all of us--pay into Medicare every \nmonth, so we are entitled to Medicare benefits when we reach age 65. \nThe fact that we are entitled to these benefits is not bad. In fact, it \nis very good for so many millions of American seniors. The fact that \nmany call it an entitlement only means we have a right to expect to get \nthe benefits we paid in for. Entitlements, in this case, should not be \na pejorative.\n  We have heard a lot about entitlement programs recently and about the \nplace of Medicare in the conversation about our Federal deficit. We \njust heard the Senator from Alabama talk about that. He said there is \nno discussion of reform of Medicare. But in these discussions sometimes \nI think a critical component is missing, which is we already reformed \nMedicare, and these reforms extended the life of Medicare by 8 years \nwhile expanding benefits for seniors.\n  During the recent campaign, as the Presiding Officer has pointed out, \nwe saw a lot of ads about the so-called $716 billion in cuts to \nMedicare and how terrible that was, is, and will be. I would like to \ntake just a few minutes to explain what these savings were, what they \nare, and what they will be.\n  The two biggest sources of the $716 billion are, one, insurance \ncompanies overcharging the government for Medicare Advantage and \nsavings in payments to hospitals.\n  First, Medicare Advantage. As the Presiding Officer knows, as people \nwatching no doubt know, seniors can choose to get their Medicare \nbenefits directly from the Medicare Program or get them through a \nprivate insurance program that gets paid by Medicare, which is called \nMedicare Advantage.\n  Before we passed the Affordable Care Act, we were overpaying those \nprivate insurers by 14 percent. These insurers were getting much more \nthan they should have based on the benefits they were providing to \nseniors. So we cut what Medicare gives to these private insurance \ncompanies. Over the next 10 years, we are going to cut these insurance \npayments by 14 percent, which CBO scored in 2010 as saving Medicare \n$136 billion over 10 years.\n  We were told by some of our colleagues that insurance companies were \ngoing to leave the market, that we were not going to have Medicare \nAdvantage anymore. So far, enrollment in Medicare Advantage has gone up \nby 11 percent. That is many billions of dollars we were able to take--\ninstead of overpaying insurance companies--to extend the life of \nMedicare.\n  Second is the lower reimbursements to hospitals. Why does this work \nout for hospitals? When we insure 31 million more people, and those 31 \nmillion people go to the emergency room, go to the hospital, the \nhospital is no longer on the line to pay for that.\n  They are not left holding the bag. Those 31 million people now have \ninsurance that pays for it. So the hospitals are now able to take lower \nreimbursements for Medicare patients. That is why it works out. So when \npeople talk about the $716 billion, this is a huge part of what they \nare talking about. It is not cuts to benefits. It is not shifting costs \nto seniors. It is streamlining the program and making it more \nefficient.\n  We took these savings and we reinvested the savings in the program. \nWe overall extended the life of Medicare by 8 years. That is \nentitlement reform, extending the life of the program. That is what we \nare talking about when we talk about reforming Medicare. That is what \nwe did. But not only that, we actually expanded benefits for seniors.\n  I go to a lot of senior centers around Minnesota, nursing homes. I \nhave to tell you seniors are very happy we expanded their benefits. \nThey are happy about the new free preventive care they get, wellness \ncheckups, colonoscopies, mammograms. They know an ounce of prevention \nis worth a pound of cure. This saves us all money and keeps people \nhealthier.\n  What else are we doing with this money in addition to expanding the \nsolvency by 8 years? We are closing the doughnut hole, the prescription \ndrug doughnut hole. I have to tell you, seniors are very happy about \nthat too. For more than one-third of seniors, for them, Social Security \nprovides more than 90 percent of their income. For one-quarter of \nelderly beneficiaries, Social Security is the sole source of retirement \nincome. So when they hit their doughnut hole, that is serious.\n  Sometimes they have to make choices between food and heat and \nmedicine. Because we are closing the doughnut hole, in many cases, \npeople do not have to make that choice anymore. This is important \nstuff. When I was running for the Senate, a nurse who worked in \nCambridge, MN, a town north of the Twin Cities, came to me and told me \nthat in the hospital she worked in very often they would admit a senior \nwho was very sick and the doctors would treat this senior and get them \nback on their feet and send them home with their prescriptions.\n  As this started happening, they would call the drug store, the \npharmacy a few days later, 1 week later, and say: Has Mrs. Johnson \nfilled these prescriptions? The pharmacist would say: No; because she \nwas in her doughnut hole. A couple weeks later, Mrs. Johnson would be \nback in the hospital. How wasteful is that? How wise? That costs a \ntremendous amount of money to our system. This is saving money. This is \nhealth care reform. This is Medicare reform. It is improving people's \nhealth and saving money at the same time. So we have increased \nbenefits. We have extended the life of Medicare. That was done as part \nof health care reform. That is Medicare reform.\n  In the election we had a discussion about this. There were a lot of \nads about it. We know what Governor Romney would have done to Medicare. \nHe said very explicitly that--and again the Presiding Officer has \nquoted this. He said very explicitly he would restore those billions \nand billions of dollars in overpayments to private insurance companies \nfor no reason, for no good effect, just so, I guess, these insurance \ncompanies could have more profit. Instead, we reinvested this money \ninto Medicare. But he would have given it to the insurance companies. \nHe would have replaced this health care law. He would have made the 8 \nyears we extended Medicare vanish. Governor Romney supported raising \nthe Medicare eligibility age. If we raise the age from 65 to 67 as he \nsuggested, that means hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of \nseniors would no longer have access to Medicare.\n  They would end up receiving Federal subsidies in the exchanges and \nsome of them would go to Medicaid. They would be--these 65- to 67-year-\nolds--by definition, older and as a population sicker than the other \npeople in the exchanges and in Medicaid. So they would make both these \nprograms more expensive.\n  They would also make Medicare more expensive because they would be \nthe youngest and least sick and be taken out. Although this sounds like \na reasonable compromise, trust me, it is a bad idea. It would cost the \nhealth care system twice as much as it would save Medicare. This is \nexactly the kind of bad idea which explains why we pay twice as much as \nother developed countries around the world for our health care and in \nmany, if not most, cases with worse outcomes.\n  Medicare reform was an issue in the campaign because we already did \nit. We extended the program by 8 years. It is not like it was a secret. \nIt was part of the conversation during the election. In the election, \nthe American people\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\nvoted to keep those reforms. As we continue this conversation about our \nfiscal future, I would love to hear from my colleagues across the aisle \nabout how they would reform Medicare, how they would expand its life by \n8 years while expanding or at least, at the very least, not cutting \nbenefits. How would they do it? Because we extended its life for 8 \nyears and increased benefits--very meaningful benefits.\n  I would ask my colleagues why, before the election--and this is the \nvery point the Presiding Officer made a few days ago on this floor--why \nthey were attacking us--incorrectly I might add, inaccurately--for \nmaking cuts in Medicare, but since the election they have been \ninsisting we make cuts to Medicare.\n  Going forward, I think we need to move from talking points to taking \na thoughtful look at policies and working together to tackle our \nNation's fiscal challenges and do it based on a little bit deeper look \nat what we have done and what the health care reform was that we passed \nin the Senate and the House, now the law of the land, what that does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8032-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8032-S8034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with the close of the 112th Congress, the \nSenate will lose its most determined champion of fiscal prudence and \nbalance, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota. Senator Conrad is best \nknown nationally for his leadership as chairman of the Committee on the \nBudget.\n  Again, that committee has limited legislative power, but that did not \nstop Senator Conrad from using that committee relentlessly for fiscal \nrestraint, for honest budgeting. As we all know, he has spent countless \nhours on the floor educating, exhorting Senators on budget issues, \ndriving home his points by displaying a seemingly endless array of \ncharts and graphs.\n  Indeed, I would note in 2001, the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration assigned Senator Conrad his own printing equipment \nbecause he was producing more charts than all his colleagues combined. \nThe other day, we had this so-called Secret Santa that Senator Franken \nhad established, where we draw names out of a hat and we exchange these \nlittle gifts. You never know who is going to give you a gift. You know \nto whom you are giving, but you do not know who is giving you a gift. \nIt turned out my gift giver was Senator Conrad.\n  So I got a nice little book. But most importantly, I got three \ncharts. They were charts from the 2008 farm bill we both worked on, and \nof which I was chairman at that time. I thought that was a great gift, \nboth to get some of his charts but the charts pertaining to a major \npiece of legislation on which both he and I had worked very closely. We \nhave been long-time colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition and Forestry. He joined that committee as a freshman Senator \nin 1987, just 2 years after I got here in 1985. We were in the midst of \nthe worst economic crisis in the farm sector since the Great \nDepression.\n  Senator Conrad left a major imprint on the Agricultural Credit Act of \n1987, advocating strongly for measures to help farm families and rural \ncommittees persevere through circumstances beyond their control, to \npreserve a family farm system of agriculture as well as to preserve \nsmall towns, the fabric of rural America. Over the years Senator Conrad \nhas been a key advocate in enacting major drought relief bills and \nother disaster assistance.\n  He has consistently fought for effective programs to protect and \nenhance farm income through the farm commodity programs and crop \ninsurance. For many years we have been allies in advancing farm bill \ninitiatives to promote renewable energy production on farms and in \nrural communities.\n  Let no one doubt that Senator Conrad has always been a relentless, \nfierce advocate for the interests of his constituents in North Dakota. \nI know Kent is very proud of a framed resolution presented to him by \nhis State's Standing Rock Sioux tribe. It bears his honorary Sioux \nname, Namni Sni, which translates as ``never turns back.'' I think that \ndescribes Kent Conrad. He never turns back.\n  Kent Conrad and I are proud of our shared roots in the upper Midwest. \nHe has been an outstanding Senator, a good friend for more than two and \none-half decades in this body.\n  I join with the entire Senate family in wishing Kent and Lucy all the \nbest in the years ahead.\n\n\n                               Dick Lugar\n\n  In these closing weeks of the 112th Congress, the Senate is saying \nfarewell to a number of retiring colleagues. One of our most poignant \nfarewells is to a Member respected and esteemed on both sides of the \naisle. I speak of Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana.\n  He is a friend, a fellow Midwesterner. But to all of us, he is much \nmore. Dick Lugar is truly a Senator's Senator. He epitomizes the very \nbest in this institution, and it is a sad commentary on the state of \nour Nation's politics that the main reason why Senator Lugar is leaving \nthe Senate is because his primary opponent attacked him for the very \nqualities we admire and need here: his readiness to forge fair and \nhonorable compromises, his insistence on putting country ahead of party \nor ideology, his enormous decency and civility.\n  As we all know, Senator Lugar has been the Senate's most passionate \nand effective advocate of arms control and nuclear nonproliferation. \nThe program he created with former Senator Sam Nunn has assisted Russia \nand other countries of the former Soviet Union to secure and dispose of \ntheir weapons of mass destruction. What an amazing accomplishment by \nSenator Lugar. I also want to salute Senator Lugar's record of \nprincipled, conscientious leadership on the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, including as chairman from 1995 to 2001.\n  He is a key author of landmark measures strengthening Federal \nagricultural conservation policies and programs, particularly in the \n1985 farm bill and succeeding farm bills.\n  He has been instrumental in strengthening--and in fighting for at \ncritical junctures--Federal nutrition assistance, including school \nlunch, breakfast, and other child nutrition programs through the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and through support for food \nbanks and other emergency food assistance. Dick Lugar has also been an \noutstanding leader in enacting Federal initiatives to research, \ndevelop, and market farm and forest commodities by converting them to \nenergy and bio-based products.\n  For me, it has been a great honor to be Senator Lugar's friend and \ncolleague for 36 years and to serve all of that time with him on the \nAgriculture Committee. Our friendship, of course, will continue, but I \nwill miss, as we all will, Senator Lugar's calm, positive, always \nconstructive influence on this body. Across 36 years of distinguished \nservice, this Senator and statesman has faithfully served the people of \nIndiana and the United States. There is no doubt that he will pursue \nnew avenues of public service in retirement.\n  So I will miss his day-to-day friendship and his counsel in the \nSenate. I wish Dick and his wonderful wife Char all the best in the \nyears ahead.\n\n\n                              Daniel Akaka\n\n  Mr. President, we are bidding farewell to one of our most respected \nand beloved Members, Senator Daniel Akaka of Hawaii or, as we all know \nhim, ``Danny.''\n  With his retirement, our friend is bringing to a close a remarkable \nand distinguished career in public service spanning nearly seven \ndecades. Having witnessed, as a 17-year-old boy, the Japanese attack on \nPearl Harbor, he took a civilian job with the Army Corps of Engineers \nbefore joining the U.S. Army in 1945. We honor him, along with his \nsenior colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, and Senator Lautenberg, \nas the only veterans of World War II still serving in the Senate.\n  Not surprisingly, Senator Akaka has been a leader on veterans issues. \nHe served as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in the \n110th and 111th Congresses, and he remained active on that committee \ndespite relinquishing his chairmanship in the current Congress in order \nto chair the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  We will not soon forget Senator Akaka's retort when another Senator \nwas holding up a package of veterans benefits, demanding that the costs \nof the veterans benefits be offset.\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\n  Senator Akaka calmly, very deliberately argued that the costs did not \nneed to be offset, stating:\n\n       The price has already been paid, many times over, by the \n     service of the brave men and women who wore our Nation's \n     uniform.\n\n  Needless to say, Senator Akaka carried the day.\n  Senator Akaka has played a leading role in demanding improvements in \nthe handling of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain \ninjuries sustained by service men and women. In 2009, he joined with \nSenator Inouye in securing compensation for Filipino veterans of World \nWar II who fought for the United States.\n  Senator Akaka is the only ethnic, Native Hawaiian to serve in this \nbody. Throughout his congressional career, including 4 years in the \nHouse and 22 years in the Senate, he has been a determined and \nimpassioned advocate for the people of his State of Hawaii. He has \nfought for legislation that would grant Federal recognition to ethnic \nNative Hawaiians, the same recognition we have granted to American \nIndians and Native Alaskans.\n  In 1993, President Clinton signed a resolution sponsored by Senator \nAkaka officially apologizing on behalf of the U.S. Government for \noverthrowing Hawaii's last monarch a century earlier.\n  In so many ways, Senator Akaka represents the Senate at its very \nbest--the Senate the way it used to be in less partisan times. He works \ntirelessly behind the scenes, and he shuns the media limelight. He \nprides himself on reaching across the aisle and forging honorable \ncompromises. He is the ultimate gentleman, and his word is his bond.\n  Across these many years Danny Akaka has been a wonderful friend and \ncolleague. Of course, that friendship will continue, and I will miss \nhim in the Senate.\n  I join with the entire Senate family in wishing Danny and Millie all \nthe best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                             Jeff Bingaman\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague from \nNew Mexico, Senator Jeff Bingaman, who is retiring from the Senate at \nthe end of this year. Senator Bingaman has been a strong voice for the \npeople of New Mexico, first as their attorney general and then during \n30 years of service in the Senate. He has brought a keen intellect and \na commonsense perspective to the Senate that should make the people of \nNew Mexico proud. He has worked to build consensus across party lines \nto help strengthen our Nation.\n  Senator Bingaman and I serve together on the Finance Committee, and \nwe also worked together on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nduring my first term in the Senate. I greatly admire the thoughtfulness \nhe applies to every issue. Throughout his career, he has focused \nintently on finding solutions to the challenges facing our country.\n  For example, in 2009, I worked closely with him and other colleagues \non the Finance Committee in crafting the health care reform bill that \nwas signed into law as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \nHe was a key author of that legislation, which has already improved \nmillions of people's lives.\n  Senator Bingaman has brought a tremendous breadth of knowledge to his \nchairmanship of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He has long \nunderstood the need to reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign energy \nand has worked diligently to push Congress to create a national energy \npolicy suited to the 21st century. That includes the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act, which helped put us on the right path by \nimproving gas mileage in the vehicles Americans drive, increasing \nproduction of domestic biofuels, and boosting energy efficiency in \nhomes and businesses across our country.\n  Senator Bingaman also understands the importance of education as a \nsource of opportunity to our people and a key investment in the ongoing \nprosperity of our country. As a member of the Senate Health Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Bingaman has worked to advance \nteacher training, student technological literacy, and boosting \ngraduation rates at underperforming schools. He also helped pass \nlegislation that increases student aid and caps Federal student loan \npayments to assist students struggling with excessive debt.\n  Senator Bingaman has been an outstanding public servant for the \npeople of New Mexico and our Nation. I will miss having him as a \ncolleague in the Senate, but I also know that his wife Anne will be \nexcited to have him back home. I wish him happiness and success in \nwhatever he chooses to do in the next chapter of his life.\n\n\n                             Olympia Snowe\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I also pay tribute to my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Olympia Snowe, who is retiring from the Senate after \n18 years of exemplary service representing the people of Maine.\n  Though thousands of miles apart, Maine and North Dakota face similar \nchallenges. In particular, we share very similar climates. Our States' \nresidents must endure long winters, and, for the most vulnerable, \nkeeping their homes warm is sometimes a challenge. Senator Snowe has \nalways understood how difficult it can be for some families to pay \ntheir utility bills and keep their heat on through harsh winters and \nhas been a tireless supporter of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram, which provides struggling families in our States with the \ncertainty of a warm home.\n  Senator Snowe's constant attention to constituent concerns have made \nher one of the most popular Senators in the Nation, and her dedication \nto her State and country has not gone unrecognized. Throughout her 37 \nyears of public service, Senator Snowe has earned many honors and \ndistinctions. In 2005, Forbes rated her as the 54th most powerful woman \nin the world. Later, in 2006, Time magazine recognized her as one of \nAmerica's Best Senators. She was also recognized as one of eight female \npoliticians that could run and be elected President of the United \nStates.\n  Senator Snowe is a true statesman and public servant, never \nhesitating to put people over politics and fiercely representing the \nvalues and needs of her constituents. Throughout all her years of \nservice, her steady resolve, moderate voice, and willingness to work \nacross the aisle have been a force in Washington. It has truly been an \nhonor working with her to find practical solutions to our Nation's most \npressing issues. In a time of partisan excess, Senator Snowe's ability \nto reach compromises with Members on both sides of the aisle was \nextremely valuable to this venerable institution. She will be sorely \nmissed.\n  I thank Senator Snowe for her service to her country in the U.S. \nSenate and wish her the very best in the future.\n\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  Mr. President, today I honor my colleague, Senator Herb Kohl, who \nwill be leaving the Senate at the end of this term. Senator Kohl has \nserved the people of Wisconsin for 24 years since first being elected \nto the Senate in 1988. Throughout his time in Congress, Senator Kohl \nhas stayed above political partisanship, while remaining true to his \nMidwest roots. He has represented the people of Wisconsin well and \nanswered to no one but the citizens of his State. When he announced his \nretirement from the Senate, he said ``The office doesn't belong to me. \nIt belongs to the people of Wisconsin, and there is something to be \nsaid for not staying in office too long.'' These words describe a \nhumble man who truly believes that it is his duty to represent the \nideals of his constituents, even in an era of political polarization.\n  Born and raised in Wisconsin, Senator Kohl is known throughout the \nSenate as a philanthropist. He had a successful career in business, \neventually purchasing the Milwaukee Bucks. Throughout his time in \nCongress, Senator Kohl has proven that he is as openminded as he is \nhonest, while continually holding on to his core principles. From \nexpanding the coverage of health care to promoting education \nadvancements, Senator Kohl's legislative history is truly impressive.\n  Wisconsin and North Dakota have a lot in common. We share a similar \nculture and geography as well as an agriculture industry that is a \ncrucial component of both our States' economies. In 2011, the National \nFarmers Union recognized Senator Kohl as a champion of dairy and \ncompetition issues. But that is only part of the story concerning \nSenator Kohl's support for\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\nfamily farmers. Senator Kohl has served as chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture. In that capacity, he has \nbeen instrumental in ensuring that the partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and rural communities contributes to economic development \nthroughout rural America. He has enhanced the conservation of our \nnatural resources and ensured the United States remains at the \nforefront in agricultural research and innovation. In addition, Senator \nKohl has been a stalwart supporter of food assistance programs for \nthose who are the least fortunate among us.\n  On a personal note, Senator Kohl recommended my wife Lucy for a \nposition with Major League Baseball. It has been my wife's dream job, \nso I am personally indebted to him for that.\n  Senator Kohl's commitment to the people of Wisconsin has been \nunwavering. The Senate will miss his honesty and hard work. I thank \nSenator Kohl for his service in the Senate and wish him the best in his \nfuture endeavors. Wisconsin should be proud of Senator Kohl, he \nremained true to his 1988 Senate campaign slogan, serving as ``Nobody's \nSenator But Yours.''\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Finally, Mr. President, I am proud today to honor my \ncolleague from Virginia, Jim Webb. In just 6 years in the Senate, he \nhas proven himself to be an agile and independent thinker on both \nmilitary matters and issues of economic fairness, as well as a tireless \nadvocate for veterans. His candid and moderate voice in the Senate will \nbe sorely missed.\n  Jim Webb has spent an impressive career working in public service and \non behalf of our veterans and active troops overseas. The importance of \ndiscipline and service to country was instilled in him as a young boy, \nas he moved with his father, a career Air Force officer, to various Air \nForce Bases across the country. A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, \nSenator Webb served as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve \nAffairs under President Reagan, as well as the U.S. Secretary of the \nNavy, before coming to the Senate in 2007.\n  Senator Webb demonstrated his unwavering commitment to our troops and \nveterans on his very first day in the Senate when he introduced the \nPost-9/11 G.I. Bill of Rights. He won passage for this important piece \nof legislation, the most comprehensive G.I. bill since World War II, in \nonly his second year as a Senator--a remarkable feat. Since its \npassage, more than 1 million post-9/11 veterans have applied to use \ntheir G.I. bill benefits. The G.I. bill has been instrumental in \nproviding a great opportunity and a demonstration of gratitude for our \ntroops as they separate from service.\n  I personally had the privilege of working closely with Senator Webb \non a bill that aims to preserve the valor of our decorated military \nheroes. I was proud to join him in introducing the Military Service \nIntegrity Act, which creates criminal penalties for individuals who lie \nabout receiving military medals for personal gain. On behalf of the \nnearly 60,000 veterans in North Dakota and all of our active troops, it \nwas an honor to work with him on this legislation in ensuring that the \nintegrity of our Nation's military awards are not belittled by those \nattempting to seek a profit.\n  But apart from his dedication to our military heroes, I also respect \nSenator Webb for his commitment to fiscal responsibility. Together with \nSenator McCaskill, he formed the US Commission on Wartime Contracting \nin Iraq and Afghanistan to analyze the efficacy and expenditures of \nFederal contractors abroad. When the findings of the Commission were \npublished, he subsequently introduced comprehensive reform legislation \nto address the failures and mismanagement of overseas contractors. As \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I deeply respect his \ninitiative and commitment to eliminating any waste, fraud, or abuse in \nour national security operations.\n  It is a deep loss for the Senate to be losing such a candid and \nindependent voice. Senator Webb has set an extraordinary example of \ndiscipline, initiative, and candor in his work on behalf of working-\nclass Americans and military families. I thank Senator Webb for his \ncareer of service in the Senate and the armed services and wish him all \nthe best.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Jimmy worked for me and has \nremained a good friend ever since.\n  Jim Jones hails from one of Las Vegas' railroad families. In 1921, \nafter Jim's father proudly served our Nation in World War I, he \npioneered West in a boxcar and not much else. Jim's father arrived in \nLas Vegas, walked into a railroad shop and stayed for 21 years. It was \non South Third Street that Jim remembers his early childhood, as he \nwatched the trains go by in his small railroad town of Las Vegas.\n  Jim has spent a lifetime working hard and giving back to his patients \nand community. His commitment to service began at the age of 12 as a \nBoy Scout in Troop 63. Jim grew interested in dentistry while a student \nat Las Vegas High School. But he knew he was unable to afford college, \nso he joined his father to work the railroad at 15. Jim tirelessly \nworked nights, weekends and summers; after graduating from Las Vegas \nHigh School, he attended East Los Angeles Junior College. During his \nsecond semester of college, he served in a Naval Reserve Unit when he \nwas called into active duty during the Korean War. Although he could \nhave applied to be exempted, he chose to serve as a dental technician \nand proudly worked on a Marine base in San Diego fixing recruits' teeth \nbefore they would head overseas. He later attended BYU's pre-dental/\nmedicine program and graduated with honors from dental school in \nSeattle.\n  He returned to Las Vegas to work for the Nevada State Department of \nHealth's Dental Division, which led him all across Indian country in \nNevada. He traveled with a fold up chair in a station wagon across the \nmost rural parts of Nevada providing dental care and services to Native \nAmerican children in Schurz, Gabbs, Tonopah, Overton and Mesquite. The \ntime he spent in Native American communities across Nevada taught him \nmuch about our State, and its first people, and because of this formed \nlongtime friendships.\n  In 1961, Jim opened his private dental practice, thus beginning a \nlong career of providing dental care to many in Southern Nevada. He \nretired from his full-time practice in 2002, though he still works \nweekly caring for patients including Landra and me. He's lived a life \nof service as a longtime member of service organizations like Kiwanis \nClub and Rotary. He served in the leadership of Rotary as director, \nvice president, and president. He is passionate about Las Vegas, and he \nhas remained involved in these service organizations, as well as in \nlocal commissions.\n  Mr. President, I share only but a glance at Jim's life as we reflect \nupon his many contributions on the momentous occasion of his 80th \nbirthday. My friend, Jim, embodies the story of Nevada, that the son of \na working class man can build a good life for his family and still have \nlegacy of that small railroad town, Las Vegas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8034-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING DR.

Mr. President, a week ago, I came to the Senate floor and \nsaid it was time for the Senate and the\n\n[[Page S8035]]\n\nHouse to come together to pass the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act. I expressed hope because I thought there was a \nbasis for compromise on a provision that had been a sticking point for \nHouse Republicans. I am dismayed that we have not seen progress toward \nthat compromise despite my outreach and the urgency of the situations \nfor thousands of victims of domestic and sexual violence.\n  Senator Crapo and I included in our bill a key provision to allow \ntribal courts limited jurisdiction to consider domestic violence \noffenses committed against Indian women on tribal lands by non-Indians. \nThe epidemic of violence against Native women is appalling, with a \nrecent study finding that almost three in five Native women have been \nassaulted by their spouses or intimate partners. This provision would \nhelp end an untenable situation where non-Indians assaulting their \nspouses or intimate partners on tribal land are essentially immune from \nprosecution.\n  This is a commonsense proposal with important limitations and \nguarantees of rights, but I know that House Republicans have continued \nto object to it. That is why I was heartened when two conservative \nHouse Republicans with leadership positions introduced a bill providing \na compromise on the tribal jurisdiction provision.\n  Representative Issa of California and Representative Cole of Oklahoma \nintroduced the Violence Against Indian Women Act, H.R. 6625. Their \ncosponsors include Republicans from North Carolina, Minnesota, and \nIdaho. They all have tribes within their States and are concerned about \nthe violence our Senate bill is trying to combat. Their bill includes a \nprovision that allows defendants to remove a case to Federal court if \nany defendant's rights are violated. This modification should ensure \nthat only those tribes that are following the requirements of the law \nand providing full rights can exercise jurisdiction and that defendants \ncan raise challenges at the beginning of a case.\n  Last week, I called on House Republican leadership to abandon their \n``just say no'' approach to any grant of tribal jurisdiction and give \nserious consideration to the Republican compromise proposal introduced \nlast week. I have heard that Republican leaders are meeting today to \nfinally discuss the issue. It is my hope that they will show real \nleadership by supporting crucial protections for tribal women, rather \nthan offering empty proposals that do not change existing law and will \nnot move us forward or help us to address this crisis.\n  I have reached out to House leaders throughout the year and very \nrecently to find a path forward on VAWA, and I know others have \nconducted similar outreach. While I am very disappointed that I have \nyet to see meaningful movement despite the opportunity for reasonable, \nbipartisan compromise to enact this needed legislation, I do believe \nHouse leaders still have an opportunity to do the right thing and pass \nVAWA, but that window is closing.\n  Passing the Leahy-Crapo VAWA bill will make a difference. It will \nlead to a greater focus on the too often neglected problem of sexual \nassault and rape. It will lead to important new programs to identify \nhigh risk cases and prevent domestic violence homicides. It will lead \nto better protections for students on campuses across the country and \nbetter housing protections for victims of domestic and sexual violence. \nThese improvements are most meaningful if they apply to all victims. I \nam willing to explore compromise language to make progress, but we \nshould not leave out the most vulnerable victims.\n  As partisan objections continue to hold up this bill, we continue to \nread each week about new and horrific cases of domestic violence and \nrape. It is heartbreaking that women continue to suffer as our efforts \nto compromise and pass this crucial legislation hit roadblock after \nroadblock. I hope that our last ditch effort will finally break this \nfrustrating impasse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8035-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the end of this Congress quickly \napproaches, I urge the Senate--Republicans, Democrats, and \nIndependents--to come together and pass our bipartisan Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act.\n  More than a century after the Emancipation Proclamation and despite \nthe fact that slavery is now illegal everywhere in the world, modern-\nday slavery, or human trafficking, still occurs throughout the world--\nincluding in the United States of America. The Polaris Project \nestimates that there are more than 27 million victims of human \ntrafficking worldwide today. To put that in perspective, that is more \npeople than the population of Texas.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act is a \nbipartisan bill that was carefully crafted with the input of victims \nand service providers to reflect critical improvements to existing law. \nI have worked hard to try to address concerns expressed by Republican \nSenators and to ensure bipartisan support for this legislation, which \nCongress has reauthorized three times before. The result is that our \ncurrent bill, which was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nmore than a year ago, now has 54 cosponsors--including 14 Republicans.\n  This bipartisan legislation seeks to stop human trafficking at its \nroots by supporting international and domestic efforts to fight against \nthe causes and punish the perpetrators of trafficking. It also provides \ncritical resources to help support victims as they rebuild their lives. \nWe have included new accountability measures to ensure that Federal \nfunds are used for their intended purposes, and we have streamlined \nprograms to focus scarce resources on the approaches that have been the \nmost successful.\n  Earlier this week, several Senators spoke on the floor of the Senate \nin commemoration of Human Rights Day. I was pleased to see that Senator \nRubio, with whom I have worked on this issue, mentioned the need to \npass our anti-trafficking bill by the end of the year. We agree that it \nis imperative for the Senate to act now so that we can take steps \ntoward ending human trafficking and providing the survivors with the \nsupport they desperately need in order to get back on their feet.\n  I have checked with my caucus to see if we can move this bill today. \nI can report that every Democratic Senator has agreed to pass this \nlegislation now by unanimous consent. I hope my friends on the other \nside of the aisle will join us to pass the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act without further delay.\n  This is the type of bipartisan bill about an urgent human rights \nissue that should pass by unanimous consent. I hope we can work \ntogether TODAY to make that happen.\n  The United States remains a beacon of hope for so many who face human \nrights abuses. We know that young women and girls--often just 11, 12, \nor 13 years old--are being bought and sold. We know that workers are \nbeing held and forced into labor against their will. No one should \nfurther delay action while these injustices continue. I am calling on \nCongress to do the right thing and enact the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act before the end of this year. Millions of \npeople around the world are counting on us and they cannot wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8035-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8035-S8036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NEWEST UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last Friday, December 7, 2012, the new \nUnited States Courthouse in Cedar Rapids, IA was dedicated. This \nfacility was built to replace the previous courthouse, built in 1932, \nthat was closed due to the extensive flood damage that occurred in June \n2008.\n  The new courthouse has five courtrooms and associated facilities for \nthe United States Courts operations and also houses a number of Federal \nGovernment agencies. Groundbreaking took place in April 2009. The new \ncourthouse opened to the public on November 5. It is my understanding \nthe courthouse was completed within budget and on time.\n  At the dedication ceremony last week, the keynote address was \ndelivered by the Honorable David R. Hansen, Senior United States \nCircuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth \nCircuit. I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8036]]\n\n\n       Chief Judge Reade, Senator Grassley, Senator Harkin, \n     Distinguished Members of the Federal and State Judiciaries, \n     Mayor Corbett, Honored Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:\n       May It Please The Court:\n       We gather today to dedicate this, the newest United States \n     Courthouse in these United States of America. It stands as a \n     fitting testament to the Federal Government's Design \n     Excellence program which employs the Nation's leading \n     architects and designers to design the country's newest \n     federal public buildings. In our case those professionals \n     were William Rawn and Associates of Boston and OPN Architects \n     of Cedar Rapids, and they have produced, with the excellent \n     efforts of the Ryan Companies this beautiful, eye-catching, \n     and awe-inspiring structure to house the components of the \n     United States District Court for the Northern District of \n     Iowa. The Northern District is composed of the northernmost \n     fifty-two counties in this state, with the dividing line \n     between the Northern and Southern districts basically along \n     Highway Thirty. The best news is that it was done on time and \n     within the budget.\n       Fifty years ago there were six Congressionally authorized \n     federal court points across this district. They were in \n     Dubuque, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, Mason City, Fort Dodge, and \n     Sioux City. Not one of them was a stand-alone United States \n     Courthouse. All of them were buildings which principally \n     housed the United States Post Office for that city and \n     provided space for a courtroom and a judge's chambers, \n     usually on the second floor, along with some jury space. \n     Other non-court federal agencies were housed there too, and \n     they were really federal buildings. The players in the \n     federal court system had been and were scattered across the \n     district as well, with the Clerk of Court in Dubuque, the \n     Bankruptcy Referee in Fort Dodge, the United States Marshal \n     in Dubuque; and the Probation Office in Waterloo. The United \n     States Attorney was at times in Dubuque, Cedar Rapids, \n     Waterloo, Mason City, Fort Dodge, and Sioux City. Over the \n     years, and principally because of Judge Edward J. McManus's \n     initiatives, the various court functions were centralized \n     here in Cedar Rapids (for the eastern two-thirds of the \n     district) and in Sioux City for the Western Division.\n       The centralization meant that the United States Post Office \n     and Federal Building at 101 First Street SE, now City Hall, \n     here in Cedar Rapids, soon became way too small for the Court \n     and its offices, and we began our efforts to build a new \n     courthouse to bring the Federal Court family under a single \n     roof. It has taken more than twenty years' time, and a \n     monumental flood to make this United States Courthouse a \n     reality. It is also a reality because of the untiring efforts \n     of the entire Iowa Congressional delegation to make it so, \n     and of the unwavering support of this city's leaders, both \n     public and private, for which the Courts are very grateful.\n       But what is a courthouse? Or more specifically, what \n     attributes should a United States Courthouse have? Surely, as \n     you can easily discern, a courthouse is stone and steel, \n     glass and polished wood, art and architecture, pleasing lines \n     and soaring columns. But it is all those things combined to \n     inspire those who view it, those who work within it, and \n     those who are called to it, to the pursuit of the most lofty \n     goal of our democratic society--the attainment of justice for \n     all. As the ancient writer in the Old Testament enjoined his \n     readers--``Justice, Justice Thou Shalt Pursue.''\n       But it is not justice, in some raw or abstract sense, that \n     is to be pursued in this United States Courthouse: It is as \n     the inscription supporting the pediment of the United States \n     Supreme Court Building in Washington proclaims--It is Equal \n     Justice Under Law--that is, justice based on an equality of \n     treatment for those who seek it here, arrived at by applying \n     the Rule of Law. It is a justice based upon our First \n     Principles as outlined in the Declaration of Independence and \n     our Constitution. It is a justice arrived at by employing the \n     statutory laws, both Federal and State, that our \n     democratically elected representatives pass and our \n     presidents and governors approve, all of them acting in the \n     good faith pursuit of justice. It is a justice obtained by \n     the systematic weighing of the merits of each seeker's claim \n     to justice, pursuant to regularly established rules of \n     procedure by experienced and highly trained judges and well-\n     intentioned juries of the seeker's peers, together with the \n     assistance of able lawyers, all of whom have sworn an oath to \n     administer justice equally and to serve the rich and poor \n     alike. Oftentimes the line between justice and injustice is \n     not a bright one. Statues of Lady Justice are abundant--they \n     always show her holding a balance scale. Sometimes the scales \n     are shown to be evenly balanced and sometimes they are out of \n     balance.\n       Those who come here seeking justice for themselves will \n     sometimes leave disappointed, and they will go away mumbling \n     that ``Justice was not done'' when they really mean ``I \n     didn't win'': But because one didn't win doesn't mean that \n     justice under the Rule of Law wasn't administered in the \n     process of deciding their claim to it. The justice to be \n     obtained in this building is one informed by the law, based \n     on human reason, and guided by ancient precepts and common \n     sense. It is not an arbitrary judgment, nor is it dispensed \n     at the whim of the one who has the power to dispense it, be \n     it judge or jury.\n       Administering justice under law admits of no caprice and \n     permits no whimsy. In order to be true to its purpose, it is \n     to the tireless pursuit of justice that this building must be \n     dedicated.\n       In his 1951 Requiem For A Nun, the American novelist \n     William Faulker described the courthouse in his fictional \n     Yoknapatawpha County this way:\n       ``But above all, the courthouse: The center, the focus, the \n     hub, sitting looming in the center of the the county's \n     circumference like a single cloud in its ring of horizon; \n     laying its vast shadow to the uttermost rim of horizon; \n     musing, brooding, symbolic and ponderable, tall as cloud, \n     solid as rock, dominating all; protector of the weak, \n     judicate and curb of the passions and lusts, repository and \n     guardian of the aspirations and hopes''\n       Much of that description can be used to describe this real \n     courthouse. It is the center, the hub, the focus of the Third \n     Branch of government, the Judiciary, and of those who have \n     business with it. It is symbolic of the majesty and grace of \n     the law. It is nearly tall as cloud, solid as the tons of \n     rock used to build it, and it may be seen by some as rather \n     dominating in its appearance. It is emblematic of the trust \n     and confidence the people of the United States place in the \n     enduring National Government Lincoln described--``a \n     government of the people, by the people and for the people.''\n       But it is more than it appears to be--it is more than the \n     transcendent qualities it evokes when first seen. It is the \n     place where the rights of all citizens are protected, where \n     the passions of the majority are tempered by overarching \n     fundamental principles, and as Faulkner wrote, it is a place \n     where citizens with hopes and aspirations can repair for \n     redress.\n       This courthouse is all those things and more. The ``more'' \n     is a goal that those of us who helped design it made clear at \n     the outset--it had to be as transparent as possible. It was \n     to be neither a castle on a hill nor a fortress of thick, \n     impenetrable walls. Rather than Faulkner's brooding and \n     formidable structure, we wanted one that, while imposing, was \n     also open and inviting. We wanted the citizens to be able to \n     see into the building, to see through it. As you approach the \n     entry, coming down First Street, you can easily see, behind \n     the glass wall, the entrances to each of the courtrooms. Once \n     inside, you can appreciate the abundance of natural light \n     everywhere. Every courtroom, every public space is filled \n     with it. This is not a dark place, where the forces of evil \n     can find repose. It has been purposely designed so that \n     natural sunshine will light the way of all who enter its \n     doors, of all who seek the truths to be found here, and of \n     all who engage in the never ending pursuit of justice to \n     which it is dedicated.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8036-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8036-S8037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FHA EMERGENCY FISCAL SOLVENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to encourage \nmy colleagues to pass the FHA, Emergency Fiscal Solvency Act, H.R. \n4264.\n  Since 1934, the FHA has been helping stabilize the mortgage market by \nensuring that qualified low-to-moderate income and first-time home \nbuyers have access to mortgage credit. Since the beginning of the \nfinancial crisis, the FHA increased its market share from below 5 \npercent in 2006 to approximately 30 percent at its peak volume in 2009 \nin pursuit of that mission. This counter-cyclical expansion was \nessential to the mortgage market--especially for first-time homebuyers \nwho comprised 78 percent of the single-family purchase loans insured by \nthe FHA in 2011. According to Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody's \nAnalytics, without the FHA's counter-cyclical support, and I quote, \n``the housing market would have cratered, taking the economy with it.''\n  However, the FHA is now facing a potential crisis of its own--but \nthis time we have the opportunity to act. On December 6, I held a \nhearing in the Banking Committee entitled Oversight of FHA: Examining \nHUD's Response to Fiscal Challenges. Through the course of the hearing, \nHUD Secretary Shaun Donovan described how loans made from 2000 to \n2009--and especially those loans made at the height of the mortgage \ncrisis from 2007-2009 before the ban on seller-funded downpayments took \neffect--were weighing heavily on the FHA's finances. As I stated in the \nhearing, I am very concerned about the FHA's condition and will not \nhesitate to take action to prevent the FHA from needing taxpayer \nsupport.\n  This is only an immediate first step. I fully intend to engage my \ncolleagues on and off the Banking Committee to find bipartisan \nconsensus to provide the FHA with the additional authorities Secretary \nDonovan described during our hearing and address any technical fixes to \nthis language. While this bill is not perfect and the path forward will \nnot be easy, it is essential that we come together to protect taxpayers \nand this essential program.\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8037-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GREAT APE PROTECTION AND COST SAVING ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, consistent with Senate standing orders and \nmy policy of publishing in the Congressional Record a statement \nwhenever I place a hold on legislation, I am announcing my intention to \nobject to any unanimous consent request to proceed to and pass S. 810, \nthe Great Ape Protection and Cost Saving Act.\n  Oregon is home to one of the eight National Institutes of Health, \nNIH-supported National Primate Research Centers, and it is already \nsubject to strong local and national oversight to ensure the highest \nquality and ethical care for animals. These Centers provide outstanding \nresearch and powerful research tools that are vital to our \nunderstanding of human health and disease and hold enormous potential \nfor finding treatments for life-threatening disorders.\n  While ensuring the highest quality and ethical care for animals is of \nutmost importance, there is already significant oversight and \nregulation of these facilities.\n  In addition to meeting the high standards required by NIH to obtain \nand retain Federal health research dollars, centers are also already \nresponsible for meeting the lengthy, detailed and often-updated Federal \nrequirements within the Animal Welfare Act. Facilities are subject to \nthorough, regular, and unannounced inspections by U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services and are \nsubject to regulations from the Public Health Service, PHS, and Food \nand Drug Administration, FDA. Experiments must also be approved by the \nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee, IACUC, at the Institution \nwhere the scientist works before research can begin.\n  While I support protecting animals from unethical and inhumane \ntreatment, the NIH is in the process of reviewing and implementing \nrelated recommendations from the Institute of Medicine. At this stage, \npassing legislation would circumvent this ongoing process. For this \nreason, I object to the Senate taking up and passing S. 810.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8037-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO 405TH CIVIL AFFAIRS BATTALION\n\n  Mr. HELLER.

Each and every day of their tour, this company faced \ndangerous situations in order to our protect freedom and democracy. \nParticipating in missions to some of the most volatile provinces of \neastern Afghanistan, they encountered deadly firefights and roadside \nbombs. This company's courageous acts have been awarded with 5 Purple \nHeart medals, 18 Army Commendation medals, and 7 Bronze Star medals for \nmeritorious service. These decorated soldiers have made significant \nsacrifices for our country, and I am so grateful they have the \nopportunity to return home to their families.\n  The brave men and women in our Armed Forces have made grave \nsacrifices on behalf of our Nation and we owe them a debt of gratitude. \nThe families of our troops also deserve our heartfelt appreciation for \ntheir unwavering strength and support.\n  I wish these soldiers a joyful homecoming this weekend and happy \nholiday season with their loved ones.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate a father \nand son team and their family from Westport, CT, whose company, Tea \nImporters, Inc., was recently recognized by Secretary of State Hillary \nRodham Clinton with the 2012 Award for Corporate Excellence.\n  Every year, the Secretary of State honors two American owned, global \ncompanies, that are both successful and humanitarian. They are \ncompanies doing well and doing good. This year, Joseph and Andrew \nWertheim of Tea Importers, Inc. were celebrated as international \nleaders of fair trade standards, democratic principles, and diplomacy \nin the small-medium sized category. Intel Corporation received this \nyear's award in the large business category.\n  After escaping from Nazi Germany, Joseph Wertheim settled in \nConnecticut and began importing tea in 1953. Since then, he has grown \nhis company and forged strong ties with customer tea companies in the \nUnited States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 1960, he \nbegan working to market and import tea from Rwanda, and developed a \nparticularly strong relationship with the Government of Rwanda, who \nrequested that Mr. Wertheim partner with them in building a tea \nprocessing factory. What started as the first facility in a remote area \nin Kigali, Rwanda, has grown into the largest single producer of tea in \nthe entire African nation.\n  This tea factory named Sorwathe has helped the people of Rwanda make \nremarkable progress. Sorwathe ensures equal working conditions for its \n5,242 employees, guided by the principle that every small farmer is a \nstake holder. In addition, Sorwathe has assisted the Government of \nRwanda in building roads, bringing in water, and working with the USAID \nto start schools and medical clinics. The Wertheims and Tea Importers \nhave worked with Rotary International to teach literacy to at least \n15,000 adults, fund the town's public library, and provide high school \nscholarships. Their efforts have helped to ban child labor and \nfacilitate collective bargaining agreements. Sorwathe has implemented \nenvironmentally sustainable agricultural practices, and organic \nfarming, and formed alliances with important organizations in support \nof these efforts, to include the Rainforest Alliance and Ethical Tea \nPartnership. These accomplishments give you a sense of the spirit that \nguides this company that is financially successful, environmental \nconscious, and socially aware.\n  This small business of only six domestic employee in Westport has \nfurthered American diplomacy around the world. As Secretary of State \nClinton said in her address at last month's awards ceremonies, our \nbusinesses operating abroad are ``how millions and millions of people \nfind out about our values, what we really stand for, what kind of \npeople we are.'' I saw firsthand this spirit of inclusivity when I \nattended this awards ceremony. Video conferencing was set up to include \nboth employees of Sorwathe and members of Intel's office in Vietnam \ninviting all members of those innovative ventures to be congratulated \nand acknowledged.\n  I congratulate Joseph and Andrew Wertheim and all employees of Tea \nImporters, Inc. and Sorwathe in this well-deserved award, which \nhighlights how a family-owned business can make an enormous impact on a \nglobal scale.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8037-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8037-S8038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO C.W. FLOYD\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I would like to honor C.W. \nFloyd, Vietnam veteran, skeet-shooting champion, advocate for \nservicemembers everywhere, friend, and one of my longtime staff. On \nDecember 22, 2012, C.W. will retire after more than 30 years of service \nin and to the military. Although his retirement is much deserved, his \nabsence will leave a void that will be hard to fill. In our extensive \nsearch to find a replacement for him, it has become clear that finding \nan ever-smiling, gun-collecting war veteran who provides the office \nwith doughnuts is no easy task.\n  Mr. Floyd gave the U.S. Army 22 years of service, including a tour of\n\n[[Page S8038]]\n\nduty in the Vietnam war. From 1979 through 1985, he served as a member \nof the Alaska Army National Guard. Those years with the U.S. Army would \nhave been commendable and worthy of thanks in and of themselves, but it \nis actually the work that C.W. has done since retiring from the Army \nthat sets him apart and needs to be honored. Since his Army retirement, \nMr. Floyd has lived and worked to help Alaska's military members at \nevery level. He was appointed the municipality of Anchorage's first \nmilitary and veterans liaison and was then hired on as special \nassistant to the Senator in Veteran and Military Affairs. During his \ntime in the U.S. Senate office, Mr. Floyd helped to pass legislation to \ngain Federal pension and benefits for members of the Alaska Territorial \nGuard who served during WWII but were overlooked because Alaska was not \nyet a state when they were active.\n  C.W. Floyd not only works professionally for veterans and military \nmembers, he also volunteers his own time to support the cause. He spent \n15 years on the Alaska Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve \nCommittee and works as an organizer and volunteer for Alaska Operation \nSTANDOWN, a program advocating for and supporting homeless veterans. \nC.W. was named Civilian Volunteer of the Year by the Armed Services \nYMCA of Alaska and was also honored with the Patrick Henry Award, which \nprovides recognition to local officials and civic leaders who \ndistinguish themselves with outstanding and exceptional service to the \nArmed Forces of the United States, the National Guard, or the National \nGuard Association of the United States. The Patrick Henry Award states, \n``Mr. Floyd is an inspirational role model for selfless service in \nsupport of our total Homeland Security Team and the National Guard of \nthe United States.''\n  Besides providing doughnuts for the Senate office and championing for \nthe rights of veterans, C.W. has a full and happy personal life. He has \nbeen in love with his wife Elaine for 28 years and plans to turn her \ninto a California snowbird when they are both officially retired. They \nhave raised three wonderful men, Chuck, Travis, and Curtis, and are \nhappily watching as their sons repopulate the Earth with girl babies. I \nam guessing that the sales of powder pink guns will skyrocket as C.W. \nwelcomes each granddaughter into the world. He is a lifetime NRA, \nNational Skeet Shooting Association, Alaska Gun Collectors Association, \nand Alaska Veterans Museum member.\n  C.W. is a shining example of all that our country has to offer and \nall that we can be. He has a smile and wise words of advice for anyone \nwho walks into our office looking for assistance with veterans or \nmilitary issues. No problem is too small or too big for C.W. to give \nattention to. My staff and I have witnessed him helping thousands of \nservicemembers, and I know that there are thousands more we did not \nwitness. It should also be mentioned that his personal experiences and \nhis articulate nature provide a voice that can explain veterans issues \nto those of us who do not know what it is like. In this way, he has \neducated all those who have ever had the chance to speak to him. His \nimpact on the lives of U.S. veterans is far-reaching and immeasurable.\n  Let history remember C.W. Floyd as one of our Nation's true \nheroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8038-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DON JACKSON\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Today I wish to commend the career of a man who \nhas devoted his entire life to agriculture. After more than 35 years \nserving in various leadership capacities in the U.S. poultry and \nagricultural industries, Dr. Don Jackson, president and chief executive \nofficer of JBS USA, is retiring.\n  Don's agricultural career arguably began in the early 1950s on his \nfather's ranch in Phoenix, AZ. Don, the fifth out of seven children, \nwas one heck of a high school football athlete--securing a game-\nclinching interception in the State semifinal game and helping to lead \nhis team to the State championship in his senior year.\n  Don studied as an undergraduate at Arizona State University and then \nmoved to Colorado State University, where he graduated in 1978 with a \nmaster's degree and Ph.D. in animal science.\n  Don officially began his career in agriculture as a nutritionist in \nthe feed and poultry division of Central Soya. When the company's \npoultry division was sold to Seaboard, Don remained with the \norganization, serving in several operational and executive roles. From \n1996 to 2000, Don served as Seaboard's chief executive officer.\n  In 2000, ConAgra acquired Seaboard's poultry division and Don moved \nto Foster Farms, where he served as president for 8 years. In late \n2008, Pilgrim's Pride Corporation called on Don to serve as chief \nexecutive officer and lead the company out of bankruptcy.\n  In December 2009, Don helped successfully negotiate the sale of a \ncontrolling interest in Pilgrim's Pride to JBS USA, and a short year \nlater, Don was selected as president and chief executive officer of JBS \nUSA, a leading processor of U.S. beef, pork, poultry, and lamb and \nAustralian beef and lamb.\n  Don has been married to his high school sweetheart, Teresa, for 41 \nyears, and they are the proud parents of six children who have given \nthem seven beautiful grandchildren. For the past 28 years, Don has \ncalled Athens and Atlanta, GA, home, and he passionately roots for the \nAtlanta Braves and the University of Georgia Bulldogs.\n  I commend Don for his years of service and congratulate him on an \nincredibly successful career. American agriculture has benefitted from \nhis passion, energy, wisdom, and humor, and I am proud to call him a \nGeorgian. We wish Don well as he embarks on his well-deserved \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8038-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8038-S8039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION WEEK\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of \nComputer Science Education Week, which started on Sunday, December 9, \n2012, and continues through Saturday, December 15, 2012. This week long \ncelebration is an opportunity for educators and students to participate \nin activities that will elevate computer science education at all \nlevels. The date for Computer Science Week honors Grace Murray Hopper, \nwho was born on December 9, 1906, and who pioneered new programming \nlanguages and standards for computer systems that laid the foundation \nfor many subsequent advances in computer science. In my home State of \nPennsylvania and across the Nation, this annual celebration helps to \nspark interest in a subject of critical importance to our economy now \nand in the future.\n  Computers touch nearly every corner of our economy and mastery of \ncomputer science is a valuable skill set for jobseekers. According to \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be 9.2 million jobs in the \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM, fields by the \nyear 2020. Half of these jobs, or 4.6 million, will be in computing. \nThat is one in every two STEM jobs.\n  Unfortunately, not enough high school students are mastering these \nSTEM subjects. According to the College Board, in 2011, 3.4 million \nadvanced placement exams were administered to high school students. \nFewer than 1 million of these exams tested a STEM subject. Only about \n20,000 of these exams were in the subject of computer science, \naccounting for 2 percent of the total science exams and 1 percent of \nall AP exams administered last year. Of even greater concern, only \n4,000 females took this AP exam. Our policies, schools, and education \nsystems must respond to the demand for a larger, more diverse computing \ntalent pipeline. Computer Science Education Week brings attention to \nthese issues and builds enthusiasm for potential solutions.\n  In Pennsylvania, computer science educators and supporters have \nplanned a number of events to observe Computer Science Week. At a high \nschool outside of Philadelphia, ninth graders are converting room \nnumbers to binary representation and relabeling the classrooms in their \nschool. Springfield will further host an event for students, families, \nand community members to present information about that district's \nupcoming computer science curriculum, as well as hold an exposition of \nstudent projects. For the third consecutive year, students from \nHaverford and Bryn Mawr Colleges will present\n\n[[Page S8039]]\n\ntheir summer and senior work in computing. At Villanova University, \ncomputer science projects and computer scientists are being showcased \nat the library all month. Drexel University will host a series of \nevents that honor computer science's contribution to society and raise \nawareness of its importance in education, economic growth, and \ntechnological innovations.\n  The inclusion of computer science in K-12 education is of vital \nimportance to prepare students for work in this field and to access \nemerging available jobs. Earlier this Congress, I was pleased to \nintroduce S. 1614, the Computer Science Education Act, which would \nstrengthen computer science education in elementary schools and high \nschools. The Computer Science Education Act would help to ensure that \nAmerican students not only use technology in school but also learn the \ntechnical computing skills needed to grow our economy and invent the \ntechnology that will drive our economic future. Technology firms and \nbackers of computer science education in Pennsylvania and elsewhere \nstrongly support this legislation as a necessary investment in our \nfuture economic competitiveness.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these issues. America \nsimply cannot afford to continue wasting talent and opportunities in \nthe computing field. This Computer Science Education Week, I applaud \nthe efforts of educators, students, and activities organizers who are \nshowcasing the importance of this subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8039-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES E. HOGGE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate James \nE. Hogge on his upcoming retirement from serving as State director of \nthe Idaho Small Business Development Center, SBDC, and recognize his \nremarkable career.\n  As State director of the Idaho SBDC for nearly 18 years, Jim has led \nthe center with distinction and helped shape it into a highly regarded \nresource for small business consulting and training. He has provided \nstrategic planning and financial and programmatic oversight and guided \nthe center through challenges, including limited budgets. During his \ntime leading the center, the Idaho SBDC was one of the first SBDCs in \nthe country to be accredited and has received the highest accreditation \npossible in the past two reviews. The Idaho SBDC has also been in the \ntop 10 percent of SBDCs in the country based on productivity and \nimpact, which includes the growth of sales and jobs, capital raised, \nand return on investment.\n  Jim recognizes the immense value of partnerships in assisting \nbusinesses and has worked to utilize the expertise of individuals and \norganizations for the benefit of the entrepreneurs and businesses \nseeking assistance and all those involved in the partnerships. Some of \nhis collaborative achievements during his time as State director \ninclude the development of a partnership with Boise State University, \nthe University of Idaho, and Idaho State University to help Idaho's \nmanufacturers increase their sales and reduce costs. Jim also planned \nand developed funding for the Technology and Entrepreneurial Center at \nBoise State University. Additionally, he developed collaborative \nprojects with the University of Idaho Law School, the Idaho National \nLaboratory, the city of Boise, the Idaho Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, \nZions Bank, and the U.S. Forest Service.\n  Prior to his work at the Idaho SBDC, Jim spent 20 years serving our \nNation in the U.S. Air Force as a weapons systems operator in F-111 and \nEF-111 aircraft. He has also provided significant service to the \ncommunity and Nation through volunteering and serving on various local \nand national boards. This includes his service on the board of the \nAssociation of Small Business Development Centers, ASBDC, and his \nservice as ASBDC Accreditation chair. He also served on the board of \ndirectors for Drug Free Idaho and the Idaho GemStars and was a founding \nboard member for the Idaho Non-Profit Center. In addition, he was \nappointed to the Governor's Rural Task Force to help develop long-term \nstrategies to help Idaho's rural communities, and he served on the \nCriminal Justice Council and as president of the Boise Sunrise Rotary \nClub.\n  Outstanding service has been the hallmark of Jim's career. I \ncongratulate Jim on his many successes and thank him for his service to \nthe community, State and Nation. I wish him a very happy \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8039-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO FRANCIS J. BUTTERFIELD\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish today to commemorate Francis \nJames Butterfield's 92nd birthday and pay tribute to his remarkable \nlife.\n  Francis, who was born on November 2, 1920, to Millard E. and Margaret \nC. Payne Butterfield in Franklin County, NE, has led a positive life of \ndedicated service. His devotion to his country started early. His \nmother was active in the women's suffrage movement and looked forward \nto voting for the first time. Margaret was in labor with Francis on \nelection day and braved the labor pains to cast her ballot before \ngiving birth to Francis. As Francis describes it, ``So, that's how I \ngot here--my Mom voted first, then she went home and had me.''\n  This dedication and resolve runs deep in Francis. He grew up during \nthe Great Depression in a happy, resourceful, and grateful family \ndespite the challenges. He helped with his two brothers' mechanic \noperation and worked retail sales before volunteering for the U.S. Army \nin 1942. He completed Officer Candidate School and served in the \nPacific Theater during World War II. He was assigned to an Amphibian \nTractor Battalion that served in Okinawa. He also served as a Tank \nDestroyer Unit commander and rose to the rank of captain before his \nhonorable discharge from Active Duty in 1946. The military honors he \nearned for his service to our Nation include the American Theater \nService Medal, Asiatic Pacific Service Medal, and World War II Victory \nMedal. He continued to serve in the U.S. Army Reserves until his \nhonorable discharge from Reserve service in 1953.\n  On October 18, 1959, Francis married Doris Jo Runge, and they were \nblessed with two daughters: Georgia Jo and Virginia Jo. Francis had a \n23-year career with the U.S. Postal Service. He served as a mail \ncarrier, and he walked 25-30 miles per day delivering mail in Sidney, \nNE. Since Doris' passing in 1998, Francis spends time traveling to \nvisit his family, including his daughters and granddaughter, Aleah. His \ndaughters keep him busy fixing things, and he also enjoys shopping.\n  Francis is a positive, outgoing, friendly, and patriotic American. He \nis a problem solver with a ``can do'' spirit who does not let \nchallenges get in his way. I commend him for his example of optimism \nand devotion and wish him great happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8039-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8039-S8040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO SOUTH DAKOTA NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today, on the \n376th birthday of the National Guard, I wish to honor all those who \nhave served in the National Guard and to pay tribute to the South \nDakota National Guard, which this year celebrates its 150th \nanniversary. The South Dakota National Guard has served in every major \nAmerican conflict since the Civil War, in addition to helping countless \ncommunities recover from natural disasters and other emergencies. This \nJune, South Dakotans participated in celebrations across the State to \ncommemorate the Guard's important milestone.\n  The history of the South Dakota National Guard dates back to the \nearly days of the Dakota Territory. On January 27, 1862, the Guard \nfirst formed in Yankton, SD, to protect settlers in the fledgling \nterritory. Since that time, the South Dakota National Guard has served \nour Nation in every major conflict, sending units to the Spanish-\nAmerican War, World Wars I and II, and Operations Just Cause and Desert \nStorm. The Guard has also been called to aid in our country's military \nefforts during the Mexican border conflict, the Korean war, the Vietnam \nwar, and peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo.\n  Since the attacks of September 11, over 8,000 South Dakota guardsmen \nhave served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we honor the service of those \nguardsmen who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. As \nthe father of a soldier in the National\n\n[[Page S8040]]\n\nGuard, I personally understand the sacrifices these service members \nmake and the burdens placed on their families during deployments. I \nknow our entire Nation shares in my gratitude for their service.\n  When disaster strikes, the South Dakota National Guard comes to the \naid of our State and Nation. Throughout its history, the men and women \nof our Guard have battled floods, fires, blizzards, tornadoes, and a \nhost of other disasters. Last year, when flooding from the Missouri \nRiver threatened communities along its banks, guardsmen were there to \nshore up levees, pile sandbags, and help citizens prepare for the \nworst. When Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated states along the \ngulf coast, units from the South Dakota National Guard were deployed to \nhelp the region recover.\n  The Guard personnel from the Mount Rushmore State represent the best \nSouth Dakota has to offer.

Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the late Frederick Ladd Potter, who passed away on February \n18, 2012. I wish to pay my respects to Fred's family and to note the \nimportant role he played in assisting me and my colleagues in \ndeveloping and passing the Renewable Fuels Standard, RFS, as part of \nthe Energy Policy Act, EPAct, of 2005.\n  Fred Potter began his lifelong commitment to ethanol and clean-\nburning transportation fuels in 1979 when he helped to open the Office \nof Alcohol Fuels within the U.S. Department of Energy. In 1981 he \nstarted Information Resources Inc., IRI, a private communications \nbusiness, to promulgate information by publishing newsletters and \nholding press conferences. During this time, IRI played a major support \nrole in removing the lead from gasoline, to be replaced by oxygenates \nwhich met the octane needs of gasoline.\n  In 1991 Fred worked out a merger with Hart Energy in forming Hart/IRI \nto greatly expand the publications business to include a wider range of \nnewsletters, studies, research efforts, and conferences. The \nInternational Fuel Quality Center was established, to be followed by \nthe Global Biofuels Center, all with the goal of improving fuel quality \nworldwide and reducing harmful emissions from the automotive sector.\n  Because of the pioneering work Fred accomplished in developing \nbiofuel policy, Congress was able to put into place the first renewable \nfuel volume mandate for the United States. As required under the EPAct, \nthe original RFS Program, RFS1, required 7.5 billion gallons of \nrenewable fuel to be blended into gasoline by 2012.\n  Fred's contribution to achieving this foothold in our nation's \ncomprehensive energy policy is well recognized by those of us who have \nbeen supportive of ethanol and biofuels throughout our careers.\n  Due to these achievements in 2005, Congress was able to expand the \nRFS program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. \nRFS2 laid the foundation for achieving a significant reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions and imported petroleum, as well as the \ndevelopment and expansion of our Nation's renewable fuels sector with \nthe established goal of 36 billion gallons of first-generation and \nadvanced biofuels by 2022. I can think of no better remembrance for \nFred than knowing his fundamental work was essential toward providing \nour Nation's transportation sector with clean-burning, high-octane \nfuels.\n  In addition to his work in renewable fuels, Fred Potter will be \nremembered for his unflagging service to America, his amazing cadre of \nfriends, and his great and loving family. I, therefore, join with \nFred's friends in the Senate in honoring his achievements, his memory, \nand his devoted family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8040-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING JEN'S PLACE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, our Nation's small business owners \nknow what it means to sacrifice every day for a dream. The risks, the \nfears, and the uncertainty are all familiar to those brave enough to \nstrike out on their own and open a small business. Our country's \nentrepreneurs routinely prove that through dedication, hard work, and \nspirit, any vision can be realized. Few know the challenges of opening \na small business like Jen Burton, who has overcome seemingly \ninsurmountable obstacles to build from scratch one of Brunswick, \nMaine's most popular restaurants. I rise today to recognize Jen and her \noutstanding achievements at Jen's Place.\n  Jen Burton understands the value of hard work. An inspiration and an \nexample of the can-do spirit of Maine, Jen worked her way from welfare \nrecipient to entrepreneur and restaurateur. As a single mother, she \nbalances the personal demands of family with the professional \nchallenges of running a restaurant. Jen's Place is now so popular that \ncustomers happily wait in a line that stretches out the door and around \nthe side of the building. It is clear that her popularity is no passing \ntrend. Jen's Place is a favorite of locals, students, and visitors, \nwith its mouthwatering reputation constantly bringing hungry new \npatrons to its tables.\n  Jen spent many years working in restaurants before opening Jen's \nPlace. From those experiences, she learned the right and wrong way to \nrun a restaurant. She learned the priorities and details that were \nimportant to master in her own business. Jen devoted months to \nperfecting her menu items, focusing on quality and taste rather than \ncost efficiency. She also values supporting other Maine small \nbusinesses and buys many of her ingredients locally. Her menu features \ndishes named after frequent patrons, and the eclectic decor is \nreminiscent of a family's cozy kitchen. The relaxed hometown feel and \ndelicious comfort food is the essence of Jen's Place and is a product \nof Jen's tireless effort, perseverance, and culinary know-how.\n  From humble beginnings to successful entrepreneur and local favorite, \nJen Burton embodies the American dream. When the restaurant landscape \nseems dominated by fast-food and chain restaurants, it is heartening to \nsee the success of restaurants like Jen's Place. Her passion and \ncommitment to quality set her apart. I am proud to offer my \ncongratulations to Jen and best wishes for her continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8040-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8040-S8041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TYLER STENBERG\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to clarify the collateral requirement for certain \nloans under section 7(d) of the Small Business Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on an \nissue that is of great importance to my home State of Louisiana: \nFederal disaster assistance. As you know, along the Gulf Coast we keep \nan eye trained on the Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. This is \nfollowing the devastating one-two punch of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nof 2005 as well as Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. Unfortunately, \nour region also has had to deal with the economic and environmental \ndamage from the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 and more recently \nHurricane Isaac. Due to this history, as Chair of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, ensuring Federal disaster \nprograms are effective and responsive to disaster victims is one of my \ntop priorities. While the Gulf Coast is prone to hurricanes, other \nparts of the country are no strangers to disaster. The Midwest has \ntornadoes, California experiences earthquakes and wildfires, and the \nNortheast sees crippling snowstorms. So no part of our country is \nspared from disasters--disasters which can and will strike at any \nmoment. This certainly hit home when the northeast was struck by \nHurricane Sandy in October of this year. With this in mind, we must \nensure that the Federal government is better prepared and has the tools \nnecessary to respond quickly and effectively following a disaster.\n  In order to give the U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, better \ntools to respond after a future disaster, I am proud to have filed S. \n3672, legislation that will make a small but important improvement to \nSBA's disaster assistance programs for impacted businesses. This \nprovision builds off of SBA disaster reforms enacted in 2008 and \nensures that SBA is responsive to the needs of small businesses seeking \nsmaller amounts of disaster assistance. These are the businesses that \nare burdened the most by liens on their primary personal residential \nhomes when they could conceivably provide sufficient business assets as \ncollateral for the loan. In particular, the bill I am filing today \nwould clarify that, for SBA disaster business loans less than $200,000, \nSBA is required to utilize assets other than the primary residence if \nthose assets are available to use as collateral towards the loan. The \nbill is very clear though that these assets should be of equal or \ngreater value than the amount of the loan. Also, to ensure that this is \na targeted improvement, the bill includes additional language that this \nbill in no way requires SBA to reduce the amount or quality of \ncollateral it seeks on these types of loans.\n  I note that this provision is similar to Section 204 of S. 2731, the \nSmall Business Administration Disaster Recovery and Reform Act of 2009 \nthat Senator Bill Nelson and I introduced last Congress. A similar \nprovision also passed the House of Representatives twice last Congress. \nH.R. 3854, which included a modified collateral requirement under \nSection 801, passed the House on October 29, 2009, by a vote of 389-32. \nThe provision also passed the House again on November 6, 2009, by a \nvoice vote as Section 2 of H.R. 3743. So this provision has a history \nof bipartisan Congressional support. I want to especially thank Ranking \nMember Olympia Snowe for working with me to improve upon this previous \nlegislation. The legislation that I am filing today is a result of \ndiscussions with both her and other stakeholders. I believe that this \nbill is better because of improvements that came out these productive \ndiscussions.\n  This bill addresses a key issue that is serving as a roadblock to \nbusiness owners interested in applying for smaller SBA disaster loans. \nAfter the multiple disasters that hit the Gulf Coast, I and my staff \nhave consistently heard from business owners, discouraged from applying \nfor SBA disaster loans. When we have inquired further on the main \nreasons behind this hesitation, the top concern related to SBA \nrequiring business owners to put up their personal home as collateral \nfor smaller SBA business disaster loans. This requirement is \nunderstandable for large loans\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\nbetween $750,000 and $2 million. However, business owners complained \nabout this requirement being instituted for loans of $200,000 or less. \nI can understand their frustration. Business owners, in many cases who \nhave just lost everything, are applying to SBA for a $150,000 loan for \ntheir business. SBA then responds by asking them to put up their \n$400,000 personal home as collateral when the business may have \nsufficient business assets available to collateralize the loan. While I \nalso understand the need for SBA to secure the loans, make the program \ncost effective, and minimize risk to the taxpayer, SBA has at its \ndisposal multiple ways to secure loans.\n  Furthermore, SBA has repeatedly said publicly and in testimony before \nmy committee that it will not decline a borrower for a lack of \ncollateral. According to a July 14, 2010 correspondence between SBA and \nmy office, the agency notes that ``SBA is an aggressive lender and its \ncredit thresholds are well below traditional bank standards. . . . SBA \ndoes not decline loans for insufficient collateral.'' SBA's current \npractice of making loans is based upon an individual/business \ndemonstrating the ability to repay and income. The agency declines \nborrowers for an inability to repay the loan. In regards to collateral, \nSBA follows traditional lending practices that seek the ``best \navailable collateral.'' Collateral is required for physical loans over \n$14,000 and Economic Injury Disaster Loans, EIDL, loans over $5,000. \nSBA takes real estate as collateral when it is available, but as I \nstated, the agency will not decline a loan for lack of collateral. \nInstead it requires borrowers to pledge what is available. However, in \npractice, SBA is requiring borrowers to put up a personal residence \nworth $300,000 or $400,000 for a business loan of $200,000 or less when \nthere are other assets available for SBA.\n  While I do not want to see SBA tie up too much of a business' \ncollateral, I also believe that if a business is willing and able to \nput up business assets towards its disaster loan, SBA should consider \nthat first before attempting to bring in personal residences. It is \nunreasonable for SBA to ask business owners operating in very different \nbusiness environments post-disaster to jeopardize not just their \nbusiness but also their home. Loans of $200,000 or less are also the \nloans most likely to be repaid by the business so personal homes should \nbe collateral of last resort in instances where a business can \ndemonstrate the ability to repay the loan and that it has other assets.\n  In closing, I believe that this commonsense fix will greatly benefit \nbusinesses impacted by future disasters. This provision does not \nsubstantively change SBA's current lending practices and it will not \nhave a significant cost. I believe that this legislation would not \ntrigger direct spending nor would it have a significant impact on the \nsubsidy rate for SBA disaster loans. Currently for every $1 loaned out, \nit costs approximately 10 cents on the dollar. Most importantly, this \nbill will greatly improve the SBA disaster loan programs for businesses \nahead of future disasters. If a business comes to the SBA for a loan of \nless than $200,000 to make immediate repairs or secure working capital, \nthey can be assured that they will not have to put up their personal \nhome if SBA determines that the business has other assets to go towards \nthe loan. However, if businesses seek larger loans than $200,000, then \nthe current requirements will still apply. This ensures that very small \nbusinesses and businesses seeking smaller amounts of recovery loans are \nable to secure these loans without significant burdens on their \npersonal property. For the business owners we have spoken to, this \nprovides some badly needed clarity to one of the Federal Government's \nprimary tools for responding to disasters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Johnny Manziel was named the 2012 \nHeisman Trophy winner for his incredible accomplishments on the \ngridiron. Texas A finished this season ranked No. 9 nationally with a \nrecord of 10 wins and 2 losses including an impressive victory in \nTuscaloosa, Alabama over the previously ranked No. 1 University of \nAlabama, Crimson Tide.\n  At a young age, Johnny Manziel's parents, Paul and Michelle Manziel \ninstilled a discipline to succeed. Their parenting laid the groundwork \nfor his competitiveness and strong work ethic. Raised in Tyler, Texas, \nand a graduate of Tivy High School in Kerrville, Texas, Johnny was a \nhigh school star athlete never willing to back down because of his size \nor age.\n  Johnny's time at Texas A may not be extensive but his freshman year \nstatistics and accomplishments are not short of anything but \nextraordinary. Johnny is the first freshman in National Collegiate \nAthletic Association, NCAA, history to ever win the prestigious Heisman \nTrophy. Johnny also became the first freshman and only the fifth player \never, in NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision, FBS, history to achieve 3,000 \npassing yards and 1,000 rushing yards in a season. Incredibly, Johnny \nbecame the first player in the FBS to pass for 300 yards and rush for \n100 yards in the same game three times in his career. He also earned \nthe Davey O'Brien Award, presented annually to the best NCAA \nquarterback.\n  On Saturday, December 8, 2012, Johnny Manziel was recognized as the \ngreatest college football player of the year. The Heisman Trophy is the \nmost prestigious award in college sports, and no one is more deserving \nof this honor than Johnny Manziel.\n  Congratulations to Johnny Manziel on a truly memorable season; to his \nfamily, who provided the foundation for his abilities; to his teammates \nand to all of Aggieland.

78 Stat. 241), which broke \n     down the barrier of legal discrimination against African \n     Americans and made equality before the law a reality for all \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks has been honored as the ``first lady of \n     civil rights'' and the ``mother of the freedom movement'', \n     and her quiet dignity ignited the most significant social \n     movement in the history of the United States;\n       Whereas, in 1987, Rosa Parks and her close associate Elaine \n     Steele cofounded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for \n     Self Development to motivate and direct youth to achieve \n     their highest potential through Rosa Parks' philosophy of \n     ``quiet strength'' and cross-cultural exposure for nurturing \n     a global and inclusive perspective;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks was the recipient of many awards and \n     accolades for her efforts on behalf of racial harmony, \n     including the Congressional Gold Medal, the Spingarn Award, \n     which is the highest honor of the National Association for \n     the Advancement of Colored People for civil rights \n     contributions, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which \n     is the highest civilian honor in the United States, and was \n     named one of the 20 most influential and iconic figures of \n     the 20th century;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks sparked one of the largest movements in \n     the United States against racial segregation, and by her \n     quiet courage symbolizes all that is vital about nonviolent \n     protest because of the way she endured threats of death and \n     persisted as an advocate for the basic lessons she taught the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas Rosa Parks and her husband Raymond Parks relocated \n     to Michigan in 1957, and remained in Michigan until the death \n     of Rosa Parks on October 24, 2005;\n       Whereas, on Tuesday, October 26, 2005 the United States \n     Senate adopted a Resolution expressing its condolences on the \n     passing of Rosa Parks, and honored her life and \n     accomplishments;\n       Whereas, in recognition of the historic contributions of \n     Rosa Parks, her remains were placed in the rotunda of the \n     Capitol from October 30 to October 31, 2005, so that the \n     people of the United States could pay their last respects to \n     this great American;\n       Whereas, in November 2005, Congress authorized the Joint \n     Committee on the Library to procure a statue of Rosa Parks to \n     be placed in the Capitol;\n       Whereas the United States Postal Service will issue a stamp \n     in February 2013 to honor Rosa Parks and her courage to act \n     at a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement;\n       Whereas, the bus on which Rosa Parks sparked a new era in \n     the American quest for freedom and equality is one of the \n     most significant artifacts of the American civil rights \n     movement and is on permanent display in the Henry Ford Museum \n     in Dearborn, Michigan;\n       Whereas, on February 4, 2013, the Henry Ford Museum, will \n     commemorate the 100th birthday of Rosa Parks by calling for a \n     National Day of Courage and sponsoring a program that \n     highlights her contributions to the civil rights movement, \n     including a day-long celebration, with both virtual and on-\n     site activities featuring nationally-recognized speakers, \n     musical and dramatic interpretative performances, a panel \n     presentation of ``Rosa's Story'' and a reading of the tale \n     ``Quiet Strength'', featuring the actual bus on which Rosa \n     Parks sat as the centerpiece in commemorating Rosa Parks' \n     extraordinary life and accomplishments, and affording \n     everyone the opportunity to board the bus and sit in the seat \n     that Rosa Parks refused to give up; and\n       Whereas the Rosa Parks Museum at Troy University and the \n     Mobile Studio will commemorate the birthday of Rosa Parks \n     with the 100th Birthday Wishes Project, culminating on \n     February 4, 2013, with a 100th birthday celebration at the \n     Davis Theatre for the Performing Arts in Montgomery, Alabama, \n     where 2,000 birthday wishes submitted by individuals \n     throughout the United States will be transformed into 200 \n     graphic messages: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) observes the 100th birthday of civil rights icon Rosa \n     Parks; and\n       (2) commemorates the legacy of Rosa Parks to inspire all \n     people of the United States to stand up for freedom and the \n     principles of the Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/13/senate-section/article/S8044-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8044-S8045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3335.
