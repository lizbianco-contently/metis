The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. The Senate is considering the motion to proceed to the farm \nbill postcloture.\n  At 4:30, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the \nnomination of Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to be a United States Circuit \nJudge for the Ninth Circuit. At 5:30 p.m., there will be a cloture vote \non the Hurwitz nomination.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Democrats and Republicans hold a different \nview on many issues. But the bipartisan work by Senators Stabenow and \nRoberts on the agriculture jobs bill demonstrates, despite our \ndifferences, we can still find common ground. I hope their cooperative \nspirit guides our work on this important legislation this week. \nAmerican farmers are counting on us, and so is the economy.\n  Despite the uncertain economic times, America's farms are the most \nproductive in the world, exporting $136 billion worth of products last \nyear and supporting 16 million private sector jobs. But to keep \nAmerican farms strong, Congress must pass a strong farm bill.\n  This legislation creates jobs, cuts subsidies, and reduces the \ndeficit. The bill includes important reforms to farm and food stamp \nprograms. It saves $23 billion, which will be used to reduce the \ndeficit. And it will give farmers the certainty they need to maintain \nthe largest trade surplus of any sector of our economy.\n  Helping American farmers thrive is an important part of our work to \nget the economy on a firm footing again. I commend Senators Stabenow \nand Roberts for their leadership on this issue. We are working now to \ncome up with a list of amendments on this legislation.\n  It is a shame we are now wasting 30 hours postcloture on this bill. \nIt is a bill that passed by 90 Senators agreeing that we should move \nforward to debate. But it now appears we are in a situation that we \nwere in last week and the week before and the week before that, when \nthe Republicans have made a decision that they would rather do anything \nthey can to stop jobs from being created, hoping it will help them with \nthe elections come November.\n  Too often in this Congress the Republican strategy has been to kill \njob-creating bills in the hopes of harming the economy and hurting \nPresident Obama. It forces the Senate to spend weeks passing consensus \nlegislation that once was passed in a matter of minutes.\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\nThey have held many important jobs measures hostage to extract votes on \nunrelated, ideological amendments. It appears we are in that same place \nright here on this bill.\n  I am disappointed, as I have already said, that they have caused us \nto waste 30 hours on procedural hurdles on this bill. We shouldn't have \nto do that. We shouldn't have to run that clock when 90 Senators agree \nwe should move to the bill. That is what happened last week.\n  I hope my Republican friends will dispense with these delay tactics. \nThis is a bill that creates jobs, cuts subsidies, and protects our \nworking farmers.\n  We hear the hue and cry from our Republican friends all the time that \nthey want to reduce the deficit. How about one bill, in one fell swoop, \nwith $23 billion of deficit reduction--a bill that will reduce \nsubsidies, get rid of a lot of waste and abuse, and create jobs.\n  We are in this position where my friends have said, just as the \nRepublican leader has said, that their only goal is to defeat Obama, \nnot help our country, and that is too bad.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nfarm bill that is now before the Senate. I want to say at the outset \nthat this is a reform-minded bill that saves money and continues the \nevolution of farm policy in our Nation.\n  I commend the chair and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee \nfor working to craft a farm bill that helps equip producers with \nimproved risk management tools while being mindful of our very \nchallenging budget situation.\n  This bipartisan bill will reduce the deficit by $23.6 billion because \nof changes to every title and the elimination of nearly 100 Federal \nprograms overall. It shifts farm policy further away from dependence on \nincome support and, instead, focuses on risk management.\n  But to truly appreciate where we are in farm policy today, it is \nimportant to spend a minute examining how we got here.\n  In the 1930s, depression and disaster ravaged our country's farm \nsector. At the time a quarter of this country's population lived and \nworked on farms and ranches, and most of what they produced was \nconsumed relatively close to where it was grown.\n  When prices collapsed and dust storms swept the Plains, many were \nforced off their land to look for work in the cities. But oftentimes no \nwork was to be found.\n  In response to this situation, Congress passed the first farm bill. \nIt was called the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. The act placed \nthe Federal Government in the driver's seat in making farm production \ndecisions. A structure to eliminate crop and livestock surpluses was \nestablished--the thought being, if that was done, it would drive up \nprices. Literally, crops were plowed under and livestock was \nslaughtered to reduce supply and then, hopefully, to increase farm \nprices, according to the thinking at the time.\n  The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 made federally funded price \nsupports mandatory for several crops. That would include corn, cotton, \nand wheat.\n  Then another law was passed in 1949. It mandated extensive government \nintervention to maintain parity with prices prior to World War I.\n  I am not going to start an argument today about whether all of this \nwas the right farm policy during the 1930s and 1940s. I will leave that \nfor another time. But I can say, with no hesitation whatsoever, it is \nabsolutely the wrong approach for the farm economy today and virtually \nno one disagrees with that.\n  Over the past several decades, farm bills have improved from those \nearly laws, and U.S. farm policy has slowly but surely become a more \nmarket-oriented policy. For a long time the main goal was to support \nprices for a list of crops. We set high prices in law which distorted \nmarkets and discouraged cultivation of crops that did not benefit from \nprice supports.\n  In 1996, Congress began to shift away from the distorting farm \npolicies of the past, and direct payments were introduced to \ntemporarily support farmers as they transitioned away from an \nagricultural economy that was very reliant upon government \nintervention.\n  Removing the government from price and supply controls created new \nrisks to farmers, and it created uncertainty from Mother Nature. \nCongress then responded with ad hoc disaster spending to help farmers \nand ranchers address losses due to weather and other disasters. In \nfact, since 1996, USDA's Economic Research Service estimates that $43 \nbillion has been spent on these ad hoc and emergency programs.\n  To help manage these risks in a more fiscally responsible way, a crop \ninsurance program has emerged. This highly effective public-private \npartnership helps farmers customize protection for their individual \noperations. Over time, crop insurance has become the risk management \ntool for farmers.\n  These are policies sold by private companies for over 100 different \ncrops, and roughly 85 percent of acreage for major crops is now covered \nby crop insurance.\n  Last year, in spite of the drought in much of the southern plains and \nflooding in States such as Nebraska and many other States, farmers and \nranchers did not call for emergency relief. In fact, I have heard \nclearly from farmers in Nebraska that crop insurance is working well.\n  Today's farmers are certainly some of the most sophisticated and \ntalented businesspeople in our Nation. The fruits of their labor \nproduce an abundance of healthy low-cost food for Americans and, for \nthat matter, people around the world. In fact, trade currently accounts \nfor more than 25 percent of all U.S. farm receipts, and 1 out of every \n3 crop acres--1 out of 3--is now exported.\n  In 2011 agricultural exports reached $136 billion. Our efficient \nexport system, including handling, processing, and distribution of our \nfood and agricultural products, creates millions of U.S. jobs. Given \nthe projected global population growth of an additional 2.5 billion \npeople by 2050, U.S. agriculture is positioned to experience \nsignificant growth in just a few years.\n  This farm bill ensures that USDA is focused on maintaining current \nexport markets and gaining access to new emerging markets for U.S. farm \nand food products. This is the first farm bill in recent history that \ndoes not pay farmers a specific payment just because they are farmers. \nYou see, farmers have come to realize that risk management is best \nhandled with crop insurance. In fact, in many listening sessions I have \nhad around the State, virtually no one asked for the continuation of \ndirect payments.\n  The bill actually saves $15 billion from commodity crop support by \neliminating four programs, including direct payments; countercyclical \npayments; the Average Crop Revenue Election Program, called ACRE; and \nthe Supplemental Revenue Assistance Program, called SURE.\n  It does not raise loan rates, the price levels that have \ntraditionally triggered the making of payments. It focuses the farm \nprogram on revenue, not price--something I proposed as the U.S. \nSecretary of Agriculture when I served in the Cabinet.\n  I remind my colleagues that our job in writing a farm bill is not to \nprotect the interests of specific commodity groups. Instead, the farm \nbill should be about preserving the health of our agricultural economy. \nThis farm bill continues a history of steps in that direction.\n\n  It seeks to minimize distortions and allows farmers to respond to \nmarket incentives--not determined by artificial prices set in a Federal \nstatute.\n  I am also glad to see a step forward on payment limits and changes to \nensure that those who receive government payments are actively engaged \nin farming.\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\n  I am especially pleased with the efforts to streamline and simplify \nthe conservation programs. That is an issue I have heard a lot about. \nThis bill actually consolidates 23 conservation programs into 13. In \nfact, I proposed similar changes as Agriculture Secretary during the \nlast farm bill process. The improvements reduce costs as well as make \nthe programs more farmer friendly.\n  This bill also provides for the basic research at USDA, universities, \nand elsewhere that is needed to meet the demand for our farmers to \nproduce more food, and on less land, and it does so in a way that \nincludes new avenues to ensure that important work continues in these \ntimes of very tight Federal budgets.\n  Finally, I am pleased this bill builds on efforts to encourage \nbeginning farmers and ranchers, veterans, and others looking for \ncareers in agriculture.\n  It is important to me that we keep this farm bill as simple and \nstreamlined as possible. I think we can agree that a bill that \neliminates nearly 100 Federal programs does just that.\n  Given our Nation's daunting budget situation, it is appropriate that \nthis bill saves $23.6 billion, taking yet another step in the right \ndirection to reforming farm policy for the 21st century.\n  I hope we can keep this bill moving to help ensure certainty for \nfarmers, ranchers, and others in rural communities where livelihoods \nare impacted by these policies. But make no mistake, good farm policy \ndoes not end with a good farm bill. Our farmers and ranchers also \ndeserve a more constructive regulatory environment and a fairer tax \nsystem. So while I support the bill, I hope we can get some amendments \npending to make a good bill a better bill.\n  This is so important that I led a letter with 43 other Senators \nasking for an open amendment process. I look forward to the debate and \nto passing a very reform-minded farm bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley and Mr. Kyl are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Executive Session.'')\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to comment on something the President \nrecently said that is very much in the news.\n  Last Friday, the President of the United States said, ``The private \nsector is doing just fine.''\n  This is not taken out of context. He was talking about economically. \nHis office leader explained what he was really talking about is the \ncomparison between the public sector and the private sector, and I take \nhim at his word there.\n  The President said:\n\n       Where we're seeing weaknesses in our economy have to do \n     with state and local government--oftentimes cuts initiated by \n     governors or mayors who are not getting the kind of help that \n     they have in the past from the federal government and who \n     don't have the same kind of flexibility as the federal \n     government in dealing with fewer revenues coming in.\n\n  I think that is generally true. But here are the two key points I \nwould make in response: First, everyone--not just government \nemployees--is suffering. They are struggling in the Obama economy.\n  Yes, the number of government jobs has decreased during the last 40 \nmonths since President Obama took office, but overall employment in \ngovernment has increased on the whole in recent years, even with the \nreductions that have occurred in the last couple of years.\n  For example, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total \ngovernment employees added up to 21,847,000--rounded off--in January \n2006. That is just a little over 6 years ago--21,847,000. By \ncomparison, last month the total amount of government employees added \nup to 21,969,000. So there are a few more government employees today--\nState, Federal, and local--than there were just 6 years ago. I would \njust ask, how on Earth did we get by in this country with only \n21,847,000 government workers in 2006? I think we were doing just fine.\n  The reality is, when a private firm faces financial difficulty, \nusually the first area the firm looks to in terms of saving money is \nits workforce. It is too bad, but frequently firms have to lay off \nworkers because they simply can't afford to continue to pay that many \nworkers.\n  I will just give the experience of a friend of mine in Arizona who \nsaid: This recession was probably the best thing that happened to us \nbecause it forced us to look at our workforce, how we did business, and \nwhether we could make savings. He said: Today, we are making more money \nthan we ever have, even with a lower workforce, because we found that \nwe could make do and make the improvements that made us more efficient.\n  We are asking that to be done in government. Government doesn't have \na right to continue to grow and grow. Government should be as efficient \nas the private sector, including with respect to the number of people \nit hires to do the work that has to be done. After all, the private \nsector has to take care of paying both the employees in the private \nsector and the employees in the government sector. Who pays government \nemployees? All of our constituents, the people in the private sector.\n  So we in the government have an obligation to run the governments--\nFederal, State, and local--as efficiently and leanly as we possibly \ncan. If we find we can run the government with just a few more \nemployees today than we had, for example, 6 years ago, then all the \nbetter for our economy and all the better for the taxpayers who have to \npay their salaries.\n  So there isn't some right of the Federal Government to continue to \ngrow its workforce at a rate higher than the private sector. Rather, we \nshould be trying to run the government on as few a number of employees \nas necessary to do the work the American people want us to do. But here \nis the larger point: As the Wall Street Journal points out, the reason \nthe government workforce has shrunk since January 2009 is not due to \nsmaller budgets or dwindling aid, as the President suggested. As the \nWall Street Journal notes, revenues to State and local governments have \nincreased during the last 2 years, according to census data. The main \nproblem is rising health care and pension costs for government workers, \nand we have seen the experience in a State such as Wisconsin in having \nto deal with that to make some reductions, which caused a lot of \npolitical turmoil in the State. But at the end, the voters of the State \nsaid: We agree. We need to cut government cost as it relates to the \nhealth care and pension commitments we have made to our government \nemployees.\n  While government has experienced some job losses, it is important to \nremember that benefits enjoyed by government workers are far superior \nto those enjoyed by those employed in the private sector. For example, \naccording to an article in the National Review magazine, on an hourly \nbasis private sector employees' benefits cost their companies $2.15 an \nhour. State and local government workers cost taxpayers $4.72 an hour--\n219 percent more.\n  For retirement benefit costs, the private sector figure works out to \n$1.02 per hour. The State and local workers sum, $3.37 an hour--a 330-\npercent premium.\n  This is where the extra costs are for government workers. You can't \nblame State and local governments for trying to provide more efficiency \nfor their operations by conforming their practices for health care and \npension benefits more to those in the private sector.\n  Why do government employees deserve more? I guess that is the \nquestion. As is a matter of fairness--and especially when compared to \npeople who are paying their salaries--I don't think anyone can argue \nthat government employees should have twice as much or three times as \nmuch of a benefit as somebody in the private sector.\n  The second point I would make is this: At 4.2 percent, according to \nthe latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment \nrate among government workers is also far below that of the private \nsector. We know the average in the country is 8.2 percent, and that is \nonly the people who are still looking for work. If we\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\ntook all the people who are out of work, it would be about 11.1 or 11.2 \npercent. But among government workers, the unemployment rate is 4.2 \npercent.\n  Compare that with unemployment in some other sectors. In agriculture, \nit is 9.5 percent; 8.1 percent in the wholesale and retail trade; 9.7 \npercent in leisure and hospitality, to name just a few industries. In \neach of these I named--I think each of them would be thrilled to have \nunemployment at 4.2 percent. When the President says the real problem \nis with government employment, the private sector is doing just fine, \nthe facts simply belie that. The President was wrong; he was incorrect.\n\n  Finally, let me address his theory of how an economy grows. \nUnemployment, as I said, is 8.2 percent nationwide. Labor force \nparticipation is at historic lows--the number of people actually \nworking or looking for work. GDP growth in the first quarter of 2012 \nwas a very anemic 1.9 percent. This is not enough for this country to \ngrow and prosper and the President wants to borrow or raise taxes from \nthat segment of our society so taxpayers can finance more government \nworkers? That does not make sense.\n  I think not only is the President wrong on the facts about the \nprivate sector doing just fine, he has it wrong as to what the solution \nwould be. The solution to help government workers is to have the \nprivate sector do better so it can afford to help--to hire more \ngovernment workers and to pay them better benefits. Government stimulus \nspending and aid to States has not grown the economy so far and it is \nobviously not going to do so in the future.\n  Rather than divide the country into public versus private sector \nworkers, Federal versus State and local workers, rich versus poor, men \nversus women, as the President is wont to do, I hope we work hard to \nrepresent all Americans. No one benefits in the long run from an \nenormous government with an appetite to grow more and more, crushing \neconomic growth and crowding out the private sector, a government that \ndrives up costs for job creators and forces companies to lay off \nprivate sector workers. None of us benefits from that. Yet that is what \nwe are seeing playing out right now. The total number of unemployed and \nunderemployed is over 23 million people in the United States. Think of \nthat. That is the number of people who are looking for work who have \nstopped looking for work or who do not have the kind of work they could \nbe doing. Economic growth last quarter, as I said, was only 1.9 \npercent; only 69,000 new jobs added. We need more than twice that many \njobs added each month in order to keep pace with the new workers coming \ninto the economy, so we are losing ground in terms of jobs created. I \ndon't think the President's solution of more spending on government \nemployees is the answer. I think that is a recipe of another 40 months \nof 8 percent-plus unemployment. At that rate we are not going to get \nout of the economic difficulties we are in right now. Let's do things \nthat support the private sector, things that help the private sector. \nThe healthier the economy is, the more growth we have, the more we are \nable to do for the public sector as well. That is the ultimate answer.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

I ask unanimous consent that the time be divided in such a \nway that the vote will occur at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Last week's confirmation of Jeffrey Helmick to a judicial \nemergency vacancy in the Northern District of Ohio marked the 150th \nconfirmation of a Federal circuit or district court nominee of \nPresident Obama's. I do not say that for self-congratulations because \nwe should acknowledge that we had already confirmed 150 of President \nBush's circuit and district court nominees 9 months earlier, in \nSeptember of his third year in office.\n  In other words, to have matched what we had done so far for President \nObama, we would have had to have had this number late last year. I \nmention that because it is one measure of how far behind we are in the \nconsideration of President Obama's nominees. Part of that is because a \nvery large number of nominees who went through the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously last year who would normally be confirmed by voice vote \nwithin 1 week or so after they went through Committee were delayed on \nthe Executive Calendar until this year.\n  I would point out another thing, which is that today is June 11, but \nby June 15 of President Bush's fourth year in office, the Senate had \nalready confirmed 180 Federal circuit and district court judges--150 \nfor President Obama, 180 for President Bush--30 more judges for \nPresident Bush than we have been allowed to consider and confirm during \nPresident Obama's administration to date.\n  There are still more than 70 judicial vacancies around the country. \nThat is more than when President Obama came into office. One of the \nreasons it is more is that when Democrats were in control, we moved \nPresident Bush's nominees much faster than Republicans have allowed us \nto move President Obama's.\n  The unprecedented delays in the consideration of President Obama's \nnominations were confirmed by a recent Congressional Research Service \nreport on judicial nominations. The median number of days President \nObama's circuit court nominees have been delayed from Senate \nconsideration after being voted on by the Judiciary Committee has \nskyrocketed to 132 days. As the report notes, that is ``roughly 7.3 \ntimes greater than the median number of 18 days for the 61 confirmed \ncircuit nominees of his immediate predecessor, President G.W. Bush.'' \nSimilarly, district court nominees are being unnecessarily delayed. The \nmedian time from Committee vote to Senate vote has gone from 21 days \nduring the George W. Bush presidency to 90 days for President Obama's \ndistrict nominees.\n  There are 18 judicial nominees sitting here waiting for final Senate \nconsideration. They have been approved by the Judiciary Committee with \nbipartisan votes. It is my hope the Senate will be allowed to consider \nthose other nominees and make real progress.\n  In fact, today the Senate is voting on whether to end a partisan \nfilibuster against the nomination of Justice Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona \nto fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Ninth Circuit. He is \nsupported by both the Senators from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, the deputy \nRepublican leader, and Mr. McCain. Last month, the Senate finally began \ntaking actions I have been urging for months. We were finally able to \nconsider and confirm the nominations of Judge Jacqueline Nguyen and \nJudge Paul Watford of California to judicial emergency vacancies on the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The delay in the \nconsideration of all these nominees follows the pattern also seen with \nJudge Morgan Christen of Alaska last December despite the strong \nsupport of the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski. I commend \nSenators from both sides of the aisle who rejected the misguided effort \nto filibuster the nomination of Judge Watford.\n  Normally, on a nomination such as Justice Hurwitz's, we would not \neven\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nbe having a cloture vote, but we seem to have a new standard that is \nrequired for President Obama that was not required of the other \nPresidents since I have been here. It was not required for President \nFord or President Carter or President Reagan or President George H.W. \nBush or President Clinton or President George W. Bush.\n  I mention those because those are the only Presidents with whom I \nhave served. We did not have that standard. Suddenly, we have this \nbrand new standard for President Obama. So for the 28th time, the \nmajority leader has been forced to file for cloture to get an up-or-\ndown vote on one of President Obama's judicial nominations.\n  By comparison, during the entire 8 years, not 3\\1/2\\ years but 8 \nyears, that President Bush was in office, cloture was filed in \nconnection with 18 of his judicial nominees, most of whom were not \nconfirmed or were not passed out of the Judiciary Committee by a \nbipartisan majority. Most were opposed as extreme ideologues.\n  Justice Hurwitz is not a nominee who should be filibustered or \nrequire cloture in order to be considered by the Senate. He is a \nnominee with impeccable legal credentials and qualifications. I urge \nSenators to see through the specious and unfair attacks from the \nextreme right and narrow special interest groups. Senator Kyl and \nSenator McCain are right to support his nomination, and this good man \nand excellent judge should be confirmed. Justice Hurwitz is a respected \nand experienced jurist on the Arizona Supreme Court. His nomination has \nthe strong support of his home state Senators, Senator John McCain and \nSenator Jon Kyl. Justice Hurwitz was reported favorably out of \nCommittee with bipartisan support over three months ago. His nomination \nreceived the highest possible rating of the American Bar Association \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary after their nonpartisan \npeer review found him to be ``well qualified.'' He has all the \ncredentials anyone could want, has exhibited good judgment on the \nbench, and has the right judicial temperament. He is the kind of \nnominee who would at any other time in our history be confirmed \nunanimously or nearly so by the Senate in an expeditious manner. Not so \nthis year, during this presidential administration. Despite the fact \nthat this President has reached across the aisle to work with \nRepublican home state Senators, Justice Hurwitz faces partisan \nopposition.\n\n  When Senator Kyl introduced Justice Hurwitz to the Judiciary \nCommittee at his hearing in January, he underscored what a qualified \nnominee he is. Senator Kyl said:\n\n       It is very easy to see and it is obvious to those of us who \n     have been in Arizona a long time why Justice Hurwitz was \n     awarded the ABA's highest rating, unanimous well qualified. \n     So it will be my privilege to support his nomination, and I \n     am honored to be able to introduce him to the panel today.\n\n  Justice Hurwitz is an outstanding nominee with impeccable credentials \nand qualifications. He has had nine years of experience as a judge on \nArizona's highest court, and has shown a record of excellence as a \njurist. No one has criticized a single decision he has made from the \nbench in his nine years as justice. Let me repeat that: No one can \npoint to a single decision he has made and be critical. It is because \nof his record that he has the strong support of both Republican \nSenators from Arizona as well as many, many others from both sides of \nthe political aisle.\n  A graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law School, Justice \nHurwitz served as the Note and Comment Editor of the Yale Law Journal. \nFollowing graduation, he clerked on every level of the Federal \njudiciary: First for Judge Jon O. Newman, who was then U.S. District \nJudge on the District of Connecticut. Subsequently, he clerked for \nJudge Joseph Smith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \nThen he clerked for Justice Potter Stewart of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  He then distinguished himself in private practice, where he spent \nover 25 years at a law firm in Phoenix, Arizona. While in private \npractice, Justice Hurwitz tried more than 40 cases to verdict or final \ndecision. He argued numerous times in the Ninth Circuit and other state \nand Federal appellate courts. One of the Supreme Court cases he argued \nwas Ring v. Arizona, a case which he won 7 2, with the votes of \nJustices Scalia and Thomas.\n  Justice Hurwitz has also taught classes at Arizona State University's \nSandra Day O'Connor College of Law for approximately 15 years on a \nvariety of subjects including ethics, Supreme Court litigation, \nlegislative process, civil procedure, and Federal courts.\n  By any traditional measure, he is the kind of judicial nominee who \nshould be confirmed by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, and I find it \nvery disappointing that notwithstanding the strong support of Senator \nKyl and Senator McCain, so many Republican Senators seem eager to \noppose this nomination.\n  An unfair campaign is being mounted by the extreme right against this \noutstanding nominee. The apparent basis of that campaign is not any \ndecision that Justice Hurwitz made, incidentally. He has never been \noverturned. So it is not from any decision he made but rather a \ndecision Judge Newman made while Justice Hurwitz was a young law clerk \n40 years ago.\n  Anyone who knows Judge Newman especially knows this was his decision, \nnot that of a clerk. Judge Jon Newman makes his own decisions. He \nalways has. Actually, in this particular case, the decision he made was \nultimately accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court as the law of the land.\n  Why Senators who know better would suggest that somehow, 40 years \nago, a law clerk could convince a judge how to vote--law clerks \ntraditionally are asked by the judge to give them what is the law. What \nis the law for this position, what is the law for the opposite \nposition, give that to me.\n  But I have never known a judge, certainly no Federal judge, whether \nappointed by a Republican or Democrat, who did not make up their own \nmind. No judge had their law clerks make up their mind. Law clerks give \nthem the material on both sides. So the opposition to this nomination \nmarks a new low. I say that in a way that pains me, after 37 years in \nthis body.\n  Some are attempting to disqualify a nominee who has impeccable \ncredentials, who has the highest possible rating, because a Federal \njudge, now retired, for whom that nominee clerked some 40 years ago, \ndecided a case with which some Senators disagree, even though that is \nthe law that has been upheld, even by a very conservative Supreme \nCourt.\n  Come on. They are against Roe v. Wade. They oppose the constitutional \nright for women to have privacy recognized in that case. That is their \nright. But what is not right is them attributing responsibility for the \njudge's decision which properly construed the Constitution, to his \nclerk.\n  To then say, because this judge properly construed the Constitution \nthe way it has been upheld by the Supreme Court, we have to look at the \nman who was his clerk 40 years ago and vote him down.\n  Come on, that is Alice in the Wonderland. If we start doing that sort \nof thing, then we can vote down anybody for anything. Oh, when they \nwere 11 years old, they stayed out late one night. We can't have a \njudge on our court who disobeyed the rules, the laws laid down by their \nfamilies, and they were out late. What about that time when they were a \nfreshman in college and they stayed out too late? Oh, throw that man \nout. The fact that Justice Hurwitz served on the Arizona Supreme Court \nand never had one of his cases overturned--the heck with that. Forty \nyears ago his qualifications were such that he was able to be a law \nclerk, but out of the thousands of decisions of the judge he clerked \nfor, we disagreed with one--even though that is the law of the land \ntoday--therefore, we cannot do anything about that judge, so we will \nget the guy who clerked for him. I wonder who turned the lights on in \nthat building at that time. Maybe we should make sure they never get a \njob anywhere else either. Come on.\n  This opposition follows after we saw the opposition to Judge Paul \nWatford, who clerked for a very conservative judge, Judge Alex \nKozinski, who had been appointed by President Reagan and now serves as \nchief judge of the Ninth Circuit. Judge Kozinski strongly supported his \nnomination. But somewhere in the ether, they found something that went \nagainst him. The 34 Senate Republicans who voted against the \nconfirmation of Paul Watford did not credit him for having clerked for \na\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\nconservative judge who wrote conservative opinions with which they \nagreed. So this is another one-way street, another ratcheting down of \nthe process, another excuse for opposing a highly qualified nominee. \nAnd it is wrong.\n  This also follows a pattern. Senate Republicans have attacked \nnominees by attributing the position of the nominee's legal client to \nthe judicial nominee. That is something, incidentally, that Chief \nJustice Roberts strongly condemned at his confirmation hearing, and I \nagree with him. In fact, I voted for Chief Justice Roberts. The fact \nis, lawyers are often asked to represent people on one side or the \nother.\n  John Adams, who became our President, who worked so hard to have us \nbreak free from Britain, defended the British soldiers who were \ninvolved in the Boston Massacre because he said we have to show not \nonly our new country but the world that we stand for the rule of law \nand that everybody in court gets adequate representation. I mention \nthat because when they opposed Judge Helmick, they argued that because \nhe served as a court-appointed lawyer for a defendant in a terrorism \ncase, that means he supports terrorism. Baloney. I represented \ncriminals when I was in private practice, and I prosecuted criminals \nwhen I was a prosecutor. Now, what does that mean? It means I followed \nthe law and played the part a lawyer should play in these proceedings. \nThat is why, after what they did with Judge Helmick, I reminded them of \nJohn Adams defending the British soldiers after the Boston Massacre. I \nhad a person ask me: Is it possible that you have Senators who have \nnever read a history book? I said that I never thought so before.\n  I also looked at how they filibustered Caitlin Halligan, who served \nas her State's top appellate lawyer. They filibustered her because she \ndefended the constitutionality of her State's law. Let's take a look at \nwhat a Hobson's choice we have there. If you are the State's top lawyer \nand you defend your State's law, we cannot possibly support you. Let's \nsay that she was the State's top lawyer and she opposed the State's \nlaw. Then they would say: Oh, we obviously cannot support you. So you \nare damned if you do and damned if you don't.\n  They opposed the nomination of Jesse Furman. Why? Well, he wrote \nsomething when he was a freshman in college, before he even went to law \nschool. Oh my goodness gracious, let's hope we don't have a judicial \nnominee who may have written for a college newspaper. Can you imagine? \nI might ask every Senator to go back and look at some of the papers \nthey wrote in high school and college.\n  If somebody brought those up today, they would probably say: Who \nwrote this garbage?\n  Well, you did, Senator. So following your standards, I assume you are \ngoing to retire today and notify the government.\n  I have seen Senate Republicans grossly distorting a nominee's record \nto make him out to be a caricature, as with Goodwin Liu.\n  Now we are seeing Senate Republicans attack a nominee for serving as \na law clerk to a distinguished Federal judge. By those standards, does \nthat mean Democrats should oppose anybody who clerked for Justice \nScalia or Justice Thomas because we disagree with some of their \ndecisions? Are we saying we won't confirm those clerks? Boy, I have \ncast some bad votes if we are using that standard because I have voted \nfor people who have been law clerks for judges whose opinions I \ndisagreed with. I was there to vote on the law clerk who may have had a \ndistinguished career in the law, and I look at their career.\n  I urge Senate Republicans to reject this attack, as Senator Kyl and \nothers do, and vote to confirm Justice Hurwitz. Let him be a judge on \nhis own substantial record as a judge. This nominee has been a judge on \nthe Arizona Supreme Court for 9 years. Let's judge him on that record. \nLet's accept the fact that President Obama did what I urged him to do. \nHe talked to the Senators of the State and got their support for his \nnominee. It didn't matter whether they were Republicans or Democrats.\n  In March when the Judiciary Committee voted on Justice Hurwitz's \nnomination, Senator Kyl stated:\n\n       [T]he real question is . . . how he has comported himself \n     in the place where you can really judge [him]--on the Arizona \n     Supreme Court. Not once has an opinion that Justice Hurwitz \n     wrote or joined in been overturned by a higher court.\n\n  Senator Kyl further stated:\n\n       [Justice Hurwitz] is a good example of a person who \n     probably has some views personally that are different from \n     mine, but whose opinions obviously carefully adhere to the \n     law. And, after all, I think that is what most of us are \n     looking for in judicial nominations. So I am pleased to \n     support him without reservation and would urge my colleagues \n     to support his nomination as well.\n\n  I agree with Senator Kyl and commend him.\n  In direct and express answer to a question from Senator Sessions, \nJustice Hurwitz explained that his personal views would have no role in \nhis decisions as a judge, and that they have never played a role in all \nhis years as a judge. We know from Justice Hurwitz's record that he is \na judge's judge. He is a person who meticulously analyzes the law and \napplies the facts of the case to the law. There is no evidence to \ncontend that Justice Hurwitz would not do the same on the Ninth \nCircuit.\n  The Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit along with the members of the \nJudicial Council of the Ninth Circuit, wrote to the Senate months ago \nemphasizing the Ninth Circuit's ``desperate need for judges,'' urging \nthe Senate to ``act on judicial nominees without delay,'' and \nconcluding ``we fear that the public will suffer unless our vacancies \nare filled very promptly.'' The judicial emergency vacancies on the \nNinth Circuit are harming litigants by creating unnecessary and costly \ndelays. The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts reports that it takes \nnearly five months longer for the Ninth Circuit to issue an opinion \nafter an appeal is filed, compared to all other circuits. The Ninth \nCircuit's backlog of pending cases far exceeds other Federal courts. As \nof September 2011, the Ninth Circuit had 14,041 cases pending before \nit, far more than any other circuit.\n  When Senate Republicans filibustered the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to the D.C. Circuit for positions she took while representing \nthe State of New York, they contended that their underlying concern was \nthat the caseload of the D.C. Circuit did not justify the appointment \nof another judge to that Circuit. I disagreed with their treatment of \nCaitlin Halligan, their shifting standards and their purported caseload \nargument. But if caseloads were really a concern, Senate Republicans \nwould not have delayed action on the nominations to judicial emergency \nvacancies on the overburdened Ninth Circuit for months and months.\n  We are still lagging behind what we accomplished during the first \nterm of President George W. Bush. During President Bush's first term we \nreduced the number of judicial vacancies by almost 75 percent. When I \nbecame Chairman in the summer of 2001, there were 110 vacancies. As \nChairman, I worked with the administration and Senators from both sides \nof the aisle to confirm 100 judicial nominees of a conservative \nRepublican President in 17 months.\n  We continued when in the minority to work with Senate Republicans to \nconfirm President Bush's consensus judicial nominations well into 2004, \na presidential election year. At the end of that presidential term, the \nSenate had acted to confirm 205 circuit and district court nominees. In \nMay 2004, we reduced judicial vacancies to below 50 on the way to 28 \nthat August. Despite 2004 being an election year, we were able to \nreduce vacancies to the lowest level in the last 20 years. At a time of \ngreat turmoil and political confrontation, despite the attack on 9/11, \nthe anthrax letters shutting down Senate offices, and the ideologically \ndriven judicial selections of President Bush, we worked together to \npromptly confirm consensus nominees and significantly reduce judicial \nvacancies.\n  In October 2008, another presidential election year, we again worked \nto reduce judicial vacancies and were able to get back down to 34 \nvacancies. I accommodated Senate Republicans and continued holding \nexpedited hearings and votes on judicial nominations into September \n2008. We lowered vacancy rates more than twice as quickly as Senate \nRepublicans have allowed during President Obama's first term.\n  By comparison, the vacancy rate remains nearly twice what it was at \nthis point in the first term of President\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\nBush, and has remained near or above 80 for nearly three years. If we \ncould move forward to Senate votes on the 18 judicial nominees ready \nfor final action, the Senate could reduce vacancies below 60 and make \nprogress.\n  Once the Senate is allowed to vote on this nomination, we need \nagreement to vote on the 17 other judicial nominees stalled on the \nExecutive Calendar. Another point made by the Congressional Research \nService in its recent report is that not a single one of the last three \npresidents has had judicial vacancies increase after their first term. \nIn order to avoid this, the Senate needs to act on these nominees \nbefore adjourning this year.\n  As the Congressional Research Service report makes clear, in five of \nthe last eight presidential election years, the Senate has confirmed at \nleast 22 circuit and district court nominees after May 31. The notable \nexceptions were during the last years of President Clinton's two terms \nin 1996 and 2000 when Senate Republicans would not allow confirmations \nto continue. Otherwise, it has been the rule rather than the exception. \nSo, for example, the Senate confirmed 32 in 1980; 28 in 1984; 31 in \n1992; 28 in 2004 at the end of President George W. Bush's first term; \nand 22 after May 31 in 2008 at the end of President Bush's second term.\n  So let us move forward to confirm Justice Hurwitz. We need to work to \nreduce the vacancies that are burdening the Federal judiciary and the \nmillions of Americans who rely on our Federal courts to seek justice. \nLet's work in a bipartisan fashion to confirm these qualified judicial \nnominees. If we do that, we can address the judicial crisis facing this \ncountry. We may not only restore the faith of the American people in \nthe Federal judiciary but start restoring their faith in the U.S. \nSenate, which is a body I love, which the American people see as being \nfar too polarized. I think that is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Hurwitz Nomination\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to tell my \ncolleagues why they should not support cloture on the Hurwitz \nnomination.\n  On Saturday, December 2, 1989, this 4-year-old boy in the photo, \nChristopher, was dressed in his favorite clothes by his mother Deborah \nMilke. She told him James Styers, who shared the apartment with Debra, \nwould take him to the mall to see Santa Claus. After picking up another \nman, Roger Scott, they stopped at a couple drug stores and then the two \nmen and Christopher had pizza for lunch.\n  Rather than taking Christopher to see Santa Claus at the mall, they \ndrove him to the desert. Christopher was told they were going to look \nfor snakes. Instead, Christopher was shot three times in the back of \nthe head by Styers, his body left in the desert.\n  James Styers, 63, was convicted of first-degree murder of the 4-year-\nold boy, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, child abuse, and \nkidnapping--all supposedly at the request of the boy's mother. Debra \nMilke, James Styers, and Roger Scott were all sentenced to death for \nthe killing.\n  After years of appeals, the case found itself in Federal Court, \nmaking its way to the Ninth Circuit. In 2008, nearly 19 years after the \nterrible crime took place, the Ninth Circuit sent the Styers case back \nto Arizona, claiming that the State court did not adequately consider \nthe post-traumatic stress disorder Styers suffered because of his \nmilitary service in Vietnam.\n  Just about 1 year ago, in June 2011, some 22 years after this \nhorrific, evil event occurred, the Arizona Supreme Court heard the \nappeal. In a 4-to-1 decision, the court acknowledged Styers' post-\ntraumatic stress disorder but nonetheless ruled it didn't outweigh the \naggravating factors found during trial. Styers' death sentence was \nupheld, and he remains on Arizona's death row.\n  The nominee before the Senate, whom we will be voting on, Justice \nAndrew Hurwitz, was the lone dissenter in that 4-to-1 decision. He was \nthe sole person on the Arizona Supreme Court who believed that \nChristopher's murderer should be given another trial.\n  Another trial would have resulted in another round of delays. If he \nhad his way, the victim in this crime would still be awaiting justice. \nArizona taxpayers would be facing unnecessary expenses, and society at \nlarge would still be waiting for a resolution to this case.\n  Today, we are asked by the President and by the majority leader to \nconfirm this judge to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Ninth Circuit. I \nstrongly disagree he should be rewarded with a lifetime appointment to \nthe Federal bench. For reasons I will outline, I oppose this nomination \nand urge all Senators to do likewise. I urge you to vote no on cloture, \nand, if it occurs, on any vote on final confirmation.\n  In the Styers case, Justice Hurwitz acknowledged his position would \nresult in further delay in the case and also conceded it was unlikely a \nnew sentencing proceeding would produce a different result. In his \ndissent, he cited Ring v. Arizona.\n\n  Ring v. Arizona was a case Judge Hurwitz had personally argued before \nthe Supreme Court of the United States in 2002, before his appointment \nto the Arizona Supreme Court. In that case, he argued that Arizona's \ncapital punishment sentence law was unconstitutional, although the \nSupreme Court had previously upheld the Arizona statute in a 1990 \ndecision.\n  Let me make this clear: Mr. Hurwitz, as an attorney, advocated \nagainst the death penalty. This was not just advocacy for a paying \nclient or as a court-appointed attorney. As I have said before, \njudicial nominees should not be judged by the clients they represent. \nBut in this case, Mr. Hurwitz volunteered for this case. He did it on a \npro bono basis. Then, after advocating in this case in private \npractice, he used the same case as the basis for dissenting in another \nArizona death penalty case.\n  Timothy Stuart Ring was sentenced to death in 1996 by an Arizona \nSuperior Court judge for the 1994 killing of John Magoch, an armored \ncar driver. Mr. Hurwitz successfully challenged the Arizona death \npenalty statute. He then argued before the Arizona Supreme Court on \nbehalf of the 29 inmates then on death row in Arizona. Mr. Hurwitz \nasked the Arizona Supreme Court to either throw out each man's death \nsentence and order a new trial or to resentence each to life \nimprisonment with the possibility of parole. According to press \naccounts at the time, Hurwitz said the next step following the Arizona \nv. Ring ruling should be to resentence the inmates to life in prison, \nsaying that allowing the previous death sentence to stand would be a \n``dangerous precedent.'' However, the State's high court refused to \noverturn the convictions and death sentences on a blanket basis, ruling \nthat the trials were fundamentally fair and that the U.S. Supreme \nCourt's ruling didn't require throwing out all death sentences.\n  I believe there is strong evidence that Justice Hurwitz is unable to \ndifferentiate between his personal views and his responsibility as a \njudge. I believe Judge Hurwitz's record suggests that he allows his own \npersonal policy preference to seep into his judicial decisionmaking. \nOthers share this view. The fear that political activism would \ntranslate into judicial activism once on the bench was expressed in the \nfollowing quote from a 2003 article summarizing the various candidates \nfor the seat now occupied by Justice Hurwitz:\n\n       But the final name on the list, Andrew Hurwitz . . . will \n     be a controversial choice for Napolitano, in some ways. He is \n     considered the most liberal of the candidates, even labeled \n     by some as an ideologue. . . . He wears his passion for the \n     law in the open, and eagerly engaged in debates with the \n     commission members about recent death penalty decisions and \n     his past as a member of the Arizona Board of Regents. . . . \n     In the end, the commission almost didn't include Hurwitz's \n     name on the list; he got just eight votes, barely a majority.\n\n  We certainly do not need more of that on the Ninth Circuit.\n  The Styers case was not the only death penalty case in which Justice \nHurwitz was the lone dissenter. In another death case, Donald Beaty was \nconvicted of the May 9, 1984, murder in Tempe of 13-year-old Christy \nAnn Fornoff. She was abducted, sexually assaulted, and suffocated to \ndeath by Beaty while collecting newspaper subscription payments for her \nPhoenix Gazette newspaper route.\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\n  Beaty, who has been on death row since July 1985, was scheduled to \ndie by lethal injection at an Arizona Department of Corrections prison \nin Florence at 10 a.m. on May 25 last year. Again, the victim's family \nand Arizona citizens had to wait 27 years for justice to be served, but \nthey would have to wait a few more hours. Beaty's execution was delayed \nfor most of the day as his defense team tried to challenge the Arizona \nDepartment of Corrections' decision to substitute one drug for another \nin the State's execution drug formula. State and Federal courts denied \nrequests by inmate Donald Beaty to block his scheduled execution \nbecause of a last-minute replacement of one of three execution drugs. \nThe Arizona Supreme Court ruled 4 to 1 to lift the stay. The majority \nheld that Beaty's lawyers hadn't proved he was likely to be harmed by \nthe change. Again, there was one dissenter: Justice Hurwitz. If he had \nhis way, the State would have had to start over with the death warrant \nprocess, leading to additional delays and pain to the victim's family.\n  Meanwhile, U.S. district judge Neal Wake, in Phoenix, refused to \nblock the execution, and the Supreme Court declined to consider two \nstay requests for Beaty. Beaty was pronounced dead at 7:38 p.m., more \nthan 9 hours after his execution had initially been scheduled. Arizona \nattorney general Tom Horne called the daylong delay a ``slap in the \nface'' to the Fornoff family.\n  These cases are not just anecdotal evidence or isolated incidents \ntaken out of context. A study by court watcher and Albany law school \nprofessor Vincent Bonventre validated the prodefendant posture of \nJustice Hurwitz. Let me summarize his results, which I have borrowed \nfrom the Professor's Web site.\n  In a 2008 study, Professor Bonventre examined the criminal decisions \nin which the Arizona Supreme Court was divided over the past 5 years. \nHis graph, the graph I have up here, portrays the voting spectrum--the \nideological proprosecution versus prodefendant spectrum--of the \njustices. As shown in the graph, the greatest contrast is between the \nrecord of then-Chief Justice McGregor and Justice Hurwitz. At one end \nis her record of taking the more proprosecution position in all the \ndivided cases during the 5-year period, and at the other end is Judge \nHurwitz's record. According to this professor, Justice Hurwitz sided \nwith the prodefendant position 83 percent of the time. This is well \noutside the mainstream for other members of this court.\n  All of this leads me to believe that Justice Hurwitz, who in private \npractice only devoted about 2 percent of his litigation practice to \ncriminal law, has deeply held views on the criminal justice system in \ngeneral and the death penalty in particular. We do not need to add \nanother prodefendant, activist judge to the Ninth Circuit or to any \nother court. Victims such as Christopher and Christy, their families, \nand society as a whole deserve better.\n  There is another issue I find extremely troubling regarding Justice \nHurwitz. In 2002 he authorized a Law Review article entitled ``John O. \nNewman and the Abortion Decision: A remarkable first year.'' His \narticle examined two 1972 abortion decisions by Judge Newman, a \ndistrict court judge for the District of Connecticut. Both of \nJudge Newman's decisions struck down Connecticut's law restricting \nabortions.\n\n  Justice Hurwitz's article detailed how those two decisions proved to \nbe incredibly influential on the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision \nless than a year later. In fact, Judge Hurwitz argued that Judge \nNewman's opinions provided the framework for Roe. More specifically, \nthe much criticized viability cutoff point that formed the basis of Roe \ncame directly from Judge Newman's opinion.\n  In his article, Judge Hurwitz noted how influential Judge Newman's \nopinion was on the Supreme Court's decision to adopt viability as a \ncutoff point for legal abortion, rather than the first trimester. He \nstated:\n\n       Judge Newman's Abele II opinion not only had a profound \n     effect on the United States Supreme Court's reasoning, but on \n     the length of time that a pregnant woman would have the \n     opportunity to seek an abortion.\n\n  Justice Hurwitz had a unique perspective and insight into how these \nevents unfolded. As a young lawyer, Justice Hurwitz clerked for Judge \nNewman in 1972 when he drafted the abortion decisions. Then, in the \nfall of that year and several weeks after Judge Newman's second \nabortion decision was released, Justice Hurwitz interviewed for Supreme \nCourt clerkships. At the time, the Supreme Court Justices were \nconsidering Roe. In fact, they were trading drafts of the Court's \nopinion which was eventually handed down in January of 1973.\n  Justice Hurwitz further noted in his article that when he interviewed \nfor Supreme Court clerkships, it became clear to him how influential \nJudge Newman's opinion was on the Court, meaning the Supreme Court. \nJustice Hurwitz wrote:\n\n       The author received some small inkling of the influence of \n     Abele II on the Court's thinking in the fall of 1972, when \n     interviewing for clerkships at the Supreme Court. Justice \n     Powell devoted over an hour of conversation to a discussion \n     of Judge Newman's analysis, while Justice Stewart (my future \n     boss) jokingly referred to me as ``the clerk who wrote the \n     Newman opinion.''\n\n  Now, I recognize that Judge Hurwitz was clerking for a Federal judge. \nIt was Judge Newman who signed those abortion opinions and Judge Newman \nwho was ultimately responsible for them. My primary concern rests on \nthe article Justice Hurwitz wrote 30 years later, in 2002, embracing \nand celebrating the rationale and framework for Roe v. Wade. Justice \nHurwitz praised Judge Newman's opinion for its ``careful and meticulous \nanalysis of the competing constitutional issues.'' He called the \nopinion ``striking, even in hindsight.'' Let me remind everyone that \nthe constitutional issues and analysis he praises are Newman's \ninfluence on the Supreme Court's expansion of the ``right'' to abortion \nbeyond the first trimester of pregnancy. This, Hurwitz wrote, \n``effectively doubled the period of time in which States were barred \nfrom absolutely prohibiting abortions.''\n  Furthermore, Newman's opinion in Abele II was even more drastic and \nfar-reaching than Roe turned out to be. He said that the ``right'' to \nabortion could be found in the ninth amendment, a theory about \nunenumerated rights that the Supreme Court rejected in Roe and has not \nendorsed elsewhere.\n  Hurwitz's article was clearly an attempt to attribute great \nsignificance to the decisions in which the judge for whom he had \nclerked had participated. I think that by any fair measure, it is \nimpossible to read Justice Hurwitz's article and not conclude that he \nwholeheartedly embraces Roe and, importantly, the constitutional \narguments that supposedly support Roe. He takes this view despite near \nuniversal agreement among both liberal and conservative legal scholars \nthat Roe is one of the worst examples of judicial activism in our \nNation's history. For example, Professor Tribe, a liberal \nconstitutional law scholar, wrote:\n\n       One of the most curious things about Roe is that behind its \n     own verbal smokescreen, the substantive judgment on which it \n     rests is nowhere to be found.\n\n  Stuart Taylor wrote:\n\n       Roe v. Wade did considerable violence to the constitutional \n     fabric. When the 7 2 decision came down in 1973, very few \n     scholars thought its result could plausibly be derived from \n     the Constitution; not one that I know of considered \n     Blackman's opinion a respectable piece of constitutional \n     reasoning.\n\n  Even Justice Ginsburg has repeatedly criticized Roe. She wrote that \nthe Court's ``heavy-handed judicial intervention was difficult to \njustify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.''\n  We are not talking about an article published shortly after \ngraduating from law school. Mr. Hurwitz published it 30 years after \ngraduating from law school, when he was well established and a seasoned \nlawyer. In fact, he published this article shortly before joining the \nArizona Supreme Court. All of this leads me to question his ability to \nbe objective should this issue come before him if he is confirmed to \nthe Ninth Circuit.\n  I would note the following groups have expressed opposition to this \nnomination: the National Right to Life, Heritage Action, Concerned \nWomen for America, Faith and Freedom Coalition, Liberty Counsel Action, \nFamily Research Council, Eagle Forum, Traditional Values Coalition, \nAmericans United for Life, Susan B. Anthony List, American Center for \nLaw and Justice, Judicial Confirmation Network, and\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\nJudicial Action Group have written in opposition to this nomination. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of these \nletters.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Right to Life\n\n\n                                              Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2012.\n     Re NRLC scorecard advisory in opposition to cloture on the \n         nomination of Andrew Hurwitz to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n         for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n     Sen. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: On Monday, June 11, the Senate will \n     vote on whether to invoke cloture on the nomination of Andrew \n     D. Hurwitz to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit. The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), the \n     nationwide federation of state right-to-life organizations, \n     urges you to vote against cloture, and reserves the right to \n     include the roll call on cloture in the NRLC scorecard of key \n     right-to-life votes of the 112th Congress.\n       In 1972, Hurwitz was a clerk to Jon O. Newman, a U.S. \n     District Judge for the District of Connecticut. During the \n     time that Hurwitz was Newman's clerk, Newman issued a \n     sweeping ruling that struck down a recently enacted \n     Connecticut law that prohibited abortion except to save the \n     life of mother. The Newman ruling--styled as Abele II--was \n     issued the year before the U.S. Supreme Court handed down Roe \n     v. Wade, but after the Supreme Court had conducted the first \n     of two rounds of oral arguments in that case.\n       In Abele II, Newman enunciated a new constitutional \n     doctrine under which state prohibitions on abortion prior to \n     ``viability'' would be deemed to be violations of a \n     constitutional ``right to privacy.'' Newman's ruling left it \n     an open question to what extent a state would be permitted to \n     apply limitations on abortion even after ``viability.''\n       In 2002, when Hurwitz was 55 years old and already a \n     justice on the Arizona supreme court, he authored an article \n     titled, ``Jon O. Newman and the Abortion Decisions,'' which \n     appeared in the New York Law School Law Review. In this \n     article, Hurwitz argues that Newman's Abele II ruling heavily \n     influenced the then-ongoing deliberations of the U.S. Supreme \n     Court in Roe v. Wade. Hurwitz makes a persuasive case for his \n     thesis, citing comments made by Supreme Court justices during \n     the second round of oral arguments in the Roe case, \n     information from the now-public archives of some of the \n     justices who were involved, and personal conversations with \n     Justice Stewart (for whom Hurwitz clerked in 1973 74) and \n     others who were directly involved in the crafting of Roe v. \n     Wade.\n       Hurwitz provides particularly detailed and plausible \n     evidence that Newman's opinion was instrumental in persuading \n     Justice Blackmun to abandon a draft opinion that would have \n     limited the ``right to abortion'' to the first three months \n     of pregnancy, and to adopt instead the more sweeping doctrine \n     laid down in the final Roe v. Wade ruling, under which states \n     were barred from placing any meaningful limitation on \n     abortion at any point prior to ``viability'' (and severely \n     circumscribed from doing so even after ``viability'').\n       Hurwitz wrote: ``This viability dictim, first introduced by \n     Justice Blackmun into the Roe drafts only after Justice \n     Powell had urged that he follow Judge Newman's lead, \n     effectively doubled the period of time in which states were \n     barred from absolutely prohibiting abortions . . . Judge \n     Newman's Abele II opinion not only had a profound effect on \n     the United States Supreme Court's reasoning, but on the \n     length of time that a pregnant woman would have the \n     opportunity to seek an abortion.'' The entire tone of \n     Hurwitz's article leaves no doubt that he considers Newman's \n     role in leading the Supreme Court majority to adopt a much \n     more expansive right to abortion than otherwise might have \n     occurred, to be a major positive achievement of Newman's \n     career.\n       Roe v. Wade has been critiqued as constitutionally \n     indefensible even by liberal legal scholars who agree with \n     legal abortion as social policy. Many others believe that \n     Newman and the Supreme Court justices who Hurwitz asserts \n     followed Newman's ``lead,'' were engaged in a super-\n     legislative activity--an exercise memorably denounced by \n     dissenting Justice Byron White as ``an exercise in raw \n     judicial power.'' Of these critiques, there is no hint in \n     Hurwitz's presentation, which is laudatory from start to \n     finish.\n       The recasting of the draft Roe ruling, which Hurwitz \n     credibly attributes to Newman's influence, had far-reaching \n     consequences. The absolute number of abortions performed \n     nationwide in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months of \n     pregnancy increased greatly after Roe was handed down. \n     Abortion methods were refined, under the shield of Roe, to \n     more efficiently kill unborn human beings in the fourth month \n     and later. The most common method currently employed is the \n     ``D,'' in which the abortionist twists off the unborn \n     child's individual arms and legs by brute manual force, using \n     a long steel Sopher clamp. (This method is depicted in a \n     technical medical illustration here: http://www.nr1c.org/\nabortion/pba/DEabortiongraphic.html) Well over four million \n     second-trimester abortions have been performed since Roe was \n     handed down.\n       This carnage is in part the legacy of Jon O. Newman--but \n     Judge Hurwitz clearly wants to claim a measure of the credit \n     for himself, as well. In Footnote no. 55 of his article, \n     Hurwitz relates a 1972 interview in which Justice Stewart \n     ``jokingly referred to me as `the clerk who wrote the Newman \n     opinion'.'' Hurwitz remarks that this characterization ``I \n     assume . . . was based on Judge Newman's generous letter of \n     recommendation, a medium in which some exaggeration is \n     expected.'' It is impossible to read Footnote 55 without \n     concluding that Judge Hurwitz could not resist the \n     opportunity to put on record his personal claim to having \n     played an important role in the development of the expansive \n     abortion right ultimately adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       NRLC urges you to oppose cloture on the nomination of Judge \n     Hurwitz, and reserves the right to include the cloture vote \n     in the NRLC scorecard for the 112th Congress.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Douglas Johnson,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From Heritage Action for America, June 8, 2012]\n\n       Key Vote Alert: ``No'' on the Nomination of Andrew Hurwitz\n\n       On Monday (June 11), the Senate is scheduled to vote on the \n     nomination of Andrew Hurwitz to the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. Mr. Hurwitz's previous actions and writings raise \n     serious questions as to whether he'd be able to follow the \n     rule of law from the bench.\n       In the past, Mr. Hurwitz has encouraged courts to legislate \n     from the bench. In the Supreme Court case of Ring v. Arizona, \n     he suggested the Supreme Court change the wording of the \n     Constitution in order to achieve a ruling based on his \n     beliefs, which would have made the state's death penalty \n     sentencing unconstitutional. He believed so strongly in the \n     cause of this case that he worked pro bono.\n       His foray into activist-legislating was not limited to that \n     case, though. He has also said that would look to previous \n     Supreme Court decisions on relevant issues before consulting \n     the United States Constitution. He also believes that Judges \n     have the power--and supposedly the better judgment--to bestow \n     rights upon American citizens, outside of the law.\n       Placing personal beliefs ahead of the law and the \n     Constitution, as Mr. Hurwitz appears to do, is a dangerous \n     subversion of the rule of law. Those who support the rule of \n     law, and the role it plays in civil society, cannot allow \n     such judges to be confirmed.\n       Heritage Action opposes the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz \n     and will include it as a key vote in our scorecard.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Concerned Women For America,\n\n\n                                 Legislative Action Committee,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 15, 2012.\n     Senator,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Concerned Women for America Legislative \n     Action Committee (CWALAC) and its more than half a million \n     members around the country respectfully ask that you oppose \n     the nomination of Andrew David Hurwitz to be a United States \n     Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.\n       Roe v. Wade represents one of the most blatant disregards \n     for the U.S. Constitution and our founding principles in \n     American history. Nearly every sincere legal scholar, \n     including many committed liberal ones, admit its arguments \n     are not based in law.\n       Edward Lazarus, for example, who clerked for Roe's author, \n     Justice Blackmun, has said, ``As a matter of constitutional \n     interpretation and judicial method, Roe borders on the \n     indefensible. . . . Justice Blackmun's opinion provides \n     essentially no reasoning in support of its holding.''\n       That is why it is inexcusable for Mr. Hurwitz to take pride \n     in helping craft the decision that provided the underlining \n     arguments for it, as he helped craft a similar decision when \n     he clerked for District Judge Jon O. Newman of the District \n     of Connecticut. Hurwitz proudly recounts how he was referred \n     to as ``the clerk who wrote the Newman opinion,'' the \n     decision that served as the basis for Roe, when he went on to \n     apply for clerkships at the Supreme Court.\n       As a women's organization we simply cannot overlook the \n     pain that Mr. Hurwitz's radical view of the Constitution has \n     brought women. As the Supreme Court finally admitted on its \n     recent partial-birth abortion decision in Gonzalez v. \n     Carhart:\n       ``It is self-evident that a mother who comes to regret her \n     choice to abort must struggle with grief more anguished and \n     sorrow more profound when she learns, only after the event, \n     what she once did not know: that she allowed a doctor to \n     pierce the skull and vacuum the fast-developing brain of her \n     unborn child.''\n       That grief and anguish are the practical results of Mr. \n     Hurwitz's legal theory refusing to recognize the unborn baby \n     as a ``person'' until the baby is born. We urge you to oppose \n     this nomination, and we plan to score each and every vote on \n     it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Penny Nance,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                    FRCAction,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 2012.\n     Senator,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Family Research Council Action \n     (FRCA), the legislative arm of the Family Research Council, \n     and the families we represent, I want to urge you to vote NO \n     on the confirmation of Andrew Hurwitz to the U.S. Ninth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. In a 2003 Law Review article \n     entitled John O. Newman and the Abortion Decision, Mr. \n     Hurwitz praises a Connecticut District Judge for the \n     prescient and seminal role he played in informing Roe v. \n     Wade. This article revealed, not only his admiration for the \n     Judge (for whom he was clerking at the time), but also a \n     disquieting admiration for Roe and its tenuous foundation.\n       A modicum of privilege can be sensed as Mr. Hurwitz \n     recounts his clerkship during the ``remarkable'' months of \n     1972 as Roe was being argued. That year he had caught the \n     attention of the Supreme Court while aiding Judge Newman in \n     casting the swing vote in a case ushering abortion into \n     Connecticut. Indeed, in one footnote (55) of his essay, \n     Hurwitz speaks candidly of the reputation he had with Supreme \n     Court Justice Stewart as ``the clerk who wrote the Newman \n     Opinion.''\n       It is telling that at a time when many scholars are \n     abandoning the divisive and indefensible position of Roe, \n     Hurwitz comes to its defense for reasons that, given his \n     history, cannot be ruled out as personal.\n       In his article, Mr. Hurwitz commends Judge Newman for his \n     ``careful and meticulous analysis of the competing \n     constitutional issues.'' Hurwitz wrote, ``He [Newman] placed \n     primary reliance on the natural implications of Griswold: if \n     the capacity of a fetus to be born made it a person endowed \n     with Fourteenth Amendment Rights, the same conclusion would \n     seemingly also apply to the unfertilized ovum, whose \n     potentiality for human life could be terminated under \n     Griswold.'' One can hardly call the analysis that fails to \n     see the difference between an unfertilized ovum and a fetus \n     ``meticulous'' yet Hurwitz claims its still, ``striking after \n     30 years.''\n       This failure to distinguish a fetus from an unfertilized \n     ovum is part of a larger inability to understand the question \n     of when life begins through a biological lens. Hurwitz \n     recalls a ``candid concession'' made by Newman (presumably \n     shared by himself) who confided he felt the issue of when \n     life begins was ultimately philosophical rather than legal \n     when, in fact, it is neither.\n       Finally, Mr. Hurwitz praises Judge Newman on his insight \n     regarding allowing limitations to abortion after viability as \n     opposed to the first trimester. This stance he claims greatly \n     influenced Blackmun in the Roe decision to ``effectively \n     double the period of time in which states were barred from \n     absolutely prohibiting abortions.'' This position is one that \n     many state and congressional lawmakers have found morally \n     objectionable due to medical research demonstrating the \n     fetus' ability to feel pain as early as 18 weeks.\n       Mr. Hurwitz's vaulting regard for Roe, his personal \n     involvement in its formulation and his inability to see its \n     shortcomings, offer no assurances he will arbitrate \n     impartially from the bench. For these reasons we urge you to \n     oppose the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz to the Ninth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Thomas McClusky,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: Andrew David Hurwitz is the self-\n     titled architect of Roe v. Wade, a court decision responsible \n     for the 55 million abortions performed in the United States \n     since 1973 while proudly trumpeting his repeal of the death \n     penalty in Arizona as ``the best episode'' of his career in \n     private practice.\n       Babies get the death penalty. But murderers don't? Hurwitz \n     is unqualified to serve on the federal bench.\n       Not only are Hurwitz's views on justice way beyond the \n     mainstream, Hurwitz's pride--for lack of a better term--over \n     Roe v. Wade is simply appalling even to the most jaded \n     observer of American politics. Such is this pride that \n     Hurwitz has gone out of his way to specifically identify \n     himself with the license Roe v. Wade introduced into American \n     culture, despite some question as to his actual influence.\n       Moreover, Hurwitz refuses to do what most members of the \n     legal community have already done, namely back away from the \n     legal premise underlying Roe v. Wade.\n       The confirmation of such a nominee to an already extremely \n     liberal Ninth Circuit court would be an immediate disaster. \n     Anyone who allows Hurwitz a free pass sends an extraordinary \n     clear sign that Senate Republicans would govern no \n     differently than the liberal Senate we have today.\n       Traditional Values Coalition on behalf of our 43,000 \n     churches and ministries and the millions of Americas we \n     represent will be scoring this critical make-or-break vote. \n     If not on Hurwitz, where will our conservative leaders make a \n     stand?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Andrea Lafferty,\n     President, Traditional Values Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                February 27, 2012.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing today on behalf of Americans \n     United for Life Action (AUL Action)--the legislative arm of \n     Americans United for Life (AUL), the oldest national pro-life \n     public-interest law and policy organization--to express our \n     strong opposition to the nomination of Justice Andrew David \n     Hurwitz to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. We respectfully \n     urge you to oppose his nomination.\n       We believe that it is important to focus on the period of \n     Justice Hurwitz's clerkship for United States District Judge \n     Jon O. Newman, despite the fact that it was four decades ago. \n     His clerkship is important because it reveals Hurwitz to be a \n     supporter both of judicial activism and of extreme pro-\n     abortion views.\n       Justice Hurwitz clerked for Judge Newman during his first \n     year on the court. During this time, Newman authored opinions \n     in two abortion decisions striking down Connecticut's \n     abortion restrictions, commonly known as Abele I and Abele \n     II.\n       It became well known that Hurwitz played a significant role \n     in shaping these decisions. Hurwitz admitted that Supreme \n     Court Justice Potter Stewart, for whom he later clerked, \n     ``jokingly referred to me as `the clerk who wrote [Abele \n     II].' ''\n       Abele II was a radical opinion, the anti-life influence of \n     which is still with us today. Two features of Abele II are \n     pillars of Roe: the conclusion that a ``fetus'' is not a \n     ``person'' under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the singling \n     out of ``viability'' as the point in time before which the \n     state has no interest in protecting the lives of unborn \n     babies.\n       Hurwitz has done nothing to distance himself from these \n     extreme positions in the intervening years. To the contrary, \n     he has embraced--and even celebrated--them. In his article \n     from 2002 on Judge Newman, he praised the Abele II ruling.\n       Americans want judges who apply the law, not make policy. \n     As someone who greatly influenced one of the most divisive \n     and constitutionally unfounded Supreme Court decisions in our \n     nation's history, Justice Hurwitz is not qualified to serve \n     on a federal circuit court.\n       We respectfully ask that you vote against Justice Hurwitz's \n     nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Charmaine Yoest,\n\n                                                  President & CEO,\n     Americans United for Life.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Center\n\n\n                                            for Law & Justice,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2012.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: The \n     American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) is writing to \n     express its concerns about the nomination of Andrew D. \n     Hurwitz to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit.\n       Justice Hurwitz's outspoken defense of Roe v. Wade forces \n     us to conclude that he is unable to be a neutral and \n     impartial judge and will likely attempt to legislate from the \n     bench. Not only does he support the holding of Roe, but he \n     also adamantly supports its long discredited reasoning. As \n     explained by the law clerk who assisted Justice Blackmun in \n     authoring the Roe opinion, ``As a matter of constitutional \n     interpretation and judicial method, Roe borders on the \n     indefensible'' and ``Roe must be ranked among the most \n     damaging of judicial decisions.''\n       In a 2002 law review article, Justice Hurwitz praised the \n     reasoning of Roe and proudly discussed how he helped author \n     the opinion that influenced the Roe decision. In 1972, he was \n     the clerk for Connecticut District Court Judge Jon O. Newman \n     when Judge Newman wrote the opinion in Abele v. Markum \n     (commonly known as Abele II, which used a ``viability'' \n     standard in evaluating a right to abortion. Abele II was \n     released just three weeks before the Supreme Court heard re-\n     argument in Roe and eventually ruled that a woman had a \n     constitutional right to an abortion before viability. Justice \n     Hurwitz states that the reasoning in Abele II ``was in almost \n     perfect lockstep'' with Roe, and it ``not only had a profound \n     effect on the United States Supreme Court's reasoning, but on \n     the length of time that a pregnant woman would have the \n     opportunity to seek an abortion.''\n       The pride Justice Hurwitz takes in having helped author the \n     opinion that influenced Roe reveals the scope and passion of \n     his judicial activism. In his 2002 article he states of his \n     Supreme Court clerkship interviews:\n       Justice Powell devoted over an hour of conversation to a \n     discussion of Judge Newman's analysis, while Justice Stewart \n     (my future boss) jokingly referred to me as `the clerk who \n     wrote the Newman opinion.' I assume that the latter was based \n     on Judge Newman's generous letter of recommendation, a medium \n     in which some exaggeration is expected.\n       Roe and Abele II are two notorious examples of judges \n     legislating from the bench. Given his involvement with Abele \n     II and his pride in its effect on Roe, Justice Hurwitz \n     confirms his admiration for an activist judiciary. Every \n     judge must be neutral, objective, and faithful to the \n     Constitution and our\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\n     laws. This must be especially true of appellate judges. \n     Because the United States Supreme Court hears very few cases \n     (approximately 100 per year), federal circuit courts have the \n     final say on the vast majority of cases in the federal \n     system. Between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011, the Ninth \n     Circuit terminated more than 13,000 appeals. Because of the \n     vast number of cases heard by the federal Courts of Appeals, \n     especially the Ninth Circuit, it is critical that only \n     neutral, impartial judges are elevated to those courts. \n     Justice Hurwitz's support for the long discredited reasoning \n     and activism of Roe and his role in constructing the Abele II \n     opinion that influenced Roe starkly indicate his bias, his \n     comfort with extra-constitutional decision making, and a \n     desire to legislate from the bench.\n       We urge the Committee to carefully consider the important \n     issues noted above as they review Justice Hurwitz's \n     nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jay A. Sekulow,\n     Chief Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Judicial Action Group,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n                         Andrew David Hurwitz--\n\n              Nominee to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\n\n\n Hurwitz: The ``The Architect'' and ``Lone Remaining Defender'' of Roe \n                                v. Wade\n\n       Action: Contact the Senate Judiciary Committee Members and \n     tell them to vote ``no'' on Hurwitz on Thursday, 3/1/12.\n       Hurwitz acted as a key author of abortion court decisions \n     that were eventually relied upon by the Supreme Court in Roe \n     v. Wade. As a young law clerk to Judge Jon O. Newman (U.S. \n     District Court Judge for the Dist. of Connecticut) Hurwitz \n     played a key role in authoring two 1972 decisions which the \n     U.S. Supreme Court mimicked and expanded in the majority \n     opinion of Roe v. Wade. According to Hurwitz in his law \n     review article dedicated to the 1972 pro-abortion decisions \n     that he helped author, Newman ``had an enormously productive \n     and influential first year. Twice confronted . . . with cases \n     challenging the constitutionality of Connecticut's anti-\n     abortion statute, he [we] produced two memorable [pro-\n     abortion] opinions.'' As Judge Newman's Law Clerk, Hurwitz \n     played a significant role in authoring these opinions. \n     Hurwitz claims that these pro abortion decisions influenced \n     the Supreme Court's decision in Roe and Hurwitz makes it \n     clear that he is very proud of his role in these pro-abortion \n     decisions. Hurwitz claims:\n       ``One need no longer speculate on the point: it is now \n     clear that Jon O. Newman [and Hurwitz] had, in words of one \n     historian, `crucial influence' on both the outcome and the \n     reasoning in the [Roe v. Wade] case.''\n       ` ``[I] received some small inkling of the influence of \n     Abele II [Judge Newman's pro-abortion decision] on the \n     [Supreme] Court's thinking [in Roe v. Wade] in the fall of \n     1972, when interviewing for clerkships at the Supreme Court . \n     . . Justice Stewart (my future boss) jokingly referred to me \n     as `the clerk who wrote the [pro-abortion] Newman opinion.''\n       Hurwitz's continued celebration of Roe places him far \n     outside the mainstream even among liberal legal experts. \n     While legal experts on both ends of the Abortion debate have \n     wisely chosen to back away from the indefensibly \n     extrapolative arguments made in the Court's decision in Roe, \n     Hurwitz instead chooses to celebrate the patently activist \n     conclusions of this ruling.\n       Hurwitz continues to take pride in his role crafting the \n     case that had `` `Crucial Influence' on both the outcome and \n     the reasoning in Roe v. Wade].'' Roe is not only a \n     constitutional abomination but also a moral abomination that \n     has resulted in judicial sanction of the killing of tens of \n     millions of unborn children. Hurwitz should be ashamed of his \n     role in Roe. His pride in his role in Roe is expressed not \n     only as a young law clerk in 1972 but as recently as 2003, at \n     the age of 52. Hurwitz's pride in his role in Roe is cause \n     for great concern.\n       Hurwitz refused to answer the questions of Senators \n     Grassley and Sessions regarding his role in the pro abortion \n     decision, even though he previously wrote about and praised \n     it. In response to several questions from Senator Grassley \n     and Senator Sessions, Hurwitz refused to answer, claiming ``I \n     do not think it appropriate for a former law clerk to comment \n     on the correctness of an opinion written by a judge during \n     the clerkship term.'' However, Hurwitz previously commented \n     extensively on the same (Abele) decisions extensively in a \n     law review article, bragging about his role in the decision \n     and even going so far as to praise the decision as a \n     ``careful and meticulous analysis of the competing \n     constitutional issues.'' The decision was not a ``careful and \n     meticulous analysis,'' and reasonable legal scholars (liberal \n     and conservative) do not differ on that point.\n       Hurwitz celebrates his role in the Supreme Court's activist \n     decision striking down Arizona's death penalty scheme as the \n     best episode of his private practice. Senator Sessions asked \n     Judge Hurwitz to explain his role in Ring:\n       ``You served as pro bono as lead counsel in the seminal \n     Supreme Court case of Ring v. Arizona, which struck down \n     Arizona's death penalty sentencing scheme as \n     unconstitutional, and also invalidated several other States' \n     statutes as well. You were quoted in an article by the \n     Arizona Attorney newsletter as saying that the experience was \n     `the best episode in [your] wonderful career in private \n     practice.' ''\n       Hurwitz responded tersely: ``I was referring to the \n     experience of arguing before the Supreme Court.''\n       Hurwitz's response fails to acknowledge, however, that he \n     invited and encouraged the Court to legislate from the bench \n     and to effectively change the very wording of the \n     Constitution to arrive at a brand new result. Hurwitz \n     invitation for the court to usurp legislative power is a \n     shameful act and would not be made by any attorney who \n     respects the text of the constitution. Moreover, Hurwitz so \n     believed in the activist cause of the Ring case that he \n     performed his legal services for free, i.e., pro bono.\n       Hurwitz would side with activist judges, even when in \n     conflict with the Constitution. In response to written \n     questions from Senator Jeff Sessions, Hurwitz states: ``I do \n     not believe that the Constitution changes from one day to the \n     next, although I recognize that the Supreme Court may \n     effectively produce that result when it overrules a prior \n     decision.'' Even while recognizing that the Court cannot \n     legislate from the bench and change the meaning of the \n     Constitution, Hurwitz states that he would not look first to \n     the constitution and other laws, but would only consider the \n     Constitution if other judges had not already addresses an \n     issue in a given case. Hurwitz replied to Senator Sessions: \n     ``I would of course look to binding Supreme Court precedent \n     first. If there were none, I would then look to precedents \n     within my circuit. Assuming that neither my circuit nor the \n     Supreme Court had addressed the issue, I would then analyze \n     the language of the statute and the Constitution.''\n       Hurwitz asserts that Constitutional Rights--such as the \n     right to privacy--can be created by judges. Hurwitz believes \n     that rights can be created outside of the law, by judges who \n     decide on their own whether those rights are `deeply rooted \n     in this Nation's history and tradition.' Washington v. \n     Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 21 (1997).'' Hurwitz wrote to \n     Senator Grassley: ``The Court has held that the due process \n     clauses protect certain fundamental rights and that the right \n     to privacy is one of those rights.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In addition, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter signed by a variety of leaders expressing their \nopposition to this nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 24, 2012.\n     Re Opposition to Andrew David Hurwitz.\n\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: Your long and distinguished career in the \n     Senate has given us many opportunities to agree with each \n     other, particularly on the issues of life and defense of the \n     unborn. In recognition of this legacy, we respectfully ask \n     that you vote ``nay'' on the question of the confirmation of \n     Andrew David Hurwitz to the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Ninth Circuit, and that you encourage your Senate \n     colleagues to do the same.\n       Hurwitz was a key author of two pro-abortion court \n     decisions whose rationale was significantly relied upon by \n     the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. As a young law clerk to \n     Judge Jon O. Newman (U.S. District Court Judge for the Dist. \n     of Connecticut) Hurwitz played a key role in authoring two \n     1972 decisions which the U.S. Supreme Court mimicked and \n     expanded in the majority opinion of Roe v. Wade. Hurwitz \n     accurately claims that these pro-abortion decisions \n     influenced the Supreme Court's decision in Roe and Hurwitz \n     makes it clear that he is proud of his role in these pro-\n     abortion decisions. Hurwitz wrote:\n       ``One need no longer speculate on the point: it is now \n     clear that Jon O. Newman [and Hurwitz] had, in words [sic] of \n     one historian, `crucial influence' on both the outcome and \n     the reasoning in the [Roe v. Wade] case.''\n       Hurwitz continued:\n       ``[I] received some small inkling of the influence of Abele \n     II [Judge Newman's pro-abortion decision] on the [Supreme] \n     Court's thinking [in Roe v. Wade] in the fall of 1972, when \n     interviewing for clerkships at the Supreme Court . . . \n     Justice Stewart (my future boss) jokingly referred to me as \n     `the clerk who wrote the [pro-abortion] Newman opinion.' ''\n       While legal experts on both ends of the abortion debate \n     have wisely chosen to back away from the constitutionally \n     indefensible ``reasoning'' of the Court's decision in Roe, \n     Hurwitz instead chose to celebrate it. Hurwitz's recent and \n     continued celebration of Roe places him far outside the \n     mainstream of legal thought and demonstrates his fundamental \n     misunderstanding of the Constitutional role of the Judiciary. \n     As such, Hurwitz is one of President Obama's most \n     controversial and dangerous nominees.\n       Hurwitz's professional record is distinguished by his \n     significant contribution to--and defense of--one of the most \n     activist Supreme Court opinions in history. As such, any vote \n     for Hurwitz would stand as a tacit--if not outright--\n     endorsement of his radical views on abortion and the \n     constitutional role of the judiciary. One of the most \n     enduring legacies of United States Senators is determined by \n     the records of judges that they voted to confirm. In light of \n     your past work to defend life, we ask that you withdraw\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\n     your support for Hurwitz and that you encourage your \n     colleagues to vote against his confirmation.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a different subject \nprimarily, but in view of my colleague's comments and my disagreement \nwith them, let me just make a note of my position.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I certainly respect my colleague from Iowa. \nLike him, my views on the issue of abortion are very decidedly pro-\nlife, and I too disagree with the decision in Roe v. Wade. I agree with \nhim that many legal scholars believe that decision rests on very shaky \nlegal grounds.\n  But I would say this about Andrew Hurwitz, the nominee who will be \nbefore us: Never in any decision he has rendered as a member of the \nArizona Supreme Court has anybody I know believed he let his personal \nviews, his personal philosophic or political views determine his \njudicial rulings. To the contrary, everyone with whom I have spoken, \nand to the degree I have been able to study his career of about a \ndecade on the Arizona Supreme Court, it is remarkably free of the kind \nof politics that sometimes infuses judicial decisionmaking.\n  His opinions are well considered, based on the law, well written, and \ngenerally a part of a consensus court. There are both Republicans and \nDemocrats on the Arizona Supreme Court, and Justice Hurwitz is usually \nwith his other colleagues on the court in deciding these matters.\n  I think it is unfair to an extent that because he wrote a Law Review \narticle several years ago in which one can assume he expressed a pro-\nchoice point of view that therefore somehow he would be disqualified \nfrom serving on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In fact, here is \nsome breaking news: President Obama nominates pro-choice candidates to \ncourts. Obviously, I am being facetious.\n  I suspect most of President Obama's nominees are pro-choice. I don't \nask the nominees I consult with, the ones we recommend from the State \nof Arizona, what their view is on any particular issue, including that \nissue. But I can assume the nominees of President Obama are probably \nmore liberal--and are pro-choice--on that particular issue than my \nviews. But President Obama is the President. He gets to nominate \npeople. So I have to work with his White House Counsel to try to find \nthe best possible people with two primary qualifications: One, how good \na judge would that individual be in intelligence, judicial temperament, \nthe kinds of things that make a good judge?\n  Secondly--and this is very important to me--will this judge decide \ncases based on the law, period, the facts of the case and the law, and \nthe U.S. Constitution or will the nominee potentially allow his or her \nown personal preferences, political points of view, and philosophy to \nbe a part of the decisionmaking process?\n  If I believe it is the latter, then I will not support a nominee. I \nhave opposed nominees right here on the Senate floor based on that test \nwhere I thought that based on the hearing and the record of the nominee \nthat the individual could have a hard time separating out their own \npolitical judgments from deciding cases. Then I voted no.\n  This is a nominee I not only gladly vote yes on, but I am, frankly, \nasking my colleagues to vote yes because I absolutely, totally believe \nhe will decide cases based upon the merits of the case, the facts, and \nthe law, not based on the politics.\n  Interestingly, on this one particular issue, to my knowledge there \nhas not been an issue before the Arizona Supreme Court in the last \ndecade, while he has been on the court, which would call on him to \ndecide it one way or the other. So neither side can say, well, he \ndidn't allow it to happen or he did allow it to happen. We have not \nbeen able to find any case like that.\n  There have been other political kinds of issues that have come before \nthe court--issues dealing with the death penalty and things of that \nsort. As I said, neither my conservative friends back in Arizona nor I \nhave been able to find a case in which Justice Andrew Hurwitz's \ndecisions have been based on anything other than a pretty clear reading \nof the law as applied to the facts of the case. I have every reason to \nbelieve in his honesty and his integrity in continuing that practice, \nwhich he has manifested over the last decade, if and when he is \nconfirmed to the Ninth Circuit Court Of Appeals or I would not have \nrecommended him to the administration, and I would not be recommending \nhim to my colleagues.\n  So with all due respect to my good friend from Iowa, whose views I \nshare on the question of abortion, I think it would be wrong to oppose \nthis nominee based on that fact.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong \nsupport of the nomination of Arizona Supreme Court Justice Andrew \nHurwitz to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  The Ninth Circuit is the busiest Federal appellate court in the \nNation. It has over 1,400 appeals pending per three-judge panel. This \nis the most of any circuit, and it is over two times the average of \nother circuits combined. Think of that: It is twice as heavily busy \nwith cases as the average of the other circuits combined.\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States has declared each Ninth \nCircuit vacancy a judicial emergency. So today we are considering a \nnominee to a judicial emergency vacancy. The nominee is Justice Andrew \nHurwitz of the Arizona Supreme Court, and he is very well respected. He \nis seasoned. He has over 25 years of practical experience and 9 years \non the State supreme court. He has the strong support of the two \nRepublican Senators from his home State, Jon Kyl and John McCain.\n  Candidly, I am surprised that a cloture vote is necessary. This body \nshould be able to confirm this nominee without controversy. So I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for cloture and to support this nomination.\n  Justice Hurwitz earned his bachelor's degree from Princeton \nUniversity, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1968. He earned his law degree from Yale \nLaw School in 1972 where he was note and comment editor of the Yale Law \nJournal.\n  Following graduation, Justice Hurwitz clerked for three distinguished \nFederal judges: Jon O. Newman, then of the District of Connecticut; \nJoseph Smith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; and \nPotter Stewart of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Following these three clerkships, Justice Hurwitz worked in private \npractice for over 25 years in Phoenix, AZ, where he represented clients \nin State courts, Federal courts, and administrative agencies.\n  Hurwitz's clients have included AT, Lucent Technologies, ABC, \nClorox, the city of Phoenix, PGA Golf, the Arizona State Compensation \nFund, various Native American tribes, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nthe National League of Cities, and the Council of State Governments. \nThat is a wide and diverse cross-section of companies in our country.\n  Hurwitz has tried more than 40 cases to final judgment. That is \nactually more than most appellate court judges who have been before us. \nHe has argued numerous cases before the Ninth Circuit and other State \nand Federal appellate courts and argued two cases before the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Justice Hurwitz was appointed to the Arizona Supreme Court in 2003, \nwhere he has built a reputation as a fair-minded and highly skilled \njurist. As Senator Kyl said in the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Everyone who has practiced in Arizona before the Arizona \n     Supreme Court on which Justice Hurwitz sits . . . is \n     complimentary of his legal skills, temperament, and he has \n     received widespread support [in Arizona] for his appointment \n     . . . to the ninth circuit.\n\n  Justice Hurwitz was appointed by Chief Justice Rehnquist to serve as \na member of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence and \nwas reappointed to that position by Chief Justice Roberts.\n  In my view, Justice Hurwitz is one of the most qualified circuit \ncourt nominees I have seen, and I have served on the Judiciary \nCommittee for 19 years now. There are two areas of dispute I would like \nto address.\n  First, some have criticized Justice Hurwitz on the death penalty. As \na Democrat who supports the death penalty, I can tell you these charges \nare simply wrong. On the Arizona Supreme Court, Justice Hurwitz has \nvoted to uphold numerous death sentences. Just this year, in State v. \nCota, he authored an opinion for the court upholding the death sentence \nof a man who killed a married couple who had hired him to perform house \nwork. He joined a similar opinion this year in State v. Nelson which \nupheld the death penalty for a man who hit his 14-year-old niece on the \nhead with a mallet. Last year, in State v. Manuel, he joined an opinion \nupholding a death sentence for a man who shot and killed the owner of a \npawn shop in Phoenix.\n  Justice Hurwitz did argue a case in the Supreme Court called Ring v. \nArizona, which established that a jury, not a judge, must find the \nfacts necessary to make a defendant eligible for the death penalty. The \nRing decision was 7 to 2. It is part of a line of cases--beginning with \nApprendi v. New Jersey in 2000--in which Justices Scalia and Thomas \nhave been at the forefront of expanding defendants' rights to have \ncertain facts found by juries, not judges. In fact, Justices Scalia and \nThomas concurred in the decision. Justice Breyer dissented. So it is \nnot something that breaks down along ideological lines.\n  There is simply no question Justice Hurwitz will follow the law on \nthe death penalty if he is confirmed. He has done so for the last 9 \nyears.\n  The second issue is a Law Review article Hurwitz wrote in 2002 about \na decision by a district court judge 40 years ago that may have \ninfluenced--I say may have influenced--the Supreme Court's decision in \nRoe v. Wade.\n  In response, I would first say, as Senator Kyl said in the Judiciary \nCommittee, that Justice Hurwitz did not express his personal views on \nthe Roe decision. Second, the real question is how Justice Hurwitz has \ncomported himself as a judge because we have long years to look at. By \nall accounts, his record has been superb. Not once has an opinion he \nhas written been overturned by a higher court. Let me repeat: Not once \nhas he been overturned by a higher court. Yet it is my understanding \nthat 60 votes is hard-pressed to get in this body, and that is hard for \nme to understand.\n\n  As Senator Kyl has also said, Justice Hurwitz's ``opinions obviously \ncarefully adhere to the law . . . [and] that is what most of us are \nlooking for in judicial nominations.'' And that is absolutely right.\n  In the Judiciary Committee I listened to Senator Kyl's strong defense \nof Justice Hurwitz. Jon Kyl is not a liberal; he is a rock-rib \nconservative. I said at the time that Senator Kyl's statement was \n``music to my ears'' because I thought we finally might be getting away \nfrom this effort to find a single statement or speech in someone's \nbackground to use to condemn him or her for all time.\n  In this case, it is a district judge's decision from 40 years ago and \na Law Review article. If we have 41 Members who are going to vote \nagainst this man because he wrote a Law Review article about a case \ndecided 40 years ago, that is a real problem, particularly because this \nman is a supreme court justice of the State of Arizona, and \nparticularly because both Republican Senators support him. I, as a \nDemocrat--and Democrats on our side in the Judiciary Committee--also \nsupport him. There may be something else that somebody wrote 40 years \nago in college--and we have seen some of this too. It goes on and on, \nand it is wrong.\n  I agree with Senator Kyl that this is a highly qualified nominee for \nthe busiest circuit in the country and a circuit that has a judicial \nemergency. So I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture to support \nJustice Hurwitz's nomination by virtue of education, by virtue of \ntraining, by virtue of private practice, and by virtue of court record, \nhis record is unimpeachable, and I stand by that.\n  So I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the \nnomination of Andrew Hurwitz to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. I would first note that this year we have already confirmed 25 \nof President Obama's judicial nominees.\n  At this point in 2004, the last Presidential election year during a \nPresident's first term, the Senate had confirmed only 11 of President \nBush's judicial nominees. At precisely the same point in 1996, during \nPresident Clinton's first term, the Senate had confirmed only three \njudicial nominees. So this year we have confirmed more than twice as \nmany of President Obama's judicial nominees as we did during a \ncomparable period for President Bush and more than eight times as many \nas we did for President Clinton.\n  Of the nominees we have already confirmed so far this year, two are \nnow serving as appellate judges on the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit \nis an important appellate court in America, with jurisdiction over \nabout 60 million Americans--roughly 20 percent of our country's total \npopulation.\n  Approximately one-third of all reversals handed down by the Supreme \nCourt last term were from the Ninth\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\nCircuit. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has developed something of a \nreputation for eccentric legal theories and unusual results. As one \ncommentator suggested, ``There should be two Supreme Courts, one to \nreverse the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, the other to \nhear all the other cases.''\n  We should therefore exercise some caution in confirming yet another \nliberal nominee to the Ninth Circuit. But Mr. Hurwitz is not simply \nanother liberal nominee. Mr. Hurwitz has sought to claim credit for one \nof the most controversial and constitutionally indefensible decisions \nin Supreme Court history--Roe v. Wade.\n  In 1972, Mr. Hurwitz clerked for Judge Jon Newman on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Connecticut. That year, as Mr. \nHurwitz later put it: ``[t]he abortion issue dominated [Judge Newman's \ntime],'' and Mr. Hurwitz helped Judge Newman write two key abortion \ndecisions known as Abele I and Abele II. These two decisions \nestablished the conceptual groundwork for the decision that became \nknown later as Roe v. Wade. They relied on a single discredited, \nhistorical account to conclude that Connecticut's abortion laws were \nnot in fact passed to protect the life of the fetus; they relied on \nflawed science to conclude that there was no objective way of knowing \nwhen human life begins; and they relied on a fabricated and arbitrary \nlegal framework of viability to analyze the competing rights of the \nindividual and the State.\n  Given the woefully misguided reasoning behind these decisions, one \nwould assume that a former law clerk would keep quiet about his \npersonal role in drafting opinions that lack serious constitutional \ngrounding. Indeed, most former law clerks--who have a certain duty not \nto discuss internal deliberations--would consider themselves ethically \nbound not to talk about decisionmaking in individual cases, and \ncertainly would not seek to attract public attention to their role in \nparticular decisions. But Mr. Hurwitz did just that.\n  In a 2002 law review article, Mr. Hurwitz recounted how he received a \nSupreme Court clerkship partly on the basis of his role in helping \ndraft Judge Newman's 1972 abortion decisions. Mr. Hurwitz wrote that \nJustice Potter Stewart, who hired Mr. Hurwitz as a clerk at the Supreme \nCourt, ``jokingly referred to [Hurwitz] as `the clerk who wrote the \nNewman [abortion] opinion.' '' And Mr. Hurwitz made clear that the \nopinion had a ``demonstrable effect'' on the Supreme Court's approach \nto abortion.\n  My concern with respect to Mr. Hurwitz's asserted role in Roe v. Wade \ngoes beyond his attempt to take credit for that decision. Mr. Hurwitz \nhas been nominated to serve as a Federal appellate judge, and his \nendorsement of the reasoning underlying Roe v. Wade raises immense \nconcerns about his constitutional jurisprudence. While Mr. Hurwitz \ncontinues to write about Roe with fondness, nostalgia, and even pride, \nmost legal scholars--including many who hold very liberal political \nviews--concede that Roe was an extraordinarily flawed legal decision. \nFor example, Prof. John Hart Ely has written:\n\n       [Roe v. Wade] is bad because it is bad constitutional law, \n     or rather it is not constitutional law [at all] and gives \n     almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.\n\n  Prof. Lawrence Tribe has written:\n\n       [B]ehind its own verbal smokescreen, the substantive \n     judgment on which [Roe] rests is nowhere to be found.\n\n  Prof. Akhil Reed Amar has written:\n\n       Roe's main emphasis is neither textual, nor historical, nor \n     structural, nor prudential, nor ethical: it is doctrinal. But \n     here too it is a rather unimpressive effort. As a precedent-\n     follower, Roe simply string-cites a series of privacy cases . \n     . . and then abruptly announces with no doctrinal analysis \n     that this privacy right is broad enough to encompass \n     abortion.\n\n  Prof. Cass Sunstein likewise has written:\n\n       In the Court's first confrontation with the abortion issue, \n     it . . . decided too many issues too quickly. The Court \n     should have allowed the democratic processes of the states to \n     adapt and to generate solutions that might not occur to \n     judges.\n\n  Unlike these liberal legal scholars, Mr. Hurwitz fails to appreciate \nthat Roe represents exactly the kind of constitutional activism Federal \ncourts must avoid--inventing new rights without any substantive or \nsignificant constitutional analysis.\n  Given the chance at his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to \ndisassociate himself from Roe v. Wade, Mr. Hurwitz did not do so. \nInstead, his only relevant response--an assertion also unpersuasively \nmade by some of my colleagues--has been that his 2002 law review \narticle was merely descriptive and did not express any personal opinion \nas to the merits of Roe. But to anyone who has reviewed Mr. Hurwitz's \narticle and the laudatory tone with which it discusses the connection \nbetween Judge Newman's opinions and Roe v. Wade itself, this assertion \nsimply is not credible.\n  Mr. Hurwitz wrote that Judge Newman's opinions on abortion were \n``memorable, innovative, careful, and meticulous.'' He described them \nas exerting a ``profound, critical, immediate, direct, and crucial'' \ninfluence on Roe v. Wade, which he described as a landmark opinion of \nthe Supreme Court.\n  Mr. Hurwitz cannot have it both ways. He cannot seek credit for his \nrole in developing a jurisprudence that is unmoored from the \nConstitution and that has fundamentally disrespected human life, and \nthen later claim he was only retelling a story. Mr. Hurwitz's attempts \nto take credit for, and subsequent refusal to distance himself from, \nconstitutional decisions that lack serious constitutional foundation \ncasts an unacceptable degree of doubt on his ability to serve in the \nrole of a Federal appellate judge.\n  Of the countless qualified individuals who would make excellent \nappellate judges to serve on the Ninth Circuit, President Obama chose \nto nominate the one person who, by his own account, was a key \nintellectual architect of the profoundly flawed legal arguments in Roe \nv. Wade--someone who fails to appreciate the illegitimacy of \nconstitutional activism and who, even today, looks back on his role in \nthat case with pride.\n  It is for this reason that I urge all of my colleagues to vote \nagainst the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz.\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President. I oppose the nomination of Andrew \nHurwitz to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals because I have serious \nconcerns with his capability to serve in the role of a life-tenured \nFederal appellate judge. His public statements regarding, and past \ncontributions to, previous Supreme Court decisions give serious pause \nas to whether we should confirm him to serve on a Federal appellate \ncourt.\n  Mr. Hurwitz has effectively taken credit for helping develop the \nlegal architecture for Roe v. Wade while serving as a law clerk to \nthen-Judge Jon Newman. Judge Newman, a U.S. District Judge for the \nDistrict of Connecticut, issued two 1972 decisions which are clearly \nreflected and expanded upon in the Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. \nWade. Mr. Hurwitz played a key role in authoring these decisions and he \nhas publicly expressed great pride in this fact. He wrote a 2002 law \nreview article praising Roe and bragged that he helped craft Newman's \nopinion that was reflected in ``almost perfect lockstep'' in the \nSupreme Court's decision. This concerns me because not only is Roe a \nconstitutional abomination, but a moral abomination that has resulted \nin the killing of tens of millions of unborn children.\n  Mr. Hurwitz has claimed credit for shaping a judicial decision that \nfundamentally disrespected human life and is completely unfounded in \nthe Constitution. Roe v. Wade forever changed the debate about abortion \nin this country by creating a nationwide policy of abortion-on-demand \nthrough one of the worst cases of judicial activism in history. It is \nso poorly reasoned that both conservative and liberal legal experts and \nscholars acknowledge that Roe was a deficient opinion that lacks any \nlegitimate legal reasoning in support of its holding.\n  His willful failure to recognize the legal deficiencies of the Roe \nopinion and his self-promotion for playing a part in such an \nunfortunate event in this country's judicial history makes clear that \nhe is not qualified to serve in the role of a Federal appellate judge.\n  I believe we must support the dignity and sanctity of all human life \nand defend those who cannot defend themselves. This judicial nominee \nwould do the opposite, which is why I must oppose Andrew Hurwitz's \nnomination to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\n  Mr. Kyl. I support the nomination of Justice Andy Hurwitz to the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Justice Hurwitz received his undergraduate degree from Princeton \nUniversity (A.B. 1968) and his law degree from Yale Law School (J.D. \n1972), where he was Note and Comment Editor of the Yale Law Journal.\n  He served as a law clerk to Judge Jon O. Newman of the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Connecticut in 1972; to Judge J. \nJoseph Smith of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit in 1972 1973; and to Associate Justice Potter Stewart of the \nSupreme Court of the United States in 1973 1974.\n  Justice Hurwitz has served on the Arizona Supreme Court since 2003. \nBefore joining the Arizona Supreme Court, Justice Hurwitz was a partner \nin the Phoenix firm of Osborn Maledon, where his practice focused on \nappellate and constitutional litigation, administrative law, and civil \nlitigation. He is a member of the bar in Arizona and in Connecticut; he \nreceived the highest grade on the Arizona Bar examination in the summer \nof 1974. He argued two cases before the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. Justice Hurwitz served as chief of staff to two Arizona \ngovernors--from 1980 to 1983 and in 1988. He was a member of the \nArizona Board of Regents from 1988 through 1996, and served as \npresident of the Board in 1992 1993.\n  He has regularly taught at the Arizona State University College of \nLaw, and was in residence at the College of Law as Visiting Professor \nof Law in 1994 1995 and as a Distinguished Visitor from Practice in \n2001. He was appointed by Chief Justice Rehnquist in 2004 as a member \nof the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence and \nreappointed to a second term by Chief Justice Roberts in 2007.\n  His easy to see why Justice Hurwitz was awarded the ABA's highest \nrating: Unanimous ``Well Qualified.''\n  During his 9-year tenure on the Arizona Supreme Court, Justice \nHurwitz has consistently demonstrated a commitment to faithfully apply \nexisting law and precedent regardless of his own policy preferences. A \nfew examples are quite telling:\n  In 2006, he upheld the constitutionality of a 200-year sentence for a \nman convicted of possessing twenty pictures of child pornography even \nthough Justice Hurwitz personally felt that the sentence was too long. \nResponding to the dissent in State v. Berger, he wrote:\n\n       As a policy matter, there is much to commend Justice \n     Berch's suggestion that the cumulative sentence imposed upon \n     Mr. Berger was unnecessarily harsh, and my personal \n     inclination would be to reach such a conclusion. As a judge, \n     however, I cannot conclude under the Supreme Court precedent \n     or even under the alternative test that Justice Berch \n     proposes that Berger's sentences violate the United States \n     Constitution.\n\n  In 2005, in State v. Fell, Justice Hurwitz, followed Supreme Court \nprecedent and held that ``the Sixth Amendment does not require that a \njury find an aggravating circumstance before a natural life sentence \ncan be imposed.'' In so doing, he rejected a position similar to the \none he had advocated for at the Supreme Court just 3 years earlier.\n  Justice Hurwitz repeatedly reiterated his commitment to judicial \nrestraint in his testimony to the Judiciary Committee. To briefly quote \nhim: ``Judgments about policy matters are within the province of the \nlegislature, and courts should not second-guess such judgments.''\n  Justice Hurwitz's steadfast commitment to this philosophy is likely \nthe reason that no opinion written or joined by Justice Hurwitz has \never been overturned by the United States Supreme Court.\n  I support the nomination of Justice Hurwitz to the Ninth Circuit \nbecause I believe that his abilities, experience, and commitment to \njudicial restraint will enable him to serve the residents of the Ninth \nCircuit as ably as he has served the people of Arizona.\n  Today, I am very disappointed because a lot of friends of mine in the \npro-life community are, to put it charitably, exaggerating one Law \nReview article that he wrote attributing to Justice Hurwitz all kinds \nof views which are not appropriate based upon the facts. It has to do \nwith the pro-life issue.\n  I want to set the record straight on Justice Hurwitz's article about \nJudge Jon O. Newman, which has unfortunately been blown out of \nproportion. About 10 years ago, the New York Law School Law Review \nsolicited Judge Jon O. Newman's former clerks to write articles for a \nsymposium dedicated to Judge Newman's first 30 years on the bench. Five \nclerks agreed, including Justice Hurwitz, who wrote about the most \ninfluential opinion written by Judge Newman while Justice Hurwitz was \nclerking for him.\n  Justice Hurwitz wrote the Newman article to ``document the historical \nrecord about the effect of Judge Newman's decisions on subsequent \nSupreme Court jurisprudence.'' [Hurwitz Responses to the Written \nQuestions of Senator Jeff Sessions, question 1(a), pg. 1.] He did not \nexpress his ``personal opinions'' on the merits of Judge Newman's \nreasoning in Abele I or Abele II, something that Justice Hurwitz \nbelieves would be ``improper for a law clerk to do, either then or \nnow.'' [Hurwitz Responses to the Written Questions of Senator Jeff \nSessions, question 1(a), pg. 1.]\n  Although Justice Hurwitz ``assisted in the research,'' ``Judge Newman \nwrote the [Abele II] opinion, as he did all opinions which bore his \nname during the time [Justice Hurwitz] clerked for him.'' [Hurwitz \nResponses to the Written Questions of Senator Tom Coburn, question 8, \npg. 5.] Further, as a law clerk, Justice Hurwitz was required to \nimplement Judge Newman's preferences, not his own. Thus, Judge Newman's \nopinion cannot be attributed to Justice Hurwitz.\n  If someone told me that Justice Hurwitz was pro-choice, I would \nbelieve that, though he has never said, and he did not express his \npersonal opinions in the Law Review article about the decision that his \nprevious boss, a federal judge, had written. His boss, Judge Newman, \nwrote an opinion that was part of the basis for Roe v. Wade, a decision \nwith which I wholeheartedly disagree. Andrew Hurwitz wrote about that. \nSomehow my friends in the pro-life community have turned this into a \nfederal case against him. What do they suggest? That he approved of Roe \nv. Wade. The point is that Andrew Hurwitz has never in his career on \nthe Arizona State Supreme Court evidenced any inability to separate his \nown personal views from the judging that he is required to do. And I \nwould defy any of these people who think they know more about it than I \ndo to show me a case if they can find one where that is not true.\n  Justice Andrew Hurwitz is known in Arizona as a very fair jurist who \napplies the law fairly and without regard to his personal inclinations. \nThat is the kind of judge he will be on the Ninth Circuit of Appeals. \nIf my reputation among my conservative colleagues means anything, I \nsimply say I know the man; I have known him a long time; and my good \nfriends in the conservative community have every confidence in Andrew \nHurwitz.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to submit for the record my \nviews on roll call vote No. 118, the nomination of Andrew Hurwitz to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I am deeply concerned \nwith Mr. Hurwitz's role in advancing a constitutionally flawed doctrine \nthat would become the framework for Roe v. Wade. His actions constitute \na brand of judicial activism unfit for the Court. I do not believe Mr. \nHurwitz holds the requisite traits necessary to be an objective arbiter \nof the law. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                    125th Anniversary of United Way\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise tonight to recognize the \n125th anniversary of United Way and honor their extraordinary \nachievements since their founding 125 years ago in Denver, CO.\n  In 1887, a Denver woman along with local religious leaders recognized \nthe need for community-based action in order to address Denver's \ngrowing problem with poverty. In Denver, this group--this initial \ngroup--established the first of what would become a worldwide network \nof organizations called United Way. Their goal was simple: create a \ncommunity-based organization that would raise funds in order to provide \neconomic relief and counseling services to neighbors in need. During \ntheir first campaign in 1888, this remarkable organization raised \ntoday's equivalent of $650,000.\n  Now, 125 years after its founding, United Way has become a celebrated \nworldwide organization committed to improving communities from the \nbottom up through cooperative action and community support in 41 \ncountries across the globe. United Way forges public-private \npartnerships with local businesses, labor organizations, and 120 \nnational and global corporations through the Global Corporate \nLeadership Program that brings an impressive $1 billion to local \ncommunities each year. United Way effectively leverages private \ndonations in order to finance innovative programs and initiatives that \nprofoundly affect communities throughout Colorado, the United States \nand, dare I say, the world.\n  The success and strength of these partnerships between United Way and \nAmerica's workers cannot be overstated. Nearly two-thirds of the funds \nfor United Way come from voluntary worker payroll contributions, and \nthe Labor Letters of Endorsement Program championed by the AFL CIO \nencourages affiliates and their members to give their time and \nresources to United Way campaigns.\n  Just one powerful illustration of this partnership is the National \nAssociation of Letter Carriers' National Food Drive, which is a \ncooperative effort of the U.S. Postal Service, the AFL CIO, and United \nWay, which has become the world's largest 1-day food drive.\n  United Way has strengthened bonds and built a foundation of \ncollaboration and partnership in our communities. Its founders could \nnever have imagined the ultimate breadth and reach of this group, \ngrowing from a local support organization in little Denver, CO, back in \n1887 to a globally recognized force for good.\n  United Way is an indispensable part of Colorado's social fabric, and \nI am proud to recognize and honor this historic anniversary.\n  There are 14 local United Way organizations leaving an indelible mark \nthroughout Colorado. I want to take a moment to recognize each of them \nfor their tremendous role as cornerstones of their communities: \nFoothills United Way, Boulder; Pikes Peak United Way, Colorado Springs; \nMoffat County United Way, Craig; Mile High United Way, Inc., Denver; \nUnited Way of Southwest Colorado, Durango; United Way of Eagle River \nValley, Eagle; United Way of Morgan County, Inc., Fort Morgan; United \nWay of Mesa County, Grand Junction; United Way of Weld County, Greeley; \nUnited Way of Larimer County, Inc., Fort Collins and Loveland; Pueblo \nCounty United Way, Inc., Pueblo; United Way of Garfield County, Rifle; \nRoutt County United Way, Steamboat Springs; and Logan County United \nWay, Sterling.\n  To all of the employees and partners of United Way, I join my Senate \ncolleagues in recognizing and applauding your legacy and inspirational \nservice. This 125th anniversary is a milestone deserving of \ncelebration, and I commend your tireless pursuit to advance the common \ngood.\n\n\n                          Bipartisan Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise to speak to the important bipartisan \nlegislation we are considering which is commonly known as the farm \nbill.\n  This legislation is critical not just to our farmers and ranchers and \nrural communities but to every segment of our population and our \neconomy. We have heard from others highlighting that this bill supports \nmore than 16 million jobs across our country.\n  In fact, the Colorado Department of Agriculture estimates that in my \nhome State alone the agricultural-related industry generates \napproximately $20 billion in economic activity supporting more than \n100,000 jobs. This is a principal reason why I urge the Senate to \nconsider and pass a 2012 farm bill.\n  This bill will unquestionably strengthen our economy and help to grow \njobs that support the livelihood of Coloradans and Americans in both \nrural and urban communities. That is what our constituents in \nPennsylvania, Ohio, and Arkansas are demanding we do--work together \nacross the aisle to pass bills that will help put people back to work.\n  I want to take a second or two to thank the members of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, especially Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking \nMember Roberts, for their efforts to bring a bipartisan bill to the \nSenate floor.\n  As with most of our work in the Senate--and when we are at our best--\ncompromise is key, and it rules the day. I am pleased we are now \ndiscussing a bill that will provide certainty to our farmers and \nranchers over the next 5 years.\n  Let me tell you some of the other things the bill will do. It will \nimprove opportunities for farmers and ranchers to enter the \nagricultural sector, it will\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\nstreamline and maintain valuable programs that support voluntary \nconservation practices on the farm, and it will responsibly extend \nimportant nutrition programs, all the while reducing our deficit by \nmore than $23 billion. Yes, you heard that correctly--while reducing \nour Federal budget deficit by over $23 billion.\n\n  There are many important aspects to each title in the bill, but I \nwant to take a few minutes to speak specifically about the forestry \ntitle, particularly given the news of the large wildfires in my State \nand in New Mexico and other portions of the West. The forestry portion \nof the farm bill has been of particular interest to me and my \nconstituents because of its bearing on my State's economy and on the \npublic safety of so many Coloradans.\n  Good stewardship of our forests not only provides private sector \nopportunities to enhance stewardship of our public lands, it also \nprotects wilderness and roadless areas, all the while sustaining a \nstrong tourism industry. Indeed, activities such as hiking, skiing, \nshooting, and angling contribute over $10 billion a year to Colorado's \neconomy, supporting 100,000 Colorado jobs.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee did a commendable job in building a \nresponsible approach to addressing forest health. I have a few \nadditional concerns that I hope we can address during the amendment \nprocess. But I want to emphasize the importance of this title in \nparticular because of the need to address a growing emergency in our \nwestern forests caused by the largest bark beetle outbreak in recorded \nhistory.\n  From the west coast, through the Rocky Mountains, all the way to the \nBlack Hills of the Dakotas, this infestation has killed more than 41 \nmillion acres of trees, and it is anticipated to continue to kill \nmillions more in the years to come as it spreads. In my State alone--\nand it breaks my heart to share this with you--the bark beetle is \nexpected to kill every single lodgepole pine. When that takes effect, \nwhen every tree is killed, then 100,000 trees a day are going to fall. \nI know that number seems impossible to imagine. But 100,000 trees would \nbe falling down daily once the epidemic ends by killing all of these \ntrees.\n  These falling trees have real and often devastating impacts on the \nlives of everyday westerners.\n  I have put up a picture for the viewers to show what it looks like \nwhen entire stands of infested trees are blown over because of heavy \nwinds and other conditions.\n  Massive forest mortality across the West, such as what is shown in \nthis picture, has a wide range of repercussions that affect municipal \nand agricultural water supplies and tourism economies. It also \nincreases wildfire risk and, of course, it would affect human health \nand safety.\n  The Forest Service--our U.S. Forest Service--has sought to prioritize \ntreating affected forests--like this one shown in this picture--where \nthere is a direct and immediate risk to human health and safety, and \nthis legislation will help them to further accomplish needed treatment \nin our forests.\n  In Colorado and southern Wyoming, the treatment prioritization \nincludes 215,000 acres of wildland-urban interface that poses the \ngreatest fire risk to urban areas. Treatment prioritization will \ninclude thousands of miles of roads and trails, hundreds of miles of \npower lines, and hundreds of popular recreation sites and multiple \nskiing areas that are critical to our tourism economy.\n  This second picture gives us an idea of the real risk of wildfire to \ncritical infrastructure, such as power lines. In addition, water \nsupplies, without which the West would not know civilization as we see \nit today, are at risk because of the damage wildfires can cause the \nwatershed and because falling, dead trees can obstruct water \ninfrastructure such as ditches, gates, pipelines, and storage \nfacilities.\n  Another tool that is permanently reauthorized in the farm bill title \nwhich enhances how we manage our forests and would hopefully prevent \nthis kind of a catastrophic fire is called stewardship contracting. \nStewardship contract authority is a tool used by the Forest Service and \nthe Bureau of Land Management to contract with local businesses to fell \nand treat dangerous stands of ailing trees and in so doing improve the \nhealth of our forests. These contracts help sustain rural communities, \nrestore and maintain healthy forest ecosystems, and they provide a \ncontinuous source of local income and employment. The authority allows \nfor multiple-year contracts, ensuring job stability and a consistent \nsupply of wood products to mills not only across Colorado but, frankly, \nacross our country.\n  Stewardship contracts have helped clean up more than 545,625 acres \nnationally through approximately 900 contracts, with more than 80 \nawarded in Colorado alone. This is a track record of which we can be \nproud. These stewardship contracts also provide for critical \nrestoration needs in the areas at risk of catastrophic wildfire. \nMoreover, any receipts retained by forest management activities are \navailable without further appropriations and can be reinvested locally \nto complete other service work needed.\n  On the list of successes as well is that the contracts have helped to \nmake productive use of more than 1.8 million green tons of biomass for \nenergy. Stewardship contracting has helped to treat more than 200,000 \nhazardous acres to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire within the \nwildland-urban interface areas, where wildfire poses the greatest risk. \nThat is where forests bump up against local communities.\n  In a time when wildfire can easily become a multimillion-dollar \nchallenge for every level of government and as the bark beetle epidemic \ncontinues to present a significant threat to our communities and their \nlivelihood, it is necessary that we pass a farm bill with a robust \nforestry title.\n  Just this weekend another wildfire broke out near Fort Collins, CO. \nThis is currently an uncontained wildfire, which is now more than 22 \nsquare miles, and it is in an area where stands of lodgepole pines have \nbecome damaged by beetle infestation and therefore increasingly \nsusceptible to wildfire.\n  At home, we are all closely watching the High Park fire, the images \nof the flames and the overwhelming smoke and ash clouds. We all share a \ngreat concern for the 2,600 families who have been displaced and the \ndevastation this fire could bring to northern Colorado communities. My \nthoughts go to all the firefighters, in the air and on the ground, and \nwe wish and pray that they will be safe and effective. The fire is \ncurrently zero percent contained, which is a reflection of the extreme \nweather and dry ground conditions. The High Park fire is an unfortunate \nexample of why we need a strong forestry title in the farm bill and why \ntreatment of the affected areas is a must-do priority.\n  We manage our forests so they are healthy and we reduce fire risk and \nwe protect water supplies and bolster our economy. As we watch the bark \nbeetle epidemic become the largest threat to forest health, now is the \ntime to ensure that we can equip the Forest Service, conservationists, \nprivate landowners, and industry with the tools they need to \ncooperatively address the health of America's forests.\n  This is a real opportunity for us. This farm bill is a work of \nbipartisan compromise. We need to do more of that here in the Halls of \nCongress. Let's get this done because provisions in this bill's \nforestry title will streamline Forest Service administrative processes \nand enhance the agency's ability to partner with the private sector so \nthat they can conduct more efficient and effective treatments for \ninsect and disease infestations.\n  Let's get to work. Let's discuss the merits of the farm bill. Let's \nwork to include a robust forestry title that addresses the critical \nneeds in America's forests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the Agriculture \nReform, Food, and Jobs Act or the farm bill.\n  The chair, ranking member, and all of the members of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee have worked very hard in a bipartisan manner on \nthis legislation and we have certainly come a very long way. But we \nstill have far to go, and I think that with the leadership of the \nchairwoman and other members of this body that recognize the need for a \nsafety net that meets the needs of all crops and regions that\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\nwe will eventually get there--and I thank the chair for her strong \nleadership. The fact that we are discussing this bill on the floor of \nthe Senate right now is a testament to it.\n  This Nation has a diverse fabric of agriculture with a variety of \nrisks, and writing a farm bill that serves as a safety net for all \ncrops and regions is no easy task. Yet, this is a responsibility we \nmust embrace to ensure that the United States continues to have the \nsafest, most reliable, and most affordable supply of food and fiber in \nthe world.\n  Our Nation is at a crossroads and we are in desperate need of fiscal \ndiscipline. I am pleased that this farm bill includes important \nreforms, reduces spending by more than is required of this committee, \nand eliminates duplicative or obsolete government programs to ensure \nthat we are getting the most out of every dollar we invest in \nagriculture.\n  The Forestry title contains important improvements that will benefit \nArkansas's forestry industry. The improvements to the USDA Bio-based \nMarkets program in the managers' package will allow forest products to \nbe included in the program. The current USDA Bio-based markets program \nfavors foreign products over our American forest products, which puts \nAmerican workers at a disadvantage. So I am happy with the progress on \nthis issue, and I appreciate the effort to promote and purchase our \nrenewable, home-grown products.\n  Crop insurance also contains some improvements, and the provisions \nfor irrigated and non-irrigated enterprise units, supplemental coverage \noptions, and yield plugs will help many producers who may have \notherwise been left unprotected by the elimination of direct payments \nand the counter-cyclical program.\n  At the same time, this is not a perfect bill and I have serious \nconcerns about the Commodity title and the impact it will have on \nsouthern producers and the planting decisions they make. I also have \nconcerns about some missed opportunities in terms of eliminating waste \nand abuse in the Nutrition title.\n  The Commodity title, as it is currently written, will have a \ndevastating impact on southern agriculture which relies heavily on \nirrigation and, therefore, benefits less from crop insurance. \nFurthermore, the new revenue plan is designed to augment crop \ninsurance, so this new program leaves gaping holes in the Southern \nSafety Net. Even with a reference price, this revenue plan may not be \nstrong enough for our farmers to get operating loans. For example, most \nestimates find that rice would lose more than 70 percent of its \nbaseline, far more than their fair share. However, this is not about \njust one crop. Every farmer in America knows the real threat of multi-\nyear price declines, and we need a Commodity title that treats all \ncrops and regions fairly.\n  I am very concerned that this proposal is couched in the assumption \nthat we will continue to have these high commodity prices. A revenue \nplan is attractive when prices are high, but I am not sure there is \nanything in this plan that protects producers from a multi-year price \ndecline and an untested, one-size-fits-all program, with no producer \nchoice could leave many producers vulnerable.\n  Throughout this process, I have said that anything that goes too far \nin any direction can violate the core principles of this effort. I am \nafraid that this Commodity title does that in its current form.\n  It is my opinion that we could have done more to eliminate waste and \nabuse in the Nutrition title and ensure that we are getting the most \nout of these investments and that they are, in fact, going to the \nneediest among us. We should fully close the LIHEAP loophole, which \nartificially inflates benefits for SNAP recipients, and there are other \nthings we can do to save money without reducing benefits and reinvest \nin other critical nutrition areas and deficit reduction. When we tell \nAmericans that we cannot find more than $4 billion in savings from \nprograms that account for nearly 80 percent of all agriculture \nspending, I can not think that they would believe we are trying hard \nenough.\n  But just because there is not full agreement, does not mean that our \nfarmers stop needing a safety net. I am committed to continuing the \nfight for a safety net that works not just for Arkansans--but for all \nfarmers, of all crops, in all regions of the country. With a \nresponsible producer choice, I believe we can build the consensus \nnecessary to usher a farm bill through the entire legislative process \nand see it signed into law this year.\n  We can do this while preserving the safety net, making reforms, and \nachieving deficit reduction. I am confident that we can craft a bill \nthat we are all proud of, and I look forward to continuing to work with \nthe chair, ranking member, and all the members of Congress and seeing \nthis through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Auto Manufacturing\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, people in my home State of Ohio \nknow how to make things. We know how to make big things. For decades, \nOhio has been a national leader in auto production, in chemicals, in \nsteel, in concrete, in aluminum, and in the aerospace industry and food \nprocessing. Now we are a leader in solar power, in wind turbine \ncomponents and batteries and all the kinds of things that really create \nmiddle-class jobs and help us lead the world in manufacturing \nproduction. Ohio is the third leading manufacturing State in the \ncountry. We make more in Ohio than any State but California, three \ntimes our population, and Texas, twice our population.\n  What Ohio perhaps is best known for in production is the auto \nindustry. The auto rescue did not just save the U.S. auto industry 3, \n3\\1/2\\, 4 years ago, it saved thousands of auto-related jobs in Ohio. \nEstimates are that some 850,000 jobs in Ohio--a State of 11 million \npeople, only smaller than the Presiding Officer's home State of \nPennsylvania--that 800-plus thousand jobs in Ohio are related to the \nauto industry. It is clear from the auto rescue that the President, the \nSenate, and the House supported that it saved tens of thousands and \ncreated tens of thousands of those jobs.\n  New data shows manufacturing is at the forefront of the economic \nrecovery, with factories adding 250,000 jobs since early 2010--the \nfirst sustained increase in manufacturing employment since 1997.\n  From 1965 until the late 1990s, America had about the same number of \nmanufacturing jobs in the late nineties as it did in the midsixties--a \nsmaller percent of the workforce, a smaller percent of GDP, but a \npretty constant number of manufacturing jobs, with some ups and downs, \nobviously, during that period. But from 2000 to 2010, during that \nphilosophy of trade agreements that ultimately cost us jobs, tax cuts \nand tax policy that contributed to outsourcing jobs, and an economic \npolicy of ``trickle down'' during the Bush years--from 2000 to 2010, \nAmerica lost one-third, more than 5 million manufacturing jobs. One out \nof three manufacturing jobs disappeared during those 10 years from 2000 \nto 2010.\n  Thousands of factories closed, never to be reopened, as jobs were \noutsourced, as jobs left our country. But since 2010, almost every \nsingle month in Ohio and across the country we see manufacturing jobs \nincreasing. The auto industry has led the rebound, with more than \n20,000 jobs at General Motors and Chrysler saved or created thanks to \nthe 2009 auto rescue, and thousands more were saved or created in the \nauto supply chain.\n  Too many Ohioans are struggling. Many are still looking for work, \nwhile others have seen their wages cut or their hours reduced.\n  There are also important signs of recovery at our manufacturers, auto \nsuppliers, and small businesses. Just 4 years ago the auto industry, \nmany people thought, was faltering and imploding. But look where we are \ntoday. As a result of the auto rescue, we are seeing a healthy \nturnaround. The Toledo Supplier Park employs 1900 people. The GM \nassembly and stamping plant in Lordstown employs some 4,500 Ohioans. GM \nPowertrain in Defiance is home to some 1,200 workers. Following the \nauto rescue, these facilities all created new jobs due to increased \ndemand.\n  Some Members of Congress were willing to bail out Wall Street without \nso much as asking for reasonable executive compensation restrictions on\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\nbanks that received taxpayer help but then attacked middle-class auto \nworkers. Bonuses and huge salaries have continued unabated for far too \nmany Wall Street executives. Yet some of my colleagues have said that \nauto workers' retirement--union and nonunion retirement--and health \ncare and wages were simply too much. Let's be clear. Ohio would be in a \ndepression if these naysayers had their way and let the auto industry \ncollapse or let it ``go bankrupt.'' It was about rescuing middle-class \nworkers, and it was about fueling the next generation of U.S. \nautomakers and auto manufacturing.\n  Ohio is home to an almost completely Ohio-made automobile, the Chevy \nCruze. Its engine was made in Defiance, the transmission in Toledo, the \nsound system in Springboro, the steel in Middletown, the underpinning \nsteel in Cleveland, and the aluminum wheels in Cleveland. The car is \nstamped in Parma, OH. The Chevy Cruze is assembled in Youngstown, OH. \nThe Jeep Wrangler had only 50 percent America-made components 4 years \nago. The Jeep Wrangler and the Jeep Liberty are assembled in Toledo, \nnow made with more than 70 percent U.S.-made parts.\n  When things looked bleak and when nobody wanted to stand with workers \nor auto companies, we didn't give up on American auto companies or \nAmerican manufacturing. The decision wasn't popular, and there were \nclearly some naysayers. But it was the right thing to do.\n  Our work is far from over. In particular, we have to keep our foot on \nthe gas pedal and fight back against China's unfair trade practices and \nother new threats to our auto industry. Our trade deficit in auto parts \nwith China--the parts that are obviously used, that you buy at various \nretail operations to fix your car when something goes wrong--grew from \nabout $1 billion 10 years ago to about $10 billion today, fed by unfair \nsubsidies, currency manipulation, and illegal dumping of Chinese \nproducts. This is an unlevel, tilted playing field that will cost \nhundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  My China currency manipulation bill--the biggest bipartisan jobs bill \nto have passed the Senate this session--costing taxpayers zero, would \nlevel the playing field for American manufacturers when China tries to \ncheat by manipulating its currency. A recently released report shows \nthat addressing Chinese currency manipulation could support the \ncreation of hundreds of thousands of American jobs--without adding a \ndime to the deficit. It is time to take bold action and stand up to \nChina, and it is time to put American workers and businesses first. We \ndid it in 2008 and 2009. The Presiding Officer played a role in that, \nas did so many in this body. We can do it again if our colleagues in \nthe other Chamber take up this currency bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Arrest of Jorge Luis Garcia ``Antunez'' Perez\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor outraged that \nfollowing a hearing that I held as chairman of the Western Hemisphere \nSubcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee entitled ``The Path to \nFreedom: Countering Repression and Supporting Civil Society in Cuba,'' \nafter testimony from Cuba of Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, known as \n``Antunez''--and this is a picture taken from that video feed--he was \ntaken into custody by the Castro regime this weekend, arrested, and \nbeaten unconscious.\n  This is the account of his wife, Yris Tamara Perez Aguilera, who \nprovided this account to Radio Republic, an independent radio station \nin Miami that she was able to call so that she could denounce what was \ntaking place and let the world know what was happening. Here is the \nexact statement that she gave the radio station:\n\n       My name is Yris Tamara Perez Aguilera, wife of Jorge Luis \n     Garcia Perez Antunez, a former political prisoner--\n\n--a former political prisoner who spent 17 years of his life in \nCastro's prison simply because of his peaceful prodemocracy action.\n\n       This Saturday, June 9, my husband, together with Loreto \n     Hernandez Garcia and Jonniel Rodriguez Riverol, after a \n     brutal beating by the part of the political police--[that is \n     State security]--were transferred to the precinct here in \n     Placeta. All this occurred around 3:30 in the afternoon.\n       After this, at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, we--Yaite \n     Cruz Sosa, Dora Perez Correa, Arturo Conde Zamora, and \n     myself, Yris Tamara Perez Aguilera, left for the police \n     precinct to bring my husband clothing since he was taken away \n     in shorts, since he stepped outside [of his home] to call \n     Damaris Moya Portieles, who was currently on hunger strike. \n     After leaving about one block away from my house, I was \n     intercepted by a police officer, who arrested me where I was \n     once again beaten by Police Officer Isachi, ordered by the \n     Chief of Confrontation of the municipality of Placetax, \n     better known as Corporal Pantera.\n       I was handcuffed and driven to the police precinct. Upon \n     arriving to the precinct, once again Officer Isachi, one of \n     the main oppressors here in Placetas--[that is a town in \n     Cuba]--of the ill-named National Revolutionary Police, \n     strikes my head very strongly, where once again my cervical \n     vertebrae was damaged.\n       At that point, the screams of my husband, Loreto, Jonniel, \n     and the prisoners there who said, ``Stop hitting her. Stop \n     hitting her, you abusers; can't you see she's a woman?'' Then \n     a military garrison officer approached the cells where my \n     husband and the other prisoners were pepper-sprayed. When \n     they were pepper-sprayed, my husband lost consciousness due \n     to lack of air. Thanks to the activist Yaite Cruz Sosa, whom \n     stood nearby, emptied a bucket of water on his face and \n     fanned him with a jacket until he regained consciousness.\n       My husband, arounds 7 p.m., cried from his cell, ``Yris, \n     they're taking me away, Yris, they're taking me away.'' I was \n     not able to speak because of the terrible headache from \n     all the beatings I took to the head. He said to me, ``The \n     special brigade put me on a chain of prisoners to take me \n     from the cell and place me on a bus; I don't know where \n     they are taking me.''\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       I am very worried about what may happen to my husband. He \n     has heart problems, and that pepper spray, as many know, is \n     toxic and may bring bad consequences since my husband has a \n     blocked artery and vein, and I am afraid for his life. \n     Furthermore, my husband is currently missing.\n       I don't know my husband's whereabouts. I was freed \n     yesterday [Sunday, June 10, 2012] in the afternoon, and I was \n     given no information as to where I could find my husband.\n       I lay the responsibility of what may happen to my husband \n     on the government. I know they took reprisal against him for \n     his participation in congress. In these moments, I am leaving \n     for Santa Clara, and together with me, I have Yaite Cruz \n     Sosa. I am going to the State Security Forces and they must \n     tell me where I can find my husband so I can bring him his \n     affairs.\n\n  That is the end of her statement.\n  Mr. Antunez spent 17 years of his life in Castro's jail simply for \nfomenting peaceful democracy efforts, an effort to create a civil \nsociety. We had asked him to testify before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee Western Hemisphere Subcommittee's hearing on moving \ntoward democracy in Cuba, and at personal risk he traversed from where \nhe lives--a countryside--on foot to make it to the intrasection. We \nknew that his willingness to testify was a risk, and so we did not put \nhis name on the committee's notice until he arrived at the \nintrasection, so that we then amended the notice to the public so that \nhe could be safe because we knew that, as others we invited to testify \nwho were stopped and could not make it to the hearing, that if we \ntalked about Mr. Antunez coming before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee via a video feed, he would likely not make it.\n  He testified before the committee about the Castro regime's abuses \nand beatings. He told us that day--among many other things--before the \nhearing that he witnessed the death of Antonio Ruiz in the city of \nSanta Clara, where prodemocracy peaceful activists had gathered. He \nsaid:\n\n       I had to walk many kilometers behind trees and bushes, as \n     if I was some type of criminal, to attend an event that in \n     any other free and democratic country in the world would be \n     an everyday occurrence.\n\n  He went on to say at the hearing that, at the very moment he was \nthere testifying before us, an Afro-Cuban woman had been on a hunger \nstrike for several days in Santa Clara because state security had \nthreatened to sexually assault and rape her 6-year-old daughter as \npunishment for her prodemocracy actions.\n  This is the life inside of Castro's Cuba--not the romanticism some \npeople talk about. This is the life of those who struggle as human \nrights activists and political dissidents simply to create a space for \ncivil society inside of\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\nthe country. This is the cost paid by one man willing to come forward \nto put his life on the line, to share his efforts for libertad in Cuba \nwith this institution, the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, our response must be unparalleled. The arrest and \nbeating of Antunez--clearly as a direct result of his Senate \ntestimony--is further proof of the continuing brutality of the Castro \nbrothers' regime and further evidence of the need for the United States \nand other democratic nations to stand against tyrants and realize that \nthe nature of this regime won't be altered by increasing tourist travel \nto the island, expanding agricultural trade, or by providing visas for \nregime officials to come and tour the United States.\n  Today I am calling on the U.S. State Department to cease providing \nany nonessential visas for travel to the United States by Cuban \nofficials.\n  In the last months, the Department has authorized visas for a stream \nof Cuban regime officials to visit the United States, starting with \nJosefina Vidal, Cuba's director for North American affairs in April, \nwhose husband was kicked out of the U.N. mission in New York, and most \nrecently for the daughter of Cuba's dictator Raul Castro, the same \ndictator that sends these rapid-response brigades, which is state \nsecurity dressed as civilians, to attack innocent civilians like this.\n  Mariela Castro Espin comes here to the United States with her friends \nto attend the Latin-American Studies Association conference. While Cuba \nholds an American hostage, Allen Gross, and is engaged in what has been \ndescribed as the ``highest monthly number of documented arrests in five \ndecades,'' when well over 1,000 arrests are made of peaceful activists, \nMariela Castro has been parading around the United States on a \npublicity tour describing herself as a ``dissidente.'' I don't know \nfrom what she is a dissident.\n\n  Enough is enough. Why should Mariela Castro be allowed to openly \nspout her Communist vitriol while a real leader of the Cuban people, \nMr. Antunez, who sought to convey his message to Americans through the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, is forced to clandestinely make his \nway to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana to talk and then be beaten \nand jailed simply because of what he said in an open hearing?\n  Why should Josefina Vidal be allowed to host meetings with regime \nsympathizers in the United States while an American citizen, Alan \nGross, sits as a hostage in a Cuban jail for doing nothing but trying \nto assist the island's small Jewish community in creating access to the \nInternet so they are able to communicate with each other?\n  I am also calling on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the U.N. \nCommittee Against Torture, which last week on its own called on Cuba to \nanswer for its dramatic increase in politically motivated arrests, to \nimmediately investigate this incident. Make no mistake, this was not a \nrandom bureaucratic arrest, not a random act of violence by thugs of \nthe regime. It was an in-your-face exercise of the most brutal kind \nintended to send a message to the United States and the Senate.\n  During the course of the hearing I chaired, I noticed there were \nmembers of the Cuban Interests Section; members of the Castro regime--\nwe are a democracy, so we allow them to come to hearings such as ours--\nwho were taking copious notes of everything that was going on. I made \nit clear we would be watching for any retribution against any witness \nfrom inside Cuba.\n  Cuba's leaders heard that message loudly and clearly and their \nbeating and arrest of Antunez was their response to the Senate.\n  This was a deliberate violation of human rights, in my view, ordered \nat the highest levels of the regime as punishment simply because \nAntunez had the courage to speak truth to power.\n  Enough. Enough violent repression in Cuba. Enough beatings of those \nwho seek nothing more than freedom to speak out and tell the truth. \nEnough abuse. Enough imprisonment.\n  What more evidence do we need of the tragedies of daily life inside \nCuba for those who are peaceful, prodemocracy, human rights advocates, \npolitical dissidents, and independent journalists as we saw here? What \nmore evidence do we need? How much more can we forget? I find my \nfriends in Hollywood have all kinds of great things to say about the \nCastro brothers, but what about this? What about the 1,000 who were \narrested and are languishing in Castro's jails? What about those who \ndie on hunger strikes as a result of their peaceful protest for the \nabuse they are going through? The silence is deafening.\n  Let's stand for Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, who knew what might happen \nwhen he agreed to testify before our committee. His determination to \nput Cuba on a path to freedom is what gave him the strength and the \ncourage--in the face of what he knew a brutal dictatorship could do and \nwould do--to come forward and tell us his story, which is the story of \na repressed people waiting for freedom. The courage of thousands and \nthousands of men and women on the streets of Havana, in the countryside \nacross the island is what we can never forget in our dealings with the \ndictatorial, repressive regime that has ruled Cuba since the middle of \nthe last century.\n  Still today, 23 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, these Cubans \nremain trapped in a closed society, cut off from the advancements of \nthe world--repressed, threatened, fearful of saying or doing something \nthat will land them in prison, often for years--years. Imagine an \nAmerican citizen, protesting outside the Capitol, thinking that could \nget them put in a gulag for 10, 15 or 20 years. That is what these \npeople are going through. They land in prison, are beaten until they \nare unconscious. Yet the silence is deafening. It is unconscionable.\n  I urge each and every one of us in this institution, if we cherish \nthe ability in this institution to have the free flow of testimony from \nanyone in the world without reprisal, to be outraged about what \nhappened with the beating of Mr. Antunez and his imprisonment. I urge \nevery American to remember Mr. Antunez today. I urge every American to \nremember all the victims of the Castro brothers, just as we remember \nall those around the world who have suffered and died under the iron \nfist of other repressive dictatorships.\n  As I have said many times before, the Cuban people are no less \ndeserving of America's support than the millions who were imprisoned \nand forgotten at other times around the world--lost to their families, \nleft to die for nothing more than a single expression of dissent. I am \ncompelled to ask again today, as I have before, as I did at the \nhearing, why is there such an obvious double standard when it comes to \nCuba?\n  I am amazed at colleagues who come and talk about repression, \nbrutality, beatings, and the imprisonment of average citizens around \nthe globe. Yet they are silent, silent, silent about Cuba. We are \nwilling to tighten sanctions in other places around the world, but we \nlet a repressive regime in Cuba basically walk away.\n  It is not time to forget. It is not time to forget Mr. Antunez, who \nwas willing to risk his life to give testimony before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. It is not time to forget Alan Gross, an \nAmerican citizen, who for over 2 years--over 2 years--has been sitting \nin Castro's jail, sick, his mother dying, his wife and family \ndesperately needing him. What was his crime? His crime was trying to \nhelp the Jewish people in Havana talk to each other. We can't forget \nAlan Gross. We can't forget those who suffered and died at the hands of \nthe dictators. We can't forget the arrest and beating of Antunez, \nclearly as a result of his testimony--proof positive of the continuing \nbrutality of the Castro brothers.\n  I hope we can shock the conscience of any Member of the Senate who \nwould want to hear any witness, anywhere around the world, give \ntestimony about an oppressive regime, to come forth to speak and give \ninsight about what is happening in their country and to not face \nretaliation against them. If the Senate speaks with a powerful voice in \nthis respect, it can maybe save Mr. Antunez's life, and it can send a \nmessage to the world that we will not tolerate the beating and \nimprisonment and near death of those who are willing to come and \ntestify before us.\n  I think the integrity of the Senate is at stake in terms of how we \nrespond. I hope--I hope--silence will not be the response.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Rotary \nClub of Louisville, which is celebrating its 100th year of service to \nthe Louisville community this year. Chartered on July 22, 1912, it has \nleft Louisville, the State of Kentucky, and our Nation better off \nthanks to its efforts over the past century.\n  The Rotary Club of Louisville was the first Rotary Club in Kentucky \nand the 45th worldwide, welcoming members from 10 regional States. \nToday, between 450 and 490 Louisville-area residents are members of \nthis organization.\n  In its early years, the Rotary Club of Louisville engaged in several \nlocal service initiatives. One of the club's first major projects was \nto restore the burial place of President Zachary Taylor, a Louisville \nnative. In 1918, members established a student-loan fund for young men \nat Male High School and Manual High School during World War I. When \nradio was in its infancy, a weekly radio program was broadcast by the \nLouisville Rotary Club in 1922 and 1923. In the flood of 1937, members \nof the club assisted in cleanup and repair throughout the State.\n  During the World War II era, the Louisville Rotary Club expanded its \noutreach to the world, fundraising for the war effort and working with \ndefense-related agencies. Many of the club's members also served in the \nArmed Forces. After the war, notable accomplishments included the \nbuilding of George Rogers Clark Park, as well as founding the Harelip \nand Cleft Palate Foundation.\n  In 1953, the Louisville Rotary Club began its time-proven training \nfor new members, or ``Yearlings,'' which is still used today, and the \nfollowing year, the Club adopted the Rotary International Constitution. \nIn 1987, the historically male club admitted its first female member, \nPatricia W. Hart, the Club's executive director. Also in 1987, members \nof the club donated $137,000 to the Rotary International program to \neliminate polio worldwide.\n  The Rotary Club of Louisville has created several awards to honor its \nmembers for their contributions. In 1975, Howard Fitch was recognized \nas the club's first Paul Harris Fellow for his contribution to the \nRotary International Foundation. Today, there are 275 Paul Harris \nFellows. In 1991, the Rotarian of the Year Award was started, and in \n1999, the ``Lifetime Service Award'' was established and first awarded \nto Henry Heuser Sr., posthumously.\n  In recent years, members of the Louisville Club volunteer locally by \nproviding career guidance for high-school seniors and graduates and a \nmentoring program for high-school students. Along with this, members \nregularly work as bell-ringers for the Salvation Army. Internationally, \nthe club works with student-exchange programs and various diverse \nscholarships, including the Ambassadorial Scholarship Competition, the \nInternational Scholarship Competition, and the Kentucky Rotary Youth \nInternational Exchange.\n  In 1996, the ``Saving Lives Worldwide Program'' was created to \ncollect and deliver U.S. medical supplies to the world's poorest \ncountries. During its first 8 years, this program completed 17 \nshipments valued at $4 million to 10 developing countries, including \nNicaragua, Latvia, Nepal, Romania, Panama, Ecuador, Belize, and Ghana. \nAlong with this, the Louisville Rotary Club has worked with clubs \ninternationally to open six new dental clinics in Panama, Ecuador, and \nNepal.\n  The Rotary Club of Louisville has created the Rotary Leadership \nFellows Program, which identifies individuals early in their careers \nwith the potential to become community leaders. These individuals are \nthen invited to participate in a 3-year Rotary Leadership Development \nProgram.\n  In honor of the club's centennial celebration, the Promise \nScholarship program has been initiated to provide hundreds of high-\nschool graduates with grant money to help pay for college tuition.\n  The past 100 years have seen the Louisville Rotary Club meet and \nexceed the Rotary International credo of ``Service Above Self.'' It is \nan honor to represent here in the U.S. Senate so many civic-minded \nKentuckians of goodwill who understand the value of public service. I \nwould ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing the Rotary \nClub of Louisville for its 100 years of service to the Louisville \ncommunity, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3895-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3895-S3896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENDING FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Select Committee on Intelligence has \njust reported a bill that would extend the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 \nfor 5 more years. I voted against this extension in the Intelligence \nCommittee's markup because I believe that Congress does not have enough \ninformation about this law's impact on the privacy of law-abiding \nAmerican citizens, and because I am concerned about a loophole in the \nlaw that could allow the government to effectively conduct warrantless \nsearches for Americans' communications. Consistent with my own \nlongstanding policy and Senate rules, I am announcing with this \nstatement for the Congressional Record that it is my intention to \nobject to any request to pass this bill by unanimous consent.\n  I will also explain my reasoning a bit further, in case it is helpful \nto any colleagues who are less familiar with this issue. Over a decade \nago the intelligence community identified a problem: surveillance laws \ndesigned to protect the privacy of people inside the United States were \nsometimes making it hard to collect the communications of people \noutside the United States. The Bush administration's solution to this \nproblem was to set up a warrantless wiretapping program, which operated \nin secret for a number of years. When this program became public \nseveral years ago many Americans--myself included--were shocked and \nappalled. Many Members of Congress denounced the Bush administration \nfor this illegal and unconstitutional act.\n  However, Members of Congress also wanted to address the original \nproblem that had been identified, so in 2008 Congress passed a law \nmodifying the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The \npurpose of this 2008 legislation was to give the government new \nauthorities to collect the communications of people who are believed to \nbe foreigners outside the United States, while still preserving the \nprivacy of people inside the United States.\n  Specifically, the central provision in the FISA Amendments Act of \n2008 added a new section to the original FISA statute, now known as \nsection 702. As I said, section 702 was designed to give the government \nnew authorities to collect the communications of people who are \nreasonably believed to be foreigners outside the United States. Because \nsection 702 does not involve obtaining individual warrants, it contains \nlanguage specifically intended to limit the government's ability to use \nthese new authorities to deliberately spy on American citizens.\n  The bill contained an expiration date of December 2012, and the \npurpose of this expiration date was to force Members of Congress to \ncome back in a few years and examine whether these new authorities had \nbeen interpreted and implemented as intended. Before Congress votes \nthis year to renew these authorities it is important to understand how \nthey are working in practice, so that Members of Congress can decide \nwhether the law needs to be modified or reformed.\n  In particular, it is important for Congress to better understand how \nmany people inside the United States have\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\nhad their communications collected or reviewed under the authorities \ngranted by the FISA Amendments Act. If only a handful of people inside \nthe United States have been surveilled in this manner, then that would \nindicate that Americans' privacy is being protected. On the other hand, \nif a large number of people inside the United States have had their \ncommunications collected or reviewed because of this law, then that \nwould suggest that protections for Americans' privacy need to be \nstrengthened.\n  Unfortunately, while Senator Udall of Colorado and I have sought \nrepeatedly to gain an understanding of how many Americans have had \ntheir phone calls or e-mails collected and reviewed under this statute, \nwe have not been able to obtain even a rough estimate of this number.\n  The Office of the Director of National Intelligence told the two of \nus in July 2011 that ``it is not reasonably possible to identify the \nnumber of people located in the United States whose communications may \nhave been reviewed'' under the FISA Amendments Act. I am prepared to \naccept that it might be difficult to come up with an exact count of \nthis number, but it is hard for me to believe that it is impossible to \neven estimate it.\n  During the committee's markup of this bill Senator Udall and I \noffered an amendment that would have directed the inspectors general of \nthe intelligence community and the Department of Justice to produce an \nestimate of how many Americans have had their communications collected \nunder section 702. Our amendment would have permitted the inspectors \ngeneral to come up with a rough estimate of this number, using whatever \nanalytical techniques they deemed appropriate. We are disappointed that \nthis amendment was voted down by the committee, but we will continue \nour efforts to obtain this information.\n  I am concerned, of course, that if no one has even estimated how many \nAmericans have had their communications collected under the FISA \nAmendments Act, then it is possible that this number could be quite \nlarge. Since all of the communications collected by the government \nunder section 702 are collected without individual warrants, I believe \nthat there should be clear rules prohibiting the government from \nsearching through these communications in an effort to find the phone \ncalls or e-mails of a particular American, unless the government has \nobtained a warrant or emergency authorization permitting surveillance \nof that American.\n  Section 702, as it is currently written, does not contain adequate \nprotections against warrantless ``back door'' searches of this nature--\neven though they are the very thing that many people thought the FISA \nAmendments Act was intended to prevent. Senator Udall and I offered an \namendment during the committee's markup of this bill that would have \nclarified the law to prohibit searching through communications \ncollected under section 702 in an effort to find a particular \nAmerican's communications. Our amendment included exceptions for \nsearches that involved a warrant or an emergency authorization, as well \nas for searches for the phone calls or e-mails of people who are \nbelieved to be in danger or who consent to the search. I am \ndisappointed that this amendment was also voted down by the committee, \nbut I will continue to work with my colleagues to find a way to close \nthis loophole before the FISA Amendments Act is extended.\n  I recognize that the collection that has taken place under the FISA \nAmendments Act has produced some useful intelligence, so my preference \nwould be to enact a short-term reauthorization to give Congress time to \nget more information about the impact of this law on Americans' privacy \nrights and consider possible modifications. However, I believe that \nprotections against warrantless searches for Americans' communications \nshould be added to the law immediately.\n  An obvious question that I have not answered here is whether any \nwarrantless searches for Americans' communications have already taken \nplace. I am not suggesting that any warrantless searches have or have \nnot occurred, because Senate and committee rules regarding classified \ninformation generally prohibit me from discussing what intelligence \nagencies are actually doing or not doing. However, I believe that we \nhave an obligation as elected legislators to discuss what these \nagencies should or should not be doing, and it is my hope that a \nmajority of my Senate colleagues will agree with that searching for \nAmericans' phone calls and e-mails without a warrant is something that \nthese agencies should not do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3896-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO NANCY KEENAN\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I wish to give my warm \ncongratulations to my dear friend and fellow Montanan Nancy Keenan. \nNancy announced recently that she would step down as President of NARAL \nPro-Choice America to return to her home state of Montana for some \nwell-deserved R & R. Nancy has served as president of NARAL for the \npast 8 years, devoting her time to protecting the rights of women \nacross the country.\n  Nancy has a storied career that epitomizes the tough female figures \nof Montana history. Nancy grew up in the blue-collar town of Anaconda, \nas one of five children in her Irish Catholic family. Her father was a \nboilermaker for the Anaconda smelter, and her mother worked as a clerk \nat the Marcus Daly Hotel and later at Thrifty Drug Store.\n  Upon entering college, Nancy paid her way by taking a job at the \nsmelter, becoming one of the first women laborers at the smelter. This \nwas a tough and dangerous place to work, shoveling ore and handling big \nbuckets of boiling copper. But Nancy took on the challenge with the \ntenacity that we friends have gotten to know very well. Her hard work \npaid off. Nancy became the first in her family to graduate from \ncollege. She obtained her bachelor's degree in elementary education \nfrom Eastern Montana College. Later she received her master's degree in \neducation administration from the University of Montana. Nancy spent 13 \nyears teaching special education in Anaconda.\n  Nancy speaks fondly of her time growing up in Anaconda, and her \ndesire to enter public service was shaped early in life. Nancy once \ntold the story of the family discussing public service and political \nhappenings while around the dinner table each night. She said, ``I \nremember my dad often posing problems. When my sisters, brothers, and I \nwould protest, `But it isn't fair.' my dad would simply reply, `Then \nmake it fair.''' Nancy did just that.\n  Nancy was first elected to the Montana House of Representatives in \n1983, and she served 6 years as a state legislator. In 1988, she was \nelected to statewide office as the Montana Superintendent for Public \nInstruction, a position she held until 2000.\n  As a public official, she never shied away from the difficult issues. \nAnd Nancy's commitment to women's rights has been steadfast in her \ncareer. During Nancy's eight years at the helm of NARAL Pro-Choice, she \nhas worked nonstop to protect women's right to choose.\n  She is a fighter and one of the hardest workers you will ever know. \nShe embodies the tenacity and savvy forged while working at the \nAnaconda Copper Smelter to pay for college. Nancy has inspired a new \ngeneration of leaders, particularly young women, and her dedication to \nMontanans throughout her life deserves our thanks and recognition.\n  I congratulate Nancy as she enters the next chapter of her life and \nwish her all the best as she returns to Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3896-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3896-S3897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OBSERVING NATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH MONTH\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate \nNational Cancer Research Month, honoring the courageous and determined \nresearchers, clinicians, and patients, who contribute their energy and \ntalent to our Nation's progress in cancer prevention and treatment. In \nMay, we recognized their bravery and unfaltering commitment to fighting \na complex, multifarious disease that affects millions of Americans. \nThis year, I particularly acknowledge the prevalence and continuing \nscourge of tobacco-related cancers and efforts made to combat them \nthrough innovative research, prevention measures, and programs for the\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\ncessation of tobacco use. Lung cancer is the second-most diagnosed \ncancer and the most commonly fatal form of cancer for both men and \nwomen in our country.\n  Through comprehensive efforts of leading institutions our Nation \nteams up in the quest for more information, campaigns for prevention \nawareness, and researches and disseminates improved treatments. The \nAmerican Association for Cancer Research, AACR, is the oldest and \nlargest scientific organization in the world dedicated to cancer, and \nit has led to the creation of several other leading cancer research \ncenters in Connecticut and throughout the nation. The work of these \ncutting-edge institutions--guided by dedicated leaders in clinical \nresearch and education awareness--advance our understanding of cancer \ntreatment and prevention every day. They are improving quality of care, \nenhancing our ability to reach a larger national audience, and \ndeveloping personalized treatments.\n  Connecticut has been on the frontlines of pioneering novel methods of \nresearching and treating tobacco-related cancers. For example, Yale \nCancer Center, under the direction of Dr. Roy Herbst--Associate \nDirector for Translational Research and the Chief of Medical Oncology--\nhas focused on lung cancer research and clinical care, spearheading a \nvast number of anticancer drug studies. He has placed original DNA \nresearch into the traditional scientific method and used this framework \nto discover cancer treatments that are catered to the individual \npatient. In this way, the type of tumor becomes less important than the \nunderlying genetic driver. He is a role model for our Nation's \nresearchers and physicians and an inspiration to current and future \nmedical students.\n  Today, I also commend the bravery of patients who participate in \nnovel clinical trials. By assuming risk and embracing the unknown, \nthese cancer patients help to further medical research and look out for \nfuture generations.\n  Throughout Connecticut and the nation, we have seen the positive \neffects of national organizations with engaged, local arms, such as the \nAACR, the American Lung Association, and Tobacco Free Kids. These \ninstitutions have shown Americans of all generations the carcinogenic \neffects of tobacco products. The AACR's Task Force on Tobacco and \nCancer drives the message that cancer research and the dissemination of \nthis new information to Americans are equally important in fighting our \nnational cancer epidemic. The American Lung Association creates a forum \nfor Americans and their families, empowering smokers--and those with \nloved ones who are addicted to tobacco--with the tough truth while \noffering proactive ways to integrate what we know about tobacco and \ncancer into daily life. Tobacco Free Kids keeps watch over Federal, \nState, and local government initiatives against tobacco addiction, \nbuilding and maintaining momentum for a national tobacco policy and \ncancer prevention campaign.\n  These three organizations--as well as a number of other groups--host \ncritically important forums for policy experts, lawmakers, and the \npublic. They explain the science behind tobacco-related cancers and \nteach Americans how to care for their long-term health and the well-\nbeing of our future generations through smoking-cessation techniques \nand treatments. Today, the National Cancer Policy Forum is hosting a \nworkshop on ``Reducing Tobacco-Related Cancer Incidence and Mortality'' \nat the National Academy of Sciences. I applaud this exemplary \nconference of panel discussions, new ideas, and collaboration--that \nbrings together physicians, administrators, researchers, and \norganizations to foster proactive measures that inspire healthy \nfutures.\n  At a time when Federal and State investment into prevention programs \nis at an unfortunate low, these leading institutions prove we can save \nlives through education and awareness. We must also continue to support \nrobust medical research funding through the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, and the Federal Drug Administration, to maintain \nand continue to improve upon our Nation's comprehensive and effective \napproach to fighting tobacco-related cancers.\n  In the face of this truly devastating disease that takes one American \nper minute, those that work fastidiously towards prevention and a cure, \nare true heroes.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Reverend \nBonita Grubbs, a community leader who has given so faithfully and \ngenerously to New Haven and Connecticut. Reverend Grubbs has been \nrecently awarded the 11th Annual Reverend Howard Nash Community \nLeadership Award by Community Mediation, CM, an extraordinary \norganization that helps individuals and organizations resolve conflict \nthrough mediation and dialogue.\n  Since 1988, Reverend Grubbs has served as Executive Director of \nChristian Community Action, CCA, leading a set of well-established and \ncrucial programs and social services for the poor and under-privileged \nin the Greater-New Haven area. CCA prides itself on providing emergency \nsolutions with the underlying intention of proactive education for \nlong-term sustainability and self-sufficiency. In addition to offering \nemergency services, CAA also runs education, housing, food, mentorship, \nafter-school, and youth summer programs.\n  However, this role is only one dimension of Reverend Grubbs' \ncontributions to her community. She is a champion of social justice, \nconscious of laying the foundations of sustainable lifestyles that will \nlast for future generations. Reverend Grubbs has made tremendous impact \nthrough the Greater New Haven Community Loan Fund and as President of \nthe Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, Co-Chair and member of \nthe Steering Committee of New Haven's Fighting Back Project, columnist \nfor the New Haven Register, Board of Trustee for the Hospital of St. \nRaphael, and Board Member for both Connecticut Voices for Children and \nConnecticut Center for School Change.\n  Very appropriately, Reverend Grubbs has been given an award named \nafter Reverend Howard Nash, who was renowned in New Haven as an \nomnipresent peacemaker and founder of the Dialogue Project--an \ninterfaith effort by CM and Interfaith Cooperative Ministries, ICM. \nAlthough ordained within the American Baptist Church, Reverend Grubbs' \npublic service transcends religion and race.\n  In addition to this most recent honor, she has been lauded by several \ncommunity organizations, receiving the Public Citizen Award from the \nConnecticut Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers, the \nConsultation Center's Prevention Award, the Women Who Make a Difference \nAward by the Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund, and the \nGreater New Haven Community Loan Fund's Good Egg Award.\n  Reverend Grubbs' generous spirit and loving care for her community \nmake her a role model for all. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in \nthanking Reverend Grubbs for her contributions to humanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3897-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3897-S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MAURICE SENDAK\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nMaurice Sendak, famed children's book author and illustrator, who \npassed away on May 8 in Connecticut, where he spent most of his life. \nHe would have turned 84 yesterday.\n  Tucked away in an 18th century home in Ridgefield, CT, Mr. Sendak \ndrew inspiration for his widely read, uniquely bizarre illustrated \nstories from his own memories and contemplations. His fantastical \nrealism--experienced by most American families through the eyes of Max, \nthe central character in ``Where the Wild Things Are''--changed the way \nchildren grew up. Mr. Sendak created a new genre of children's \nliterature full of vestiges and memories of the horrors he and others \nfaced maturing during World War II, the Holocaust, and the Great \nDepression.\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\n  Many of us have read Mr. Sendak's phrases to loved ones and puzzled \nover his intended meaning. Stories like ``Chicken Soup with Rice,'' \n``Pierre: A Cautionary Tale,'' ``In the Night Kitchen,'' ``Seven Little \nMonsters,'' and ``Outside Over There'' are now legendary.\n  He committed himself to being an artist, beginning as a window \ndesigner at FAO Schwartz, and from there adding illustrator, author, \nproducer, animator, and costume and set designer to his repertoire. He \ncollaborated with many famed creators, including Jim Henson, Carole \nKing, the Pacific Northwest Ballet, the Houston Grand Opera, the Los \nAngeles Music Center, the New York City Opera, the Chicago Opera \nTheatre, and Tony Kushner. Most recently, Mr. Sendak teamed with the \nYale Repertory Theatre, in conjunction with the Berkeley Repertory \nTheatre and the New Victory Theater in New York, to produce a \ncontemporary English version of a 1938 Czech children's opera about the \nHolocaust called ``Brundibar.''\n  Mr. Sendak's emotional intelligence, visual expertise, and way with \nwords have produced over 100 works, some of which have been celebrated \nwith several prestigious literary awards. In 1964, ``Where the Wild \nThings Are'' was given the Caldecott Medal from the American Library \nAssociation. In addition, Mr. Sendak received the Hans Christian \nAndersen award for Illustration in 1970, National Book Award in 1982, \nLaura Ingalls Wilder Award in 1993, and was presented with a National \nMedal for the Arts by President Bill Clinton in 1996. The New York \nTimes has selected 22 of his titles as best illustrated books of the \nyear, and an elementary school in North Hollywood, CA was even named in \nhis honor.\n  Mr. Sendak was a lover of life and forever faithful to the artistic \nprocess. In a public and deeply personal National Public Radio \ninterview in 2011, he shared vulnerable emotions, ending simply, but \nprofoundly and quite tellingly with mantralike poetry: ``live your \nlife, live your life, live your life.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3898-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SUPPORTING JERRY KRAMER\n\n Mr. CRAPO: Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Jim Risch, \njoins me today in highlighting the career of one of Idaho's most \ndistinguished football players, Jerry Kramer.\n  Jerry graduated from Sandpoint High School, in the northern part of \nour State, and attended college at the University of Idaho on a \nfootball scholarship. He was a standout player there, garnering \nselections to both the East-West Shrine Game and College All-Star Game.\n  After being drafted 39th, he signed on to play for the Green Bay \nPackers in 1958, and as football fans know, was part of a championship \ndynasty during his 11 playing years. He was an integral part of the \nfamous ``Packer Sweep'' as the lead blocker for a running back going \naround the end.\n  Jerry Kramer is perhaps most famously known for ``The Block'' where \nhe led quarterback Bart Starr into the end zone as time ran out in the \n1967 NFL Championship game, defeating the Dallas Cowboys in what is \nknown as the ``Ice Bowl.''\n  Jerry Kramer was a five-time All-Pro, a member of five championship \nteams, including the first two Super Bowls, and a member of the NFL's \n50th Anniversary All-Time team. He was named to the NFL's All-Decade \nTeam of the 1960s at offensive guard and led the NFL in field goal \npercentage in 1962.\n  Surprisingly, Jerry Kramer is the only player selected to the NFL's \n50th Anniversary team who has not been inducted into the Pro Football \nHall of Fame in Canton, OH.\n  It is time for this oversight to be corrected. Jerry Kramer is highly \nregarded. Sixteen current members of the NFL Hall of Fame, many who \nplayed against Kramer, have endorsed his nomination and election to the \nHall. That list of players includes such greats as Roger Staubach, \nFrank Gifford, Alan Page, Bob Lilly, Jan Stenerud, Gino Marchetti and \nCoach Joe Gibbs, to name just a few.\n  There is no doubt in my mind, and certainly not in the mind of my \ncolleague, Senator Risch, who highly favors his native State's Green \nBay Packers, that Jerry Kramer's NFL career clearly qualifies him for \ninduction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n  Besides his contributions on the football field, Jerry is a highly \nregarded citizen of Idaho who gives his time to worthy causes. Idahoans \nare very proud of his accomplishments and football fans throughout the \nstate support his induction.\n  As Idaho's U.S. Senators, we support Jerry Kramer's selection to the \nPro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3898-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE DAVE THOMAS FOUNDATION FOR ADOPTION\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as cochair of both the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption and the Senate Caucus on Foster \nYouth, I wish to congratulate the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption \non the occasion of its 20th anniversary.\n  The foundation was established in 1992 by Dave Thomas as a public \ncharity with one primary goal: to help every child in foster care find \na loving, permanent family. Throughout its history, the foundation has \nset forth on a mission of dramatically increasing the number of \nadoptions of waiting children.\n  For 20 years, the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption has committed \nitself to finding permanent families for the more than 100,000 children \nwaiting in the United States foster care system.\n  The Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption awards grants to public and \nprivate adoption agencies all across the country. Last year, these \ngrants totaled more than $8 million and focused on supporting adoption \nprofessionals who implement proactive, child-focused recruitment \nprograms targeted exclusively on moving the longest waiting children \nfrom foster care into adoptive families. This signature program is \ncalled Wendy's Wonderful Kids, WWK, and today exists in all 50 States, \nDC, and four Canadian provinces.\n  The results from an empirical 5-year case study on WWK were released \nin October 2011. The research showed that children in the program are \nup to three times more likely to be adopted.\n  The foundation also supports employers through the Adoption-Friendly \nWorkplace Program, is a founding member of National Adoption Day, and \nis a proud partner of the annual television special, ``A Home for the \nHolidays.''\n  The foundation is an accredited charity of the Better Business Bureau \nWise Giving Alliance, Standards for Excellence certified, and has \nreceived the highest possible rating on Charity Navigator. The \nfoundation has helped more than 3,000 children find their forever \nfamilies and provided information and support to tens of thousands of \npotential adoptive families.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to applaud the Dave Thomas Foundation \nfor Adoption and its dedicated staff for their extraordinary \ncontributions to the people of my district and throughout the United \nStates for the last 20 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3898-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3898-S3899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING FIFE LAKE PUBLIC LIBRARY'S 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as they have for generations, \nlibraries across our Nation and my home State of Michigan enable people \nto gain access to a sea of information and facts. They serve as a \ngateway for exploration. Libraries allow young people to journey back \nin time with great authors and experience the world as it was for past \ngenerations. They allow them to travel across the globe and experience \nlife in other areas of the world, and they allow them to dream and \nimagine ways to make our collective future better. These are places \nwhere the only limitation is your imagination and your willingness to \nread and learn.\n  For the past 125 years, one such library in Fife Lake has played this \nunmistakably important role, and it is with great pride that I pay \ntribute to the Fife Lake Public Library on its Quasquicentennial. This \nwonderful institution has surely helped to cultivate and nurture the \ninterests of individuals seeking to broaden and deepen their \nunderstanding of a variety of pursuits.\n  The Fife Lake Public Library was established in 1887 with a $17 grant \nfrom Grand Traverse County. Since then, this library has been a \nmainstay of the community and has met the diverse and growing needs of \nresidents of Fife\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\nLake. The library's quaint but much-cherished building was outgrown in \n2006. To accommodate this growth, the library's resources were moved to \na newer, more modern building. Impressively, the Library's circulation \nhas quadrupled in the last decade. In addition to books, its patrons \nnow have access to DVDs, albums, audiobooks and the Internet by way of \nseveral public computers.\n  In our increasingly technologically advanced world where information \nand answers are but a click away and devices such as computers and \nsmart phones are a part of many of our lives, it could be easy to \nundervalue the importance and impact of libraries. The opposite is \ntrue. Fife Lake Public Library has transformed with the digital age and \ncontinues to hold a central yet evolving role in the lives of \nresidents. One resident aptly stated, ``The library is not a quiet \nplace anymore but a social gathering place for the community.'' \nResidents come to access the Internet and learn computer skills, and \nthrough partnerships with local organizations they enjoy activities \nranging from fitness classes to grief support to tot-time. There is \nsomething for residents from all walks of life.\n  I am delighted to commend all those affiliated with the Fife Lake \nPublic Library on its 125th anniversary. Through the hard work, \ncollaboration, and financial generosity of many within the Fife Lake \ncommunity, this library has served the needs of Fife Lake residents for \na century and a quarter. With commitment and sustained effort, this \npiece of living history in Fife Lake will continue to inspire and \neducate for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3899-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEN FREIBERG\n\n Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Kenneth \nFreiberg, Deputy General Counsel at the Office of the United States \nTrade Representative (USTR). Mr. Freiberg is retiring from USTR after \nmore than 24 years of extraordinary service to our country.\n  Since 1988, Ken Freiberg has passionately promoted US trade interests \naround the world. His service has improved the lives of countless \nAmericans. During his tenure, Ken served as the chief U.S. lawyer in \ncharge of negotiations on several important trade negotiations. \nFurther, he was the chief negotiator for the General Agreement on Trade \nin Services during the Uruguay Round.\n  Ken has worked under eight US Trade Representatives and five \nPresidential administrations. Ambassador Kirk and several former U.S. \nTrade Representatives, including myself, recently sent Ken a letter to \nrecognize his achievements. Let me read an excerpt and I quote ``each \nof us benefited greatly from your tireless work ethic, immense \nknowledge, wise counsel and excellent judgment.'' I was proud to have \nKen on my team at USTR. He was a source of tremendous institutional \nknowledge at USTR, and was a terrific mentor to many young attorneys on \nthe USTR staff.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize Ken Freiberg, my former \ncolleague, on his retirement from public service and I would like to \nwish him well in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3899-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ANTONIO POMERLEAU\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate Antonio \nPomerleau of Burlington, VT, for his remarkable generosity and for his \nlifetime of service to the people of Vermont. My wife Jane and I have \nknown Tony for over 30 years, since we all worked together when I was \nMayor of Burlington, and he is clearly one of the remarkable people in \nour State.\n  Last year, Vermont was badly hit by Tropical Storm Irene, the most \ndamaging storm in a half century. Torrential rains, in combination with \nVermont's steep hills and narrow valleys, brought flooding on a vast \nscale to town after town, wiping out roads and bridges, downtowns and \nmobile home parks, homes, schools and businesses.\n  Many brave and generous people, from communities across the State, \nhelped those whose lives were uprooted to deal with their losses. The \nVermont National Guard, along with the Guards of other States and \nprivate contractors, rapidly repaired and rebuilt washed-out roads and \nbridges. State officials and Federal officials were quick to provide \nrelief and aid.\n  There are Federal funds available to help rebuild highways, to assist \nfarmers as they cope with damage to their fields, to help many \nhomeowners. But, as the Governor's ``Irene Recovery Report'' indicates, \nmobile home owners are in a category by themselves. Irene particularly \ndevastated mobile home parks, many of which were built close to rivers \nthat endured major flooding. Sixteen mobile home parks in many regions \nof Vermont were seriously affected by Irene. Hundreds of mobile homes \nwere badly damaged or completely destroyed. As the ``Irene Recovery \nReport'' made clear, while mobile homes provide an important affordable \nownership option to Vermonters, their construction, location and low \nresistance to water damage can create additional obstacles to recovery \nfollowing a disaster. Few of the Vermonters affected had significant \ndiscretionary resources with which to secure replacement housing.\n  Owners and residents of mobile homes faced enormous challenges. Into \nthe breach stepped Antonio Pomerleau.\n  Tony, who grew up on a small dairy farm in the Northeast Kingdom of \nVermont, has never forgotten the working families of Vermont. It should \nbe no surprise, though it is nevertheless remarkable, that in the \naftermath of the flooding last year Tony would generously look out for \nthose who live in affordable housing and cannot afford to rebuild when \ncatastrophe strikes.\n  Today, I want celebrate Tony for his act of enormous generosity in \ncreating the Pomerleau Cornerstone Fund and giving it $1 million. This \nfund has one purpose: to provide direct funding to residents of mobile \nhomes whose residences were destroyed by Tropical Storm Irene.\n  The Pomerleau Cornerstone Fund will help displaced mobile residents \neither with full replacement of their homes, or with downpayment \nassistance for another home. It will provide grants up to $25,000 so \nthat at least 40 families can move into safe and affordable housing.\n  Throughout his entire adult life, Tony has been a model of what a \ngood corporate citizen should be. He has been an excellent employer, \nand he has devoted a good part of his life and considerable skills \ntoward public service--without remuneration. For many years he served \nas Police Commissioner of Burlington and did an outstanding job in that \nrole. He has also been extremely generous in donating funds to a wide \nvariety of very worthy causes.\n  Since I was Mayor of Burlington, and this is going back 31 years, \nTony Pomerleau has paid for a holiday party each year for Burlington's \nlow income children and their parents. He also sponsors an annual party \nfor the Vermont National Guard. He was the major contributor of funds \nto the Pomerleau Alumni Center at St. Michael's College--two of his \nsons and a granddaughter attended college there. He has provided \nscholarships to Rice High School and funded renovations to Christ the \nKing School. Tony donated the North Avenue building that became our \ncity's police headquarters, and continues to contribute financial \nsupport for policemen and policewomen. And this really is just a very \nsmall part of Tony's philanthropic work.\n  But facts tell only part of the story of Tony Pomerleau. His \ngenerosity is matched by his energy, and even though his 94th birthday \nis in his rearview mirror, he has the energy of a man half his age. His \nmind has always been sharp, and time has not dulled it. His deep love \nfor his wife Rita and their children is the rock on which he has built \nhis life. His understanding of Vermont--where it has been, where it is, \nwhere it can be going--is, in my view, remarkable.\n  Tony Pomerleau stands as one of Vermont's outstanding citizens. \nToday, I celebrate his generosity--it is the habit of lifetime, and a \nhabit we can all learn from.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3899-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3899-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3899-S3900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/11/senate-section/article/S3900-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on June 8, 2012, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 5883.

ENERGY MARKETS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was created as \n     an independent agency, in 1974, with a mandate--\n       (A) to enforce and administer the Commodity Exchange Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 1 et seq.);\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\n       (B) to ensure market integrity;\n       (C) to protect market users from fraud and abusive trading \n     practices; and\n       (D) to prevent and prosecute manipulation of the price of \n     any commodity in interstate commerce;\n       (2) Congress declared in section 4a of the Commodity \n     Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6a) that excessive speculation imposes \n     an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce;\n       (3) title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) (and \n     amendments made by that Act) required the Commission to \n     establish position limits ``to diminish, eliminate, or \n     prevent excessive speculation'' for trading in crude oil, \n     gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and other \n     physical commodity derivatives by January 17, 2011;\n       (4) the Commission has failed to impose position limits to \n     diminish, eliminate, or prevent excessive oil and gasoline \n     speculation as required by law;\n       (5) according to an article published in Forbes on February \n     27, 2012, excessive oil speculation ``translates out into a \n     premium for gasoline at the pump of $.56 a gallon'' based on \n     a recent report from Goldman Sachs;\n       (6) on May 25, 2012--\n       (A) the supply of commercial crude oil in the United States \n     was higher than the supply was on May 22, 2009, when the \n     national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded \n     gasoline was less than $2.45; and\n       (B) demand for gasoline in the United States was lower than \n     demand was on May 22, 2009;\n       (7) on June 6, 2012, the national average price of regular \n     unleaded gasoline was $3.57 a gallon, more than $1 per gallon \n     more than 3 years ago when commercial crude oil supplies were \n     lower and demand was higher;\n       (8) during the last quarter of 2011, according to the \n     International Energy Agency--\n       (A) the world oil supply rose by 1,300,000 barrels per day \n     while demand only increased by 700,000 barrels per day; but\n       (B) the price of Texas light sweet crude rose by more than \n     12 percent;\n       (9) on November 3, 2011, Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission testified before the \n     Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that ``80 to \n     87 percent of the [oil futures] market'' is dominated by \n     ``financial participants, swap dealers, hedge funds, and \n     other financials,'' a figure that has more than doubled over \n     the prior decade;\n       (10) excessive oil and gasoline speculation is creating \n     major market disturbances that prevent the market from \n     accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand; and\n       (11) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has a \n     responsibility--\n       (A) to ensure that the price discovery for oil and gasoline \n     accurately reflects the fundamentals of supply and demand; \n     and\n       (B) to take immediate action to implement strong and \n     meaningful position limits to regulated exchange markets to \n     eliminate excessive oil speculation.\n       (b) Actions.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall use the \n     authority of the Commission (including emergency powers, if \n     necessary)--\n       (1) to implement position limits that will diminish, \n     eliminate, or prevent excessive speculation in the trading of \n     crude oil, gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and \n     other physical commodity derivatives as required under title \n     VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n     Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) (and amendments made \n     by that Act); and\n       (2) to curb immediately the role of excessive speculation \n     in any contract market within the jurisdiction and control of \n     the Commission, on or through which energy futures or swaps \n     are traded.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2254.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Recreational Fishing \n     and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act''.\n\n     SEC. 13002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) recreational fishing and hunting are important and \n     traditional activities in which millions of Americans \n     participate;\n       (2) recreational anglers and hunters have been and continue \n     to be among the foremost supporters of sound fish and \n     wildlife management and conservation in the United States;\n       (3) recreational fishing and hunting are environmentally \n     acceptable and beneficial activities that occur and can be \n     provided on Federal public lands and waters without adverse \n     effects on other uses or users;\n       (4) recreational anglers, hunters, and sporting \n     organizations provide direct assistance to fish and wildlife \n     managers and enforcement officers of the Federal Government \n     as well as State and local governments by investing volunteer \n     time and effort to fish and wildlife conservation;\n       (5) recreational anglers, hunters, and the associated \n     industries have generated billions of dollars of critical \n     funding for fish and wildlife conservation, research, and \n     management by providing revenues from purchases of fishing \n     and hunting licenses, permits, and stamps, as well as excise \n     taxes on fishing, hunting, and shooting equipment that have \n     generated billions of dollars of critical funding for fish \n     and wildlife conservation, research, and management;\n       (6) recreational shooting is also an important and \n     traditional activity in which millions of Americans \n     participate, safe recreational shooting is a valid use of \n     Federal public lands, including the establishment of safe and \n     convenient shooting ranges on such lands, and participation \n     in recreational shooting helps recruit and retain hunters and \n     contributes to wildlife conservation;\n       (7) opportunities to recreationally fish, hunt, and shoot \n     are declining, which depresses participation in these \n     traditional activities, and depressed participation adversely \n     impacts fish and wildlife conservation and funding for \n     important conservation efforts; and\n       (8) the public interest would be served, and our citizens' \n     fish and wildlife resources benefitted, by action to ensure \n     that opportunities are facilitated to engage in fishing and \n     hunting on Federal public land as recognized by Executive \n     Order No. 12962, relating to recreational fisheries, and \n     Executive Order No. 13443, relating to facilitation of \n     hunting heritage and wildlife conservation.\n\n     SEC. 13003.
