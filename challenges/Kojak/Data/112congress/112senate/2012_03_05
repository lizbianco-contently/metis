Mr. President, 56 years ago it took President Eisenhower a \nyear to convince Congress and the country to make an unprecedented \ninvestment in America's highway system. After all, building 47,000 \nmiles of interstate highways across the Nation would require an \nunparalleled effort and unprecedented investment. The project required \nenough concrete to build six sidewalks to the Moon at a cost of $50 \nbillion or the equivalent of almost $\\1/2\\ trillion today.\n  The project was hugely successful. It created jobs, it connected \nfarms and factories, tiny towns and towering cities, and allowed \nmanufacturers and merchants to ship goods across our country for the \nfirst time in our Nation's history. Looking back on this effort to pass \nthe first highway bill, President Eisenhower considered it the crowning \naccomplishment of his Presidency.\n  ``More than any single action by the government since the end of the \nwar, this one would change the face of America,'' President Eisenhower \nwrote in his memoir. ``Its impact on the American economy--the jobs it \nwould produce in manufacturing and construction, the rural areas it \nwould open up--was beyond calculation.''\n  Fifty-six years after his initial work, Congress once again is \nconsidering transportation legislation, an investment in this country's \ncrumbling roads, bridges, and train tracks. But we have the benefit of \nhistory on our side. We know from 56 years of experience that investing \nin America's highways and railways will create and sustain jobs, and we \nhave no doubt that building a world-class transportation system will \nhelp us rebuild our world-class economy.\n  That is why the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, and one of \nthe most liberal Members of the Senate, the junior Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, have joined hands to advance this bipartisan \nTransportation bill before this body. The bill is comprised of four \nmeasures reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee and \nthe Banking, Commerce and Finance Committees--all with bipartisan \nsupport. Both sides agreed to a package of 37 amendments in addition to \nthis that is now part of the measure that is before the Senate.\n  This is the legislation, as I have indicated, that is in the Senate \nnow. If the filibuster ended and we passed the bill before us, it would \nbe a huge step forward. Pass what we have now, vote on it, and we could \ncall it a good day for America, a real good day. But in today's \npolitical climate, bipartisan support is not enough to keep good \nlegislation alive. In today's political climate, 85 votes to begin \ndebate on a measure is not enough to guarantee the measure will become \nlaw.\n  The Transportation legislation under consideration is truly \nbipartisan. It will create or sustain 3 million badly needed \nconstruction jobs. Yet Republican leaders have wasted almost a month of \nthe Senate's time obstructing this valuable measure--for political \nreasons, obviously.\n  Unfortunately, Democrats cannot keep construction crews working to \nrepair 70,000 collapsing bridges across the country without Republican \ncooperation. Without Republican cooperation we cannot expand the \nNation's mass transit system to accommodate tens of thousands of new \nriders every year. Without Republican cooperation we cannot create and \nsave 3 million jobs repairing crumbling pavement and building safer \nsidewalks. It will take bipartisan effort to advance this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Frank Turner, a former Federal Highway Administrator, said work on \nthis country's transportation system ``will never be finished because \nAmerica will never be finished.'' Although the work is never finished, \nit is up to Congress to sustain the effort to move it forward. Unless \nCongress acts this month work on highways, bridges, and train tracks \nwill come to a grinding halt. Unless Congress acts, the American \neconomy will pay the price for partisan bickering.\n  What we have before the body now is the measure reported out of the \nfour committees I talked about plus 37 bipartisan amendments. We should \npass that. We should invoke cloture on it and just pass that and wait \nfor the House to pass whatever they do and go to conference. That would \nbe a tremendous step forward for us.\n  I am hopeful my Republican colleagues will join Democrats to put \nAmerican jobs ahead of these procedural games we are having so much \ntrouble with and help us advance this vital transportation legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/05/senate-section/article/S1376-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last Friday evening tornadoes hit \nseveral counties across Kentucky, including Magoffin, Menifee, Morgan, \nLaurel, Martin, Johnson, and Trimble. I might say these were not just \ntornadoes, these were very severe tornadoes all over the southern and \nmidwestern part of our country leaving an incredible trail of \ndevastation across many of our States.\n  In my State the storm caused at least 20 fatalities and more than 300\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\npeople in Kentucky were injured. Forty-eight Kentucky counties suffered \ndamage from the storms and tornadoes Friday evening. I am told that \nabout 19,000 people were without power yesterday. This morning my \ncolleague Senator Paul and I sent a letter to the President urging him \nto approve Gov. Steven Beshear's request for Federal assistance.\n  Yesterday I had a chance to visit arguably the hardest hit of our \ncommunities, West Liberty, KY. It was a scene of total devastation. The \nwhole community has either been evacuated or is in the process of being \nevacuated. The county judge--in our State the county judge is like the \ncounty executive in a number of States--Tim Conley, and Mayor Rupe, the \nmayor of West Liberty, and I toured, frankly, what little is left of \nthe community. I ran into the county attorney there. Not only had her \nhome been wiped out, her office had been wiped out.\n  The most poignant story of the day was when one of the local \nresidents came up to one of my assistants and said: Here, I found $70. \nIt doesn't belong to me. I want you to take it and see to it that it is \nused for the community.\n  My assistant said: No one knows where the $70 came from or who it \nbelongs to and you are wiped out. Why don't you keep it?\n  This citizen of West Liberty, KY, said: ``I just wouldn't feel right \nabout it.''\n  ``I just wouldn't feel right about it.'' Those are the kind of people \nwho are in West Liberty, KY. Those are the kind of people today who are \nhomeless, who have lost friends and relatives. Of course, in a town \nthat is devastated there are no jobs. Where do people go to work when \ntheir place of business has been wiped out?\n  FEMA is on the ground, and we will do everything we can to try to \nhelp these good folks rebuild their lives. Similar stories are the case \nin a number of other Kentucky counties, but West Liberty I singled out \nbecause it was probably the most devastated of any of our communities.\n  I applaud the work of the first responders. There were people from \nall over my State who immediately came to the site, some of them with \nsome official responsibility--they were with the Red Cross or they were \nwith the National Guard. In fact, there were 400 National Guard troops \nmobilized across the State in these severely hit areas. But many of the \npeople I ran into in West Liberty, KY, were simply people who got in \ntheir cars, loaded them up with bottled water and whatever food they \ncould come up with, and went there to be helpful.\n  There was one restaurant in another town that sent in a very large \nnumber of barbecue sandwiches just to try to feed the people who were \nthere trying to help get started. I went to the command center. Of \ncourse, one of the biggest questions in a situation such as that is, \nwhat do you do first? Obviously, the first effort to get the power back \non. The AEP, the power company, was there trying to get the power up \nand running. Then they had a priority chart: What do you do second? \nWhat do you do third?\n  I want to express to them and say again on the Senate floor today, we \nare going to be there for these good folks not only in West Liberty but \nin the other counties that were hit in our State. That is why FEMA \nexists. They do a good job. Hopefully, it will not require any \nadditional funding for us to have to appropriate. Hopefully, they will \nhave enough funds in their budget to take care of this, but if there is \na shortfall we will be there to be helpful.\n  I wanted to share with my colleagues today the devastation to which \nwe were subjected last weekend. It is reminiscent of a tornado that hit \nKentucky in the 1970s. I remember it went into my mother and father's \nneighborhood. The house next door to them was obliterated. The houses \nacross the street were obliterated. Amazingly enough, my mothers and \nfather's house seemed largely untouched. There were very few homes in \nWest Liberty, KY, yesterday or Friday night that were untouched. It \ncame through there with a stunning force.\n  I heard one story I will also relate. The county judge was in a \nbuilding and literally grabbed somebody by the leg and pulled him \ninside the building as the storm was attempting to suck him out into \nthe street. He was able to save that person. So the incredible force of \nthese massive tornadoes is truly destructive, and we will help local \nresidents get their lives back together as soon as we possibly can.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/05/senate-section/article/S1377-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

A British \nphotographer who was wounded and evacuated from the city described it \nas ``a medieval siege and slaughter.'' The kinds of mass atrocities \nthat NATO intervened in Libya to prevent in Benghazi are now a reality \nin Homs. Indeed, Syria today is the scene of some of the worst state-\nsponsored violence since Milosevic's war crimes in the Balkans or \nRussia's annihilation of the Chechen city of Grozny.\n  What is all the more astonishing is that Asad's killing spree has \ncontinued despite severe and escalating international pressure against \nhim. His regime is almost completely isolated. It has been expelled \nfrom the Arab League, rebuked by the United Nations General Assembly, \nexcoriated by the U.N. Human Rights Council, and abandoned by nearly \nevery country that once maintained diplomatic relations with it. At the \nsame time, Asad's regime is facing a punishing array of economic \nsanctions by the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, \nand others--measures that have targeted the assets of Asad and his \nhenchman, cut off the Central Bank and other financial institutions, \ngrounded Syria's cargo flights, and restricted the regime's ability to \nsell oil.\n  This has been an impressive international effort, and the \nadministration deserves a lot of credit for helping to orchestrate it.\n  The problem is the bloodletting continues. Despite a year's worth of \ndiplomacy backed by sanctions, Asad and his top lieutenants show no \nsigns of giving up and taking the path into foreign exile. To the \ncontrary, they appear to be accelerating their fight to the finish and \nthey are doing so with the shameless support of foreign governments, \nespecially in Russia, China, and Iran. A steady supply of weapons, \nammunition, and other assistance is flowing to Asad from Moscow and \nTehran. As the Washington Post reported yesterday, Iranian military and \nintelligence operatives are likely active in Syria, helping to direct \nand sharpen the regime's brutality. The Security Council is totally \nshut down as an avenue for increased pressure, and the recently \nconvened Friends of Syria contact group, while a good step in \nprinciple, produced mostly rhetoric but precious little action when it \nmet last month in Tunisia. Unfortunately, with each passing day, the \ninternational response to Asad's atrocities is being overtaken by \nevents on the ground in Syria.\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\n  Some countries are finally beginning to acknowledge this reality as \nwell as its implications. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are calling for arming \nopposition forces in Syria. The newly elected Kuwaiti Parliament has \ncalled on their government to do the same. Last week, the Supreme \nAllied Commander of NATO, ADM James Stavridis, testified to the Senate \nArmed Services Committee that providing arms to opposition forces in \nSyria could help them shift the balance of power against Asad. Most \nimportantly, Syrians themselves are increasingly calling for \ninternational military involvement. The Opposition Syrian National \nCouncil recently announced that it is establishing a military bureau to \nchannel weapons and other assistance to the Free Syrian Army and armed \ngroups inside the country. Other members of the Council are demanding a \nmore robust intervention.\n  To be sure, there are legitimate questions about the efficacy of \nmilitary operations in Syria and equally legitimate concerns about \ntheir risks and uncertainties. It is understandable that the \nadministration is reluctant to move beyond diplomacy and sanctions. \nUnfortunately, this policy is increasingly disconnected from the dire \nconditions on the ground in Syria, which has become a full-blown state \nof armed conflict. In the face of this new reality, the \nadministration's approach to Syria is starting to look more like a hope \nthan a strategy. So, too, does their continued insistence that Asad's \nfall is ``inevitable.'' Tell that to the people of Homs. Tell that to \nthe people of Idlib or Hama or the other cities that Asad's forces are \nnow moving against. Nothing in this world is predetermined, and claims \nabout the inevitability of events can often be a convenient way to \nabdicate responsibility.\n  But even if we do assume that Asad will ultimately fall, that may \nstill take a long time. In recent testimony in the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said if \nthe status quo persists, Asad could hang on for months, probably \nlonger. And that was before Homs fell. So to be clear, even under the \nbest-case scenario for the current policy, the cost of success will \nlikely be months of continued bloodshed and thousands of additional \nlives lost. Is this morally acceptable to us? I believe it should not \nbe.\n  In addition to the moral and humanitarian interests at stake in \nSyria, what is just as compelling, if not more so, are the strategic \nand geopolitical interests. Put simply, the United States has a clear \nnational security interest in stopping the violence in Syria and \nforcing Asad to leave power. In this way, Syria is very different than \nLibya. The stakes are far higher, both for America and some of our \nclosest allies.\n  This regime in Syria serves as a main forward operating base of the \nIranian regime in the heart of the Arab world. It has supported \nPalestinian terrorist groups and funneled arms of all kinds, including \ntens of thousands of rockets, to Hezbollah in Lebanon. It remains a \ncommitted enemy of Israel. It has large stockpiles of chemical weapons \nand materials and has sought to develop a nuclear weapons capability. \nIt was the primary gateway for the countless foreign fighters who \ninfiltrated Iraq and killed American troops. Asad and his lieutenants \nhave the blood of hundreds of Americans on their hands. Many in \nWashington fear that what comes after Asad might be worse. How could it \nbe any worse than this?\n  The end of the Asad regime would sever Hezbollah's lifeline to Iran, \neliminate a longstanding threat to Israel, bolster Lebanon's \nsovereignty and independence, and inflict a strategic defeat on the \nIranian regime. It would be a geopolitical success of the first order. \nMore than all of the compelling moral and humanitarian reasons, this is \nwhy Asad cannot be allowed to succeed and remain in power. We have a \nclear national security interest in his defeat, and that alone should \nincline us to tolerate a large degree of risk in order to see that this \ngoal is achieved.\n  Increasingly, the question for U.S. policy is not whether foreign \nforces will intervene militarily in Syria. We can be confident that \nSyria's neighbors will do so eventually if they have not already. Some \nkind of intervention will happen with or without us. So the real \nquestion for U.S. policy is whether we will participate in this next \nphase of the conflict in Syria and thereby increase our ability to \nshape an outcome that is beneficial to the Syrian people and to us. I \nbelieve we must.\n  The President has characterized the prevention of mass atrocities as \n``a core national security interest.'' He has made it the objective of \nthe United States that the killing in Syria must stop, that Asad must \ngo. He has committed the prestige and credibility of our Nation to that \ngoal, and it is the right goal. However, it is not clear that the \npresent policy can succeed. If Asad manages to cling to power--or even \nif he manages to sustain the slaughter for months to come--with all the \nhuman and geopolitical costs that entails, it would be a strategic and \nmoral defeat for the United States. We cannot--we must not--allow this \nto happen.\n  For this reason, the time has come for a new policy. As we continue \nto isolate Asad diplomatically and economically, we should work with \nour closest friends and allies to support opposition groups inside \nSyria, both political and military, to help them organize themselves \ninto a more cohesive and effective force that can put an end to the \nbloodshed and force Asad and his loyalists to leave power. Rather than \nclosing off the prospects for some kind of negotiated transition that \nis acceptable to the Syrian opposition, foreign military intervention \nis now the necessary factor to reinforce this option. Asad needs to \nknow that he will not win.\n\n  What opposition groups in Syria need most urgently is relief from \nAsad's tank and artillery sieges in the many cities that are still \ncontested. Homs is lost for now, but Idlib and Hama and Qusayr and \nDeraa and other cities in Syria could still be saved. But time is \nrunning out. Asad's forces are on the march. Providing military \nassistance to the Free Syrian Army and other opposition groups is \nnecessary, but at this late hour that alone will not be sufficient to \nstop the slaughter and save innocent lives. The only realistic way to \ndo so is with foreign air power.\n  Therefore, at the request of the Syrian National Council, the Free \nSyrian Army, and local coordinating committees inside the country, the \nUnited States should lead an international effort to protect key \npopulation centers in Syria, especially in the north, through air \nstrikes on Asad's forces. To be clear, this will require the United \nStates to suppress enemy air defenses in at least part of the country. \nThe ultimate goal of air strikes should be to establish and defend safe \nhavens in Syria, especially in the north, in which opposition forces \ncan organize and plan their political and military activities against \nAsad. These safe havens could serve as platforms for the delivery of \nhumanitarian and military assistance, including weapons and ammunition, \nbody armor, and other personal protective equipment, tactical \nintelligence, secure communications equipment, food and water, and \nmedical supplies. These safe havens could also help the Free Syrian \nArmy and other armed groups in Syria train and organize themselves into \nmore cohesive and effective military forces, likely with the assistance \nof foreign partners.\n  The benefit for the United States in helping to lead this effort \ndirectly is that it would allow us to better empower those Syrian \ngroups that share our interests--those groups that reject al-Qaida and \nthe Iranian regime and commit to the goal of an inclusive democratic \ntransition as called for by the Syrian National Council. If we stand on \nthe sidelines, others will pick winners, and this will not always to be \nto our liking or in our interest. This does not mean the United States \nshould go it alone. I repeat: This does not mean that the United States \nshould go it alone. We should not. We should seek the active \ninvolvement of key Arab partners such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab \nEmirates, Jordan, and Qatar, and willing allies in the EU and NATO, the \nmost important of which in this case is Turkey.\n  There will be no U.N. Security Council mandate for such an operation. \nRussia and China took that option off the table long ago. But let's not \nforget: NATO took military action to save Kosovo in 1999 without formal \nU.N. authorization. There is no reason why the\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\nArab League or NATO or a leading coalition within the Friends of Syria \ncontact group, or all of them speaking in unison, could not provide a \nsimilar international mandate for military measures to save Syria \ntoday.\n  Could such a mandate be gotten? I believe it could. Foreign capitals \nacross the world are looking to the United States to lead, especially \nnow that the situation in Syria has become an armed conflict. But what \nthey see is an administration still hedging its bets--on the one hand \ninsisting that Asad's fall is inevitable but, on the other, unwilling \neven to threaten more assertive actions that could make it so.\n  The rhetoric out of NATO has been much more self-defeating. Far from \nmaking it clear to Asad that all options are on the table, key alliance \nleaders are going out of their way to publicly take options off the \ntable. Last week, NATO Secretary General Rasmussen said that the \nalliance has not even discussed the possibility of NATO action in \nSyria, saying: ``I don't envision such a role for the alliance.'' The \nfollowing day, the Supreme Allied Commander, ADM James Stavridis, \ntestified in the Senate Armed Services Committee that NATO has done no \ncontingency planning--none--for potential military operations in Syria.\n  That is not how NATO approached Bosnia or Kosovo or Libya. Is it now \nthe policy of NATO--or the United States, for that matter--to tell the \nperpetrators of mass atrocities in Syria or elsewhere that they can go \non killing innocent civilians by the hundreds of thousands and the \ngreatest alliance in history will not even bother to conduct any \nplanning about how we might stop them? Is that NATO's policy now? Is \nthat our policy? Because that is the practical effect of this kind of \nrhetoric. It gives Asad and his foreign allies a green light for \ngreater brutality.\n\n  Not surprisingly, many countries, especially Syria's neighbors, are \nalso hedging their bets on the outcome in Syria. They think Asad will \ngo, but they are not yet prepared to put all their chips on that bet--\neven less so now that Asad's forces have broken Homs and seem to be \ngaining momentum.\n  There is only one nation--there is only one nation--that can alter \nthis dynamic, and that is the United States of America. The President \nmust state unequivocally that under no circumstances will Asad be \nallowed to finish what he has started; that there is no future in which \nAsad and his lieutenants will remain in control of Syria; and that the \nUnited States is prepared to use the full weight of our air power to \nmake it so. It is only when we have clearly and completely committed \nourselves that we can expect other nations to do the same. Only then \nwould we see what is really possible in winning international support \nto stop the killing in Syria.\n  Are there dangers and risks and uncertainties in this approach? \nAbsolutely. There are no ideal options in Syria. All of them contain \nsignificant risk. Many people will be quick to raise concerns about the \ncourse of action I am proposing. Many of these concerns have merit but \nnone so much that they should keep us from acting.\n  For example, we continue to hear it said that we should not assist \nthe opposition in Syria militarily because we do not know who these \npeople are. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton repeated this argument \njust last week, adding that we could end up helping al-Qaida or Hamas. \nIt is possible that the administration does not know much about the \narmed opposition in Syria, but how much effort have they really made to \nfind out, to meet and engage these people directly? Not much, it \nappears. Instead, much of the best information we have about the armed \nresistance in Syria is thanks to courageous journalists, some of whom \nhave given their lives to tell the story of the Syrian people.\n  One of those journalists is a reporter working for Al-Jazeera named \nNir Rosen, who spent months in the country, including much time with \nthe armed opposition. Here is how he described them recently:\n\n       The regime and its supporters describe the opposition, \n     especially the armed opposition, as Salafis, Jihadists, \n     Muslim Brotherhood supporters, al-Qaeda and terrorists. This \n     is not true, but it's worth noting that all the fighters I \n     met . . . were Sunni Muslims, and most were pious. They fight \n     for a multitude of reasons: for their friends, for their \n     neighborhoods, for their villages, for their province, for \n     revenge, for self-defense, for dignity, for their brethren in \n     other parts of the country who are also fighting. They do not \n     read religious literature or listen to sermons. Their views \n     on Islam are consistent with the general attitudes of Syrian \n     Sunni society, which is conservative and religious.\n       Because there are many small groups in the armed \n     opposition, it is difficult to describe their ideology in \n     general terms. The Salafi and Muslim Brotherhood ideologies \n     are not important in Syria and do not play a significant role \n     in the revolution. But most Syrian Sunnis taking part in the \n     uprising are themselves devout.\n\n  He could just as well have been describing average citizens in Egypt \nor Libya or Tunisia or other nations in the region. So we should be a \nlittle more careful before we embrace the Asad regime's propaganda \nabout the opposition in Syria. We certainly should not let these \nmisconceptions cause us to keep the armed resistance in Syria at arm's \nlength because that is just self-defeating. And I can assure you that \nal-Qaida is not pursuing the same policy. They are eager to try to \nhijack the Syrian revolution, just as they have tried to hijack the \nArab spring movements in Egypt and Tunisia and Libya and elsewhere. \nThey are trying, but so far they are failing. The people of these \ncountries are broadly rejecting everything al-Qaida stands for. They \nare not eager to trade secular tyranny for theocratic tyranny.\n  The other reason al-Qaida is failing in Tunisia and Egypt and Libya \nis because the community of nations--especially the United States--has \nsupported them. We are giving them a better alternative. The surest way \nfor al-Qaida to gain a foothold in Syria is for us to turn our backs on \nthese brave Syrians who are fighting to defend themselves. After all, \nSunni Iraqis were willing to ally with al-Qaida when they felt \ndesperate enough, but when America gave them a better alternative, they \nturned their guns on al-Qaida. Why should it be different in Syria?\n  Another objection to providing military assistance to the Syrian \nopposition is that the conflict has become a sectarian civil war and \nour intervention would enable the Sunni majority to take a bloody and \nindiscriminate revenge against the Alawite minority. This is a serious \nand legitimate concern, and it is only growing worse the longer the \nconflict goes on. As we saw in Iraq or Lebanon before it, time favors \nthe hard-liners in a conflict such as this. The suffering of Sunnis at \nthe hands of Asad only stokes the temptation for revenge, which in turn \nonly deepens fears among the Alawites and strengthens their incentive \nto keep fighting. For this reason alone, it is all the more compelling \nto find a way to end the bloodshed as soon as possible.\n  Furthermore, the risks of sectarian conflict will exist in Syria \nwhether or not we get more involved. And we will at least have some \nability to try to mitigate these risks if we work to assist the armed \nopposition now. That will at least help us to know them better and to \nestablish some trust and exercise some influence with them, because we \ntook their side when they needed it most. We should not overstate the \npotential influence we could gain with opposition groups inside Syria, \nbut it will only diminish the longer we wait to offer them meaningful \nsupport. And what we can say for certain is we will have no influence \nwhatsoever with these people if they feel we abandoned them. This is a \nreal moral dilemma, but we cannot allow the opposition in Syria to be \ncrushed at present while we worry about the future.\n  We also hear it said, including by the administration, that we should \nnot contribute to the militarization of the conflict. If only Russia \nand Iran shared that sentiment. Instead, they are shamelessly fueling \nAsad's killing machine. We need to deal with reality as it is, not as \nwe wish it to be. And the reality in Syria today is largely a one-sided \nfight where the aggressors are not lacking for military means and zeal. \nIndeed, Asad appears to be fully committed to crushing the opposition \nat all costs. Iran and Russia appear to be fully committed to helping \nhim do it.\n\n  The many Syrians who have taken up arms to defend themselves and \ntheir communities appear to be fully committed to acquiring the \nnecessary weapons to resist Asad, and leading\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\nArab States appear increasingly committed to providing those weapons. \nThe only ones who seem overly concerned about a militarization of the \nconflict is the United States and some of its allies. The time has come \nto ask a different question: Whom do we want to win in Syria--our \nfriends or our enemies?\n  There are always plenty of reasons not to do something, and we can \nlist them clearly in the case of Syria. We know the opposition is \ndivided. We know the armed resistance inside the country lacks cohesion \nor command and control. We know some elements of the opposition may \nsympathize with violent extremist ideologies or harbor dark thoughts of \nsectarian revenge. We know many of Syria's immediate neighbors remain \ncautious about taking overly provocative actions that could undermine \nAsad. And we know the American people are weary of conflict--\njustifiably so--and we would rather focus on domestic problems.\n  These are realities. But while we are compelled to acknowledge them, \nwe are not condemned to accept them forever. With resolve, principled \nleadership, and wise policy, we can shape better realities. That is \nwhat the Syrian people have done.\n  By no rational calculation should this uprising against Asad still be \ngoing on. The Syrian people are outmatched. They are outgunned. They \nare lacking for food and water and other basic needs. They are \nconfronting a regime with limitless disregard for human dignity and \ncapacity for sheer savagery. For an entire year, the Syrian people have \nfaced death and those unspeakable things worse than death, and they \nstill have not given up. Still they take to the streets to protest \npeacefully for justice, still they carry on their fight, and they do so \non behalf of many of the same universal values we share and many of the \nsame interests as well. These people are our allies. They want many of \nthe same things we do. They have expanded the boundaries of what \neveryone thought was possible in Syria. They have earned our respect, \nand now they need our support to finish what they started. The Syrian \npeople deserve to succeed, and shame on us if we fail to help them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there are life experiences that come along \nwith growing up depending on one's family and where they grew up. In my \npart of the world, part of the Midwest, there was a rite of passage \nthat seemed so commonplace that we never questioned it. It was the air \nraid siren going off in the middle of the night and your dad would come \ninto your room and say: We have to go down to the basement; there is a \ntornado warning.\n  That was part of my life. I didn't think twice about it. It happened \nevery year--sometimes not in the middle of the night, sometimes in the \nmiddle of the day, but we became accustomed to it because that is what \nhappened where we lived.\n  When I was elected to Congress and then to the Senate, I spent my \ntime visiting locations all over my State where tornadoes had struck. \nSo I have seen my fair share of tornado damage in the Midwest, but I \nhave to tell you what I saw on Saturday was extraordinary. I went to \nsouthern Illinois to two towns, Harrisburg and Ridgway. They were hit \nthe previous Wednesday by what is known as a stage 4 tornado. A stage 4 \ntornado is a tornado with winds up to 175 miles per hour. That is a \ntornado so violent that the winds, from what I am told, were even \ngreater than those of Hurricane Katrina. It hit this tiny little town \nin southern Illinois, and I looked at the devastation afterward. We \nexpect obvious casualties in a tornado. We expect to see the trees \nblown down and the siding off the house and the shingles torn off the \nroof and occasionally a window blown in. One looked at the poor mobile \nhomes, which don't have a chance in a tornado, and they are usually \nripped and thrown. But in this tornado, houses that were built on a \nslab were lifted off and tossed in the air.\n  I met a lady who was driving away from the devastation of her home--\nincidentally, these photos are fairly indicative of what we saw in the \ndevastation--and I asked her about her experience. It turned out she \nwas very lucky because she had set the alarm for quarter of 5 to go to \nwork that morning. She said she got up and started getting ready and \nheard the sirens outside. She said: I went to the bathroom, got down \nface first on the floor, and grabbed the sink to hang on to it. She \nsaid seconds passed before the ceiling caved in on top of her. Luckily, \nshe said it didn't reach her; it pinned her underneath. She said she \nwaited and waited and 15, 20 minutes later somebody started hollering: \nIs anybody in there? She said she hollered back and they told her: Keep \ntalking. We are going to get you out of there. She escaped with a few \nscratches and bruises. She was one of the lucky ones. Two of the homes \nacross the street had been blown on top of hers. It turned out across \nthe street a 22-year-old nurse at the local hospital had been killed by \nthe same tornado.\n  I have never seen this kind of tornado and this kind of damage in my \nlife. I am told it happened one time before in the history of our \nState. I also have to tell you the response of the people there makes \nme proud to be from that State and to be a part of this great Nation. \nFrom the very minute this devastation took place, people started coming \ntoward the devastation to try to help. There were some amazing stories \nsuch as the volunteers who helped this lady out of the debris of her \nhome. At the nearby coal mine, they have a rescue team that is sent in \nwhen there is danger of a mine disaster. They have hard hats and \nbreathing equipment and all the right extraction devices and tools. \nThey came rushing to the scene, coal dust all over their faces, digging \nright into the wreckage pulling people out. That story was repeated \nover and over.\n  The heroism and voluntarism didn't end that day. It continued all \nthrough the time I was there and even to this day. Special kudos to the \nAmerican Red Cross, always the first on the scene, always performing a \nvaluable and important job as they did in southern Illinois.\n  I went over to Ridgway, which is a town 24 miles away, and for some \nreason this God-awful tornado skipped from Harrisburg to Ridgway and \ndid little damage in between. But it came down in Ridgway and ripped \nthrough that town. Roughly 400 homes were damaged in Harrisburg and \nover 100 in Ridgway. There is a Catholic Church there over 100 years \nold. It was the sturdiest structure in town by far. Had people been \ngiven enough notice--this happened early in the morning at about 5 \na.m.--they might have said the safest place to go is the church. The \nchurch is gone. There are two things left, the doorway for the church \nand the altar. Everything else has been obliterated. There have been a \nlot of pictures taken of that altar still standing in the rubble, an \ninspiration to many. Perhaps a message there will be certain things \nspared even in the worst disasters.\n\n  In that town, the fire department met with the mayor and all the \nvolunteers. The one thing about being a volunteer after a disaster in \nIllinois, I guarantee you will not lose weight. Everybody brought in \nfood, all kinds of food from every direction--pies, cakes, chili, and \nhot dogs. A fellow came by there and had his barbecue operation set up. \nIt was a huge operation, and he was just cooking like crazy. It was an \nindication that everybody wanted to pitch in to help. So I wish to \nthank all those engaged in the rescue and cleanup work at every level.\n  John Monken, director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency \nunder Pat Quinn--the Governor has been down there twice--accompanied me \non this trip, local units of the government, the sheriff's office, the \nlocal disaster agency people, all the volunteers, the Red Cross, a \ngroup called Operation Blessing, which showed up--I had never heard of \nthem before. I bet they have\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\nbeen around. They knew just what to do. They said: Every religious \ngroup or volunteer group that wants to help, come check with us. We \nwill send you to a place where you might be needed. As I walked through \nthe wreckage, there were volunteers of every age, from little kids to \nelderly folks, with rakes in their hands picking up trash and getting \nit off to the side and trying to put people's lives together again. The \nscores of people made me proud to represent that great State and the \npeople living in it.\n  There are several things we need to talk about as a result of that \ndisaster that cannot go unsaid.\n  I think it is not considered politically correct now to talk about \nthe state of climate in America, but I am going to because, as I stand \nhere today, we have had 274 tornadoes already recorded in America this \nyear--274. At this time last year we had 50. This tornado that hit my \nhome State and, I might say, that tornado that hit Joplin, MO, last \nyear were extraordinary events when it came to tornadoes. The weather \npatterns are changing. The weather events are more frequent and more \nsevere. That is a fact. Are we ready? Are we prepared for it? Are we \ndoing everything we can? The simple and honest answer is no.\n  First, we need to acknowledge the obvious. I know I am walking on \ndangerous ground, but the climate is changing. We have gone from a \nsituation last year where we had the worst recorded blizzard in the \nhistory of Chicago, followed 4 months later by the most rainfall ever \nrecorded in 1 hour, to this situation with 274 tornadoes so far this \nyear and literally scores of people killed--six in Harrisburg, many in \nKentucky and Tennessee and other places. It is an indication the \nweather is changing, the severity is changing, and we need to be honest \nabout it. We have to get beyond the political argument into the world \nof reality.\n  I sincerely believe there are things we are doing that are affecting \nthe world we live in--affecting the melting of the glaciers, affecting \nthe disappearance of species, affecting the change of weather patterns \nall around. As long as we continue to take the politically convenient \nroute of ignoring that, future generations can point a finger of blame \nat us for failing to acknowledge the obvious when we might have had a \nchance to make some difference in future lives. That is a fact.\n  Secondly, I held a hearing and I brought in not government experts \nbut experts from the private sector. Do my colleagues know who knows \nmore about weather and damage events than anyone in America? The \ninsurance industry. I brought them in, property and casualty insurance \ncompanies, and I asked them the same question: Is weather changing? \nThey said it is obvious. Why do we think some companies are taking \ntheir business out of certain places in America? We cannot set up a \nreserve for the possibility of damage that is on the horizon; we are \ntrying to cover ourselves. We are profitmaking people; if we can't see \na way to set up a reserve for potential weather disasters, we start \nbacking off of coverage. It has been done. Many insurance companies \nhave walked away from places such as Florida because of hurricanes and \nbecause of violent storms.\n  Then I asked them the question about whether the U.S. Government was \nadequately prepared to shoulder the burden that comes with these \ndisasters--and the burden does come, particularly for those uninsured. \nWe end up as a government helping them. I don't begrudge people that. I \nam going to ask for my State, and I am sure the Presiding Officer would \ndo the same. Every Senator would.\n  Here is the bottom line: When the Bowles-Simpson Commission sat down \nto try to determine how much we should budget each year for disasters, \nthey came up with what these people in the private sector said was a \ntotally unreasonable formula. It basically averaged 10 years and put an \nadditional cost-of-living adjustment on it. They said that isn't the \nfuture. The future is a geometric progression in cost as property \nbecomes more expensive, as the storms become more violent.\n  We are not thinking about this, and we are not thinking about what we \nshould do to deal with it. We also need to think about ways to warn \npeople about these disasters before they strike. We live in a new \nworld. In the old world we lived in--going back how far I can't say, \nmaybe a century--we would turn on a siren outside. That is still of \nsome value. It warns people and they respond to it. But in this day and \nage there has to be a better way. Let me suggest a few.\n  In some counties in my State, the disaster agency has on record all \nof the telephone numbers of all of the residents. If something is \ncoming, their phone is going to ring too, not just the siren outside \nthat maybe they don't hear because they are sleeping or because the \ntelevision is too loud but the telephone is going to ring too. That is \nsomething we need to make standard across this country so there is a \nway to reach everyone.\n  I don't know this because I am a liberal arts lawyer. What do I know \nabout these things? It seems to me that we ought to be able to deal \nwith some mechanism that allows people to receive a notice when there \nis a warning going out of something disastrous on the way. I think that \nought to be doable. I am working with people in FEMA and others to talk \nabout that possibility.\n  The point I wish to make is this: I think we have an obligation to \nreopen a conversation which we have walked away from. There is not a \nchance that we are going to pass significant legislation on this floor \nthis year when it comes to climate change and what we need to do about \nit. There is little or no chance that we will even get a majority--\nperhaps a majority; maybe not 60--to acknowledge this is a problem we \ncould do anything about. But for us to ignore this is to ignore the \nobvious. Things are getting worse. Future generations will see even \nmore challenges than we do today, and those of us with the \nresponsibility to serve and lead need to at least stand and engage the \nconversation, engage the dialogue with the American people about this \nissue.\n  I urge my colleagues all across the political spectrum to take a look \nat the reality and to stop turning their head and looking away. What is \nhappening out there with our weather patterns is something that needs \nto be acknowledged and something we need to respond to.\n\n\n                               Gas Prices\n\n  Mr. President, one other thing I wish to say is that as I went home, \nthe tornado was the first item of discussion, but the second was \ngasoline prices. I went through the suburbs of Chicago Friday night and \nsaw a gasoline station with gas at $4.09 a gallon. It got a little more \nreasonable as I went through deep southern Illinois, but it was still \nvery expensive.\n  We have seen a significant increase, but those of us who have been \naround know that isn't the first time. I could dust off my springtime \npress release that I put out every year expressing outrage with the oil \ncompanies for gasoline price increases. It happens every spring before \nEaster. Usually, after all of the politicians get red in the face and \nsputter and run out of things to say cursing the oil companies it kind \nof moderates in May or June and then, get ready, it is coming again \nduring the summer vacation season.\n  We are not helpless but we are certainly at the mercy of oil \ncompanies which, even when investigated by major government agencies, \ncan't be found to have engaged in any conspiracy or collusion, though \nit seems passing strange that the same gas stations in town after town \nwatch their prices go up in lockstep day after day and week after week.\n\n  There are those who think they have a good, quick, easy answer and \ncan't understand why the rest of the world isn't cheering them on. They \nwant to drill their way out of this situation. They believe if we find \nenough oil in America, gasoline prices will come down and we are going \nto find ourselves oil independent. By last measure, the United States \nhas about 3 percent of the world's reserve of petroleum. We consume \neach year 25 percent. Drilling our way out of this is physically \nimpossible. Yet that doesn't mean we shouldn't look for new, \nenvironmentally responsible and safe sources for oil.\n  Here is the record: Domestic oil production is at the highest level \nin 8 years. We would never believe it, hearing speeches from the other \nside of the aisle. In 2011, U.S. crude oil production reached its \nhighest level since 2003, and we are now drilling more than ever \nbefore. The number of oil drilling rigs in\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\nthe United States is at a record high--quadrupling over the past 3 \nyears of the Obama administration.\n  Between oil and gas drilling rigs, the United States now has more \nrigs at work than the rest of the world combined. Let me repeat that: \nBetween oil and gas drilling rigs, the United States now has more rigs \nat work than the rest of the world combined. Those who are saying there \nis lack of effort don't know the obvious. We keep adding more. The \nadministration has announced a new offshore oil and gas development \nprogram--they want to do it carefully after the BP spill of 2 years \nago--which will open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil \nand gas resources.\n  Last year, Americans relied less on foreign oil than at any time in \nthe past 16 years. Even the American Petroleum Institute agrees that \nAmerican producers and refiners are producing more oil and reducing our \nreliance on imports. The American Petroleum Institute has said without \nthese two factors, today's prices might be even higher.\n  We simply cannot drill our way to lower gasoline prices. The \nPresident has proposed an approach that is balanced, and it is an \napproach with vision. It gets beyond the press release of the moment or \nPresidential campaign rhetoric.\n  The President recently announced new fuel efficiency standards for \ncars and light-duty trucks that will save Americans $1.7 trillion and \nreduce oil consumption by 2.2 million barrels per day by 2025. My wife \nand I drive a Ford Fusion hybrid. I looked at Consumer Reports, and it \nis still rated very highly. We get over 30 miles a gallon. Prius does \neven better--over 40 miles a gallon. Toyota Camry is somewhere in the \nupper thirties. There are ways to reduce the use of gasoline with more \nfuel-efficient vehicles. I can tell my colleagues I don't believe our \nfamily makes any sacrifice when it comes to comfort and safety while \ndriving this Ford.\n  The administration has also finalized the first ever national future \nefficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks, vans, and buses. These \nstandards will reduce oil consumption by over 500 million barrels, \nsaving the owners more than $50 billion in fuel costs.\n  The Department of Energy will make $30 million available for a new \nresearch competition to find ways to harness our abundant supplies of \ndomestic natural gas for vehicles.\n  There is no magic bullet that can bring Americans lower gas prices--\nnot drill baby, drill, and not the Keystone Pipeline in and of itself. \nSenator Hutchison stated that the Keystone XL Pipeline would transport \n830,000 barrels of crude oil from Canada to refineries in Texas and \nthat oil would provide Americans with 34 million gallons of gas a day.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Hutchison's statement doesn't quite match up \nwith the testimony of the oil companies. Canada's oil production ships \nless than half of its current pipeline capacity to the United States. \nThere is plenty of room for Canada to ship more right now without a new \npipeline.\n  Existing pipeline capacity would offer 4.2 million barrels per day of \ncrude oil to be transported from Canada to the United States. However, \nin 2010, Canada exported less than half of it--1.9 billion barrels a \nday--with existing pipelines. Even doubling Canada's current production \nlevels would not fill the Keystone XL Pipeline or bring an additional \n830,000 barrels a day to gulf refineries in the Texas region. So \n830,000 barrels of crude oil simply can't produce 34 million gallons of \ngasoline. Even the best refiners could produce only about half that \namount of gasoline.\n  I might also add that one of the things that is troubling to some of \nus is when the TransCanada Company was asked in a hearing in the House \nby Congressman Ed Markey of Massachusetts whether the oil coming down \nfrom Canada through the Keystone XL Pipeline would be used for domestic \nconsumption in the United States, he said he couldn't make that \npromise. So this argument that the Keystone XL Pipeline is going to \nreduce gas prices, first, that pipeline is in the future; second, there \nis existing pipeline capacity that is unused; and, third, the company \nthat is transporting it will make no promise that it will be used in \nthe United States. It may not have any impact on our gasoline prices \nwhatsoever.\n  We just can't drill our way or ``pipeline'' our way out of this \nproblem. One pipeline isn't going to solve the problem. Drilling in \npristine areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not going \nto solve the problem. We need a coordinated, balanced approach. We need \nto walk away from the heightened campaign rhetoric into a rational \ndiscussion about an energy policy for America: a balanced policy and \none that is respectful of our environment, provides the energy we need \nfor economic growth, as well as looks to innovation and green energy \napproaches that will create new businesses and new jobs for the 21st \ncentury in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/05/senate-section/article/S1382-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         REMEMBERING NICK BACON\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a true \nAmerican hero who always had our veterans at heart--Nick Bacon.\n  Bacon served in the U.S. Army from 1963 1984 serving two deployments \nto Vietnam. As a staff sergeant during his second tour, Nick solidified \nhis legacy as a hero.\n  On August 26, 1968, while commanding a squad of the first platoon of \nCompany B, 4th Battalion, in an operation west of Tam Ky in Vietnam, \nBacon destroyed several enemy positions with hand grenades. When his \nplatoon leader was wounded, Bacon led the platoon to destroy remaining \nenemy positions. Bacon also took command of a second platoon, 3rd \nPlatoon, Bravo Company, when its leader was killed and rallied both \nplatoons against the enemy. Providing cover for evacuation of wounded, \nBacon climbed a tank to fire at the enemy, a move that exposed himself \nto enemy fire. He was credited with killing at least four enemy \nsoldiers and destroying an anti-tank gun.\n  President Nixon awarded Nick the Medal of Honor for his bravery, \nheroics and valiant actions during this battle.\n  Nick's heroics extended well beyond the battlefield. He exemplified \nwhat it means to be a Medal of Honor recipient in the way he lived his \ndaily life through his service to others.\n  After retiring from the military, Nick continued his commitment to \nhis fellow soldiers by fulfilling the needs of our veterans. He is \nconsidered by many in Arkansas as the Father of Veterans Affairs in the \nNatural State. Under his guidance as the director of Arkansas \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, State veterans saw the completion of \nthe Fayetteville VA Long-term Care Facility, the development of the \nArkansas State Veterans Cemetery and the creation of the Arkansas \nVeterans' Coalition.\n  Nick's leadership in the department helped countless veterans in \nArkansas receive the benefits they deserve. His actions throughout his \nlife have inspired selfless service and sacrifice. Nick's legacy will \nlive on as we remember his consistent passion for veterans and his \ntireless advocacy on behalf of the men and women who wore our Nation's \nuniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/05/senate-section/article/S1382-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1382-S1383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING PHELPS MEMORIAL HEALTH CENTER\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today I wish to applaud the spirit \nof community betterment that led to a beautiful new wing of the Phelps \nMemorial Health Center in Holdrege, NE. As often occurs across our \ngreat State, citizens in the area saw a need and rose to meet it. They \njoined forces with officials at the hospital and set a determined \ncourse, without holding out their hands for taxpayer dollars to make it \nhappen. They recognized that high quality medical care is part of the \nlifeblood of the community and knew the hospital would benefit from \nrenovation and expansion. So, they rolled up their sleeves and came \ntogether to create the vision, raise the money and turn the dirt.\n  Some doubted the community would accomplish a multimillion dollar \nexpansion during a recession in a rural area without taxpayer dollars. \nThose doubters underestimated the motivation of Nebraskans who love \ntheir community. Citizens in the area have proven that there is no \nlimit to what can be\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\naccomplished when people come together. The new, state-of-the-art wing \nis truly impressive.\n  I was honored to see it firsthand when I attended the ribbon-cutting \nceremony and applauded the many people who poured their hearts into the \nproject. The nearly 50,000 additional square feet; four cutting-edge \noperating suites; and patient rooms with maximum comfort and \nconnectivity are remarkable, to say the least.\n  The heart and soul of healthcare in Nebraska is a hospital like the \nPhelps Memorial Health Center, providing high-quality and compassionate \ncare close to home. Today I celebrate their success in turning an aging \ninstitution into a state-of-the-art facility and highlight it as a \nshining example of what can be accomplished with determination and \ncommitment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/05/senate-section/article/S1383-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO COAST GUARD HEROES\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I \nmourn the loss of one of our brave Coast Guard airmen who gave his life \nin the line of duty when a Coast Guard MH 65C helicopter crashed during \na training flight in the vicinity of Mobile Bay, AL, on Tuesday evening \nwith four crewmembers aboard. Three other crewmembers remain missing, \nand the Coast Guard is continuing to search for them in cooperation \nwith State and local authorities from Alabama and Florida.\n  The cause of the incident is still under investigation, but it serves \nas a tragic reminder of the heroic sacrifices that the men and women of \nthe U.S. Coast Guard make on a regular basis to protect the people of \nthis country from terrorist threats, natural disasters, environmental \nhazards, and criminal activity. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the \nfamilies of the airmen onboard the Coast Guard helo that went down \nTuesday night, and I would like to take this opportunity to honor their \nservice, and the exploits of many Coastguardsmen before them, who \ndemonstrated extreme valor in the face of danger and epitomized the \nvirtues of bravery and sacrifice in service of their country.\n  Scores of grateful Americans will gather this evening at the National \nWorld War II Museum in New Orleans to honor 14 extraordinary Coast \nGuard heroes, and their family members will be in attendance to \ncommemorate their legacy. Tomorrow morning, Bollinger Shipyards in \nLockport, LA, will dedicate its fleet of fast response cutters and \ndeliver the very first in class to the U.S. Coast Guard, the Bernard C. \nWebber. This will be the first class of ships in the history of the \nU.S. military that bears the names of enlisted personnel, as opposed to \nU.S. Presidents and flag officers. I would like to take a few minutes \nto share some of their stories.\n  PO Bernie Webber led a crew of four volunteers from Chatham Station \nin Massachusetts in February 1952 to respond to the tanker Pendleton, \nwhich was in distress. They braved 60-foot seas, hurricane-force winds, \nand blizzard conditions on a cold and rainy night off the coast of New \nEngland. Wind and waves smashed their windshield and compass along the \nway, but they managed to save the lives of 33 men in what many \nhistorians consider the most difficult small boat rescue in Coast Guard \nhistory. To this day, cadets at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, \nCT, have never been able to fit so many men into a boat the size that \nWebber commanded.\n  William Ray Flores was 19 years old and less than 1 year out of boot \ncamp when he gave his life to save his fellow shipmates. On January 28, \n1980, the 180-foot Coast Guard buoy tender Blackthorn collided with a \n605-foot oil tanker near the entrance to Tampa Bay. The Coast Guard \nvessel quickly began to capsize after impact, and crewmembers leapt \nfrom the deck to escape the sinking ship. Flores, however, decided to \nstrap himself to the lifejacket locker door so he could float \nlifejackets up to the surface as the ship went down. Twenty-two of \nFlores's shipmates tragically perished that day, but 27 others survived \nthanks to his heroic sacrifice. SA Billy Flores was posthumously \nawarded the Coast Guard Medal for his actions that day, the service's \nhighest award for heroism during peacetime.\n  Margaret Norvell served for 41 years in the U.S. Lighthouse Service, \nbeginning her career watching over the southern entrance to the \nMississippi River at the Head of Passes and later taking over as keeper \nof the Port Pontchartrain Light and West End Light on Lake \nPontchartrain in New Orleans. In 1903, a storm destroyed every building \nin her small Louisiana community of Buras except Norvell's lighthouse. \nShe immediately responded by taking in the entire community and \nproviding shelter and comfort to more than 200 of her fellow citizens \nwho had been rendered homeless. Later in her career in the year 1926, \nNorvell received a report that a naval airplane had crashed into Lake \nPontchartrain. She immediately set out in her small rowboat and battled \na merciless squall for 2 hours before she finally arrived at the scene \nof the crash, rescued the downed aviator, and brought him safely back \nto shore.\n  Stewards-Mate First Class Charles Walter David was a cook aboard the \nCoast Guard cutter Comanche when the Army transport ship Dorchester was \nattacked by a German U-Boat off the coast of Greenland on the night of \nFebruary 3, 1942. David dove into the frigid seas of the North Atlantic \nand helped to save the lives of 93 soldiers and many of his own crew \nincluding the ship's executive officer, who had accidentally fallen \noverboard. David did not return to his ship until every last soul had \nbeen rescued from the water. He contracted pneumonia several days later \nand died as a result of his efforts that night, for which he was \nposthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for bravery.\n  Others, such as Isaac Mayo and Joseph Napier, returned to shore \nmultiple times to reembark on new boats after previous attempts caused \nthem to capsize and several of their fellow crewmen to perish in the \npunishing waves. Both men eventually completed their rescue missions \nsuccessfully.\n  These are just a handful of the 58 Coast Guardians who will serve as \nnamesakes for the service's newest class of patrol boats, and their \nextraordinary acts of valor will continue to inspire future generations \nof heroes for centuries to come. We salute these brave Americans who \nrisked and gave their lives to save others. We commend the Coast Guard \nfor honoring their memory through the dedication of the fast response \ncutter fleet, and we thank the dedicated Cajun shipbuilders of \nBollinger Shipyards in south Louisiana for providing the Coast Guard \nwith the fastest, most durable patrol boats available to carry out its \nmilitary, law enforcement, and maritime safety missions.\n  Our Nation will continue to pray for the airmen onboard the Coast \nGuard helicopter that went down in Mobile Bay earlier this week, as \nwell as their loved ones. We owe them all a debt of extreme gratitude \nfor their service to this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/05/senate-section/article/S1383-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MELVA E.

disrupting access to the \n     Internet, including blocking e-mail and social networking \n     sites and limiting access to foreign news and websites, \n     developing a national Internet that will facilitate \n     government censorship of news and information, and jamming \n     international broadcasts such as the Voice of America's \n     Persian News Network and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's \n     Radio Farda; and\n       Whereas opposition groups in Iran have announced they will \n     boycott the March 2, 2012, election because they believe it \n     will be neither free nor fair nor consistent with \n     international standards: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to \n     democracy, human rights, civil liberties, and rule of law, \n     including the universal rights of freedom of assembly, \n     freedom of speech, and freedom of association;\n       (2) expresses support for freedom, human rights, civil \n     liberties, and rule of law in Iran, and for elections that \n     are free, fair, and meet international standards, including \n     granting independent international and domestic electoral \n     observers unrestricted access to polling and counting \n     stations;\n       (3) expresses strong support for the people of Iran in \n     their peaceful calls for a representative and responsive \n     democratic government that respects human rights, civil \n     liberties, and the rule of law;\n       (4) reminds the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     of its obligations under the international covenants to which \n     it is a signatory to hold elections that are free and fair;\n       (5) condemns the Government of the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran's widespread human rights violations;\n       (6) calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     to respect freedom of expression and association in Iran by--\n       (A) ending arbitrary detention, torture, and other forms of \n     harassment against media professionals, human rights \n     defenders and activists, and opposition figures, and \n     releasing all individuals detained for exercising universally \n     recognized human rights;\n       (B) lifting legislative restrictions on freedoms of \n     assembly, association, and expression; and\n       (C) allowing the Internet to remain free and open and \n     allowing domestic and international media to operate freely;\n       (7) further calls on the Government of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran to allow international election monitors to be \n     present for the March 2, 2012, elections; and\n       (8) urges the President, the Secretary of State, and other \n     world leaders--\n       (A) to express support for the universal rights and \n     freedoms of the people of Iran, including to democratic self-\n     government;\n       (B) to broaden engagement with the people of Iran and \n     support efforts in the country to help promote human rights \n     and democratic reform, including by providing appropriate \n     funding to civil society organizations for democracy and \n     governance activities; and\n       (C) to condemn elections that are not free and fair and \n     that do not meet international standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/05/senate-section/article/S1399-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1399-S1400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
