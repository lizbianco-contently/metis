Mr. President, New Years Eve is fast approaching and for \ndecades and decades the American people have watched the ball drop in \nTimes Square. It is the countdown to midnight, the start of a new year.\n  This year the American people are waiting for the ball to drop, but \nit is not going to be a good drop because Americans' taxes are moving \nin the wrong direction. Come the first of this year, Americans will \nhave less income than they have today if we go over the cliff--and it \nlooks as if that is where we are headed. The House of Representatives \nas we speak, with 4 days left after today to the 1st of the year, is \nnot here, with the Speaker having told them he will give them 48 hours' \nnotice. I can't imagine their consciences. They are out wherever they \nare around the country and we are here, trying to get something done.\n  They are not in Washington, DC. The House of Representatives is not \nhere. They could not even get the Republican leadership together \nyesterday. They had to do it with a teleconference.\n  If we go over the cliff, we will be left with the knowledge it could \nhave been prevented with a single vote in the Republican-controlled \nHouse of Representatives. Prior to this session starting today, the \nPresiding Officer and I had a conversation about how things have \nchanged around here. I served in the House of Representatives. There \nare 435 Members of the House. What goes on in this country should not \nbe decided by the majority, it should be decided by the whole House of \nRepresentatives. Everyone, including the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives, knows that if they had brought up the Senate-passed \nbill that would give relief to everyone making less than $250,000 a \nyear, it would pass overwhelmingly. Every Democrat would vote for it \nand Republicans would vote for it. But the Speaker, he says: No; we \ncannot do that. It has to be a majority of the majority. So we have \ndone nothing.\n  He even tried to bring up the bill last week to show they could \ndefeat it. They could not do that even. They could not defeat the bill \nthat passed in the Senate.\n  I don't think the American people understand the House of \nRepresentatives is not operating as a House of Representatives. It is \nbeing operated with a dictatorship of the Speaker not allowing the vast \nmajority of the House of Representatives to get what they want. If the \n$250,000 threshold would be brought up, it would pass overwhelmingly, I \nrepeat.\n  On any given day for the last 5 or 6 months, since July 25, Speaker \nBoehner could have brought the Senate-passed middle-class tax cut \nlegislation to a vote in the House and it would have passed. But he has \nmade the decision he is not letting us have a vote on that because if \nhe let it be voted upon, it would pass. I have said it is not too late \nfor the Speaker to take up the Senate-passed bill, but even that time \nis winding down. Today is Thursday. He is going to give 48 hours' \nnotice to the House before they come back. So 48 hours from today is \nSaturday. With just that one vote, middle-class families would have the \nsecurity that taxes would not go up by at least $2,200 on\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\nNew Year's Day. That is the average. Some would go up more, some less, \nof course.\n\n  Speaker Boehner should call Members back to Washington today. He \nshould not have let them go, in fact. They are not here. John Boehner \nseems to care more about keeping his speakership than about keeping the \nNation on a firm financial footing. It is obvious what is going on \naround here. He is waiting until January 3 to get reelected as Speaker \nbefore he gets serious with negotiations because he has so many people \nover there who will not follow what he wants. That is obvious from the \ndebacle that took place last week, and it was a debacle.\n  He made an offer to the President. The President came back--they are \njust a little bit apart--and he walked away from that and went to Plan \nB. All that did is whack people who need help the most--poor people. He \ncould not even pass that. Remember, he is not letting the House of \nRepresentatives vote. He is letting the Republicans vote. It was so \nbad, and he was in such difficult shape there he would not even let a \nvote take place with his Republicans because he knew he would lose. For \nmonths, he has allowed House Republicans to hold middle-class taxpayers \nhostage to protect the richest 2 percent, and the funny thing about \nthat is the 2 percent do not want to be protected. The majority of \npeople in our great country are willing to pay more. The only people \nwho disagree with that are Republicans who work in this building.\n  The Speaker just has a few days left to change his mind, but I have \nto be very honest; I don't know, timewise, how it can happen now. \nEveryone knows we cannot bring up anything here unless we do it by \nunanimous consent because the rules have been so worked the last few \nyears that we cannot do anything without 60 votes. There are 53 of us. \nAfter the first of the year, there will be 55 of us.\n  I hope the Speaker and the Republican leader in the Senate would come \nto us and say here is what we think will work. Let's find out what that \ncould be because the Speaker cannot pass, it seems, much of anything \nover there. On the Sunday shows they had Republican Senators and they \nwere asked on the FOX network--pretty conservative, and that is \nprobably a gross understatement--would you filibuster the President's \nbill? They refused to answer. We don't make that decision. We can't \nanswer that. A filibuster is over all our heads.\n  That is why we have to look seriously next year at changing the rules \naround here. The bill that has passed the Senate protects 98 percent of \nfamilies and 97 percent of small businesses. They passed a bill in the \nHouse, that we defeated, that extends the tax cuts for everybody. That \nwas voted down over here. The President said he would veto it. So this \nhappy talk--the Republican House leadership said yesterday: Let them \ntake our bill. That bill was brought up and it was defeated.\n  I repeat, the American people do not agree with the Republicans in \nthe House and Republicans over here. The way to avoid the fiscal cliff \nhas been right in the face of the Republican leaders, both McConnell \nand Boehner, for days and days, going into weeks and months, and it is \nthe only option that is a viable escape route and that is the Senate-\npassed bill. It would not be hard to pass. I have talked about that at \nsome length. Every Democrat in the House would vote for it, a handful \nof Republicans would vote for it, and that is all that would be needed. \nBut Grover Norquist is standing in the way of this--not the rich people \nbut Grover Norquist, the man who says what the Republicans can do. I \nsay to the Speaker: Take the escape hatch we have left you. Put the \neconomic fate of the Nation ahead of your own fate as Speaker of the \nHouse. Millions of middle-class families are nervously watching and \nwaiting and counting down the moment until their taxes go up. Nothing \ncan move forward in regard to our budget crisis unless Speaker Boehner \nand Leader McConnell are willing to participate in coming up with a \nbipartisan plan.\n  Speaker Boehner is unwilling to negotiate, we have not heard a word \nfrom Leader McConnell, and nothing is happening. Democrats cannot put \nforward a plan of their own. Without the participation of Leader \nMcConnell and Speaker Boehner, nothing can happen on the fiscal cliff \nand so far they are radio silent.\n  We are going to work in the next couple of days to get the most \nimportant legislation done on FISA. There should be a good debate. We \nhave people who are interested in changing what we have on the floor. \nThere have been a series of amendments on trying to change FISA--the \nespionage legislation that guides this country. It should be a good \ndebate.\n  We have to finish the supplemental appropriations bill that is so \nimportant for the people in the Northeast. We have a lot to do. There \ncould be as many as 28 votes in the next few days. We are in Washington \nworking while the Members of the House of Representatives are out \nwatching movies, watching their kids play soccer and basketball and \ndoing all kinds of things. They should be here. They should be here \nurging the Speaker: Let's bring up the $250,000 bill. Let's not have \nmiddle-class Americans and small businesses get hurt.\n  What is the business?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/27/senate-section/article/S8384-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to consideration of H.R. 5949, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5949) to extend the FISA Amendments Act of \n     2008 for five years.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank Leader Reid for the honor of being \nable to open this morning's debate. I also wish to particularly \nidentify with a point the leader made. There is an old saying that most \nof life is just showing up. I think what the American people want--I \nheard this at checkout lines in our local stores, for example, this \nweek--they want everybody back in Washington and going to work on this \nissue, just as the leader suggested.\n  I think Senators know I am a charter member of what I guess you could \ncall the optimist caucus in the Senate. As improbable as some of these \ntalking heads say on TV that it is, I still think we ought to be here, \njust as the leader said, working on this issue because of the \nconsequences.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would be happy to yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The distinguished Senator from Oregon and I served together \nin the House of Representatives. Does the Senator remember the days \nwhen the House voted not as a majority but as a body to come up with \nhow legislation should be given to the American people? Does my friend \nremember that?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I do. The leader is being logical, and Heaven forbid that \nsometimes logic break out on some of these matters. I remember when we \nstarted out--and I joked that I had a full head of hair and rugged good \nlooks--the majority leader and I used to work with people on both sides \nof the aisle. We would try to show up early, go home late, and, as the \nleader said, focus on getting some results. I thank the leader for his \npoint and again for the honor of being able to start this discussion.\n  As I indicated, what I heard at home is that we are supposed to be \nhere and try to find some common ground. I know the talking heads on TV \nsay this is impossible and it cannot be done. First of all, as the \nmajority leader said, this has been done in the past. When there are \nbig issues and big challenges, historically the Congress will come \ntogether and deal with it.\n  I am particularly concerned about some of the effects going over the \ncliff will have on vulnerable senior citizens. As the Presiding Officer \nknows, that is my background. We have often talked about health care \nand seniors. My background was serving as codirector of the Oregon Gray \nPanthers. If the reimbursement system for Medicare, in\n\n[[Page S8385]]\n\neffect, goes over this cliff, that is going to reduce access to health \ncare for senior citizens across the country, and I don't believe there \nare Democrats and Republicans who want that to happen.\n  As the majority leader indicated, finding some common ground on this \nissue and backing our country away from the fiscal cliff is hugely \nimportant and crucial to the well-being of our country. I just wanted \nto start with those remarks.\n  Also crucial to our country is the legislation before the Senate \nright now. Its name is a real mouthful.\n  Mr. President, I think you will recall this legislation from your \ndays serving on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The name \nof this is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act. It \nalso expires in a few days. Our job is to find a way to strike the best \npossible balance between protecting our country from threats from \noverseas and safeguarding the individual liberties of the law-abiding \nAmericans we have cherished in this country for literally hundreds of \nyears. This task of balancing security and liberty was one of the most \nimportant tasks defined by the Founding Fathers years and years ago, \nand it is no less important for the Congress today.\n  As I indicated earlier, the majority leader, Leader Reid, has \naccorded me the honor of beginning this debate. I will open with a very \nshort explanation of what the FISA Amendments Act is all about. Of \ncourse, this is an extension of the law that was passed in 2008. It is \na major surveillance law, and it is the successor to the warrantless \nwiretapping program that operated under the Bush administration, which \ngave the government new authorities to collect the communications of \nforeigners outside the United States. The bill before the Senate today \nwould extend this law for another 5 years.\n  There is going to be a discussion of various issues, but all of them \ngo to what I call the constitutional teeter-totter, which is basically \nbalancing security, protecting our country at a dangerous time, and the \nindividual liberties that are so important to all of us. I expect there \nwill be amendments to strengthen protections for the privacy of law-\nabiding Americans.\n  I want to say to my colleagues and those who are listening that this \nis likely to be the only floor debate the Senate has on this law \nencompassing literally a 9-year period--from 2008 to 2017. So if we are \ntalking about surveillance authority that essentially looks to a 9-year \nperiod, we ought to have an important discussion about it, and that is \nwhy I am grateful to the majority leader for making today's discussion \npossible.\n  I have served on the Senate Intelligence Committee for 12 years now, \nand I can tell every Member of this body that those who work in the \nintelligence community are hard-working and patriotic men and women. \nThey give up an awful lot of evenings, weekends, and vacations to try \nto protect the well-being and security of our country. For example, we \nhear a lot about a well-publicized event, such as their enormously \nvaluable role in apprehending bin Laden. What we don't hear about is \nthe incredible work they do day in and day out. They work hard to \ngather intelligence, and I commend them for it as we begin this \ndiscussion.\n  The job of those who work in the intelligence community is to follow \nwhatever laws Congress lays down as those hard-working men and women \ncollect intelligence. Our job here in the Congress is to make sure the \nlaws we pass are in line with the vision of the Founding Fathers, which \nwas to protect national security as well as the rights of individual \nAmericans.\n  We all remember the wonderful comment by Ben Franklin. I will \nparaphrase it, but essentially Ben Franklin said: If you give up your \nliberty to have security, you really don't deserve either. We owe it to \nthe hard-working men and women in the intelligence community to work \nclosely with them. We need to find the balance Ben Franklin was talking \nabout, and we can help them by conducting robust oversight over the \nwork that is being done there so members of the public can have \nconfidence in the men and women of the intelligence community. This \nwill give the public the confidence to know that as we protect our \nsecurity at a dangerous time, we are also protecting the individual \nliberties of our people.\n  The story with respect to this debate really begins in early America \nwhen the colonists were famously subjected to a lot of taxes by the \nBritish Government. The American colonists thought this was unfair \nbecause they were not represented in the British Parliament. They \nargued that if they were not allowed to vote for their own government, \nthen they should not have to pay taxes.\n  We all remember the renowned rallying cry of the colonists. It was \n``no taxation without representation.'' Early revolutionaries engaged \nin protests against these taxes all over the country. Of course, the \nmost famous of these protests was the Boston Tea Party in which \ncolonists threw shiploads of tea into the Boston Harbor in protest of \nthe tax on tea.\n  As we recall from our history books, there were a lot of taxes on \nitems such as tea, sugar, paint, and paper. Because so many colonists \nbelieved these taxes were unjust, there was a lot of smuggling going on \nin the American Colonies. People would import things, such as sugar, \nand simply avoid paying the tax on them.\n  We all remember that the King of England didn't like this very much. \nHe wanted the colonists to pay taxes whether they were allowed to vote \nor not. So the English authority began issuing what were essentially \ngeneral warrants. They were called writs of assistance, and they \nauthorized government officials to enter into any house or building \nthey wanted in order to search for smuggled goods. These officials were \nnot limited to only searching in certain houses, and they were not \nrequired to show any evidence that the place they were searching had \nany smuggled goods in it. Basically, government officials were allowed \nto say they were looking for smuggled goods and then would search any \nhouse they were interested in to see if the house had some of those \nsmuggled goods.\n  An English authority's goal is to find smuggled goods. Letting \nconstables and customs officers search any house or building is a \npretty effective way to go out and find something. If they keep \nsearching enough houses, eventually they will find some smuggled goods \nin one of them and seize those goods and arrest whoever lives in that \nhouse for smuggling. Of course, the problem is that if government \nofficials can search any house they want, they are going to search \nthrough the houses of a lot of people who have not broken any laws.\n  Mr. President, it is almost as if you decided you were going to \nsearch everybody in your State of Rhode Island. You could go in and \nturn them all upside down, shake them, and see if anything fell out. \nObviously, you would find some people who had some things in their \npossession that they should not have, but that is not the way we do it \nin America. In America, there has to be probable cause in order to do \nsomething like that.\n  The American colonists had a huge problem with the idea that \neverybody's house was going to be checked for smuggled goods on the \nprospect that maybe somebody somewhere had engaged in smuggling. The \ncolonists said it is not OK to go around invading people's privacy \nunless there is some specific evidence that they have done something \nwrong. That is how people in Rhode Island and Oregon feel today. One \ncannot just go out and check everybody in sight on the prospect that \nmaybe there is someone who has done something wrong.\n  Back in the colonists' time, the law said that these writs of \nassistance were good until the King died. So when King George II died \nand the authorities had to get new writs, many colonists tried to \nchallenge them in court.\n  In Boston, James Otis denounced this mass invasion of privacy by \nreminding the court that--and we remember this wonderful comment--a \nman's house is his castle. Mr. Otis described the writs of assistance \nas the power that places the liberty of every man in the hands of every \npetty officer. Unfortunately, the court ruled that these general orders \npermitting mass searches without individual suspicion were legal, and \nEnglish authorities continued to use them. The fact that English \nofficials went around invading people's privacy without any specific \nevidence against them was one of the fundamental complaints the \nAmerican colonists had against the British Government. So naturally our \nFounding Fathers, with\n\n[[Page S8386]]\n\nthe wisdom they showed on so many matters, made it clear they wanted to \naddress this particular complaint when they wrote the Bill of Rights.\n\n  The Bill of Rights ensures that strong protections of individual \nfreedom would be included within our Constitution itself, and the \nFounding Fathers included strong protections for personal privacy in \nthe fourth amendment. The fourth amendment states:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and \n     seizures shall not be violated and no warrant shall issue but \n     upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and \n     particularly describing the place to be searched and the \n     person or things to be searched.\n\n  This was a direct rejection of the authority the British had claimed \nto have when they ruled the American Colonies.\n  The Founding Fathers said our government does not have the right to \nsearch any house that government officials want to search even if it \nhelps them to do their job. Government officials may only search \nsomeone's house if they have evidence that someone is breaking the law \nand they show the evidence to a judge to get an individual warrant.\n  For more than 200 years, this fundamental principle has protected \nAmericans' privacy while still allowing our government to enforce the \nlaw and to protect public safety.\n  As time passed and we entered the 20th century, advances in \ntechnology--a whole host of technologies--gave government officials the \npower to invade individual privacy in a whole host of new ways--new \nways the Founding Fathers never dreamed of--and all through those days, \nthe Congress and the courts struggled to keep up.\n  Time and time again Congress and the courts were most successful when \nthey returned to the fundamental principles of the fourth amendment. It \nis striking. If we look at a lot of the debates we are having today \nabout the Internet--and the Presiding Officer has a great interest in \nthis; we have talked often about it--certainly the Founding Fathers \ncould never have envisioned tweeting and Twitter and the Internet and \nall of these extraordinary technologies. But what we have seen as \ntechnology has continued to bring us this treasure trove of information \nwith all of these spectacular opportunities the Founding Fathers never \nenvisioned is that time and time again the Congress and the courts were \nmost successful when they returned to the fundamental principles of the \nfourth amendment.\n  For example, in 1928 the Supreme Court considered a famous case about \nwhether the fourth amendment made it illegal for the government to \nlisten to an individual's phone conversations without a warrant. Once \nagain, dating almost to the precedent about the colonists and \nsmuggling, the 1928 case was about smuggling--specifically, \nbootlegging. The government argued then that as long as it did the \nwiretapping remotely without entering an individual's house, the fourth \namendment would not apply.\n  Now, Justice Louis Brandeis wrote what has come to be seen in history \nas an extraordinary dissent, a brilliant dissent, and he argued that \nthis was all wrong; that the fourth amendment was about preventing the \ngovernment from invading Americans' privacy regardless of how the \ngovernment did it.\n  I am just going to spend a couple of minutes making sure people see \nhow brilliant and farsighted Justice Brandeis was in how his \nprinciples--the principles he talked about in 1928--are as valid now as \nthey were then.\n  Justice Brandeis said:\n\n       When the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were adopted . . . \n     force and violence were then the only means known to man by \n     which a Government could directly effect self-incrimination. \n     . . . Subtler and more far-reaching means of invading privacy \n     have [in effect] now become available to the Government. \n     Discovery and invention have made it possible for the \n     Government . . . to obtain disclosure in court of what is \n     whispered in the closet.\n\n  Justice Brandeis goes on to say:\n\n       In the application of a Constitution, our contemplation \n     cannot be only of what has been but of what may be. The \n     progress of science in furnishing the Government with means \n     of espionage is not likely to stop with wiretapping. Ways may \n     someday be developed by which the Government, without \n     removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce them in \n     court, and by which it will be enabled to expose to a jury \n     the most intimate occurrences of the home. ``That places the \n     liberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer'' \n     was said by James Otis of much less intrusions than these.\n\n  Justice Brandeis goes on to say:\n\n       The principles--\n\n  The principles, literally--\n\n       [behind the Fourth Amendment] affect the very essence of \n     constitutional liberty and security. They . . . apply to all \n     invasions on the part of the Government and its employees of \n     the sanctities of a man's home and the privacies of life. It \n     is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his \n     drawers that constitutes the essence of the offense; but it \n     is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal \n     security, personal liberty and private property, where the \n     right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some \n     public offense.\n\n  Justice Brandeis closes this remarkable dissent saying:\n\n       . . . The evil incident to invasion of the privacy of the \n     telephone is far greater than that involved with tampering \n     with the mails. . . . As a means of espionage, writs of \n     assistance and general warrants are but puny instruments of \n     tyranny and oppression when compared with wiretapping.\n\n  The protection guaranteed by the amendments Justice Brandeis was \nreferring to--the fourth and fifth amendments--is broad in scope.\n\n       The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure \n     conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They \n     recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his \n     feelings, and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of \n     the pain, pleasure and satisfaction of life are to be \n     found in material things. They sought to protect Americans \n     and their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions, and \n     their sensations. They conferred, as against the \n     Government, the right to be let alone--the most \n     comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by \n     civilized men. To protect that right, every unjustifiable \n     intrusion by the Government on the privacy of the \n     individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a \n     violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n  Because I have outlined Justice Brandeis's dissent on several issues, \nI want to make sure those last two sentences are clear.\n  Justice Brandeis said that the right of the people to be left alone \nby their government is ``the most comprehensive of rights''--the most \ncomprehensive of rights, said Justice Brandeis--and, he said, ``the \nright most valued by civilized men.'' And the Justice said that \nintrusions on individual privacy, ``whatever the means employed, must \nbe deemed a violation of the Fourth Amendment.''\n  The reason I have outlined Justice Brandeis's views on this issue is \nthat Justice Brandeis's views didn't prevail in 1928. Back in 1928 they \nthought they were dealing with high-tech surveillance. But suffice it \nto say that his views were eventually adopted by the full Supreme \nCourt. That is why I believe it is so important that as we look to \ntoday's debate--really an opportunity to update the way in which that \ncareful balance, the constitutional teeter-totter: security, well-being \nof all of us on this side and individual liberties on this side--it is \nso important to recognize what Justice Brandeis said about the value of \ngetting it right when it comes to liberty, when it comes to individual \nfreedom.\n  One of the reasons there are amendments being offered by Senators to \nthis legislation at a time when we are dealing with these crucial \nissues about the fiscal cliff, the question of the budget, taxes, and, \nas I mentioned, senior citizens being able to see a doctor--those are \ncrucial issues, but this legislation, the FISA Amendments Act, is also \na crucial piece of legislation, and that is why Senators will be \noffering amendments in order to strike the best possible balance \nbetween security and liberty.\n  When the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is often known \nas FISA--Senators and those listening will hear that discussion almost \ninterchangeably; the abbreviated name is FISA--when it was written in \n1978, Congress applied Justice Brandeis's principles to intelligence \ngathering. The Congress, when they wrote the original FISA legislation \nin 1978, really said that Justice Brandeis got it right with respect to \nhow we ought to gather intelligence. So the original FISA statute \nstated that if the government wants to collect an American's \ncommunications for intelligence purposes, the government must go to a \ncourt, show evidence that the American is a terrorist or a spy, and get \nan individual\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\nwarrant. This upheld the same principle the Founding Fathers fought for \nin the revolution, it is the same principle enshrined in the Bill of \nRights, and it said that government officials are not allowed to invade \nAmericans' privacy unless they have specific evidence and an individual \nwarrant.\n  After 9/11, the Bush administration decided it would seek additional \nsurveillance authorities beyond what was in the original Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act statute. To our great regret, instead of \nasking the Congress to change the law, the Bush administration \ndeveloped a warrantless wiretapping program--let me repeat that, a \nwarrantless wiretapping program--that operated in secret for a number \nof years. When this became public--as I have said on this floor before, \nthese matters always do become public at some point--when it became \nclear that the Bush administration had developed this warrantless \nwiretapping program, there was a huge uproar across the land. I \nremember how angry many of my constituents were when they learned about \nthe warrantless wiretapping program, and I and a lot of other Senators \nwere very angry as well.\n  As has the Presiding Officer, I have been on the Intelligence \nCommittee, and I have been a member for 12 years, but the first time I \nheard about the warrantless wiretapping program--the first time I heard \nabout it--was when I read about it in the newspapers. It was in the New \nYork Times before I, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, knew about it.\n  There was a very heated debate. Congress passed the FISA Amendments \nAct of 2008, and that was to replace the warrantless wiretapping \nprogram with new authorities for the government to collect the phone \ncalls and e-mails of those believed to be foreigners outside the United \nStates.\n  The centerpiece of the FISA Amendments Act is a provision that is now \nsection 702 of the FISA statute. Section 702 is the provision that gave \nthe government new authorities to collect the communications of people \nwho are believed to be foreigners outside the United States. This was \ndifferent than the original FISA statute. Unlike the traditional FISA \nauthorities and unlike law enforcement wiretapping authorities, section \n702 of the FISA Amendments Act does not involve obtaining individual \nwarrants. Instead, it allows the government to get what is called a \nprogrammatic warrant. It lasts for an entire year and authorizes the \ngovernment to collect a potentially large number of phone calls and e-\nmails, with no requirement that the senders or recipients be connected \nto terrorism, espionage--the threats we are concerned about.\n\n  If that sounds familiar, it certainly should. General warrants that \nallowed government officials to decide whose privacy to invade were the \nexact sort of abuse that the American colonists protested over and led \nthe Founding Fathers to adopt the fourth amendment in the first place. \nFor this reason, section 702 of the FISA law contains language that is \nspecifically intended to limit the government's ability to use these \nnew authorities to spy on Americans.\n  Let me emphasize that because that is crucial to this discussion and \nthe amendments that will be offered. It is never OK--never OK--for \ngovernment officials to use a general warrant to deliberately invade \nthe privacy of a law-abiding American. It was not OK for constables and \nCustoms officials to do it in colonial days, and it is not OK for the \nNational Security Agency to do it today. So if the government is going \nto use general warrants to collect people's phone calls and e-mails, it \nis extremely important to ensure that this authority is only used \nagainst foreigners overseas and not against law-abiding Americans.\n  Despite what the Acting President pro tempore and the Senate may have \nheard, this law does not actually prohibit the government from \ncollecting Americans' phone calls and e-mails without a warrant. The \nFISA Amendments Act states--and I wish to quote because there have been \na lot of inaccuracies and misrepresentations on this--the FISA \nAmendments Act states that acquisitions made under section 702 may not \n``intentionally target'' a specific American and may not \n``intentionally acquire'' communications that are ``known at the time \nof acquisition'' to be wholly domestic.\n  But the problem with that is, it still leaves a lot of room for \ncircumstances under which Americans' phone calls and e-mails--including \npurely domestic phone calls and e-mails--could be swept up and reviewed \nwithout a warrant. This can happen if the government did not know \nsomeone is American or if the government made a technical error or if \nthe American was talking to a foreigner, even if that conversation was \nentirely legitimate.\n  I am not talking about some hypothetical situation. The FISA Court, \nin response to a concern I and others have had, has already ruled at \nleast once that collection carried out by the government under the FISA \nAmendments Act violated the fourth amendment to the Constitution. \nSenate rules regarding classified information prevent me from \ndiscussing the details of that ruling or how many Americans were \naffected, over what period of time, but this fact alone clearly \ndemonstrates the impact of this law on Americans' privacy has been real \nand it is not hypothetical.\n  When the Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act 4 years ago, it \nincluded an expiration date. The point of the expiration date was to \nensure that Congress could review these authorities closely and the \nCongress could decide whether protections for Americans' privacy are \nadequate or whether they need to be modified.\n  Again, go back to what I have described as the constitutional teeter-\ntotter--our job: balance the need of the government to collect \ninformation, particularly with respect to what can be threats coming \nfrom overseas, with the right of individual Americans to be left alone. \nIt is that balance we are discussing. If the Congress finds it is \nunbalanced, the Congress has a responsibility to step up and figure out \nhow to make the appropriate changes in the law to ensure that both \nsecurity and privacy are being protected simultaneously.\n  Unfortunately, the Congress and the public--the American people--do \nnot currently have enough information to adequately evaluate the impact \nof the law we are debating on Americans' privacy. There are a host of \nimportant issues about the law's impact that intelligence officials \nhave simply refused to answer publicly.\n  I am going to now spend a few minutes outlining the big questions I \nbelieve Americans deserve answers to. Certainly, the Congress has to \nhave answers to these questions in order to do our job--our job of \ndoing robust oversight over this law and over intelligence, which, as I \nsaid a bit ago, is exactly what the hard-working men and women in the \nintelligence community need and deserve in order to do their job in a \nway that will generate confidence among the American people.\n  First, if we want to know what kind of impact this law has had on \nAmericans' privacy, we probably want to know roughly how many phone \ncalls and e-mails that are to and from Americans have been swept up by \nthe government under this authority. Senator Mark Udall, our \ndistinguished colleague from Colorado and a great addition to the \nIntelligence Committee--he and I began the task of trying to ferret out \nthis information some time ago. Over a year and a half ago, Senator \nMark Udall and I asked the Director of National Intelligence how many \nAmericans have had their communications collected under this law; in \neffect, swept up by the government under these authorities.\n  The response was it is ``not reasonably possible to identify the \nnumber of people located in the United States whose communications may \nhave been reviewed under the authority of the'' FISA Amendments Act. \nThat is how the government responded to Senator Udall and me.\n  If you are a person who does not like the idea of government \nofficials secretly reviewing your phone calls and e-mails, you probably \ndo not find that answer particularly reassuring. But suffice it to say, \nthe situation got worse from there.\n  In July of this year, I and a tripartisan group of 12 other Senators, \nincluding Senator Mark Udall, our colleague from Utah, Senator Mike \nLee, Senator Durbin--I am pleased to be joined by Senator Merkley, who \nhas been vital in this coalition, this\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\ntripartisan coalition to get the best possible balance between security \nand liberty--he was a signer of the letter; Senator Paul of Kentucky, \nwho has also been an outspoken advocate of striking a better balance \nbetween privacy and liberty was a signer; Senator Coons, Senator \nBegich, Senator Bingaman, Senator Tester, Senator Sanders, Senator Tom \nUdall, Senator Cantwell--all of us joined in writing another letter to \nthe Director of National Intelligence asking additional questions about \nthe impact of this law on Americans' privacy.\n\n  We asked the Director if he could give us even a rough estimate--just \na rough estimate--in other words, there has been discussion both in the \npress and in the intelligence community: This group of Senators is \nasking for something impossible. This group of Senators is asking for \nan exact count of how many Americans are being swept up under this FISA \nauthority, their calls and e-mails reviewed. I wish to emphasize we \njust said, as a tripartisan group of Senators: We would just like a \nrough estimate--use any approach they want in terms of giving us an \nassessment of how many Americans' communications have been swept up in \nthis way. Is it hundreds? Is it hundreds of thousands? Is it millions?\n  The tripartisan group of Senators basically was just asking for a \nreport, the kind of information that is a prerequisite to doing good \noversight. Frankly, I think when we talk about oversight and we cannot \neven get a rough estimate of how many law-abiding Americans have had \ntheir communications swept up under this law, if they do not have that \nkind of information, oversight--the idea of robust oversight--it ought \nto be called toothless oversight if they do not have that kind of \ninformation.\n  The Director declined to publicly answer this question. So our \ntripartisan group and others continued. We asked the Director if anyone \nelse has already done such an estimate. We did not ask about doing \nanything new. The intelligence community said: Oh, my goodness. It will \nbe so hard to give even a rough estimate. So we said: OK. Just tell us \nif anyone else has already done such an estimate. The Director declined \nto publicly answer this question as well.\n  Right at the heart of this discussion is, if we are serious about \ndoing oversight, the Congress ought to be able to get a straightforward \nanswer to the question: Have any estimates been done already as to \nwhether law-abiding Americans have had their communications swept up \nunder the FISA authority?\n  Second, if we want to understand this law's impact on Americans' \nprivacy, we probably want to know whether any wholly domestic \ncommunications have been collected under the FISA authorities. When we \nare talking about wholly domestic communications, we are talking about \none person in the United States talking to another person who is also \nin the United States. This law contains a number of safeguards that \nmany people thought would prevent the warrantless collection of wholly \ndomestic U.S. communications, and I think the Congress ought to know \nwhether these safeguards are working.\n  So our tripartisan group of Senators dug into this issue as well, and \nwe asked the Director back in July if he knew whether any wholly \ndomestic U.S. communications had been collected under the FISA \nAmendments Act. So here we are talking about wholly domestic \ncommunications from one American, for example, in Rhode Island, to \nanother American in the home State of Senator Merkley and myself. I am \ndisappointed to say the Director declined to answer this question as \nwell.\n  Let's contemplate that for a moment. A tripartisan group of \nSenators--Democrats, Republicans, Independents--asked if the government \nknew whether any wholly domestic communications had been collected \nunder the FISA law, and the head of the intelligence community declined \nto publicly provide a simple yes or no response to that question.\n  That means the FISA Amendments Act involves the government going to a \nsecret court on a yearly basis and getting programmatic warrants to \ncollect people's phone calls and e-mails, with no requirement that \nthese communications actually belong to people involved with terrorism \nor espionage. This authority is not supposed to be used against \nAmericans, but, in fact, intelligence officials say they do not even \nknow how many American communications they are actually collecting. The \nfact is, once the government has this pile of communications, which \ncontains an unknown but potentially very large number of Americans' \nphone calls and e-mails, there are surprisingly few rules about what \ncan be done with it.\n  For example, there is nothing in the law that prevents government \nofficials from going to that pile of communications and deliberately \nsearching for the phone calls or e-mails of a specific American, even \nif they do not have any actual evidence that the American is involved \nin some kind of wrongdoing, some kind of nefarious activity.\n  Again, if it sounds familiar, it ought to because that is how I began \nthis discussion, talking about these sorts of general warrants that so \nupset the colonists. General warrants allowing government officials to \ndeliberately intrude on the privacy of individual Americans at their \ndiscretion was, as I have outlined this morning, the abuse that led \nAmerica's Founding Fathers to rise up against the British. They are \nexactly what the fourth amendment was written to prevent.\n  If government officials wanted to search an American's house or read \ntheir e-mails or listen to their phone calls, they are supposed to show \nevidence to a judge and get an individual warrant. But this loophole in \nthe law allowed government officials to make an end run around \ntraditional warrant requirements and conduct backdoor searches for \nAmerican's communications.\n  Now, let me be clear. If the government has clear evidence that an \nAmerican is engaged in terrorism, espionage--serious crimes--I think \nthe government ought to be able to read that person's e-mails and \nlisten to that person's phone calls. I believe and have long felt that \nis an essential part of protecting public safety. But government \nofficials ought to be required to get a warrant. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, there are even emergency provisions--and I support these \nstrongly as well--that allow for an emergency authorization before you \nget the warrant, in order to protect the well-being of the American \npeople.\n  So what we want to know at this point, if you are trying to decide \nwhether the constitutional teeter-totter is being properly balanced or \nis out of whack, you want to know whether the government has ever taken \nadvantage of this backdoor search loophole and conducted a warrantless \nsearch for the phone calls or e-mails of specific Americans. So when \nthe tripartisan group wrote to the Director of National Intelligence, \nwe asked him to state whether the intelligence community has ever \ndeliberately conducted a warrantless search of this nature. The \nDirector declined to respond to this as well--declined to respond to a \ntripartisan group of Senators simply asking: Has the intelligence \ncommunity ever deliberately conducted a warrantless search of this \nnature?\n  If anybody is kind of keeping score on this, you will notice that the \nDirector refused to publicly answer any of the questions that were \nasked in our letter. So if you are looking for reassurance that the law \nis being carried out in a way that respects the privacy of law-abiding \nAmerican citizens, you will not find it in his response.\n  I should note that the Director did provide additional responses in a \nhighly classified attachment to his letter. This attachment was so \nhighly classified that I think of the 13 Senators who signed the letter \nof the tripartisan group, 11 of those 13 Senators do not even have \nstaff who have the requisite security clearance to read it. So \nnaturally that makes it hard for those Senators, let alone the public, \nto gain a better understanding of the privacy impact of the law.\n  Several Senators sent the Director a followup letter last month again \nurging him to provide public answers to what we felt were \nstraightforward questions--really sort of a minimum set of responses \nthat the Congress needs to do oversight. The Director refused that as \nwell.\n  Intelligence officials do not deny the facts I have outlined this \nmorning.\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\nThey still insist they are already protecting innocent Americans' \nprivacy. There is a lot of discussion about how this program is \noverseen by the secret FISA Court, how the court is charged with \nensuring that all of the collections carried out under this program are \nconstitutional.\n  To respond to those arguments, I would note that under the FISA \nAmendments Act, the government does not have to get the permission of \nthe FISA Court to read particular e-mails or listen to particular phone \ncalls. The law simply requires the court to review the government's \ncollection and handling procedures on an annual basis. There is no \nrequirement in the law for the court to approve the collection and \nreview of individual communications even if government officials set \nout to deliberately read the e-mails of an American citizen.\n  Even when the court reviews the government's collection and handling \nprocedures, it is important to note that the FISA Court's ruling are \nmade entirely in secret. It may seem hard to believe, but the court's \nrulings that interpret major surveillance law and even the U.S. \nConstitution in significant ways--these are important judgments--the \npublic has absolutely no idea what the court is actually saying. What \nthat means is that our country is in effect developing a secret body of \nlaw so that most Americans have no way of finding out how their laws \nand their Constitution are being interpreted. That is a big problem. \nAmericans do not expect to know the details of how government agencies \ncollect information, but Americans do expect those agencies to operate \nwithin the boundaries of publicly understood law. Americans need and \nhave a right to know how those laws and the Constitution are \ninterpreted so they can ratify the decisions that elected officials \nmake on their behalf. To put it another way, I think we understand that \nAmericans know that intelligence agencies sometimes have to conduct \nsecret operations, but the American people do not expect these agencies \nto rely on secret law.\n\n  I think we understand that the work of the intelligence community is \nso extraordinarily important. I see the distinguished chair of the \ncommittee here. Every member of our committee--every member--feels that \nit is absolutely critical to protect the sources and methods by which \nthe work of the intelligence community is being done. But we do not \nexpect the public to, in effect, just accept secret law.\n  When you go to your laptop and you look up a law, it is public. It is \npublic. But what I have described is a growing pattern of secret law \nthat makes it harder for the American people to make judgments about \nthe decisions that are being made by those in the intelligence \ncommunity. I think that can undermine the confidence the public has in \nthe important work being done by the intelligence community.\n  If you think back to colonial times, when the British Government was \nissuing writs of assistance and general warrants, the colonists were at \nleast able to challenge those warrants in open court. So when the \ncourts upheld those writs of assistance, ordinary people could read \nabout the decisions, and people such as James Otis and John Adams could \npublicly debate whether the law was adequately protecting the privacy \nof law-abiding individuals. But if the FISA Court were to uphold \nsomething like that today, in the age of digital communications and \nelectronic surveillance, it could conceivably pass entirely unnoticed \nby the public, even by those people whose privacy was being invaded.\n  Since 2008 other Senators and I have urged the Department of Justice \nand the intelligence community to establish a regular process for \nreviewing, redacting, and releasing the opinions of the FISA Court that \ncontain significant interpretation of the law so that members of the \npublic have the opportunity to understand what their government thinks \ntheir law and their Constitution actually mean. I am not talking about \na need to release every single routine decision made by the court. \nObviously, most of the cases that come before the court contain \nsensitive information about intelligence sources and methods that are \nappropriate to keep secret.\n  I do not take a backseat to any Member of this body in terms of \nprotecting the sources and methods of those in the intelligence \ncommunity doing their important work, but the law itself should never \nbe secret. What Federal courts think the law and the fourth amendment \nto the Constitution actually mean should never be a secret from the \nAmerican people, the way it is today.\n  I am going to wrap up. I see Senator Merkley and Senator Feinstein \nhere. I have a couple of additional points.\n  I was encouraged in 2009 when the Obama administration wrote to \nSenator Rockefeller and myself to inform us that they would be setting \nup a process for redacting and releasing those FISA Court opinions that \ncontained significant interpretations of law. Unfortunately, over 3 \nyears later, this process has produced literally zero results. Not a \nsingle redacted opinion or summary of FISA Court rulings has been \nreleased. I cannot even tell if the administration still intends to \nfulfill this promise. I often get the feeling they are hoping people \nwill go away and forget that the promise was made in the first place.\n  I should note, in fairness, that while the administration has so far \nfailed to fulfill this promise, the intelligence community has \nsometimes been willing to declassify specific information about the \nFISA Court's rulings in response to requests from myself and other \nSenators. For example, in response to a request I made this past \nsummer, the intelligence community acknowledged that on at least one \noccasion--this was an acknowledgement from the intelligence community. \nThe intelligence community acknowledged that at least on one occasion, \nthe FISA Court had ruled that collection carried out by the government \nunder the FISA Amendments Act violated the fourth amendment to the \nConstitution. I think that is an important point to remember when you \nhear people saying the law is adequately protecting Americans' privacy.\n  I would also note that on this point, partially declassified internal \nreviews of the FISA amendments collection act have noted that certain \ntypes of compliance issues continue to occur--continue to occur.\n  I have two last points. Beyond the fact that the programmatic \nwarrants authorized by the FISA Amendments Act are approved by a secret \ncourt, the other thing that intelligence officials cite is that there \nare ``minimization'' procedures to deal with the issues that those of \nus who are concerned about privacy rights have raised. This is an odd \nterm, but it simply refers to rules for dealing with information about \nAmericans.\n  Intelligence officials will tell you that these are pretty much \ntaking care of everything, and if there are not enough privacy \nprotections in the law itself, minimization procedures provide all of \nthe privacy protections any reasonable person could ever want or need. \nThese minimization procedures are classified, so most people are never \ngoing to know what they say. As someone who has access to the \nminimization procedures, I will make it clear that I think they are \ncertainly better than nothing, but there is no way, colleagues, these \nminimization procedures ought to be a substitute for having strong \nprivacy protections written into the law.\n  I will close with the reason I feel so strongly about this, which is \nthat senior intelligence officials have sometimes described these \nhandling procedures in misleading ways and make protections for \nAmericans' privacy sound stronger than they actually are. I was \nparticularly disappointed when the Director of NSA did this recently at \na large technology conference.\n  In response to a question about the National Security Agency's \nsurveillance of Americans, General Alexander referenced the FISA \nAmendments Act and talked in particular about the minimization \nprocedures that applied to the collection of U.S. communications. \nUnderstand that this was at a big, open technology conference. General \nAlexander said that when the NSA sweeps up communications from a ``good \nguy,'' which I think we all assume is a law-abiding American, the NSA \nhas ``requirements from the FISA court and the Attorney General to \nminimize that, which means nobody else can see it unless there is a \ncrime that is being committed.'' Now, anybody who hears that phrase \nsays: That\n\n[[Page S8390]]\n\nis pretty good. I imagine that is what people in that technology \nmeeting and the conference call wanted to hear. The only problem is \nthat it is not true. It is not true at all. The privacy protections \nprovided by these minimization procedures are simply not as strong as \nGeneral Alexander made them out to be.\n  In October, a few months after General Alexander made the comments, \nSenator Udall and I wrote him a letter asking him to please correct the \nrecord. The first paragraphs of the letter were:\n\n       Dear General Alexander:\n       You spoke recently at a technology convention in Nevada, at \n     which you were asked a question about NSA collection of \n     information about American citizens. In your response, you \n     focused in particular on section 702 of the FISA Amendments \n     Act of 2008, which the Senate will debate later this year. In \n     describing the NSA's collection of communications under the \n     FISA Amendments Act, you discussed rules for handling the \n     communications of U.S. persons.\n\n  General Alexander said:\n\n       We may, incidentally, in targeting a bad guy hit on \n     somebody [sic] from a good guy, because there's a discussion \n     there. We have requirements from the FISA Court and the \n     Attorney General to minimize that, which means nobody else \n     can see it unless there's a crime that's been committed.\n\n  Senator Udall and I wrote:\n\n       We believe that this statement incorrectly characterized \n     the minimization requirements that apply to the NSA's FISA \n     Amendments Act collection, and portrayed privacy protections \n     for Americans' communications as being stronger than they \n     actually are. We urge you to correct this statement, so that \n     Congress and the public can have a debate over the renewal of \n     this law that is informed by at least some accurate \n     information about the impact it has had on Americans' \n     privacy.\n\n  General Alexander wrote us back a few weeks later and said that, of \ncourse, that is not exactly how minimization procedures work and, of \ncourse, the privacy protections aren't as strong as that.\n  If anyone would like to read his letter, I put it up on my Web site. \nI don't know why General Alexander described the minimization \nprocedures the way he did. It is possible he misspoke. It is possible \nhe was mistaken. But I certainly would be more sympathetic to these \narguments that all these privacy protections are being taken care of if \nit hadn't taken Senator Udall and I making a push to get the NSA to \ncorrect the record with respect to these minimization procedures. \nFrankly, I am not sure, if there hadn't been a big push by Senators who \nhad questions about what was said at that technology conference, I am \nnot sure the NSA would have ever corrected what they originally said \nabout minimization.\n  So minimization procedures are not a bad idea, but the suggestion \nthat we don't need privacy protections written into the law because of \nthem is a bad idea.\n  Finally, at that conference, General Alexander stated: ``The story \nthat we [the NSA] have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on \npeople is absolutely false.''\n  I have been on the Senate Intelligence Committee for 12 years, and I \ndon't know what the term ``dossier'' means in that context.\n  So in October, Senator Udall, a member of the committee, and I asked \nthe Director to clarify that statement. We asked:\n\n       Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on `millions \n     or hundreds of millions of Americans'?\n\n  I think that is a pretty straightforward question. If we are asking \nwhether the NSA is doing a good job protecting Americans' privacy, it \nis one of the most basic questions of all. If General Alexander saw \nfit, and he was the one who said they don't keep millions of dossiers, \nGeneral Alexander could have answered our question about whether they \nwere keeping these dossiers with a simple yes or no.\n  Instead, the Director of the NSA replied that while he appreciated \nour desire to have responses to the questions on the public record, he \nwould not provide a public answer.\n  Again, the Director of the NSA said: ``The story that we [the NSA] \nhave millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is \nabsolutely false.''\n  So two members of the committee asked: ``Does the NSA collect any \ntype of data at all on `millions or hundreds of millions of Americans,' \n'' and the Director refused to respond.\n  At this point, I close by way of saying I believe the FISA Amendments \nAct has enabled the government to collect useful intelligence \ninformation, and my goal is to reform the legislation. The two specific \nthings I want to do are, first, require the intelligence community to \nprovide more information about the impact of the FISA Amendments Act on \nAmericans' privacy and, second, to make improvements to privacy \nprotections so we can readily see where they are most needed.\n  So there will be several amendments that will be offered. The \namendment I will be offering is sponsored by 15 Members of the Senate. \nIt simply says the Director of the National Intelligence Agency should \nsubmit a report to the Congress on the privacy impact of the FISA \nAmendments Act.\n  This amendment would require the report to state whether any estimate \nhas been done, how many U.S. communications have been collected under \nthe authority, and to provide any estimates that exist. I wish to \nemphasize this amendment would not require any entity to actually \nconduct such an estimate. The Director would be required only to \nprovide any estimates that have already been done and, if no estimates \nexist, the Director could say so.\n  Additionally, the amendment would require the report to state whether \nany wholly domestic communications have been collected under the FISA \nAmendments Act and whether any government agencies have ever conducted \nany warrantless, backdoor searches. These are straightforward \nquestions, and they are obviously relevant to understanding the scope \nof the law's impact on privacy.\n  The report would address General Alexander's confusing statements by \nrequiring the intelligence community to simply state whether the NSA \nhas collected any personally identifiable data on more than 1 million \nAmericans. The Congress and the country deserve an answer to this \nquestion as well.\n  The amendment does not force the declassification of any information. \nThe amendment gives the President full discretion to redact as much \ninformation from the public version of the report as he deems \nappropriate, as long as he tells the Congress why.\n  To repeat, the amendment doesn't require the intelligence community \nto conduct a new estimate, and the President would have full discretion \nto decide whether any information should be made public.\n\n  I offer this amendment because I believe every Member of Congress \nought to have the answers to these questions. If your constituents are \nsimilar to mine and Senator Merkley's, they expect us to give \ngovernment agencies the authority to protect our country and to gather \nintelligence on important topics, but they also expect us to conduct \nvigorous oversight on what those agencies are doing.\n  It is, I guess, a temptation to say: I don't know what is going on, \nso I will let somebody else look at the privacy issues and go from \nthere. I don't think that is good oversight.\n  To me, at a minimum, if we don't pass a requirement that we get a \nrough accounting of whether there has even been an estimate done with \nrespect to how many law-abiding Americans have been swept up under \nthese FISA authorities, my view is that oversight becomes toothless, \nand that is not what our obligation over these issues is all about.\n  There will be other important amendments as well. Senator Merkley has \none that I think is particularly important because it goes to this \nquestion of secret laws. Senator Leahy seeks to promote additional \naccountability as well with his important amendment. My colleague \nSenator Paul will be offering an amendment, an important amendment as \nwell, with respect to reasonable searches and seizures under the fourth \namendment.\n  We obviously have crucial work to do with respect to the fiscal cliff \nissue in the next few days. We talked earlier when the majority leader \nwas here about the impact of the budget and taxes, senior citizens not \nbeing able to see doctors. It is crucial work, and I continue to be \npart of that optimists caucus in the Senate, believing we can still \nfind some common ground in these last few days on the fiscal cliff and \navoid going over the fiscal cliff.\n  That is crucial work, but striking the right balance between \nprotecting our country and protecting our individual liberties is also \nimportant work. For\n\n[[Page S8391]]\n\nthat reason, I wanted to walk through the history of the FISA \nAmendments Act this morning, describe why it was so important, \nparticularly for us to get even an accounting.\n  Remember, this doesn't disrupt any operations in the intelligence \ncommunity. This is just an accounting of how many law-abiding Americans \nhad their communications swept up under this law. That work is crucial \ntoo.\n  For that reason, I hope that on a bipartisan basis, the amendments \nwill be viewed favorably by the Senate when we begin voting. Thank you \nfor your indulgence for being part of this discussion, presiding in the \nchair, and with special thanks to the distinguished majority leader who \ngave me the opportunity to open this discussion about FISA this \nmorning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to make an opening \nstatement, as the committee chair, on the bill that is before the \nSenate.\n  This bill is a simple bill. This is a House bill that extends, \nreauthorizes the FISA Amendments Act. FISA is the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act. The House bill reauthorizes the FISA Amendments Act \nfor 5 years, until December 31, 2017. That is all it does.\n  Without Senate action, these authorities to collect intelligence \nexpire in 4 days. That is the reason it is the House bill before us, \nand that is the reason I urge this body to vote no on all amendments \nand send this reauthorization to the President where it will be signed. \nIf it goes past the 31st, the program will be interrupted.\n  This is important. Reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act has the \nsupport of the Director of National Security, Jim Clapper; the Attorney \nGeneral, Eric Holder; and other national security officials who have \nmade clear the importance of this legislation.\n  Following my remarks, I would like to enter letters into the Record \nfrom the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence, \nsaying this reauthorization is the highest legislative priority of the \nIntelligence Community.\n  Let me explain what the expiring provisions of the FISA Amendments \nAct do. I assume that is agreeable with the President that these \nletters go into the Record following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me describe what these provisions do and why they \nare necessary to reauthorize.\n  What will expire on December 31 is title VII of FISA, which is called \nthe FAA, the FISA Amendments Act. This authorizes the executive branch \nof the government to go to the FISA Court, which is a special court--\nand most people don't know this--of 11 Federal District Court judges \nappointed by the Supreme Court who review government requests for \nsurveillance activities and obtain annual approval for a program to \nconduct surveillance on non-U.S. persons, in other words, surveillance \non individuals who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents \nand who are located outside the United States.\n  Under current law, the Attorney General and the Director of National \nIntelligence may submit an application to the FISA Court. I call this a \nprogram warrant. It identifies the category of foreign persons against \nwhom the government seeks to conduct surveillance. This application is \naccompanied by targeting and minimization procedures that establish how \nthe government will determine that someone targeted for surveillance is \nlocated outside the United States; and, secondly, how it is going to \nminimize the acquisition and retention of any information concerning \nU.S. persons who are accidentally caught up in this.\n  If the FISA Court finds the procedures to be consistent with both law \nand the fourth amendment, they enter an order authorizing this kind of \nsurveillance for 1 year--and the judges on the FISA Court have found \nboth--and they have authorized the program to continue.\n  The process that follows allows the intelligence community to collect \nthe communications of international terrorists and other non-U.S. \npersons who are located outside the country by, for example, acquiring \nelectronic communications such as phone calls and e-mails sent to or \nfrom a phone number or an e-mail address known to be used by the person \nunder surveillance.\n  Without this authority, the intelligence community would need to \nreturn to the process of going to the FISA Court in every individual \ncase involving collection directed at a non-U.S. person and to prove in \neach case there is probable cause to believe the individual is part of \nor working for a foreign power or a terrorist group.\n  Now, here is the question: Can the government use section 702 of FISA \nto target a U.S. person? The answer to that is no. The law specifically \nprohibits the use of section 702 authorities to direct collection \nagainst--that means target--U.S. persons. So no one should think the \ntargets are U.S. persons.\n  This prohibition is codified in section 702(b), which states that \nsurveillance authorities may not be used--and let me quote the law--\n``to intentionally target any person known at the time of acquisition \nto be located in the United States or to intentionally target a United \nStates person reasonably believed to be located outside the United \nStates.''\n  Now, if the government wants to engage in electronic surveillance \ntargeting a U.S. person for foreign intelligence purposes, it must go \nback to the FISA Court and it must get a specific order from that \ncourt. In an emergency, the surveillance can commence before the court \norder is issued, but the government still must have probable cause to \nbelieve the U.S. person is an agent of a foreign power.\n  Let me take a few moments to address the principal concerns some of \nmy colleagues have expressed about this legislation, which is the \neffect this one provision--Section 702--may have on the privacy and \ncivil liberties of U.S. persons. And let me say that 13 members of the \nIntelligence Committee who have voted in favor of the extension of the \nFISA Amendments Act--and against previous amendments from Senator \nWyden--do not believe privacy is being eliminated under the law this \nbill would reauthorize.\n  As I have discussed, section 702 establishes a framework for the \ngovernment to acquire foreign intelligence by conducting electronic \nsurveillance on non-U.S. persons who are reasonably believed to be \nlocated outside of the United States under a program that is annually \napproved by the court. The privacy concerns stem from the potential for \nintelligence collection directed at non-U.S. persons located abroad to \nresult in the incidental collection of or concerning communications of \nU.S. persons. I understand these concerns, and I would like to explain \nwhy I believe the existing provisions are adequate to address them.\n  First, this section is narrowly tailored to ensure that it may only \nbe used to target non-U.S. persons located abroad. It includes specific \nprohibitions on targeting U.S. persons or persons inside the United \nStates and prohibitions on engaging in so-called reverse-targeting, \nwhich means targeting a non-U.S. person abroad when the real purpose is \nto obtain their communications with a person inside the United States. \nThat is prohibited.\n  Anytime the intelligence community is seeking to collect the \ncommunications of an American, it has to demonstrate that it has \nprobable cause and get an individual FISA Court order.\n  Second, Congress recognized at the time this amendments act was \nenacted that it is simply not possible to collect intelligence on the \ncommunications of a person of interest without also collecting \ninformation about the people with whom and about whom that person \ncommunicates, including, in some cases, non-targeted U.S. persons. The \nconcern was addressed when the FAA was originally drafted. \nSpecifically, in order to protect the privacy and civil liberty of U.S. \npersons, Congress mandated that for collection conducted under 702, the \nAttorney General adopt and the FISA Court review and approve procedures \nthat minimize the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of \nnonpublic information concerning unconsenting U.S. persons.\n  Third, numerous reports and assessments from the executive branch \nthat I will describe in a moment provide the committee with extensive \nvisibility\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\ninto how these minimization procedures work and enable both the \nIntelligence and the Judiciary Committees to see how these procedures \nare effective in protecting the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. \npersons.\n  Oversight by the legislative, judicial, and executive branch of the \ngovernment over the past 4 years has been very thorough. There are \nprocedures and requirements in place under current law that provide \nprotection for the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. persons. Those \nentrusted with the responsibility to collect the oversight, the \ncommittees of jurisdiction, the FISA Court, and the executive branch \nagencies together remain vigilant and continue to review the operations \nof these agencies.\n  Let me give a quick summary of the 702 reporting requirements under \ncurrent law.\n  They include a semiannual assessment by the Attorney General and the \nDNI. Every 6 months the AG and the DNI are required to assess \ncompliance with the targeting and minimization procedures and the \nacquisition guidelines adopted under Section 702. They are both further \nrequired to submit each assessment to the FISA Court and the \ncongressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.\n  The inspector general of the Department of Justice and the inspector \ngeneral of each element of the intelligence community are also \nauthorized review compliance with Section 702. The IGs are required to \nprovide copies of such reviews to the Attorney General, to the Director \nof National Intelligence, and the congressional Intelligence and \nJudiciary Committees. So we have the AG reviewing, we have the IGs \nreviewing, and then we have separate reviews by the agency heads.\n  The head of each element of the intelligence community must conduct \nan annual review which includes the following:\n  First, an accounting of the number of disseminated intelligence \nreports containing a reference to the U.S. person's identity. As a \nmatter of fact, Members can go into a classified room at the offices of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee and review these reports. Any Member \nhas access to that review.\n  Second, an accounting of the number of U.S. person identities \nsubsequently disseminated by that element in response to requests for \nidentities that were not referred to by name or title in the original \nreporting. Members can review that.\n  Third, the number of targets who were later determined to be located \nin the United States and, to the extent possible, whether \ncommunications of such targets were reviewed. Members can go in the \nIntelligence Committee offices and review that.\n  Fourth, a description of any procedures developed by the head of such \nelement of the intelligence community and approved by the Director of \nNational Intelligence to assess the extent to which acquisitions under \n702 acquire communications of U.S. persons, and the results of any such \nassessment.\n  So you see, the reporting requirements go on and on.\n  Then there is a semiannual report. Every 6 months, the AG is required \nto fully inform the congressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees \nconcerning the implementation of Title VII of FISA, and there is a \nwhole list of things that must be reviewed and recounted. Then there is \na semiannual Attorney General review on FISA. There is also the \nprovision for documents from the FISA Court relating to significant \nconstruction or interpretation of FISA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis list.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Summary of Section 702 Reporting Requirements\n\n       Background: The surveillance authorities added to the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (``FISA'') by FISA \n     Amendments Act (``FAA'') enable the government to conduct \n     intelligence collection targeting persons located outside the \n     United States. The FAA provision that receives the most \n     attention is known as ``Section 702,'' which authorizes the \n     government to engage in certain forms of intelligence \n     collection targeting non-U.S. persons located overseas for \n     foreign intelligence purposes with the assistance of U.S.-\n     based electronic communication service providers. This \n     Section 702 collection is approved by the FISA Court on a \n     programmatic basis, without the need for individualized court \n     orders. Instead, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \n     and Attorney General (AG) submit annual certifications to the \n     Court for review and approval, which identify categories of \n     non-U.S. person targets located overseas.\n       Reporting Requirements Relating to Section 702: FISA \n     imposes a series reporting requirements on the AG, DNI, and \n     agencies within the Intelligence Community (IC) that utilize \n     Section 702 authorities. These include, with respect to \n     section 702:\n       Semiannual AG/DNI Assessments of Section 702. Every six \n     months, the AG and DNI are required to assess compliance with \n     the targeting and minimization procedures and the acquisition \n     guidelines adopted under Section 702. The AG and DNI are \n     further required to submit each assessment to the FISA Court \n     and the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees. \n     Section 702(l)(1) [50 U.S.C. 1881a(l)(1)].\n       IG Assessments of Section 702. The Inspector General of the \n     Department of Justice and the Inspector General of each \n     element of the intelligence community ``authorized to acquire \n     foreign intelligence information under [Section 702]'' (e.g., \n     the NSA IG) are ``authorized'' to review compliance with the \n     Section 702 targeting and minimization procedures and the \n     acquisition guidelines. Section 702(l)(2)(A) [50 U.S.C. \n     1881a(l)(2)(A)] (emphasis added).\n       In addition, the IGs are required to review ``the number of \n     disseminated intelligence reports containing a reference to a \n     United States-person identity and the number of United \n     States-person identities subsequently disseminated by the \n     element concerned in response to requests for identities that \n     were not referred to by name or title in the original \n     reporting'' and ``the number of targets that were later \n     determined to be located in the United States and, to the \n     extent possible, whether communications of such targets were \n     reviewed.'' Section 702(l)(2)(B), (C) [50 U.S.C. \n     1881a(l)(2)(B), (C)].\n       Finally, the IGs are required to provide copies of such \n     reviews to the AG, DNI, and the congressional intelligence \n     and judiciary committees. Section 702(l)(2)(D) [50 U.S.C. \n     1881a(l)(2)(D)].\n       Annual Reviews by Agency Heads of Section 702. The head of \n     each element of the intelligence community ``conducting an \n     acquisition authorized under [Section 702]'' (e.g., the \n     Director of NSA) are required to conduct annual reviews to \n     ``determine whether there is reason to believe that foreign \n     intelligence information has been or will be obtained from \n     the acquisition.'' Among other things, the annual review must \n     include:\n       (1) ``an accounting of the number of disseminated \n     intelligence reports containing a reference to a United \n     States-person identity;''\n       (2) ``an accounting of the number of United States-person \n     identities subsequently disseminated by that element in \n     response to requests for identities that were not referred to \n     by name or title in the original reporting;''\n       (3) ``the number of targets that were later determined to \n     be located in the United States and, to the extent possible, \n     whether communications of such targets were reviewed;'' and\n       (4) ``a description of any procedures developed by the head \n     of such element of the intelligence community and approved by \n     the Director of National Intelligence to assess . . . the \n     extent to which the acquisitions authorized under [Section \n     702] acquire the communications of United States persons, and \n     the results of any such assessment.''\n       The head of each element of the intelligence community that \n     conducts an annual review is also required to use the review \n     to ``evaluate the adequacy of the minimization procedures \n     utilized by such element.''\n       Finally, the head of each element of the intelligence \n     community that conducts an annual review is required to \n     provide a copy of each review to the FISA Court, AG, DNI, and \n     the congressional intelligence and judiciary committees. \n     Section 702(l)(3) [50 U.S.C. 1881a(l)(3)].\n       Semiannual AG Report on Title VII. Every 6 months, the AG \n     is required to ``fully inform'' the congressional \n     intelligence and judiciary committees ``concerning the \n     implementation'' of Title VII. This reporting requirement is \n     in addition the semiannual assessment performed under Section \n     702 and encompasses Section 703 and 704 of Title VII, as well \n     as Section 702. Among other things, each report is required \n     to include:\n       (1) certifications submitted in accordance with Section \n     702;\n       (2) justification for any exercise of the emergency \n     authority contained in Section 702;\n       (3) directives issued under Section 702;\n       (4) ``a description of the judicial review during the \n     reporting period . . . including a copy of an order or \n     pleading in connection with such review that contains a \n     significant legal interpretation of the provisions of \n     [Section 702];''\n       (5) actions taken to challenge or enforce a directive under \n     Section 702;\n       (6) compliance reviews of acquisitions authorized under \n     Section 702;\n       (7) a description of any incidents of noncompliance with \n     directives, procedures, or guidelines issued under Section \n     702; and\n       (8) the total number of applications made for orders under \n     Sections 703 and 704, as well as the total number of such \n     orders granted, modified; and denied; and the number of AG-\n\n[[Page S8393]]\n\n     authorized emergency acquisitions under these sections. \n     Section 707 [50 U.S.C. 1881f].\n       Semiannual AG Report on FISA. Every 6 months, the AG is \n     required to submit a report to the congressional intelligence \n     and judiciary committees concerning the implementation of \n     FISA. This reporting requirement comes in addition to both \n     the Section 702 semiannual assessment and the Title VII \n     semiannual report and encompasses all the provisions of the \n     Act. In addition to requirements that pertain to Titles I-V \n     of FISA, the report must include a ``summary of significant \n     legal interpretations'' involving matters before the FISA \n     Court and copies of all decisions, orders, or opinions of the \n     FISA Court that include ``significant construction or \n     interpretation'' of any provision of FISA, including Section \n     702. Section 601(a) [50 U.S.C. 1871(a)].\n       Provision of Documents Relating to Significant Construction \n     or Interpretation of FISA. Within 45 days of any decision, \n     order, or opinion issued by the FISA Court that ``includes \n     significant construction or interpretation of any provision \n     of [FISA]'' (including Section 702), the AG is required to \n     submit to the congressional intelligence and judiciary \n     committees ``a copy of the decision, order, or opinion'' and \n     any ``pleadings, applications, or memoranda of law associated \n     with such decision, order, or opinion.'' Section 601(c) [50 \n     U.S.C. 1871(c)].\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So, Mr. President, it is not a question of this \noversight not being done. I must respectfully disagree with the Senator \nfrom Oregon on that point. There is clearly rigorous oversight, and we \nhave done hearing after hearing, we have looked at report after report, \nand any Member of this body who so wishes can go and review this \nmaterial in the offices of the Intelligence Committee.\n  Now, let me talk about a protection that does exist for privacy, but \nwill expire if this bill is not passed. That is section 704. Under this \nsection, the intelligence community is required to get a specific \njudicial order before conducting surveillance on a U.S. person located \noutside the United States.\n  Before this provision was enacted in 2008 as the product of Senators \nwho were concerned--and they were listened to, and this was enacted--\nthe intelligence community could conduct intelligence collection on \nU.S. persons outside the country with only the approval of the Attorney \nGeneral but without a requirement of independent judicial review. \nSection 704 provides that judicial review by the special Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court. This will only be preserved if title \nVII of this act is reauthorized. If it isn't, the privacy provision \ngoes down with it.\n  Now, let me talk a bit more about the oversight that we have done. If \nyou listen to some, there has been little oversight, but that is not \nthe case. We have held numerous hearings with Directors of National \nIntelligence Dennis Blair and Jim Clapper; with the head of the NSA, \nGeneral Alexander; and with Bob Mueller at the FBI. We have had Eric \nHolder appear before the committee to discuss this, and we have heard \nfrom intelligence community professionals involved in carrying out \nsurveillance operations, the lawyers who review these operations, and, \nimportantly, the inspectors general who carry out oversight of the \nprogram and have written reports and letters to the Congress with the \nresults of that report.\n  The intelligence committee's review of these FAA surveillance \nauthorities has included the receipt and examination of dozens of \nreports concerning the implementation of these authorities over the \npast 4 years, which the executive branch is required to provide by law. \nWe have received and scrutinized all the classified opinions of the \ncourt that interpret the law in a significant way.\n  Finally, our staff has held countless briefings with officials from \nthe NSA, the DOJ, the Office of the DNI, and the FISA Court itself, \nincluding the FBI. Collectively, these assessments, reports, and other \ninformation obtained by the Intelligence Committee demonstrate that the \ngovernment implements the FAA surveillance authorities in a responsible \nmanner, with relatively few incidents of noncompliance.\n  Let me say this. Where such incidents of noncompliance have arisen, \nthey have been inadvertent. They have not been intentional. They have \nbeen the result of human error or technical defect, and they have been \npromptly reported and remedied. That is important. Through 4 years of \noversight, from all these reports, from all the meetings, from all the \nhearings, we have not identified a single case in which a government \nofficial engaged in a willful effort to circumvent or violate the law.\n  Keep in mind the oversight performed by Congress--that is, both \nHouses--and the FISA court comes in addition to the extensive internal \noversight of the implementation that is performed by the Department of \nJustice, the Director of National Intelligence, and multiple IGs.\n  There is a view by some that this country no longer needs to fear \nattack. I don't share that view, and I have asked the intelligence \ncommittee staff to compile arrests that have been made in the last 4 \nyears in America on terrorist plots that have been stopped. There are \n100 arrests that have been made between 2009 and 2012. There have been \n16 individuals arrested just this year alone. Let me quickly review \nsome of these plots. Some of these may arrests come about as a result \nof this program. Again, if Members want to see the specific cases where \nFISA Amendments Act authorities were used, they can go and look at the \nclassified background of these cases.\n  First, in November, 1 month ago, two arrests for conspiracy to \nprovide material support to terrorists and use a weapon of mass \ndestruction. That was Raees Alam Qazi and Sheheryar Alam Qazi. They \nwere arrested by the FBI in Fort Lauderdale, FL. The next case is \nanother conspiracy to provide material support. Arrested were Ralph \nDeleon, Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales and Arifeen David Gojali. \nThese three men were planning to travel to Afghanistan to attend \nterrorist training and commit violent jihad; third, was a plot to bomb \nthe New York Federal Reserve Bank; fourth, a plot to bomb a downtown \nChicago bar; fifth, a conspiracy to provide material support to the \nIslamic Jihad Union; sixth, a plot to carry out a suicide bomb attack \nagainst the U.S. Capitol in February of 2012; seventh, a plot to bomb \nlocations in Tampa, FL; eighth, a plot to bomb New York City targets \nand troops returning from combat overseas; ninth, a plot to assassinate \nthe Saudi Ambassador to the United States; and it goes on and on and \non.\n  So I believe the FISA Amendments Act is important and these cases \nshow the program has worked. As the years go on, I believe good \nintelligence is the most important way to prevent these attacks.\n  Information gained through programs such as this one--and through \nother sources as well--is able to be used to prevent future attacks. \nSo, in the past 4 years, there have been 100 arrests to prevent \nsomething from happening in the United States, some of these plots have \nbeen thwarted because of this program. I think it is a vital program. \nWe are doing our level best to conduct good oversight and keep abreast \nof the details of the program and to see that these reports come in. I \nhave tried to satisfy Senator Wyden but apparently have been unable to \ndo so.\n  I am hopeful the Senate Intelligence Committee's 13-to-2 vote to \nreauthorize this important legislation will be considered by all \nMembers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Statement \nof Administrative Policy on the House bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n       H.R. 5949--FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012\n\n          (Rep. Smith, R-TX, and 5 cosponsors, Sept. 10, 2012)\n\n       The Administration strongly supports H.R. 5949. The bill \n     would reauthorize Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act (FISA), which expires at the end of this \n     year. Title VII of FISA allows the Intelligence Community to \n     collect vital foreign intelligence information about \n     international terrorists and other important targets \n     overseas, while providing protection for the civil liberties \n     and privacy of Americans. Intelligence collection under Title \n     VII has produced and continues to produce significant \n     information that is vital to defend the Nation against \n     international terrorism and other threats. The Administration \n     looks forward to working with the Congress to ensure the \n     continued availability of this critical intelligence \n     capability.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It states that the administration strongly supports \nH.R. 5949, and it goes on to say what the bill\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n\nwould do. It says it is vital and it produced and continues to produce \nsignificant information that is vital to defend the Nation against \ninternational terrorism and other threats.\n  I am very hopeful this bill will pass without amendment and thereupon \ncan go directly to the President for signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n                                          Inspector General of the\n\n\n                                       Intelligence Community,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2012.\n     Hon.

On 21 May 2012, I informed you that the \n     NSA Inspector General, George Ellard, would be taking the \n     lead on the requested feasibility assessment, as his office \n     could provide an expedited response to this important \n     inquiry.\n       The NSA IG provided a classified response on 6 June 2012. I \n     defer to his conclusion that obtaining such an estimate was \n     beyond the capacity of his office and dedicating sufficient \n     additional resources would likely impede the NSA's mission. \n     He further stated that his office and NSA leadership agreed \n     that an IG review of the sort suggested would itself violate \n     the privacy of U.S. persons.\n       As I stated in my confirmation hearing and as we have \n     specifically discussed, I firmly believe that oversight of \n     intelligence collection is a proper function of an Inspector \n     General. I will continue to work with you and the Committee \n     to identify ways that we can enhance our ability to conduct \n     effective oversight. If you have any questions concerning \n     this response, please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n\n\n                                   I.

Dick Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senators: (U) Thank you for your July 26, 2012 letter \n     on the FISA Amendments Act (FAA). As you noted, \n     reauthorization of FAA is an extremely high priority for the \n     Administration. The FAA authorities have proved to be an \n     invaluable asset in our effort to detect and prevent threats \n     to our nation and our allies.\n       The members of the Intelligence Community and I appreciate \n     the need for Congress to be fully informed about this statute \n     as it considers reauthorization. We have repeatedly reported \n     to the Intelligence and Judiciary committees of both the \n     House and Senate how we have implemented the statute, the \n     operational value it has afforded, and the extensive measures \n     we take to ensure that the Government's use of these \n     authorities comports with the Constitution and the laws of \n     the United States. Our record of transparency with the \n     Congress includes many formal briefings and hearings, \n     numerous written notifications and reports, and countless \n     hours that our legal, operational, and compliance experts \n     have spent in detailed discussions, briefings, and \n     demonstrations with committee staff and counsel. In addition, \n     we have provided classified and unclassified white papers, \n     available to any Member of Congress, detailing how the law is \n     implemented, the robust oversight involved, and the nature \n     and value of the resulting collection.\n       (U) This extensive history of interaction with Congress has \n     included discussions, within the past several months, of the \n     issues raised in your letter of July 26. We have met at \n     length with committee staff and counsel to discuss the legal \n     and operational parameters associated with use of FAA 702. \n     With the benefit of this information, the committees have \n     reported FAA reauthorization legislation. We urge that it be \n     brought to the floor of the Senate and House, and enacted \n     without amendment as proposed by the Administration at the \n     earliest possible date.\n       This degree of transparency with Congress has been possible \n     because these hearings, briefings, reports, and discussion \n     have generally been classified. The issues you have raised \n     cannot be accurately and thoroughly addressed in an \n     unclassified setting without revealing intelligence sources \n     and methods, which would defeat the very purpose for which \n     the laws were enacted. It remains vitally important to avoid \n     public disclosure of sources and methods with respect to \n     section 702 in order to protect the efficacy of this \n     important provision for collecting foreign intelligence \n     information.\n       (U) The ability to discuss these issues in a classified \n     setting allows us to be completely transparent with Congress \n     on behalf of the American people. We are committed to \n     continuing that transparency. Although a meaningful and \n     accurate unclassified response to the important questions you \n     have asked is not possible. I am enclosing a classified \n     response that addresses your questions in detail.\n       (U) That said, there is a point in your letter I would like \n     to address directly. I strongly take exception to the \n     suggestion that there is a ``loophole'' in the current law \n     concerning access to communications collected under section \n     702 of the FAA. While our collection methods are classified, \n     the basic standards for that collection are a matter of \n     public law:\n       Section 702 only permits targeting of non-U.S. persons \n     reasonably believed to be located outside of the United \n     States. It does not permit targeting of U.S. persons anywhere \n     in the world, or of any person inside the United States.\n       Section 702 prohibits so-called ``reverse targeting''--\n     targeting a person located outside the United States as a \n     pretext when the real goal is to target a person inside the \n     United States.\n       Section 702 prohibits the intentional acquisition of any \n     communication when all communicants are known at the time of \n     acquisition to be within the United States.\n       (U) In enacting these standards for collection, Congress \n     understood that some communications of U.S. persons would be \n     incidentally acquired, and the statute therefore specifies \n     minimization procedures that restrict that acquisition, \n     retention, and dissemination of any information about U.S. \n     persons. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is \n     required by statute to ensure that those procedures are both \n     reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the above \n     limitations and consistent with the Fourth Amendment. In \n     addition, components of the Executive Branch, including both \n     my office and the Department of Justice, regularly assess \n     compliance with the targeting and minimization procedures. \n     Finally, the Intelligence Committees have been fully briefed \n     on both the law and how the government collects and uses \n     information under section 702. In short, there is no loophole \n     in the law.\n       (U) As the legislation comes up for floor consideration, we \n     would welcome the opportunity to meet with any Senator or \n     appropriately cleared staff member to address these issues in \n     a classified setting. I have asked Kathleen Turner, Director \n     of my Office of Legislative Affairs, to contact your offices \n     to try to schedule a briefing.\n       (U) I appreciate your taking the time to share your views \n     with me, and I look forward to working with you to ensure \n     that Congress has a full understanding of these and any other \n     concerns you may have as the Senate considers legislation to \n     reauthorize the FAA this fall.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James R. Clapper.\n       Enclosure.\n       UNCLASSIFIED upon removal of Enclosure.\n\n[[Page S8395]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n         Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and \n           United States Department of Justice\n                                     Washington, DC, Feb. 8, 2012.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, United States House of Representatives, Washington, \n         DC\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosim\n     Democratic Leader, United States House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leaders Reid, Pelosi, and \n     McConnell: we are writing to urge that the Congress \n     reauthorize Title VII of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act (FISA) enacted by the FISA Amendments Act of \n     2008 (FAA), which is set to expire at the end of this year. \n     Title VII of FISA allows the Intelligence Community to \n     collect vital information about international terrorists and \n     other important targets overseas. Reauthorizing this \n     authority is the top legislative priority of the Intelligence \n     Community.\n       One provision, section 702, authorizes surveillance \n     directed at non-U.S. persons located overseas who are of \n     foreign intelligence importance. At the same time, it \n     provides a comprehensive regime of oversight by all three \n     branches of Government to protect the privacy and civil \n     liberties of U.S. persons. Under section 702, the Attorney \n     General and the Director of National Intelligence may \n     authorize annually, with the approval of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), intelligence \n     collection targeting categories of non-U.S. persons abroad, \n     without the need for a court order for each individual \n     target. Within this framework, no acquisition may \n     intentionally target a U.S. person, here or abroad, or any \n     other person known to be in the United States. The law \n     requires special procedures designed to ensure that all such \n     acquisitions target only non-U.S. persons outside the United \n     States, and to protect the privacy of U.S. persons whose \n     nonpublic information may be incidentally acquired. The \n     Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of \n     National Intelligence conduct extensive oversight reviews of \n     section 702 activities at least once every sixty days, and \n     Title VII requires us to report to the Congress on \n     implementation and compliance twice a year.\n       A separate provision of Title VII requires that \n     surveillance directed at U.S. persons overseas be approved by \n     the FISC in each individual case, based on a finding that \n     there is probable cause to believe that the target is a \n     foreign power or an agent, officer, or employee of a foreign \n     power. Before the enactment of the FAA, the Attorney General \n     could authorize such collection without court approval. This \n     provision thus increases the protection given to U.S. \n     persons.\n       The attached background paper provides additional \n     unclassified information on the structure, operation and \n     oversight of Title VII of FISA.\n       Intelligence collection under Title VII has produced and \n     continues to produce significant intelligence that is vital \n     to protect the nation against international terrorism and \n     other threats. We welcome the opportunity to provide \n     additional information to members concerning these \n     authorities in a classified setting. We are always \n     considering whether there are changes that could be made to \n     improve the law in a manner consistent with the privacy and \n     civil liberties interests of Americans. Our first priority, \n     however, is reauthorization of these authorities in their \n     current form. We look forward to working with you to ensure \n     the speedy enactment of legislation reauthorizing Title VII, \n     without amendment, to avoid any interruption in our use of \n     these authorities to protect the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n     James R. Clapper,\n       Director of National Intelligence.\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Background Paper on Title VII of FISA Prepared by the Department of \n   Justice and the Office of Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)\n\n       This paper describes the provisions of Title VII of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) that were added \n     by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA). Title VII has \n     proven to be an extremely valuable authority in protecting \n     our nation from terrorism and other national security \n     threats. Title VII is set to expire at the end of this year, \n     and its reauthorization is the top legislative priority of \n     the Intelligence Community.\n       The FAA added a new section 702 to FISA, permitting the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to approve \n     surveillance of terrorist suspects and other foreign \n     intelligence targets who are non-U.S. persons outside the \n     United States, without the need for individualized court \n     orders. Section 702 includes a series of protections and \n     oversight measures to safeguard the privacy and civil \n     liberties interests of U.S. persons. FISA continues to \n     include its original electronic surveillance provisions, \n     meaning that, in most cases, an individualized court order, \n     based on probable cause that the target is a foreign power or \n     an agent of a foreign power, is still required to conduct \n     electronic surveillance of targets inside the United States. \n     Indeed, other provisions of Title VII extend these \n     protections to U.S. persons overseas. The extensive oversight \n     measures used to implement these authorities demonstrate that \n     the Government has used this capability in the manner \n     contemplated by Congress, taking great care to protect \n     privacy and civil liberties interests.\n       This paper begins by describing how section 702 works, its \n     importance to the Intelligence Community, and its extensive \n     oversight provisions. Next, it turns briefly to the other \n     changes made to FISA by the FAA, including section 704, which \n     requires an order from the FISC before the Government may \n     engage in surveillance targeted at U.S. persons overseas. \n     Third, this paper describes the reporting to Congress that \n     the Executive Branch has done under Title VII of FISA. \n     Finally, this paper explains why the Administration believes \n     it is essential that Congress reauthorize Title VII.\n\n\n1. Section 702 provides valuable foreign intelligence information about \nterrorists and other targets overseas, while protecting the privacy and \n                      civil liberties of Americans\n\n       Section 702 permits the FISC to approve surveillance of \n     terrorist suspects and other targets who are non-U.S. persons \n     outside the United States, without the need for \n     individualized court orders. The FISC may approve \n     surveillance of these kinds of targets when the Government \n     needs the assistance of an electronic communications service \n     provider.\n       Before the enactment of the FAA and its predecessor \n     legislation, in order to conduct the kind of surveillance \n     authorized by section 702, FISA was interpreted to require \n     that the Government show on an individualized basis, with \n     respect to all non-U.S. person targets located overseas, that \n     there was probable cause to believe that the target was a \n     foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, and to obtain \n     an order from the FISC approving the surveillance on this \n     basis. In effect, the Intelligence Community treated non-U.S. \n     persons located overseas like persons in the United States, \n     even though foreigners outside the United States generally \n     are not entitled to the protections of the Fourth Amendment. \n     Although FISA's original procedures are proper for electronic \n     surveillance of persons inside this country, such a process \n     for surveillance of terrorist suspects overseas can slow, or \n     even prevent, the Government's acquisition of vital \n     information, without enhancing the privacy interests of \n     Americans. Since its enactment in 2008, section 702 has \n     significantly increased the Government's ability to act \n     quickly.\n       Under section 702, instead of issuing individual court \n     orders, the FISC approves annual certifications submitted by \n     the Attorney General and the DNI that identify categories of \n     foreign intelligence targets. The provision contains a number \n     of important protections for U.S. persons and others in the \n     United States. First, the Attorney General and the DNI must \n     certify that a significant purpose of the acquisition is to \n     obtain foreign intelligence information. Second, an \n     acquisition may not intentionally target a U.S. person. \n     Third, it may not intentionally target any person known at \n     the time of acquisition to be in the United States. Fourth, \n     it may not target someone outside the United States for the \n     purpose of targeting a particular, known person in this \n     country. Fifth, section 702 prohibits the intentional \n     acquisition of ``any communication as to which the sender and \n     all intended recipients are known at the time of the \n     acquisition'' to be in the United States. Finally, it \n     requires that any acquisition be consistent with the Fourth \n     Amendment.\n       To implement these provisions, section 702 requires \n     targeting procedures, minimization procedures, and \n     acquisition guidelines. The targeting procedures are designed \n     to ensure that an acquisition only targets persons outside \n     the United States, and that it complies with the restriction \n     on acquiring wholly domestic communications. The minimization \n     procedures protect the identities of U.S. persons, and any \n     nonpublic information concerning them that may be \n     incidentally acquired. The acquisition guidelines seek to \n     ensure compliance with all of the limitations of section 702 \n     described above, and to ensure that the Government files an \n     application with the FISC when required by FISA.\n       The FISC reviews the targeting and minimization procedures \n     for compliance with the requirements of both the statute and \n     the Fourth Amendment. Although the FISC does not approve the \n     acquisition guidelines, it receives them, as do the \n     appropriate congressional committees. By approving the \n     certifications submitted by the Attorney General and the DNI \n     as well as by approving the targeting and minimization \n     procedures, the FISC plays a major role in ensuring that \n     acquisitions under section 702 are conducted in a lawful and \n     appropriate manner.\n       Section 702 is vital in keeping the nation safe. It \n     provides information about the plans and identities of \n     terrorists, allowing us to glimpse inside terrorist \n     organizations and obtain information about how those groups \n     function and receive support. In addition, it lets us collect \n     information about the intentions and capabilities of weapons \n     proliferators and other foreign adversaries who threaten the \n     United States. Failure to reauthorize section 702 would \n     result in a loss of significant intelligence and impede the \n     ability of the Intelligence Community to respond quickly to \n     new threats and intelligence opportunities. Although this \n     unclassified paper cannot discuss more specifically the \n     nature of the information acquired under\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\n     section 702 or its significance, the Intelligence Community \n     is prepared to provide Members of Congress with detailed \n     classified briefings as appropriate.\n       The Executive Branch is committed to ensuring that its use \n     of section 702 is consistent with the law, the FISC's orders, \n     and the privacy and civil liberties interests of U.S. \n     persons. The Intelligence Community, the Department of \n     Justice, and the FISC all oversee the use of section 702. In \n     addition, congressional committees conduct essential \n     oversight, which is discussed in section 3 below.\n       Oversight of activities conducted under section 702 begins \n     with components in the intelligence agencies themselves, \n     including their Inspectors General. The targeting procedures, \n     described above, seek to ensure that an acquisition targets \n     only persons outside the United States and that it complies \n     with section 702's restriction on acquiring wholly domestic \n     communications. For example, the targeting procedures for the \n     National Security Agency (NSA) require training of agency \n     analysts, and audits of the databases they use. NSA's Signals \n     Intelligence Directorate also conducts other oversight \n     activities, including spot checks of targeting decisions. \n     With the strong support of Congress, NSA has established a \n     compliance office, which is responsible for developing, \n     implementing, and monitoring a comprehensive mission \n     compliance program.\n       Agencies using section 702 authority must report promptly \n     to the Department of Justice and ODNI incidents of \n     noncompliance with the targeting or minimization procedures \n     or the acquisition guidelines. Attorneys in the National \n     Security Division (NSD) of the Department routinely review \n     the agencies' targeting decisions. At least once every 60 \n     days, NSD and ODNI conduct oversight of the agencies' \n     activities under section 702. These reviews are normally \n     conducted on-site by a joint team from NSD and ODNI. The team \n     evaluates and, where appropriate, investigates each potential \n     incident of noncompliance, and conducts a detailed review of \n     agencies' targeting and minimization decisions.\n       Using the reviews by Department of Justice and ODNI \n     personnel, the Attorney General and the DNI conduct a semi-\n     annual assessment, as required by section 702, of compliance \n     with the targeting and minimization procedures and the \n     acquisition guidelines. The assessments have found that \n     agencies have ``continued to implement the procedures and \n     follow the guidelines in a manner that reflects a focused \n     and concerted effort by agency personnel to comply with \n     the requirements of Section 702.'' The reviews have not \n     found ``any intentional attempt to circumvent or violate'' \n     legal requirements. Rather, agency personnel ``are \n     appropriately focused on directing their efforts at non-\n     United States persons reasonably believed to be located \n     outside the United States.''\n       Section 702 thus enables the Government to collect \n     information effectively and efficiently about foreign targets \n     overseas and in a manner that protects the privacy and civil \n     liberties of Americans. Through rigorous oversight, the \n     Government is able to evaluate whether changes are needed to \n     the procedures or guidelines, and what other steps may be \n     appropriate to safeguard the privacy of personal information. \n     In addition, the Department of Justice provides the joint \n     assessments and other reports to the FISC. The FISC has been \n     actively involved in the review of section 702 collection. \n     Together, all of these mechanisms ensure thorough and \n     continuous oversight of section 702 activities.\n\n\n   2. Other important provisions of Title VII of FISA also should be \n                              reauthorized\n\n       In contrast to section 702, which focuses on foreign \n     targets, section 704 provides heightened protection for \n     collection activities conducted overseas and directed against \n     U.S. persons located outside the United States. Section 704 \n     requires an order from the FISC in circumstances in which the \n     target has ``a reasonable expectation of privacy and a \n     warrant would be required if the acquisition were conducted \n     inside the United States for law enforcement purposes.'' It \n     also requires a showing of probable cause that the targeted \n     U.S. person is ``a foreign power, an agent of a foreign \n     power, or an officer or employee of a foreign power.'' \n     Previously, these activities were outside the scope of FISA \n     and governed exclusively by section 2.5 of Executive Order \n     12333. By requiring the approval of the FISC, section 704 \n     enhanced the civil liberties of U.S. persons.\n       The FAA also added several other provisions to FISA. \n     Section 703 complements section 704 and permits the FISC to \n     authorize an application targeting a U.S. person outside the \n     United States to acquire foreign intelligence information, if \n     the acquisition constitutes electronic surveillance or the \n     acquisition of stored electronic communications or data, and \n     is conducted in the United States. Because the target is a \n     U.S. person, section 703 requires an individualized court \n     order and a showing of probable cause that the target is a \n     foreign power, an agent of a foreign power, or an officer or \n     employee of a foreign power. Other sections of Title VII \n     allow the Government to obtain various authorities \n     simultaneously, govern the use of information in litigation, \n     and provide for congressional oversight. Section 708 \n     clarifies that nothing in Title VII is intended to limit the \n     Government's ability to obtain authorizations under other \n     parts of FISA.\n\n\n    3. Congress has been kept fully informed, and conducts vigorous \n                oversight, of Title VII's implementation\n\n       FISA imposes substantial reporting requirements on the \n     Government to ensure effective congressional oversight of \n     these authorities. Twice a year, the Attorney General must \n     ``fully inform, in a manner consistent with national \n     security,'' the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees about \n     the implementation of Title VII. With respect to section 702, \n     this semi-annual report must include copies of certifications \n     and significant FISC pleadings and orders. It also must \n     describe any compliance incidents, any use of emergency \n     authorities, and the FISC's review of the Government's \n     pleadings. With respect to sections 703 and 704, the report \n     must include the number of applications made, and the number \n     granted, modified, or denied by the FISC.\n       Section 702 requires the Government to provide to the \n     Intelligence and Judiciary Committees its assessment of \n     compliance with the targeting and minimization procedures and \n     the acquisition guidelines. In addition, Title VI of FISA \n     requires a summary of significant legal interpretations of \n     FISA in matters before the FISC or the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court of Review. The requirement extends to \n     interpretations presented in applications or pleadings filed \n     with either court by the Department of Justice. In addition \n     to the summary, the Department must provide copies of \n     judicial decisions that include significant interpretations \n     of FISA within 45 days.\n       The Government has complied with the substantial reporting \n     requirements imposed by FISA to ensure effective \n     congressional oversight of these authorities. The Government \n     has informed the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of \n     acquisitions authorized under section 702; reported, in \n     detail, on the results of the reviews and on compliance \n     incidents and remedial efforts; made all written reports on \n     these reviews available to the Committees; and provided \n     summaries of significant interpretations of FISA, as well as \n     copies of relevant judicial opinions and pleadings.\n\n\n   4. It is essential that Title VII of FISA be reauthorized well in \n                       advance of its expiration\n\n       The Administration strongly supports the reauthorization of \n     Title VII of FISA. It was enacted after many months of \n     bipartisan effort and extensive debate. Since its enactment, \n     Executive Branch officials have provided extensive \n     information to Congress on the Government's use of Title VII, \n     including reports, testimony, and numerous briefings for \n     Members and their staffs. This extensive record demonstrates \n     the proven value of these authorities, and the commitment of \n     the Government to their lawful and responsible use.\n       Reauthorization will ensure continued certainty with the \n     rules used by Government employees and our private partners. \n     The Intelligence Community has invested significant human and \n     financial resources to enable its personnel and technological \n     systems to acquire and review vital data quickly and \n     lawfully. Our adversaries, of course, seek to hide the most \n     important information from us. It is at best inefficient and \n     at worst unworkable for agencies to develop new technologies \n     and procedures and train employees, only to have a statutory \n     framework subject to wholesale revision. This is particularly \n     true at a time of limited resources. It is essential that \n     these authorities remain in place without interruption--and \n     without the threat of interruption--so that those who have \n     been entrusted with their use can continue to protect our \n     nation from its enemies.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the reauthorization of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act, also known as the FISA \nAmendments Act, is a crucial authority for the U.S. Intelligence \nCommunity. Unless we act to pass this legislation, the law will expire \nin just a few days from now. It must be reauthorized immediately for a \n5-year period.\n  I am familiar with the FISA Amendments Act, FAA, through my role as \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, which along with the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, has jurisdiction over this legislation and \noversight of the intelligence operations conducted by the Department of \nJustice and Federal Bureau of Investigation. During the last year, my \nstaff and I have engaged in extensive consultation with the \nintelligence community and the Department of Justice to understand how \nthe FAA has been used. The committee held a closed hearing with witness \ntestimony and questions from Senators as well.\n  We debated this legislation in committee where I opposed the version \nproduced by the Judiciary Committee which is now the basis of the Leahy \namendment. I opposed it because I have learned a great deal both about \nthe value of the intelligence collected under the FAA and about the \nlengths that the intelligence community goes to protect the rights of \nU.S. citizens when collecting that intelligence.\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\nGiven the congressional oversight of this legislation, coupled with the \nbuilt-in protections and oversight from the executive branch, the value \nof the intelligence gathered by this important legislation warrants \nreauthorization without the changes made by the Leahy amendment.\n  The most important portion of the FAA is Section 702. It authorizes, \nwith approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, FISC, an \n11-member panel of Article III judges appointed by the Supreme Court, \nelectronic surveillance of non-U.S. persons located overseas, but \nwithout the need for individualized orders for every target of the \nsurveillance, as is required for surveillance of anyone inside the \nUnited States. The law specifically prohibits targeting U.S. persons, \nacquiring wholly domestic communications, or targeting someone outside \nthe U.S. with the intent to collect information on a target inside the \nU.S. known as ``reverse-targeting''.\n  It is possible that the communications of some U.S. citizens may be \ncaptured during the conduct of authorized surveillance. But that is \nonly incidentally. The only way that a U.S. person's communication \nwould be picked up would be if that person were in communication with a \nnon-U.S. person overseas who had been targeted under the FAA.\n  Some people think that a U.S. person has a constitutional right not \nto have his communications with a foreign target eavesdropped by the \nU.S. government without a warrant. But that's not how the fourth \namendment works. It protects the rights of the person who is being \ntargeted, not anyone in contact with him. For example, if the \ngovernment legally taps the phone of a mafia godfather in the United \nStates, it can listen to his conversation with anyone who calls him. It \ndoesn't need a court-issued warrant for the person calling, only for \nthe godfather himself. He is the one who has a reasonable expectation \nof privacy in his telephone.\n  In the same way, when the government legally intercepts the \ncommunications of a terrorist living overseas, it can listen to his \nconversation with anyone who contacts him, even if the other party is \nin the United States. What matters is whether the government has the \nlegal authority to intercept the communications of the terrorist in the \nfirst place. That's what the FAA provides. It is important to point out \nthat no warrant is required because the target is not a U.S. citizen \nand is located overseas. So, the fourth amendment doesn't apply to him.\n  Instead, under Section 702, the FISC approves annual certifications \nfrom the attorney general and director of National Intelligence about \ncollection of information on categories of foreign intelligence \ntargets, what procedures the intelligence community will use to \naccomplish this surveillance, how they will target subjects for \nsurveillance, and how the IC will use the information. The government \nmust also demonstrate to the court that it has special procedures to \nweed out intentional collection of communications of anyone located \ninside the United States and to minimize the use of any incidentally \ncollected information.\n  In addition, there is significant oversight of the program to protect \nU.S. citizens' rights. The law requires that the Attorney General and \ndirector of National Intelligence conduct semi-annual assessments of \nthe surveillance activities. Furthermore, it authorizes the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Justice to review the program at any time. \nBoth houses of Congress are provided the semi-annual reports and IG \naudits, as well as significant decisions of the FISC. These are on file \nwith the Senate security office and any Senator and appropriately \ncleared staff can review them.\n  This process works. Our oversight of the implementation of the \nstatute has found no evidence that it has been intentionally misused in \norder to eavesdrop on Americans. Senator Feinstein, chair of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, and even Senator Leahy, chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, have stated that no such misconduct has been \ndiscovered.\n  For these reasons, we should reauthorize the statute without any \nchanges, as the House has done. The only adjustment to the existing \nstatute in the House bill is replacing the expiration date of December \n31, 2012 with December 31, 2017, a 5-year period. That is also what the \nadministration supports and what the intelligence committee passed this \nsummer. A 5-year period would allow the intelligence community to \ncontinue utilizing these valuable tools against potential terrorists or \nother intelligence targets without interruption or delay. It will \nprovide the intelligence community with much needed certainty and \nstability in a program that works to save American lives.\n  The combination of the statutory limitations on collection, targeting \nand minimization procedures, and acquisition guidelines, court review \nof those procedures and guidelines, and compliance oversight by the \nadministration and Congress, ensure that the rights of U.S. persons are \nsufficiently protected when their communications are incidentally \ncollected in the course of targeting non-U.S. persons located abroad.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the House passed version of the FAA \nreauthorization so we can ensure that there is no interruption in one \nof our most vital national security tools.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3435\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3435.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Attorney General to disclose each decision, \n  order, or opinion of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that \nincludes significant legal interpretation of section 501 or 702 of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 unless such disclosure is \n      not in the national security interest of the United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _.

115 Stat. 287), \n     authorizes the Federal Bureau of Investigation to require the \n     production of ``any tangible things'' and the extent of such \n     authority, as interpreted by secret court opinions, has been \n     concealed from the knowledge and awareness of the people of \n     the United States.\n       (8) In 2010, the Department of Justice and the Office of \n     the Director of National Intelligence established a process \n     to review and declassify opinions of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court, but more than two years later no \n     declassifications have been made.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     each decision, order, or opinion issued by the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court of Review that includes significant \n     construction or interpretation of section 501 or section 702 \n     of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 \n     U.S.C. 1861 and 1881a) should be declassified in a manner \n     consistent with the protection of national security, \n     intelligence sources and methods, and other properly \n     classified and sensitive information.\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\n       (c) Requirement for Disclosures.--\n       (1) Section 501.--\n       (A) In general.--Section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Disclosure of Decisions.--\n       ``(1) Decision defined.--In this subsection, the term \n     `decision' means any decision, order, or opinion issued by \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review that includes \n     significant construction or interpretation of this section.\n       ``(2) Requirement for disclosure.--Subject to paragraphs \n     (3) and (4), the Attorney General shall declassify and make \n     available to the public--\n       ``(A) each decision that is required to be submitted to \n     committees of Congress under section 601(c), not later than \n     45 days after such opinion is issued;

Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the concerns I and many of my \ncolleagues have.\n  Earlier this morning, Senator Wyden, the senior Senator from Oregon, \nwas discussing at length the importance of the fourth amendment, the \nimportance of Americans knowing the boundaries and the rules under \nwhich our government collects intelligence and to know their rights to \nprivacy are protected.\n  Under this Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, there are a variety \nof ways in which that assurance is compromised, and Senator Wyden did a \nvery good job of laying those out. I wish to emphasize that same \nmessage; that our country was founded on the principles of privacy and \nliberty, of protection from an overreaching central government.\n  During the founding, we set out and said we are going to be a new \nkind of nation; one that will not permit an overbearing, intrusive \ngovernment spying on citizens or meddling in their private affairs. \nThis belief was enshrined in our fourth amendment:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\n  I think that is an extraordinarily complete description saying that \nthe government is bound--bound--by having to demonstrate before a court \nprobable cause a case that is put forward and backed up by oath or \naffirmation, a case that is put forward with great detail about the \nplaces to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.\n  So the concept is laid out very clearly about what constitutes \nunreasonable searches and seizures. It is certainly not that the \ngovernment can't collect information, just they have to show probable \ncause of a crime in order to create that boundary that says the \ninformation we have in our daily lives. I don't know how much broader \nit can be than houses, papers, and effects. It pretty much covers the \nentire parameter.\n  One of the problems we have is that sometimes lawyers start looking \nfor loopholes, and we can address those loopholes if they are discussed \nin a public setting, if we can get our hands around them. But if they \nare loopholes created in secrecy, then indeed it is very hard to have a \ndebate on the floor of the Senate about whether those loopholes or \ninterpretations are right or whether we should change the law in order \nto address them.\n  Of course, our laws have had to be updated and changed over time to \nadapt to new technology and changing threats, and one of those \ndevelopments was the creation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct in the 1970s.\n  In 1972, the Supreme Court held the fourth amendment does not permit \nwarrantless surveillance for intelligence investigations within our \ncountry. One may wonder how this even took a Supreme Court decision \nsince the fourth amendment is so absolutely clear on this point.\n  In 1978, Congress enacted FISA--Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct--to regulate government surveillance within our country that is \nconducted for foreign intelligence purposes. Under FISA, the government \nhad to obtain an order from a special court called the FISA Court in \norder to spy on Americans. This is certainly an appropriate boundary to \nimplement. The order required the government to obtain a warrant and \nshow probable cause. These are the same basic, commonsense protections \nwe have had in place for other types of searches. This development \nrequired individualized and particular orders from the FISA Court to \ncollect communications.\n  But now let's fast forward to 2001. President Bush decided in secret \nto authorize the National Security Agency to start a new program of \nwarrantless surveillance inside the United States. This is in complete \ncontravention of the fourth amendment and in complete contravention of \nthe law at that time. As I am sure many of my colleagues will certainly \nrecall, this was revealed to the American people 4 years later when it \nwas reported in the New York Times in 2005. In response, after years of \nback and forth contentious debate, Congress passed the FISA Amendments \nAct--the bill we are considering on this floor today. We are \nconsidering a reauthorization. This law gave the government new \nsurveillance authority but also included a sunset provision to ensure \nthat Congress examines where the law is working and the way it was \nintended.\n\n  The debate we are having right now on this floor is that \nreexamination. I will note that I think it is unfortunate that we are \ndoing this at the last second. We have known that this intelligence law \nis going to expire for years. It was laid out for a multiyear span.\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\nCertainly, it is irresponsible for this Chamber to be debating this \nbill under a falsely created pressure that it needs to be done without \nany amendments in order to match the bill from the House. That is a way \nof suppressing debate on critical issues here in America.\n  If you care about the fourth amendment, if you care about privacy, \nyou should be arguing that we should either create a very short-term \nextension in order to have this debate fully or that we should have had \nthis debate months ago so it could have been done in a full and \nresponsible manner, with no pressure to vote against amendments in \norder to falsely address the issue of partnering with the House bill.\n  This law included that sunset provision. Now here we are looking at \nthe extension. It is a single-day debate, crowded here into the \nholidays when few Americans will be paying attention. But I think it is \nimportant, nonetheless, for those of us who are concerned about the \nboundaries of privacy and believe the law could be strengthened to make \nour case here in hopes that at some point we will be able to have the \nreal consideration these issues merit.\n  In my opinion, there are serious reforms that need to be made before \nwe consider renewing this law. This law is supposed to be about giving \nour government the tools it needs to collect the communications of \nforeigners, outside of our country. If it is possible that our \nintelligence agencies are using the law to collect and use the \ncommunications of Americans without a warrant, that is a problem. Of \ncourse, we cannot reach conclusions about that in this forum because \nthis is an unclassified discussion.\n  My colleagues Senator Wyden and Senator Udall, who serve on \nIntelligence, have discussed the loophole in the current law that \nallows the potential of backdoor searches. This could allow the \ngovernment to effectively use warrantless searches for law-abiding \nAmericans. Senator Wyden has an amendment that relates to closing that \nloophole.\n  Congress never intended the intelligence community to have a huge \ndatabase to sift through without first getting a regular probable cause \nwarrant, but because we do not have the details of exactly how this \nproceeds and we cannot debate in a public forum those details, then we \nare stuck with wrestling with the fact that we need to have the sorts \nof protections and efforts to close loopholes that Senator Wyden has \nput forward.\n  What we do know is that this past summer, the Director of National \nIntelligence said in a public forum that on at least one occasion the \nFISA Court has ruled that a data collection carried out by the \ngovernment did violate the fourth amendment. We also know that the FISA \nCourt has ruled that the Federal Government has circumvented the spirit \nof the law as well as the letter of the law. But too much else of what \nwe should know about this law remains secret. In fact, we have \nextremely few details about how the courts have interpreted the \nstatutes that have been declassified and released to the public. This \ngoes to the issue of secret law my colleague from Oregon was discussing \nearlier. If you have a phrase in the law and it has been interpreted by \na secret court and the interpretation is secret, then you really do not \nknow what the law means.\n  The FISA Court is a judicial body established by Congress to consider \nrequests for surveillance made under the FISA Amendments Act, but, \nalmost without exception, its decisions, including significant legal \ninterpretations of the statute, remain highly classified. They remain \nsecret.\n  I am going to put up this chart just to emphasize that this is a big \ndeal. Here in America, if the law makes a reference to what the \nboundary is, we should understand how the court interprets that \nboundary so it can be debated. If the court reaches an interpretation \nwith which Congress is uncomfortable, we should be able to change that, \nbut of course we cannot change it, not knowing what the interpretation \nis because the interpretation is secret. So we are certainly \nconstrained from having the type of debate that our Nation was founded \non--an open discussion of issues.\n  These are issues that can be addressed without in any way \ncompromising the national security of the United States. Understanding \nhow certain words are interpreted tells us where the line is drawn. But \nthat line, wherever it is drawn, is, in fact, relevant to whether the \nintent of Congress is being fulfilled and whether the protection of \ncitizens under the fourth amendment is indeed standing strong.\n  An open and democratic society such as ours should not be governed by \nsecret laws, and judicial interpretations are as much a part of the law \nas the words that make up our statute. The opinions of the FISA Court \nare controlling. They do matter. When a law is kept secret, public \ndebate, legislative intent, and finding the right balance between \nsecurity and privacy all suffer.\n  In 2010, due to concerns that were raised by a number of Senators \nabout the problem of classified FISA Court opinions, the Department of \nJustice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said \nthey would establish a process to declassify opinions of the FISA Court \nthat contained important rulings of law. In 2011, prior to her \nconfirmation hearing, Lisa Monaco, who is our Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for National Security, expressed support for declassifying FISA \nopinions that include ``significant instructions or interpretations of \nFISA.''\n  So here we have the situation where the Department of Justice and the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence said they would \nestablish a process of declassifying opinions. They understood that \nAmericans in a democracy deserve to know what the words are being \ninterpreted to mean. We have the Assistant Attorney General for \nNational Security during her hearings express that she supports \nsignificant instructions or interpretations being made available to the \npublic. But here we are 2 years later since the 2010 expressions and a \nyear from the confirmation hearings for Lisa, and nothing has been \ndeclassified--nothing.\n  The amendment I am offering today sets out a three-step process for \nsending the message it is important Americans know the interpretations \nof these laws. It does so in a fashion that is carefully crafted to \nmake sure there is no conflict with national security.\n\n  First you call upon the Attorney General to declassify the FISA \nreport in court of review opinions that include significant legal \ninterpretations. If the Attorney General makes a decision, however, \nthat it cannot be declassified--those decisions--in a way that does not \njeopardize national security, then the amendment requires the \nadministration to declassify summaries of their opinions.\n  So at the first point, you have the official written court opinions. \nBut possibly woven into those court opinions are a variety of contexts \nabout ways and manner of gathering intelligence that pose national \nsecurity problems. This amendment says: OK, if that is the case, we \ncertainly do not want to disclose sensitive information about ways and \nmeans of collecting intelligence, so declassify summaries. That way, we \ncan understand the legal interpretation without adjoining information \nthat might represent a national security problem.\n  This amendment goes further. If the Attorney General decides that not \neven a summary can be declassified without compromising national \nsecurity, then the amendment requires the administration to report to \nCongress regarding the status of its process for declassifying these \nopinions--a process the administration has already said it is \nundertaking. It just says: Tell us where you are.\n  It is probably very clear from my discussion that I would prefer that \nthe opinions, the actual court opinions, be declassified and that \nperhaps, if they are sensitive, the national security information would \nbe redacted. That is the normal process in which documents are \ndeclassified--you black out or remove sections that are sensitive. But \nthe amendment I am presenting goes further on the side of protecting \nnational security, saying: You don't have to just redact court \nopinions, you can do a summary that addresses significant legal \nimplications without addressing the ways and means that might be \nembedded in a further court decision. Furthermore, Mr. Attorney \nGeneral, if you make a decision that not even that is possible, then \nupdate us on the process.\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\n  But the key point is that it requires the Attorney General to make a \ndecision, a clear decision over the national security balance and \nprovide what can be done within the context, within the framework of \nnot compromising our national security.\n  This is so straightforward that anyone bringing the argument to this \nfloor that we should not do it because it compromises national security \nreally has no case to make--absolutely no case to make.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator, under the \norder, has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. My understanding is that 30 minutes was allocated?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirty minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Can I yield to \nSenator Merkley time from general debate in order to let him complete \nhis remarks?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. With the unanimous consent of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, wait a minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object, if it is time on our side that will be \nused.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, if there is no one else waiting to speak, \nI ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business and will yield \nwhen someone is ready, prepared to speak to the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me do something I do sometimes--\ncorrect myself. If the Senator is offering to use the time on his side, \nthat is fine with me. As long as it is not using the time for the bill \non our side.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think this is acceptable, yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for setting out the \nparameters. I am going to wrap this up in fairly short order.\n  I again wish to emphasize that if any of my colleagues would like to \ncome down and argue that this in any way compromises national security, \nI will be happy to have that debate because this has been laid out very \nclearly so the Attorney General has complete control over any possible \ncompromise of information related to national security. Indeed, \nalthough I think it is important for this body to continue to express \nthat the spirit of what we do in this Nation should be about citizens \nto the maximum extent possible having full and clear understanding of \nhow the letter of the law is being interpreted.\n  Let me show an example of a passage. Here is a passage about what \ninformation can be collected: `` . . . reasonable grounds to believe \nthat the tangible things sought are relevant to an authorized \ninvestigation (other than a threat assessment) conducted in accordance \nwith subsection (a)(2),'' and so on.\n  Let me stress these words: ``relevant to an authorized \ninvestigation.''\n  There are ongoing investigations, multitude investigations about the \nconduct of individuals and groups around this planet, and one could \nmake the argument that any information in the world helps frame an \nunderstanding of what these foreign groups are doing. So certainly \nthere has been some FISA Court decision about what ``relevant to an \nauthorized investigation'' means or what ``tangible things'' means. Is \nthis a gateway that is thrown wide open to any level of spying on \nAmericans or is it not? Is it tightly constrained in understanding what \nthis balance of the fourth amendment is? We do not know the answer to \nthat. We should be able to know.\n  If we believe that an administration and the secret court have gone \nin a direction incompatible with our understanding of what we were \nseeking to defend, then that would enable us to have that debate here \nabout whether we tighten the language of the law in accordance with \nsuch an interpretation. Again, is this an open gateway to any \ninformation anywhere in the world, anytime, on anyone or is it a very \nnarrow gate? We do not know. American citizens should have the ability \nto know, and certainly a Senator working to protect the fourth \namendment should know that as well. We have always struck a balance in \nthis country between an overbearing government and the important \npathway to obtaining information relevant to our national security.\n\n  The amendment I am laying forth strikes that balance appropriately. \nIt urges the process to continue by providing an understanding of what \nthe secret court interpretations are, which is very important to \ndemocracy. It provides the appropriate balance with national security, \ngives clear decisionmaking authority to the Attorney General of this \nprocess, and in that sense it gives the best possible path that honors \nnational security concerns while demanding transparency and \naccountability for this issue of privacy and protection of the fourth \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. For purpose of general debate, how much time remains on \nour side and how much time remains under the control of the \ndistinguished chair of the committee?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The opponents have 140 minutes \nremaining; the proponents have 183 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. I will speak out of our time in order \nto respond to a couple points. I also wish to commend my colleague \nSenator Merkley from Oregon for his excellent statement. He has been \ndoing yeoman's work in terms of trying to promote accountability and \ntransparency on this issue and the work he has done in the Senate. I am \ngoing to correct a couple of misconceptions about what has been said \nand also talk on behalf of the good work Senator Merkley is doing.\n  With respect to this amendment I will be offering, I believe the \nSenate cannot say we passed the smell test with respect to doing \nvigorous oversight if we don't have some sense of how many Americans in \nour country who are communicating with each other are being swept up \nunder this legislation. For purposes of the FISA Amendments Act, I \nthink we ought to know, generally, how many Americans are being swept \nup under the legislation. Oversight essentially would be toothless \nwithout this kind of information.\n  I wish to correct one misconception with respect to where we are on \nthe language in the reporting amendment. The distinguished chair of the \ncommittee urged Senators to visit the offices of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence to see the documents the chair has stated \nrelate to intelligence officials who say it is impossible for them to \nestimate the number of law-abiding Americans who have had their \ncommunications swept up under the legislation. However, the fact is \nthat when colleagues read the amendment I will be offering, they will \nsee I am not requiring anyone to take on a new task of preparing an \nestimate of how many law-abiding Americans have been swept up in it. \nThis is simply a request to the intelligence community, which states \nthat if any estimate has already been done, that estimate ought to be \nprovided.\n  When the distinguished chair of the committee says Senators should go \nover to the committee's offices and look at the documents which state \nthat the intelligence community cannot do a new estimate, I want \nSenators to know the language of my amendment does not ask for a new \nestimate. In no way does it ask for a new estimate. It simply says: If \nan estimate has been done, that estimate ought to be furnished. If no \nestimate has been done, the answer to that is simply no. We will be \nvery clear about it, and the matter will have been clarified. If no \nestimate has been done, then fine; the answer is no.\n  As I indicated earlier, the amendment also requires the intelligence \ncommunity to state whether any wholly domestic communications have been \ncollected. That again can be answered with a yes or no. Finally, it \nrequires a response as to whether the National Security Agency has \ncollected personal information on millions of Americans, and that too \nis a very straightforward answer.\n  I think when we talk about this kind of information, we ought to come \nback\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\nto the fact that no sources and methods in the intelligence community \nwould be compromised. In no way would the operations or the important \nwork of the intelligence community be interrupted. What it would simply \ndo is provide us with what I think are the basics that this Senate \nneeds to be able to say it is doing real oversight over a very broad \narea of surveillance law.\n  I hope Senators will ask themselves as we look at this: Do we in the \nSenate know whether anyone has ever estimated how many U.S. phone calls \nand e-mails have been warrantless collected under the statute? Does the \nSenate know whether any wholly domestic phone calls or e-mails have \nbeen collected under this statute? Does the Senate know whether the \ngovernment has ever conducted any warrantless, backdoor searches for \nAmericans' communication? If not, this is the Senate's chance to answer \nthat question.\n\n  When our constituents come forward and ask us whether the government \nis protecting our privacy rights as we protect our security, the \nquestion is: How does the Senator look their constituents in the eye \nand tell them they don't know and are not in a position to get \ninformation that is essential to pass the smell test when it comes to \nthis body doing basic oversight over what is certainly a broad and, for \nmany Americans, rather controversial surveillance law.\n  I assume--because we have already heard some characterizations of my \namendment, which are simply and factually incorrect--that we will have \nother responses to the reporting amendment in terms of objections. I \nhave already stated my first concern: The intelligence community \nstating that they cannot estimate how many Americans' communications \nare collected under key section 702 of FISA. Again, my response is that \nwhen Senators look at the text of the amendment, it does not require \nanybody to do an estimate. It simply says that if estimates do exist, \nthey ought to be provided to the Congress. When it comes to our \noversight responsibilities, I do not think that request is excessive or \nunreasonable.\n  Second, I think we will hear the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees already do oversight of FISA. Every Member of the Congress \nhas to vote on whether to renew the FISA Amendments Act. Frankly, I \nthink every Member of this body ought to be able to get a basic \nunderstanding of how the law actually works, and that is not available \ntoday.\n  Next, we will hear that the intelligence community has already \nprovided the Congress with lots of information about the FISA \nAmendments Act. As the Presiding Officer knows from his service on the \ncommittee, much of that information is in highly classified documents \nthat are difficult for most Members to review. The reality is most \nMembers literally have no staff who have the requisite security \nclearance in order to read them.\n  The amendment I am talking about with respect to basic information on \nthe number of Americans who have had their communications swept up \nunder FISA--whether Americans with respect to wholly domestic \ncommunications have been swept up under this law--in my view that \ninformation ought to be available to this body in documents Members can \nactually access. Frankly, it ought to be available in a single document \nwhich Members can access.\n  In connection with the discussion about these issues, we will also \nhear the answers to these questions should not be made public. The \namendment I am going to be offering with respect to getting a rough set \nof estimates as to how many Americans are being swept up under these \nauthorities--and whether an estimate actually even exists--gives the \nPresident full authority to redact whatever information he wishes from \nthe public version of the report. Under the amendment I am pursuing, \nthe executive branch would have full discretion to decide whether it is \nappropriate to make any of this information public.\n  As we ensure more transparency and more accountability with respect \nto this information and access to it, no sources or methods which have \nto be protected--including important work the intelligence committee is \ndoing--will be compromised in any way. The last word on this subject is \nthe call of the President of the United States, who has the full \ndiscretion to decide whether it is appropriate to make any of this \ninformation public.\n  Finally, we are undoubtedly going to hear that the law is about to \nexpire and amendments will slow it down. First of all, I think many of \nus would rather have had this debate earlier in this session of the \nSenate, and had there been more dialog on many of these issues, that \nwould have been possible. We are where we are, and I think all of us \nunderstand that. We understand this is a huge challenge. The fiscal \ncliff is vital in terms of our work this week, but I continue to \nbelieve the other body is perfectly capable of passing this legislation \nbefore the end of the year.\n  The amendments that are being offered all go to the issue of \ntransparency and accountability. Not one of those amendments would \njeopardize the ongoing issues and operations which relate to the \nsources and methods of the intelligence community. The Congress can \nmake amendments to improve oversight and still keep this law from \nexpiring.\n  With respect to the reporting amendment, I hope the argument made by \nthe distinguished chair of the committee that the intelligence \ncommunity has said they cannot estimate how many Americans' \ncommunications have been collected under section 702--that Senators go \nto the offices of the Intelligence Committee. When colleagues look at \nthe text of the amendment, the amendment does something different than \nthe issue which has been raised by the distinguished chair of the \ncommittee. The amendment does not require anyone to do an estimate. It \nsimply says that if an estimate already exists, that estimate ought to \nbe provided to the Congress.\n\n  Let me also make some brief remarks on this issue of secret law that \ntouches on the point raised by my colleague from Oregon Senator \nMerkley, who I think has given a very good presentation on the floor \nand has a very good amendment. When the laws are interpreted in secret, \nthe results frequently fail to stand up to public scrutiny. We have \ntalked about this on the floor and in the committee and it isn't that \nsurprising when we think about it. The law-making process in our \ncountry is often cumbersome, it is often frustrating, and it is often \ncontentious. But over the long run I think we know this process is the \nenvy of the world because it gives us a chance to have a real debate, \ngenerate support of most Americans because then people see, when they \nhave had a chance to be a part of a discussion, that they are empowered \nin our system of government. On the other hand, when laws are secretly \ninterpreted behind closed doors by a small number of government \nofficials without public scrutiny or debate, we are much more likely to \nend up with interpretations of the law that go well beyond the \nboundaries of what the public accepts or supports. So let's be clear \nthat when we are talking about public scrutiny and having debates, that \nis what allows the American people to see that those of us who are \nhonored to serve them are following their will.\n  Sometimes it is entirely legitimate for government agencies to keep \ncertain information secret. In a democratic society, of course, \ncitizens rightly expect their government will not arbitrarily keep \ninformation from them, and throughout our history our people have \nguarded their right to know. But I think we also know our constituents \nacknowledge certain limited exceptions exist in this principle of \nopenness. For example, most Americans acknowledge that tax collectors \nneed to have access to some financial information, but the government \ndoes not have the right to share this information openly. So we strike \nthe appropriate balance on a whole host of these issues on a regular \nbasis.\n  Another limited exception exists for the protection of national \nsecurity. The U.S. Government has the inherent responsibility to \nprotect its citizens from threats, and it can do this most effectively \nif it is sometimes allowed to operate in secrecy. I don't expect our \ngenerals to publicly discuss the details of every troop movement in \nAfghanistan any more than Americans expected George Washington to \npublish his strategy for the Battle of Yorktown. By the same token, \nAmerican citizens recognize their government may sometimes rely on \nsecret intelligence collection methods in order to\n\n[[Page S8402]]\n\nensure national security, ensure public safety, and they recognize \nthese methods often are more effective when the details--what are the \noperations and methods as we characterize them under intelligence \nprinciples--remain secret. But while Americans recognize government \nagencies will sometimes rely on secret sources and methods to collect \nintelligence information, Americans expect these agencies will at all \ntimes operate within the boundaries of publicly understood law.\n  I have had the honor to serve on the Intelligence Committee now for \nover a decade. I don't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to the \nimportance of protecting genuine, sensitive details about the work \nbeing done in the intelligence community, particularly their sources \nand methods. However, the law itself should never be secret. The law \nitself should never be secret because voters have a right to know what \nthe law says and what their government thinks the text of the law means \nso they can make a judgment about whether the law has been \nappropriately written, and they can then ratify or reject the decisions \nelected officials make on their behalf.\n  When it comes to most government functions, the public can directly \nobserve the functions of government and the typical citizen can decide \nfor himself or herself whether they support or agree with the things \ntheir government is doing. American citizens can visit our national \nforests--we take particular pride in them in our part of the country--\nand decide for themselves whether the forests are being appropriately \nmanaged. When our citizens drive on the interstate, they can decide for \nthemselves whether those highways have been properly laid out and \nadequately maintained. If they see an individual is being punished, \nthey can make judgments for themselves whether that sentence is too \nharsh or too lenient, but they generally can't decide for themselves \nwhether intelligence agencies are operating within the law. That is \nwhy, as the U.S. intelligence community evolved over the past several \ndecades, the Congress has set up a number of watchdog and oversight \nmechanisms to ensure intelligence agencies follow the law rather than \nviolate it. That is why both the House and the Senate have Select \nIntelligence Committees. It is also why the Congress created the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and it is why the Congress \ncreated a number of statutory inspectors general to act as independent \nwatchdogs inside the intelligence agencies themselves. All these \noversight entities--one of which I am proud to serve on, the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence--all of them were created, at least in \npart, to ensure intelligence agencies carry out all their activities \nwithin the boundaries of publicly understood law.\n  But I come back to my reason for bringing up this issue this \nafternoon. The law itself always ought to be public and government \nofficials must not be allowed to fall into the trap of secretly \nreinterpreting the law in a way that creates a gap between what the \npublic thinks the law says and what the government is secretly claiming \nthe law says. Any time that is being done, it first violates the public \ntrust, and, second, I have long felt that allowing this kind of gap--a \ngap between the government's secret interpretation of the law and what \nthe public thinks the law is--undermines the confidence our people \nare going to have in government. Also, by the way, it is pretty \nshortsighted because history shows the secret interpretations of the \nlaw are not likely to stay secret forever, and when the public \neventually finds out government agencies are rewriting these \nsurveillance laws in secret, the result is invariably a backlash and an \nerosion of confidence in these important government intelligence \nagencies and the important work, as I noted this morning, our \nintelligence officials are doing.\n\n  So this is a big problem. Our intelligence and national security \nagencies are staffed by exceptionally hard-working and talented men and \nwomen, and the work they do is extraordinarily important. If the public \nloses confidence in these agencies, it doesn't just undercut morale, it \nmakes it harder for these agencies to do their jobs. If we ask the head \nof any intelligence agency, particularly an agency that is involved in \ndomestic surveillance in any way, he or she will tell us that public \ntrust is a vital commodity and voluntary cooperation from law-abiding \nAmericans is critical to the effectiveness of their agencies. If \nmembers of the public lose confidence in these government agencies \nbecause they think government officials are rewriting surveillance laws \nin secret, those agencies are going to be less effective. I don't want \nto see that happen. On my watch, I don't want to be a part of anything \nthat makes our intelligence agencies less effective.\n  Officials at these government agencies do not get up in the morning \nto do their work with malicious intent. They work very hard to protect \nintelligence sources and methods for good reasons. Sometimes what \nhappens is people lose sight of the difference between protecting \nsources and methods, which ought to be kept secret, and the law itself, \nwhich should not be kept secret. Sometimes they even go so far as to \nargue that keeping the interpretation of the law secret is actually \nnecessary because it prevents our Nation's adversaries from figuring \nout what our intelligence agencies are allowed to do. My own view is \nthis is ``Alice in Wonderland'' logic, but if the U.S. Government were \nto actually adopt it, then all our surveillance laws would be kept \nsecret because that would, I guess one could argue, be even more \nuseful. When Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nin 1978, it would have been useful to keep the law secret from the KGB \nso Soviet agents wouldn't know whether the FBI was allowed to track \nthem down. But American laws and the American Constitution shouldn't be \npublic only when government officials think it is convenient. They \nought to be public all the time. Americans ought to be able to find out \nwhat their government thinks those laws mean, and I think it is \npossible to do that while still ensuring that sensitive information--\ninformation about sources and methods and the operations of the \nintelligence community--is appropriately kept secret.\n  My own view is the executive branch in the United States has so far \nfailed to live up to their promises of greater transparency in this \narea, greater commitment to ensuring the public sees how our laws are \nbeing interpreted. As long as there is a gap between the way the \ngovernment interprets these laws and what the public sees when people \nare sitting at home and looking it up on their laptops, I am going to \ndo everything I can to reduce that gap and to ensure our citizens, \nconsistent with our national security, have additional information with \nrespect to how our laws are interpreted. We can do that while at the \nsame time protecting the critical work being done by officials in the \nintelligence community.\n  With that, I am happy to yield to the distinguished chairwoman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to clarify \nthis question of secret law. This code book I am holding is the law. It \nis not secret. This is all of the code provisions which guarantees the \nlegality of what the intelligence community does. There is a whole \nsection on congressional oversight. There is a whole section on \nadditional procedures regarding persons inside the United States and \npersons outside the United States. This, in fact, is the law. We can \nchange the law, and Senator Wyden had something to do with adding \nsection 704. He did, in fact, change the law to put additional privacy \nprotections in and those privacy protections are up for reauthorization \nin this bill before us.\n  I wish to address, if I could, what Senator Merkley said in his \ncomments. I listened carefully. What he is saying is opinions of the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court should, in some way, shape or \nform, be made public, just as opinions of the Supreme Court or any \ncourt are made available to the public. To a great extent, I find \nmyself in agreement with that. They should be. Why can't they be? \nBecause the law and the particular factual circumstances are mixed \ntogether in the opinion, so the particular facts and circumstances are \npossibly classified. Hopefully the opinion can either be written in a \ncertain way for public release or the Attorney General can be required \nto prepare a summary of what that opinion said for release to the \npublic.\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\n  There is one part of Senator Merkley's amendment which I think we can \nwork together on regarding the FISA Court opinions, and that is on page \n5, lines 3 to 11, where the amendment says:\n\n       . . . if the Attorney General makes a determination that a \n     decision may not be declassified and made available in a \n     manner that protects the national security of the United \n     States, including methods or sources related to national \n     security, the Attorney General shall release an unclassified \n     summary of such decision.\n\n  I have talked to Senator Merkley about this, and I have offered my \nhelp in working to establish this. The problem is, we have 4 days, and \nthis particular part of the law expires, the FISA Amendments Act. I \nhave offered to Senator Merkley to write a letter requesting \ndeclassification of more FISA Court opinions. If the letter does not \nwork, we will do another intelligence authorization bill next year, and \nwe can discuss what can be added to that bill on this issue.\n  I am concerned that what is happening is the term ``secret law'' is \nbeing confused with what the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nissues in the form of classified opinions based on classified \nintelligence programs. As I have made clear, the law is public and when \npossible, the opinions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nshould be made available to the public in declassified form. It can be \ndone, and I think it should be done more often.\n  If the opinion cannot be made public, hopefully a summary of the \nopinion can. And I have agreed with Senator Merkley to work together on \nthis issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all quorum calls during debate on the \nFISA bill be equally divided between the proponents and opponents.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just to respond to the points made by the \ndistinguished chair of the committee--and, by the way, I think the \nchair's reference to being willing in the next intelligence \nauthorization bill to work with those of us--and Senator Merkley has \nmade good points this afternoon to try to include language in the next \nintelligence authorization bill to deal with secret law--I think that \nwould be very constructive. I appreciate the chair making that \nsuggestion.\n  Colleagues may know that under the leadership of the chair of the \ncommittee and the distinguished Senator from Georgia, the vice chair of \nthe committee, Mr. Chambliss, we were able, late last week, to work out \nthe disagreements with respect to the intelligence authorization bill \nthis year. I wish to thank the chair for those efforts. I think we have \na good bill. I think all of us are against leaks. That is what was at \nissue. I think we have now dealt with the issue in a fashion so as to \nprotect the first amendment and the public's right to know, and I \nappreciate the chair working with this Senator on it.\n  I think we have a good intelligence authorization bill now for this \nyear. I think the chair's suggestion that we look at dealing with this \nissue of secret law--in addition, I hope, to adopting the Merkley \namendment--that we deal with it in the next intelligence authorization \nbill is constructive. I do want to respond to one point on the merits \nwith respect to comments made by the distinguished chair on this issue.\n  The distinguished chair of the committee essentially said the law is \npublic because the text of the statute is public. That is true. That is \nnot in dispute. It is true that the text of the law is public. But the \nsecret interpretations of that law and the fourth amendment from the \nFISA Court are not public. The administration pledged 3 years ago to do \nsomething about that. They pledged it in writing in various kinds of \ncommunications, and that still has not been done. That is why this is \nan important issue with respect to transparency and accountability.\n  The distinguished chair of the committee is absolutely correct that \nthe law is public. The text of the law is public. Nobody disputes that. \nBut the secret interpretations of the law and the fourth amendment--the \ninterpretations of the FISA Court are not public, and we have received \npledges now for years that this would change.\n  I remember--perhaps before the distinguished chair of the committee \nwas in the Chamber--talking about how Senator Rockefeller and I got a \nletter indicating that this was going to be changed and that we were \nvery hopeful we were going to again get more information with respect \nto legal interpretations, matters that ought to be public that do not \nthreaten sources and methods and operations. We still have not gotten \nthat. That is the reason why Senator Merkley's work is so important.\n  I see my friend and colleague. I say to Senator Merkley, the \ndistinguished chair of the committee has made the point--I think while \nthe Senator had to be out of the Chamber--that the law is public \nbecause the text of it is public. But what the Senator has so \neloquently described as being our concern is that the opinions of the \nFISA Court--their opinions and views about the fourth amendment--are \nwhat has been secret, and the administration has said for years now \nthey would do something about it.\n  So the Senator's amendment seeks to give this the strongest possible \npush. I think that is why the Senator's amendment is so important. The \nSenator is obviously making a lot of headway because the distinguished \nchair of the committee has also said this issue of secret law is \nsomething that can be addressed as well in the intelligence \nauthorization bill.\n  If we can adopt the Senator's amendment and then move on to the \nintelligence authorization bill, that will be a very constructive way \nto proceed, very much in the public interest. The Senator is obviously \nmaking headway.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, if I could interject for a moment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes, of course.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from Oregon for spearheading this \nwhole conversation about privacy and national security and how the two \nare not at war with each other. We are simply looking for appropriate \nwarrant processes, an assurance to the public that the boundaries of \nprivacy are being respected. Certainly, a piece of that is the secret \nlaw. I appreciate the comments of the chair of the Intelligence \nCommittee on this issue. I do feel that in a democracy, understanding \nhow a statute is interpreted is essential to the conduct of our \nresponsibility in forging laws and ensuring that the constitutional \nvision is protected.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. He is making an important point. I \nhave sat next to Senator Feinstein in the Intelligence Committee now \nfor 12 years, and I think all of us--and we have had chairs on both \nsides of the aisle--understand how important the work of the \nintelligence community is. This is what prevents so many threats to our \ncountry from actually becoming realities--tragic realities.\n  What my friend and colleague from Oregon has hammered home this \nafternoon is that if a law is secret and there is a big gap between the \nsecret interpretation of a law and what the public thinks the law \nmeans--my friend and I represent people who, for example, could be \nusing their laptop at home in Coos Bay. If they look up a law and they \nsee what the public interpretation is and they later find out that the \npublic interpretation is real different than what the government \nsecretly says it is, when people learn that, they are going to be very \nunhappy.\n  I see my colleague would like some additional time to address this \nissue. I am happy to yield to him.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank Senator Wyden.\n  The Senator mentioned an Oregonian sitting in Coos Bay working on his \nor her laptop and calling the Senator's office and saying: Hey, the law \nsays the government can collect tangible material related to an \ninvestigation. Does that mean they can collect all of my Web \nconversations--knowing that the Web circuits travel around the world \nmultiple times and at some point they travel through a foreign space. \nThey ask this question in all sincerity because they care about the \nfourth amendment and their privacy.\n  How much ability do we have to give them a definitive answer on that?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Absent the information we are seeking to get under the \namendment I am going to offer, I do not\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nthink it is possible for a Senator to respond to the question.\n  The issue for an individual Senator would be: Do you know whether \nanyone has ever estimated how many U.S. phone calls and e-mails have \nbeen warrantlessly collected under the statute? Do you know whether any \nwholly domestic phone calls and e-mails have been collected under this \nstatute, which I believe is the exact question my colleague from Oregon \nhas asked.\n  I do not believe a Member of the Senate can answer that question. \nBeing unable to answer that question means that oversight, which is so \noften trumpeted on both sides of the aisle, is toothless when it comes \nto the specifics.\n  I hope that responds to my colleague's question.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Absolutely. I think about other questions our \nconstituents might ask. They might ask if our spy agencies are \ncollecting vast data from around the world and they become interested \nin an American citizen, can they search all that data without getting a \nwarrant--a warrant that is very specific to probable cause and an \naffirmation.\n  Again, I suspect the answer we could give to the citizen would be \nthat we cannot give a very precise evaluation of that, not knowing how \nthe concept of information related to an investigation has been \ninterpreted and laid out.\n  Mr. WYDEN. My colleague is asking a particularly important question \nbecause the Director of the National Security Agency, General \nAlexander, recently spoke at a large technology conference, and he said \nthat with respect to communications from a good guy, which we obviously \ninterpret as a law-abiding American, and someone overseas, the NSA has \n``requirements from the FISA Court and the Attorney General to minimize \nthat''--to find procedures to protect the individual, the law-abiding \nAmerican's rights, essentially meaning, in the words of General \nAlexander, ``nobody else can see it unless there's a crime that's been \ncommitted.''\n  If people hear that answer to my colleague's question--which, \nfrankly, General Alexander responded to directly--they pretty much say \nthat is what they were hoping to hear; that nobody is going to get \naccess to their communications unless a crime has been committed.\n  The only problem, I would say to my friend, is Senator Udall and I \nhave found out that is not true. It is simply not true. The privacy \nprotections provided by this minimization approach are not as strong as \nGeneral Alexander made them out to be. Senator Udall and I wrote to \nGeneral Alexander, and he said--and I put this up on my Web site so all \nAmericans can see the response--the general said: That is not really \nhow the minimization procedures work--these minimization procedures \nthat have been described in such a glowing way--and that the privacy \nprotections are not as strong as we have been led to believe. He may \nhave misspoken and may have just been mistaken, but I am not sure the \nrecord would be correct even now had not Senator Udall and I tried to \nmake an effort to follow it up.\n  I can tell the Senator that at this very large technology \nconference--this was not something that was classified--at a very large \ntechnology conference recently in Nevada, what the head of the National \nSecurity Agency said was taking place with respect to protecting \npeople, in response to my colleague's questions: Were their e-mails and \nphone calls protected, the general said to a big group: They are, \nunless a crime has been committed. The real answer is that is not \ncorrect.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from Oregon for being so deeply \ninvested in the details of this over many years, utilizing a fierce \nadvocacy in support of the fourth amendment and privacy to bring to \nthese debates. I also thank the chair of the Intelligence Committee for \nher comments earlier today about secret laws and her own concerns about \nthat and her willingness to help to work to have the administration \nprovide the type of information that clarifies how these secret \nopinions interpret statutes. My thanks go to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my friend. Just one last point with respect to \nthis technology conference where so many people walked away and thought \ntheir privacy was being protected by strong legal protections. General \nAlexander made additional confusing remarks that were in response to \nthat same question with respect to the protections of law-abiding \npeople.\n  General Alexander said, `` . . . the story that we [the NSA] have \nmillions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is absolutely \nfalse.''\n  Now, I have indicated this morning as well, having served on the \nIntelligence Committee for a long time, I do not have the faintest idea \nof what anybody is talking about with respect to a dossier. So Senator \nUdall and I followed that up as well. We asked the Director to clarify \nthat statement. We asked, ``Does the NSA collect any type of data at \nall on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?'' So that, too, \nis a pretty straightforward question.\n  The question Senators have been asking about this are not very \ncomplicated. If you are asking whether the National Security Agency is \naddressing these privacy issues, I think it is one of the most basic \nquestions you can ask. Does the National Security Agency collect any \ntype of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? \nIf the Agency saw fit, they could simply answer that with a yes or no. \nInstead, the Director of the Agency replied that while he appreciated \nour desire to have responses to those questions on the public record, \nthere would not be a public response forthcoming.\n  So to go over the exchange again, the Director of National Security \nAgency states that `` . . . the story that we have millions or hundreds \nof millions of dossiers on people is absolutely false.'' Senator Udall \nand I then asked: Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on \nmillions or hundreds of millions of Americans? The Agency is unwilling \nto answer the question.\n  So that is what this debate is all about, is reforming the FISA \nAmendments Act and, in particular, getting enough information so that \nit is possible for the Senate to say to our constituents: We are doing \noversight over this program.\n  I think right now, based on what we have outlined over the last 3 or \nmore hours, it is clear that on so many of the central questions--the \ngap, for example, between the secret interpretation of the law and the \npublic interpretation of the law, our inability to find out whether \nAmericans in their wholly domestic communications have had their rights \nviolated, how many law-abiding Americans have had their e-mails and \nphone calls swept up under FISA authorities, responses to these \nquestions that stem from public remarks made by intelligence officials \nat public conferences--the inability to get answers to these questions \nmeans that this Senate cannot conduct the vigorous oversight that is \nour charge.\n  I expect we will have colleagues coming in. With the weather, it is a \nspecial challenge to get here from our part of the country.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry. The distinguished chair of the \ncommittee already, I believe, got unanimous consent that the time in \nquorum calls be allocated to both sides. That was my understanding. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \ngeneral debate as to H.R. 5949 and that my time in so speaking be \ncharged against Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, in this dangerous world, we have an \nobligation to give our intelligence community the tools and the \nresources they need to keep us safe. But we also have a fundamental \nobligation--just as great, I believe--to protect the civil liberties of \nlaw-abiding American citizens. A right to private communications free \nfrom the prying eyes and\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\nears of the government should be the rule, not the exception, for \nAmerican citizens on American soil whom law enforcement has no reason \nto suspect of wrongdoing. Yet the legislation that we debate on this \nSenate floor today, the FISA Amendments Act, or the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act, would reauthorize \nsurveillance authority that most Americans, most of the Delawareans \nwhom I represent, would be shocked to learn the government has in the \nfirst place.\n  Under section 702, FISA permits the government to wiretap \ncommunications in the United States without a warrant if it reasonably \nbelieves the target of the wiretap to be outside of the country and has \na significant purpose of acquiring foreign intelligence information.\n  Of course, communications are by definition between two or more \npeople, so even if one participant is outside our country, the person \nthey are talking to may be here in the United States and they may well \nbe an American citizen.\n  Under this legislation, the government is permitted to collect and \nstore their communications but without clear legal limits on what can \nbe done with this information. They can keep it for an indefinite \nperiod of time. They can search within these communications and use \nthem in civilian criminal investigations. Perhaps most concerning of \nall to me, they can search information obtained under this act for the \ncommunications of a specific individual U.S. citizen without judicial \noversight and for any reason. If these are all true and this is the \ncase, then I am gravely concerned.\n  What is at issue today is the scope of the government's power to \nconduct surveillance without getting a warrant. The warrant requirement \nis enshrined in our legal system from the very founding of our Nation \nbecause we believe in judicial checks and balances. If the government \nsuspects wrongdoing by a U.S. citizen, it must convince a judge to \napprove a warrant. Warrants are issued each and every day in courts \nacross the United States for investigation of potential offenses across \nthe whole spectrum of criminal activity, including crimes affecting \nnational security. In contrast, surveillance under this act is not \nrequired to meet this standard, leaving American citizens vulnerable to \npotentially very real violations of their privacy.\n  The balance between privacy and security is an essential test for any \ngovernment, but it is a vital test for our government and for this \ncountry.\n  This law, in my view, does not contain some essential checks that are \nsupposed to protect our privacy.\n  This law in its current form does contain some checks that I want to \nreview that are supposed to protect our privacy. It requires that the \ngovernment surveillance program must be reasonably designed to target \nforeigners abroad and not intentionally acquire wholly domestic \ncommunications. The law requires that a wiretap be turned off when the \ngovernment knows it is listening in on a conversation between two U.S. \nindividuals, and it forbids the government from targeting a foreigner \nas a pretext for obtaining the communications of a U.S. national. All \nthree of these are important privacy protections currently in the law.\n  The problem is that we here in the Senate--and so the citizens we \nrepresent--don't know how well any of these safeguards actually work. \nWe don't know how courts construe the law's requirements that \nsurveillance be, as I mentioned, reasonably designed not to obtain any \npurely domestic information. The law doesn't forbid purely domestic \ninformation from being collected.\n  We know that at least one FISA Court has ruled that a surveillance \nprogram violated the law. Why? Those who know can't say, and average \nAmericans can't know. We can suspect that U.S. communications \noccasionally do get swept up in this kind of surveillance, but the \nintelligence community has not--in fact, they say they cannot offer us \nany reasonable estimate of the number or frequency with which this has \nhappened.\n  The government also won't state publicly whether any wholly domestic \ncommunications have been obtained under this authority, and the \ngovernment won't state publicly whether it has ever searched this \nsurveillance, this body of communications, for the communications of a \nspecific American without a warrant.\n  For me, this lack of information, this lack of understanding, this \nlack of detail about exactly how the protections in this act have \nworked is of, as I said, grave concern. Too often, this body finds \nitself in the position of having to give rushed consideration to the \nextension of expiring surveillance authorities.\n  The intelligence communities tell us these surveillance tools are \nindispensable to the fight against terrorism and foreign spies, just as \nthey did during the PATRIOT Act reauthorization debate last year. Also \nas in the case of the PATRIOT reauthorization, the expiration of these \nauthorities, we were told, would throw ongoing surveillance operations \ninto a legal limbo, that it could cause investigations to collapse or \nharm our ability to track terrorists and prevent crimes. All of these \nare profound and legitimate concerns. It is precisely because this \nlegislation is so important that it is all the more deserving of the \nSenate's careful, timely, and deliberate attention.\n  This kind of serious consideration requires more declassified \ninformation on the public record than we have available now. That is \nwhy I am supporting the amendments reported by the Judiciary Committee, \non which I serve, which would help to shine a light on exactly how this \nsurveillance authority is used. It would direct the intelligence \ncommunity inspector general to issue a public report explaining whether \nand how the FISA Amendments Act respects the privacy interests of \nAmericans.\n  This amendment would also give us another chance to amend this FAA \nafter we receive this report by adjusting the sunset not to 2017 but to \n2015. The new expiration date would align the sunset of the FISA \nAmendments Act with those in the PATRIOT Act, allowing for more \ncomprehensive review of both surveillance authorizations.\n  Concerns about privacy rights of law-abiding American citizens, as \nwell as the striking lack of current public information, are also why I \nsupport the amendment of Senator Merkley to direct the administration \nto establish a framework for declassifying FISA Court opinions about \nthe FAA. Secure sources and methods vital to the success of our \nintelligence community must be protected. I agree with that, and this \namendment would do that. But the default position here ought to be that \nthe legal analysis about the government's use of warrantless \nsurveillance in this country is public rather than hidden from view.\n  I also strongly support the amendment of Senator Wyden to force the \nintelligence community to provide Congress and the public, as \nappropriate, with specifics on just how much domestic communication has \nbeen captured under the FAA and what the intelligence community does \nwith that information. This amendment simply asks for the most basic \ninformation about the practical consequences of the use of the powerful \nsurveillance authorities in this act. To what extent are these \nauthorities being used to discover the content of private conversations \nby U.S. citizens? What is the order of magnitude? We don't know.\n  This amendment is simply common sense. The Delawareans for whom I \nwork and the Nation for whom we work expect that the government cannot \nlisten in on their phone calls or read their e-mails unless a judge has \nsigned a warrant. If there is a reason why this requirement is not \nconsistent with national security, then I say let the intelligence \ncommunity make that case and allow us to debate that and consider it in \npublic. It is simply not acceptable for the intelligence community to \nask us to surrender our civil liberties and then refuse to tell us with \nany specificity why we must do so, the context, and the scale of the \nexercise of this surveillance authority. In my view, America's first \nprinciples demand better.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for his leadership on this issue, and I thank \nMajority Leader Reid for ensuring that we have the opportunity to \ndebate and consider these amendments and the very important issues they \nreflect here today.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to consider carefully and then support \nthese\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\namendments to the FAA. We cannot let the impending deadline distract us \nfrom the important opportunity to conduct oversight and implement \nresponsible reforms. To simply be rushed to passage when we have known \nthe deadline was approaching for years strikes me as an abrogation of \nour fundamental oversight responsibility. This Chamber deserves a full \nand informed debate about our intelligence-gathering procedures and \ntheir potentially very real impact on Americans' privacy rights, and we \nneed it sooner rather than later. These amendments would allow us to \nhave that conversation and to work together on a path that strikes the \nessential balance between privacy and security for the citizens of \nthese United States.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Fourth \nAmendment Protection Act. The fourth amendment guarantees the right of \nthe people to be secure in their persons, their houses, their papers, \nand their effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n  John Adams considered the fight against general warrants--or what \nthey called in those days writs of assistance--to be when ``the child \nIndependence was born.'' Our independence and the fourth amendment go \nhand in hand. They emerge together. To discount or to dilute the fourth \namendment would be to deny really what constitutes our very Republic.\n  But somehow, along the way, we have become lazy and haphazard in our \nvigilance. We have allowed Congress and the courts to diminish our \nfourth amendment protections, particularly when we give our papers to a \nthird party--once information is given to an Internet provider or to a \nbank. Once we allowed our papers to be held by third parties, such as \ntelephone companies or Internet providers, the courts determined we no \nlonger had a legally recognized expectation of privacy.\n  There have been some dissents over time. Justice Marshall dissented \nin the California Bankers Association v. Schulz case, and he wrote \nthese words:\n\n       The fact that one has disclosed private papers to a bank \n     for a limited purpose within the context of a confidential \n     customer-bank relationship does not mean that one has waived \n     all right to the privacy of the papers.\n\n  But privacy and the fourth amendment have steadily lost ground over \nthe past century. From the California Bankers Association case, to \nSmith v. Maryland, to U.S. v. Miller, the majority has ruled that \nrecords, once they are held by a third party, don't deserve the same \nfourth amendment protections.\n  Ironically, though, digital records seem to get less protection than \npaper records. As the National Association of Defense Attorneys has \npointed out, ``since the 1870s, a warrant has been required to read \nmail, and since the Supreme Court's decision in Katz v. the United \nStates, a warrant has generally been required to wiretap telephone \nconversations. However, under current law, e-mail, text messages, and \nother communication content do not receive this same level of \nprotection.'' Why is a phone call deserving of more protection than our \ne-mail or texts?\n  In U.S. v. Jones, the recent Supreme Court case that says the \ngovernment can't put a GPS tracking device on a car without a warrant, \nJustice Sotomayor said this:\n\n       I for one doubt that people would accept without complaint \n     the warrantless disclosure to the government of a list of \n     every Web site they have visited in the last week, or month, \n     or year. . . . I would not assume that all information \n     voluntarily disclosed to some member of the public for a \n     limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to the \n     Fourth Amendment protection.\n\n  Justices Marshall and Brennan, dissenting in Smith v. Maryland, \nemphasized the danger of giving up fourth amendment protections. They \nwrote:\n\n       The prospect of government monitoring will undoubtedly \n     prove disturbing even to those with nothing illicit to hide. \n     Many individuals, including members of unpopular political \n     organizations or journalists with confidential sources, may \n     legitimately wish to avoid disclosure of their personal \n     contacts.\n\n  In Miller and in Smith, the Supreme Court held that the fourth \namendment did not protect records held by third parties. Sotomayor \nwrote in the Jones case that it may be time to reconsider these cases, \nreconsider how they were decided; that their approach is, in her words, \n``ill-suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of \ninformation about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying \nout mundane tasks.''\n  Today, this amendment that I will present, the Fourth Amendment \nProtection Act, does precisely that. This amendment would restore the \nfourth amendment protection to third-party records. This amendment \nwould simply apply the fourth amendment to modern means of \ncommunications. E-mailing and text messaging would be given the same \nprotections we currently give to telephone conversations.\n  Some may ask, well, why go to such great lengths to protect records? \nIsn't the government just interested in the records of bad people?\n  To answer this question, one must imagine their Visa statement and \nwhat information is on that Visa statement. From our Visa statement, \nthe government may be able to ascertain what magazines we read; whether \nwe drink and how much; whether we gamble and how much; whether we are a \nconservative, a liberal, a libertarian; whom we contribute to; what our \npreferred political party is; whether we attend a church, a synagogue, \nor a mosque; whether we are seeing a psychiatrist; and what type of \nmedications we take. By poring over a Visa statement, the government \ncan pry into every aspect of one's personal life. Do we really want to \nallow our government unfettered access to sift through millions of \nrecords without first obtaining a judicial warrant?\n  If we have people who are accused of committing a crime, we go before \na judge and get a warrant. It is not that hard. I am not saying the \ngovernment wouldn't be allowed to look through records. I am saying \nthat the mass of ordinary, innocent citizens should not have their \nrecords rifled through by a government that does not first have to ask \na judge for a warrant before they look at personal records.\n  We have examples in the past of abuses by our own country. During the \ncivil rights era, the government snooped on activists. During the \nVietnam era, the government snooped on antiwar protesters. In a digital \nage, where computers can process billions of bits of information, do we \nwant the government to have unfettered access to every detail of our \nlives? From a Visa statement, the government can determine what \ndiseases one may or may not have; whether one is impotent, manic, \ndepressed; whether someone is a gun owner and whether he or she buys \nammunition; whether one is an animal rights activist, an environmental \nactivist; what books we order, what blogs we read, and what stores or \nInternet sites we look at. Do we really want our government to have \nfree and unlimited access to everything we do on our computers?\n  The fourth amendment was written in a different time and a different \nage, but its necessity and its truth are timeless. The right to privacy \nand, for that matter, the right to private property are not explicitly \nmentioned in the Constitution, but the ninth amendment says that the \nrights not stated are not to be disparaged or denied.\n  James Otis--arguably the father of the fourth amendment--put it best \nwhen he said:\n\n       One of the most essential branches of English liberty is \n     the freedom of one's house. A man's house is his castle; and \n     whilst he is quiet, he is as well guarded as a prince in his \n     castle.\n\n  Today's castle may be an apartment, and who knows where the \ninformation is coming from. It may be paper in one's apartment or it \nmay be bits of data stored who knows where, but the concept that \ngovernment should be restrained from invading a sphere of privacy is a \ntimeless concept.\n  Over the past few decades, our right to privacy has been eroded. The \nFourth Amendment Protection Act would go a long way toward restoring \nthis cherished and necessary right. I hope my colleagues will consider \nsupporting, defending, and enhancing the fourth amendment, bringing it \ninto a modern\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\nage where modern electronic and computer information and communications \nare once again protected by the fourth amendment.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, is the Senator going to call up his \namendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3436\n\n  Mr. PAUL.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise in opposition to this \namendment. This amendment is extraordinarily broad. It is much broader \nthan FISA, and in the course of my remarks, I would hope to address how \nbroad it is. It essentially bars Federal, State, and local governments \nfrom obtaining any information relating to an individual that is held \nby a third party unless the government first obtains either a warrant \nor consent from the individual. This is also not germane to FISA. It \nhas not been reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, which would have \njurisdiction over this matter. For that reason alone, I would vote \nagainst it. Also, it impedes the timely reauthorization of the FISA \nAmendments Act.\n  I also oppose the substance of the amendment. The amendment is titled \nthe ``Fourth Amendment Preservation and Protection Act.'' In reality, \nit seeks to reverse over 30 years of Supreme Court precedent \ninterpreting the fourth amendment.\n  In 1967 the Supreme Court established its reasonable expectation of \nprivacy test under the fourth amendment, in the case of Katz v. United \nStates. Nine years later, in a case known as U.S. v. Miller, the \nSupreme Court held:\n\n       [T]he Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of \n     information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to \n     Government authorities.\n\n  So already you have a Supreme Court case saying that the fourth \namendment does not prohibit the use of this kind of information by the \ngovernment.\n  The Miller case involved the government obtaining account records \nfrom a bank. But in 1979, just 3 years after Miller, the Supreme Court \ntook up the issue of third-party collection in a case involving the \ninstallation and use of pen registers, which are electronic devices \nthat enable law enforcement to collect telephone numbers dialed from a \nparticular phone line without listening to the content of those calls. \nThe 1973 case is known as Smith v. Maryland, and in it the Court held:\n\n       [W]e doubt that people in general entertain any actual \n     expectation of privacy in the numbers they dial. All \n     telephone users realize that they must ``convey'' phone \n     numbers to the telephone company, since it is through \n     telephone company switching equipment that their calls are \n     completed. All subscribers realize, moreover, that the phone \n     company has facilities for making permanent records of the \n     numbers they dial, for they see a list of their long-distance \n     (toll) calls on their monthly bills. . . . Telephone users . \n     . . typically know that they must convey numerical \n     information to the phone company; that the phone company has \n     facilities for recording this information; and that the phone \n     company does in fact record this information for a variety of \n     legitimate business purposes. Although subjective \n     expectations cannot be scientifically gauged, it is too much \n     to believe that telephone subscribers, under these \n     circumstances, harbor any general expectation that the \n     numbers they dial will remain secret. . . . This Court \n     consistently has held that a person has no legitimate \n     expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns \n     over to third parties.\n\n  More recently, in the Court's 2012 decision in U.S. v. Jones, some \nJustices have questioned whether the time has come to revisit Miller \nand Smith in some form. Now, perhaps they are right, but this amendment \nisn't the form they had in mind. And this isn't the time to do so.\n  This amendment is so broad that the police could not use cell phone \ndata to find a missing or kidnapped child without a warrant or the \nconsent of the missing child--impossible to get. Similarly, they could \nnot ask the phone company to provide the home address of a terrorist, \ndrug dealer, or other criminal without consent or warrant. They could \nnot ask a bank if such criminals had recently deposited large sums of \nmoney. In fact, as written, this amendment would prohibit law \nenforcement from looking up the name, address, and phone number of a \ncriminal suspect, witness, or any other person online unless they \nobtained a warrant or the consent of the criminal suspect. As you can \nsee, the amendment is too broad.\n  As I have already stated, the FAA authorities expire in 4 days. If \nthose authorities are allowed to lapse, our intelligence agencies will \nbe deprived of a critical tool that enables those agencies to acquire \nvital information about international terrorists and other important \ntargets overseas, plus what they may be plotting in the United States. \nIt is imperative that we pass a clean reauthorization of these \nauthorities without amendments that will hamper passage in the House.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, when Congress passed the FISA Amendments \nAct of 2008, it granted the Government sweeping new electronic \nsurveillance powers which, if abused or misused, could impinge on the \nprivacy rights of Americans. Congress enacted these controversial \nauthorities with the understanding that it would re-examine these \nprovisions within four years, and determine whether to allow these \nauthorities to continue.\n  While there is no question that the surveillance powers established \nin the FISA Amendments Act have proven to be extraordinarily important \nfor our national security, it is equally clear to me that those broad \npowers must continue to come with rigorous oversight and strong privacy \nprotections.\n  That is why the Senate should adopt the Senate substitute amendment \nthat would allow the Government to continue using these authorities, \nbut for a period of time that ensures strong and independent oversight. \nThis amendment was considered and reported favorably by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee last July. I urge Senators to support this \nreasonable and commonsense measure. I call on all Senators who talk \nabout accountability and oversight to join with us to adopt this better \napproach to ensuring our security and our privacy.\n  Many of us will remember that the FISA Amendments Act was originally \npassed to clean up what one Bush administration lawyer called the \n``legal mess'' of the warrantless wiretapping program, which undermined \nthe privacy rights and civil liberties of countless Americans. More \nthan that, the warrantless wiretapping program undermined the public's \ntrust in our Government, and in the intelligence community's ability to \npolice itself.\n  During the debate on the FISA Amendments Act in 2007 and 2008, I \nworked with others on the Judiciary Committee to ensure that important \noversight, accountability, and privacy protections were put into place, \nincluding express prohibitions on the warrantless wiretapping of U.S. \npersons or any individual located here in the United States, as well as \na prohibition against the practice of so-called ``reverse targeting.''\n  I am convinced that the oversight and accountability provisions that \nwe included in the original legislation have helped to prevent the \nabuse of these surveillance tools. Based on my review of information \nprovided by the Government, and after a series of classified briefings, \nI have not seen evidence that the law has been abused, or that the \ncommunications of U.S. persons are being intentionally targeted. But \nlet's be absolutely clear, my conclusion is based on the information I \nhave seen to date, and current compliance does not guarantee future \ncompliance. We must not relax our oversight efforts, and I believe that \nthere is more that can be done to protect against future abuse and \nmisuse.\n  In June, after the Senate Intelligence Committee originated the \nSenate bill to reauthorize and extend FISA, Senator Grassley and I \nasked for a sequential referral, just as I did in 2008, to allow the \nJudiciary Committee to consider and improve this important legislation. \nThe bill that was approved by the Intelligence Committee provided for a \ngeneral and unfettered extension of the expiring provisions until June \n2017.\n  I hoped that the Senate Judiciary Committee would improve on that, \nand we did. I worked with Senator Feinstein, Chair of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, to craft a compromise to shorten the sunset to \n2015 and to add some accountability and oversight provisions. I \nappreciated the Senator from California's commitment to helping to \nimprove this sensitive and important legislation and her strong words \nof support for the Senate Judiciary Committee bill. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee adopted the substitute and reported the Senate bill \nto the Senate promptly last July. That is the bill that I am offering, \nthe Senate bill. There is no reason for us to merely rubberstamp the \nHouse bill. We have a better bill with better provisions and more \naccountability and oversight. I am pleased that Senators Durbin, \nFranken, Shaheen, Akaka, and Coons have joined me as cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  The Senate bill that the Judiciary Committee adopted, and that I am \noffering to improve on the House bill\n\n[[Page S8409]]\n\nthat has been brought before us, provides for a shorter sunset of the \nexpiring surveillance authorities. The House bill's sunset is longer \nthan that adopted by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and \nunnecessarily extended. The Senate bill I offer provides for extending \nFISA authorities, but would sunset them in June 2015. This will allow \nthe existing programs to continue but ensures that we revisit them in a \ntimely fashion as more information becomes available. It would also \nalign with the June 2015 sunset of certain provisions of the USA \nPATRIOT Act, thereby enabling Congress to evaluate all of the expiring \nsurveillance provisions of FISA together. This is an approach that \nChairman Feinstein and I both supported during the PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization debate in 2011, along with many members of the \nJudiciary and Intelligence Committees. This is the position the \nintelligence community and the administration supported then and as \nrecently as last year. It is the right position and the right sunset, \nand that is why the Senate bill should include it and will if my \namendment is adopted.\n  As we have seen through our experience with the USA PATRIOT Act, \nsunsets are important oversight tools. Sunsets force Congress to re-\nexamine carefully the surveillance powers that have been authorized. If \nwe know we have to actually look at it because it is going to run out, \nwhat happens is amazing--Senators in both parties actually look at it. \nMore importantly, sunsets force the administration to provide full and \naccurate information to justify to Congress the reauthorization of \nsignificant authorities. Any administration is going to be willing to \nkick the ball down the road if they don't have to do it; if they have a \nsunset, they do. The last thing we want is for the NSA and the FBI to \ntake for granted that they will have these powers, especially when the \nmisuse or abuse of these powers could significantly impact the \nconstitutional liberties of Americans. Likewise, we must never take for \ngranted our constitutional liberties, and we should not shy away from \nour duty as Senators to protect against any such misuse or abuse.\n\n  I acknowledge and appreciate those in the intelligence community who \nwork very hard to ensure compliance with our laws and Constitution. But \nit is also important to note that there has never been a comprehensive \nreview of these authorities by an independent Inspector General that \nwould provide a complete perspective on how these authorities are being \nused, and whether they are being used properly.\n  The DOJ Inspector General recently completed a review of the FBI's \nimplementation of the FISA Amendments Act, but this was limited in \nscope--not only because it was just limited to the FBI, and not any \nother part of the intelligence community, but also because it was \nlimited in scope to the period ending in early 2010. Notably, this was \nthe first report ever issued by the DOJ Inspector General regarding the \nFBI's use of Section 702 authorities, and it was issued in September \n2012--after the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees reported \ntheir bills, and after the House voted to pass its clean extension.\n  Even more troubling is the fact that we still have not received a \nreport from the NSA Inspector General that fully assesses the NSA's \ncompliance with its targeting and minimization procedures, or the \nlimitations we put in place to protect the privacy of Americans. I am \ntold that a preliminary report on the adequacy of the management \ncontrols at the NSA is being finalized--but it is just that: a \npreliminary report, and not an actual, final, comprehensive, or \ndefinitive assessment of whether NSA analysts are complying with the \nprocedures and rules that they have put into place. Indeed, the NSA \nInspector General's office has acknowledged that there is more work to \nbe done, and that this review--once completed--will just be a first \nstep. Moreover, as with the DOJ Inspector General's report, this review \nis limited just to a single agency, and does not incorporate any review \nor assessment of any information-sharing that might be taking place.\n  To address the limitations faced by the IGs for individual agencies, \nour Senate bill as embodied in my substitute amendment adds some \ncommonsense improvements to the oversight provisions in the FISA \nAmendments Act, including a comprehensive independent review by the \nInspector General of the Intelligence Community. The Office of the \nInspector General of the Intelligence Community was established in 2010 \nand has the unique ability to provide a comprehensive assessment of the \nsurveillance activities across the intelligence community, rather than \njust a limited view of a single agency. An independent review by the \nInspector General for the Intelligence Community could answer some \nremaining questions about the implementation of the FISA Amendments \nAct, particularly with respect to the protection of the privacy rights \nof U.S. persons. I also believe that an unclassified summary of such an \naudit should be made public in order to provide increased \naccountability directly to the American people.\n  These are reasonable improvements to the law that I urge all Senators \nto support. We often hear Senators speak about the need for vigorous \nand independent oversight of the Executive Branch, the need to support \nindependent inspectors general who are not beholden to a particular \nagency, and the need for Congress to conduct its own independent \nreviews as a check on the power of the Executive. So I ask those same \nSenators this question: When Congress has authorized the use of \nexpansive and powerful surveillance tools that have the potential to \nimpact so significantly the constitutional rights of law-abiding \nAmericans, isn't this exactly the type of situation that calls for that \nsort of vigorous and independent oversight? Put simply, someone needs \nto be watching the watchers--and watching them like a hawk. I call upon \nall Senators, on both sides of the aisle, who talk about accountability \nand oversight to join with us to adopt this better approach to ensuring \nour security and our privacy by adopting the Senate bill as embodied in \nthe substitute amendment.\n  No one can argue that shortening the sunset or adding oversight \nprovisions somehow hampers the Government's ability to fight terrorism \nor somehow harms national security. That is not true. All Senators \nshould know that neither the 2015 sunset date nor the added oversight \nprovisions have any operational impact on the work of the intelligence \ncommunity. No one--I repeat, no one from the administration has ever \nsaid to me that these provisions cause any operational problems for the \nintelligence community, and to suggest otherwise now is simply not \naccurate.\n  In fact, when the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported \nits bill last year that bill had exactly the same sunset date of June \n2015 that is in the substitute amendment. I was encouraged that Senator \nFeinstein supported this 2015 sunset date when the Judiciary Committee \napproved this substitute amendment, and noted then that this substitute \namendment does not cause any operational problems for the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  So where does that leave us? It leaves us with a simple choice. We \ncan enable the intelligence community to continue using these \nauthorities until 2015, while adding commonsense improvements that will \nhelp us to conduct vigorous oversight. Or the Senate can abdicate its \nresponsibilities and rubberstamp the House bill that extends these \npowerful authorities for another five years, without a single \nimprovement in oversight or accountability--even though we may not have \nall the information we need to make an informed determination.\n  As an American, and as a Vermonter, the choice is simple for me. We \nhave an obligation to ensure that these expansive surveillance \nauthorities are accompanied by safeguards. We can fulfill our duty to \nprotect the privacy and civil liberties of the American public, while \ncontinuing to provide the intelligence community with tools to help \nkeep America safe. That is what the Senate bill as embodied in the \nsubstitute amendment accomplishes. I urge Senators to choose this \nbalanced, commonsense approach, and to support adopt the Senate \nsubstitute to the over-expansive House bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, in listening to the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee and also reading the amendment, I \nwant to\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\nmake clear that there are parts of this amendment to which I would \nagree. However, the House bill is now before us, which would extend the \nsunset of the FISA Amendments Act 5 years versus 2\\1/2\\ years in the \nLeahy Amendment. So, before us is the 5-year authorization period which \nthe House has already passed. We have 4 days before the FISA Amendments \nAct essentially end. I cannot support that shorter time but I support \nthe 5-year extension.\n  The part of the amendment of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nthat I do agree with is the expanded mission of the inspector general \nof the Intelligence Community. Since the chairman is now becoming the \nPresident in rapid promotion, I will be happy to address my remarks to \nhim.\n  (The PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. President, Mr. Chairman, I want you to know we have spent large \namounts of time on the particular issue of Section 702 reporting. For \nexample, the law requires semiannual Attorney General and DNI \nassessments of section 702. Every 6 months they assess compliance with \nthe targeting and minimization procedures. The law also requires the \ninspector general of Justice and the IG of every element of the \nintelligence community authorized to acquire foreign intelligence \ninformation to review compliance within Section 702. In addition, the \nIGs are required to review the number of disseminated intelligence \nreports containing a reference to a U.S.-person identity and the number \nof U.S. person identities subsequently disseminated. The law also \nalready requires annual reviews by agency heads of Section 702. It also \nrequires a semiannual Attorney General report on Title VII every 6 \nmonths to fully inform the congressional Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees. And there is another semiannual report on FISA required for \nthe Attorney General to submit a report to the committees. Finally, \nthere are requirements for the provision of documents relating to \nsignificant construction or interpretation of FISA by the FISA Court.\n  So it is clear that there are many reporting requirements on FISA and \nspecifically section 702. I would also add that the Intelligence \nCommittee has had hearings with the DNI, with Attorney General Holder, \nwith Director of FBI Mueller on how Section 702 is carried out. I will \nalso tell you the Intelligence Committee staff spends countless hours \ngoing over the reports in meetings with representatives of the \ndepartments. However, I would say to Chairman Leahy that what I would \nlike to do is look at your amendment and see how it compares to what is \ncurrently being done and possibly add some parts of your amendment to \nour authorization bill next year.\n  I would urge that we have your staff and the Intelligence Committee \nstaff work together to see what we can do. The real reason to oppose \nall of this at this time is that these authorities expire in 4 days. I \nremember the vote in the Judiciary Committee on this amendment very \nwell. Had the bill come to the floor over the summer, after it passed \nout of Committee, then we might have had time to convince the House to \nconsider these changes to current law. But here we are where we have a \n5-year House bill in front of us and only 4 days to extend the sunset. \nAs I am opposing all amendments, I would respectfully and, not quite \nsorrowfully but almost, have to oppose your amendment with the caveat I \nadded, Mr. Chairman.\n  In deference to you and your chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, \nthe Intelligence Committee staff will work closely with yours to see if \nthere is anything that needs to be added to a future intelligence \nauthorization bill.\n  I thank you for that and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first, I strongly support your amendment, \ngiven how little most Members of Congress know about the actual impact \nof the law. The shorter extension period as envisioned by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee makes a lot of sense. \nI also think it makes sense to have the intelligence community \ninspector general conduct an audit on how FISA Amendment Act authority \nhas been used.\n  Once again, we have had this discussion about how much everybody \nalready knows about how the FISA Amendments Act affects the operations \nof this program on law-abiding Americans. I would have to respectfully \ndisagree. I asked Senators, as we touched on this in the course of the \nafternoon, whether they know if anyone has ever estimated how many U.S. \nphone calls and e-mails have been warrantlessly collected under this \nstatute?\n  Senator Udall and I have asked this very simple question: Has there \nbeen an estimate--not whether there is going to be new work, whether \nthey are going to be difficult assignments. We have asked whether there \nhas ever been an estimate of how many U.S. phone calls have been \nwarrantlessly collected under the statute. We were told in writing we \nwere not going to be able to get that information.\n  I think Senators ought to also ask themselves whether they know if \nany domestic phone calls and e-mails, what are wholly domestic \ncommunications, have been conducted under this statute. I think they \nwill also find they do not know the answer to this question. I think \nSenators also would want to know whether the Government has ever \nconducted any warrantless backdoor searches for Americans' \ncommunications.\n  So when we have the argument that has now been advanced several times \nin the course of the day that we already know so much, we do not need \nall these amendments, it is just going to delay passage of the \nlegislation, I urge people--go to my Web site, in particular--to look \nat what we have learned from the intelligence community, which is the \nresponse to request after request, particularly requests of a \ntripartisan group of Senators asking yes or no questions: Has there \nbeen an estimate? For example, how many law abiding Americans have had \ntheir communications swept up into these FISA authorities? Our \ninability to get that answer makes it clear that when one talks about \nrobust oversight under this legislation, the reality is that there is \nenormous lack of specifics with respect to how this legislation \nactually works.\n  I would only say in response to the amendment offered by the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I think his amendment is very appropriate. Given how little \nis known, to me it is one of the fundamental pillars of good oversight \nthat we do not grant open-ended kind of authorizations when we lack so \nmuch fundamental information about how this program works, particularly \nhow it would affect law-abiding Americans.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/27/senate-section/article/S8410-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8410-S8411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LETTER OF RESIGNATION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on behalf of the entire Senate, I welcome \nSenator Brian Schatz to the Senate. I congratulate him on his \nappointment to fill the seat of the late Senator Dan Inouye who, as we \nall know, was an institution in and of himself.\n  Senator Schatz is now one of the youngest Senators in this body. \nNevertheless, he has a long history of serving the State of Hawaii. \nPrior to entering politics, Senator Schatz served for 8 years as the \nCEO of Helping Hands Hawaii, one of Hawaii's largest nonprofit social \nservices organizations. He also served four terms in the Hawaii House \nof Representatives and served until just a few minutes ago as the \nLieutenant Governor of the State of Hawaii.\n  Having been a Lieutenant Governor he has experience as a legislator, \nand then as one of the presiding officers of the entire Senate, speaks \nfor itself in helping to prepare for the job he has here. I expect he \nwill build upon the foundation laid by Senator Inouye in the Senate. \nWhile no one can fill the shoes of our friend Senator Inouye, Brian \nSchatz is a young man with a future full of promise and opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, now \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to welcome Hawaii's new Senator, \nBrian Schatz. Brian is a leader for Hawaii's present and for our future \nand I welcome him with much aloha pumehana, which means warm love.\n  I also welcome and congratulate Senator Schatz's wife Linda; their \nchildren, Tyler and Mia; his twin brother, and Senator Schatz's proud \nparents, Dr. Irwin and Mrs. Barbara Schatz.\n  Senator Schatz arrives in Washington during a sad time as we continue \nto mourn the loss of our champion, Senator Dan Inouye. Dan Inouye will \nalways be a legend in Hawaii. He will never be replaced.\n  At Dan Inouye's memorial service in Honolulu this past weekend, I was \nreminded of how many people he touched in Hawaii and across the \ncountry. We must honor his legacy by working together for the people of \nHawaii.\n  I thank Brian for volunteering for this incredible responsibility. He \nonly learned of his appointment yesterday and did not have any time to \nspare, so he hopped on Air Force One and flew straight to Washington to \nbe sworn in today.\n  We need him here now because we are facing a major challenge, one \nthat regrettably has been created by Congress in our own inability to \nthus far compromise. The looming spending cuts and tax increases known \nas the fiscal cliff must be fixed within the next 5 days.\n  Mahalo--thank you--Brian, for accepting this challenge.\n  I am here to help Senator Schatz in any way I can. While there are \nother talented leaders in Hawaii who stepped forward and who would also \nhave been excellent appointees, I know my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting Senator Brian Schatz for the good of Hawaii.\n  Throughout my 36-year career in Congress, the Hawaii delegation has \nalways been unified. We have always put Hawaii first before our \nindividual ambition. We must continue that. Hawaii comes first.\n  I have followed Brian Schatz's career for many years. He was an \nactive member of the Hawaii State House of Representatives for 8 years \nbefore becoming the CEO of Helping Hands Hawaii, a nonprofit \norganization that provides human services in the islands. As Lieutenant \nGovernor, he has been a big part of our community. He has been an \noutspoken supporter of our troops and veterans and defender of our \nenvironment.\n  Senator Schatz will be a strong progressive voice for Hawaii in the \nSenate. He will advance freedom and equality. He will be a strong voice \non climate change, expanding clean renewable energy, and protecting our \nprecious natural resources. He will defend our Native Hawaiians and all \nour Nation's first people--those Americans who exercised sovereignty on \nlands that later became part of the United States. He will uphold the \nvalues and priorities of our unique State.\n  I say to my friend, the new junior Senator from Hawaii, never forget \nthat he is here with the solemn responsibility to do everything he can \nto represent the people of Hawaii, to make sure their needs are \naddressed in every policy discussion, and to speak up and seek justice \nfor those who cannot help themselves.\n  God bless you, Senator Schatz. God bless Hawaii. God bless the United \nStates of America.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Hawaii leaves the \nfloor, we have all come and given speeches--a lot of us, at least--\nabout Senator Akaka, but we have not had a lot of people on the floor \nwhen we have done that.\n  The presentation just now is typical for Dan Akaka: never a word \nabout himself, always about somebody else. If the new Senator has \nSenator Akaka's qualities--the kindest, gentlest person I have ever \nserved in this body with--it is something for which he should strive. \nThe shoes he has to fill, we all know--Akaka and Inouye--are \nsignificant to fill, but he can do that.\n  For you, Senator Akaka--with these people on the floor--we are going \nto miss you so much. You are a wonderful human being and have been a \ngreat Senator.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, also on two things that do not relate to my\n\n[[Page S8412]]\n\ncomments about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--I would like \nto say it is a great honor for me to be able to speak on the floor for \nthe first time with the President pro tempore presiding over the \nSenate. I know he is going to lead this body well and he has served \nwith great dignity. It is an honor to be here with him on this day, \neven if it is December 27, 2012, and even though we are, of course, all \ncontinuing to think about the former President pro tempore and the \nservices for him that were just completed.\n\n\n                     Tributes to Departing Senators\n\n                              Danny Akaka\n\n  I would also like to say I was here when the new Member from Hawaii \nwas sworn in and listened to Mr. Akaka's comments. I have great respect \nfor him and the quiet dignity he brings to everything he does--from \nweekly demonstrations of his personal faith, which I share with him, to \nhis name being mentioned first in all these quorum calls that have gone \non now for, I assume, all the time he has been in the Senate, going \nback to 1981.\n  But we will miss him, as we will miss his colleague from Hawaii, and \nwe welcome his new colleague today. I get to welcome you personally, \nMr. President, with heartfelt appreciation, as the new President pro \ntempore of the Senate.\n  Following that, I wish to speak on the importance of extending the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Amendments Act, I think it \nis called.\n  While I was serving in the House in 2008, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act had lapsed, and we were not doing the things we should \nbe doing. I was able there to work with my good friend Steny Hoyer, who \nwas the majority whip at the time. I was the minority whip at the time. \nWe had held the reverse of those jobs in the previous Congress. I liked \nmy role as majority whip better. But Mr. Hoyer and I were able to work \ntogether, particularly with my predecessor from Missouri, Senator Bond, \nand Senator Rockefeller--Senator Bond was the vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee; Senator Rockefeller was the chairman--as we \ntried to negotiate how we would extend the FISA Amendments Act.\n  My colleagues here today--many of them remember the challenge we \nfaced in getting that bill done. Many of them, including the current \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, know the importance we \nplaced on the work that is done every day under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  At the time in 2008, we had a very concrete set of examples of what \nwould happen without FISA because, frankly, we were effectively without \nit. For periods of time in 2007 and 2008, the National Security Agency \nwas unable to fully perform its mission in monitoring many of the \nactivities of known terrorists who were overseas and particularly found \nit impossible to focus in on new targets--and, again, those are known \nterrorists not in this country.\n\n  It was wrong that Congress allowed the act to lapse, and it would be \ndangerously wrong if we let it happen again on December 31 of this \nyear.\n  Five years ago, I sat through many disturbing intelligence briefings. \nI remember the sense of urgency expressed by the then-Director of \nNational Intelligence Mike McConnell; the then-CIA Director Michael \nHayden; and the then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey, as they \ndiscussed the consequences we would have to deal with if we continued \nnot to move forward and put this act back in place.\n  The agreement we reached balanced the concerns of those who feared \nthe National Security Agency had overreached with the ongoing authority \nthe intelligence community needed to protect the country. That \nagreement is before us again to be reauthorized for another 5 years.\n  The FISA Amendments Act protects individuals in the United States \nfrom so-called reverse targeting. It is one of the concerns people had \n5 years ago. This would be a process which, in theory, could be used to \nmonitor the communications of American citizens under the guise of \nspying on terrorists.\n  It also continues to ensure that any communication originating in the \nUnited States caught in the FISA process is minimized. What does that \nmean? It means it is handled in a way that American communications \ncannot be examined unless they have further justification.\n  Meanwhile, the bill updated the antiquated way we monitor terrorist \ncommunications, ensuring that our intelligence professionals no longer \nhave to spend countless hours trying to figure out whether an overseas \nterrorist's communications are traveling over fiber optic wires or \nthrough a satellite.\n  I am concerned the amendments we are looking at here not only disrupt \nthe delicate balance we struck in 2008 but also they may mean that this \nact does not get extended. The House has voted on a straight extension. \nThe only thing standing between the continuation of that 2008 hard-\nfought and I think properly balanced agreement is a Senate vote on what \nthe House has passed. I will be voting against the amendments. I think \nsome of these amendments are well intended and, in fact, if they were \nnot part of this bill, studies and other things that are being proposed \nmight very well be worth doing but not worth doing in a way that would \nallow FISA to expire in just a few short days.\n  I am pleased to have been able to serve on both the Senate and the \nHouse Select Committees on Intelligence and have witnessed firsthand \nthe important role that FISA plays in protecting our country.\n  I am thankful for the intelligence professionals who serve our \ncountry, both in the United States and overseas. I hope, as they \nobserve this debate we are having about FISA, they see a Congress that \nsupports them, supports their families, and supports their important \nwork.\n  Unless the world changes--and, hopefully, it will change--we should \nnever allow our ability to track terrorists overseas to go dark again. \nThat is why it is critically important we pass this bill in the next \nfew hours, why we extend FISA for another 5 years, and give our \nintelligence professionals the tools they need to protect our country \nand, frankly, give the Congress, the President, and, most importantly, \nthe American people the obligation to look at this authority again in 5 \nyears and see if we still need it.\n  Today, we need to extend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I \nhope we do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I would be happy to defer to \nthe vice chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today in support of H.R. 5949, \nthe FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012. Before I speak on \nit as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, I wanted to say that \nthis bill, along with many other products that have come out of the \nIntelligence Committee, has been put together in a strong bipartisan \nway under the leadership of our chairman Senator Feinstein, who has \nbeen a great advocate for the national security of the United States \nand a great advocate for our men and women in the intelligence \ncommunity. I would be remiss if I did not say as we conclude this year, \nwhich is the second of the 2 years I have been vice chair, what a \nprivilege and pleasure it has been to work with her. I thank her for \nher leadership and all of the issues we have worked on together.\n  This bill, which passed the House with broad bipartisan support, \nprovides a clean extension of the FISA Amendments Act until December \n31, 2017. Earlier this year, with strong bipartisan support, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee also reported the bill with a clean extension, \nalthough it had a slightly earlier sunset of June 1, 2017. So we have \ntwo bills--one from each Chamber--that recognize that the FAA must be \nreauthorized for the next 5 years. Both bills also confirm that there \nshould be no substantive changes to the FAA itself. But time is running \nshort before these vital authorities expire, as they expire on December \n31. So it makes the most sense for the Senate to simply pass the House \nbill and send it to the President for his immediate signature so that \nwe have no gap in collection on those who seek to do us harm, as they \nare out there every day seeking to do that.\n  As we debate the merits of passing a clean extension of the FAA, I \nthink it is important to remember why the FAA is so necessary. The \nterrorist attacks by al-Qaida on September 11,\n\n[[Page S8413]]\n\n2001, highlighted a significant shortfall in our ability to collect \nforeign intelligence information against certain overseas targets. Our \nintelligence community took operational measures to address that \nshortfall but eventually realized that additional FISA authorities were \nneeded to fully address the problem.\n  More than 5 years ago, after an adverse ruling from the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act Court, the Director of National \nIntelligence requested that Congress act immediately to stem the sudden \nand significant reduction in the intelligence community's capability to \ncollect foreign intelligence information on overseas targets. So \nCongress responded--first with the Protect America Act of 2007 and then \nwith the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. By providing a statutory \nframework for acquiring foreign intelligence information from overseas \ntargets, the FAA has enabled the intelligence community to identify and \nneutralize terror networks before they harm us either at home or \nabroad.\n  While I cannot get into specific examples, I can say definitively \nthat these authorities work extremely well. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to go to the Intelligence Committee's spaces and review the \nclassified materials provided by the intelligence community. These \nmaterials give the classified examples that clearly demonstrate the \nFAA's success.\n  Let me briefly highlight what some of those authorities do. Under \nsection 702, the government may target persons reasonably believed to \nbe outside the United States for the purpose of acquiring foreign \nintelligence information. However, there are a number of important \nlimitations on this authority that are designed to ensure that this \nsection 702 collection cannot be used to intentionally target a U.S. \nperson under what we call reverse-targeting within the community. These \nacquisitions are authorized jointly through a certification by the \nAttorney General and the Director of National Intelligence and are \napproved by the FISA Court.\n  The plain language and legislative history of section 702 makes clear \nthat Congress understood there would be incidental collection of one-\nend domestic and U.S. person communications. There has to be. If we \nimpose an upfront ban on the collection of such communications, we \ncould never do the acquisition in the first place because it is often \nimpossible to determine in advance whether an unknown target overseas \nis, in fact, a U.S. person. So we need the broad ``any person'' \nauthority at the outset to ensure that the acquisition can occur in the \nfirst instance. Moreover, Congress also understood that this incidental \ncollection would likely provide the crucial lead information necessary \nto thwart terrorists like the 9/11 hijackers who trained and launched \ntheir attacks from within the United States. But because of legitimate \nconcerns about the privacy of U.S. persons, Congress also placed \nspecific safeguards on section 702 collection, including review and \napproval by the FISA Court of the AG-DNI certification and targeting \nand minimization procedures, a requirement that all acquisitions be \nconsistent with the fourth amendment, and explicit prohibitions against \ncertain conduct, such as intentionally targeting a U.S. person.\n  Because there are instances, however, in which we may need to target \nU.S. persons overseas who have betrayed their country as terrorists or \nspies, the FAA does include specific ways to do this. Similar to the \nauthorities in title I of FISA, sections 703 and 704 allow the FISA \nCourt to authorize collection against certain U.S. persons overseas. \nBefore the FAA, this type of collection was authorized by the Attorney \nGeneral and not by a court. The FAA enhanced the protections for U.S. \npersons by requiring individual FISA Court orders based on probable \ncause that the U.S. person is a foreign person, agent of a foreign \npower, or an officer or employee of a foreign power. As I understand \nit, most of the objections to the FAA relate to section 702 and what we \ncall incidental collection.\n  I recommend again that my colleagues review the unclassified FAA \nbackground paper that was sent by the AG and by the DNI to Congress \nlast February. That document was earlier made a part of the Record at \nmy request. This paper describes the FAA authorities in some detail, \nand it highlights the layers of oversight by all three branches of \ngovernment. These multiple oversight mechanisms are there primarily to \nprotect U.S. persons.\n  I can tell you firsthand from my work on the Intelligence Committee \non both the House and the Senate side that it is vigorous oversight. \nEvery aspect of the FAA gets looked at closely by the executive branch, \nfrom the dedicated personnel responsible for operating the system, up \nthrough the managerial chain of command to the relevant inspectors \ngeneral and all of the lawyers at the National Security Division at the \nDepartment of Justice and at the agencies responsible for FAA \nimplementation. Twice a year, Congress gets reports on its \nimplementation on top of what we learn from hearings, oversight visits, \nbriefings, and notifications, as well as other reports that are given \nto Congress. The judicial branch, the FISA Court, plays its own key \nrole by reviewing the certifications and the targeting and minimization \nprocedures and ensuring that all of those comply with the law.\n\n  I cannot say that the implementation of the FAA has been perfect. \nCertainly there have been a few mistakes along the way over the past \nseveral years. Sometimes technology does not always work the way it is \nsupposed to, and sometimes there is a disconnect between the way a \ncollection device actually works and the way it has been described by \nthe lawyers. But I can tell you that on those few occasions where \nsomething has not been quite right with how these authorities have been \nused, the oversight mechanisms put in place by the FAA have worked \nexactly as intended by Congress. When a problem arises, the Justice \nDepartment knows about it, the FISA Court knows about it, and Congress \nknows about it. The collection related to the problem stops until the \nproblem gets fixed.\n  In my experience, the FAA is one of the most tightly overseen \nactivities within the intelligence community. I know some people \nbelieve more oversight is needed, but I do not think there is \njustification for that. I am concerned that if we add more IG reviews, \nfor example, we run the risk of taking scarce resources away from \nactual analysis and operations. That is not the right course, \nespecially when we know the existing oversight mechanisms are working \nso well. These FAA authorities are simply too important to lose.\n  We have a bill before us that has passed the House and can be sent \nstraight from this body to the White House for signature by the \nPresident. The President has said he will sign the House bill as soon \nas he receives it from this body. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nvoting for a clean extension of the FISA Amendments Act until December \n31, 2017.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak for up to 30 minutes and that be under the time allotted to \nSenator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise, as many have today, \nto talk about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Before I get \nto the substance of my remarks, I wish to acknowledge the great \nleadership and work that both the chairwoman and the vice chairman \nprovide for the committee. We would not be here today without their \nfocus and their commitment to maintaining the best intelligence \ncommunity, I believe, in the world. I also want to thank my colleague \nSenator Wyden and the others who have spoken today on the floor about \nthe authorities under the FISA Amendments Act.\n  I would suggest that most Americans likely do not recognize the name \nof the bill, but I am certain they have heard about what this bill \naddresses; that is, government surveillance of communications. This is \nan issue that is critical to get right because if it is done wrong, it \ncan strike at the core of our constitutional freedoms. So I wanted to \nthank our Senate leadership today for providing us time to discuss what \nis a very important issue. I might suggest that the topic at hand is \nimportant\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\nenough to require multiple days of debate, but given the gravity and \nthe number of other issues we must confront before the end of the year, \nI am grateful for this debate and the discussion we are having for most \nof this day.\n  Some observers may even question why we are taking even this limited \namount of time to debate a bill we here in the Senate expect to pass \neasily. The truth is that even though many Senators are likely to vote \nfor this bill, it is incomplete and it needs reforms. In fact, part of \nthe reason this debate is so important is because I believe Congress \nand the public do not have an adequate understanding of the effect this \nlaw has had and could have on the privacy of law-abiding American \ncitizens.\n  This is an important subject. It is an important question. That is \nwhy a number of us have taken to the floor today to spend some time \nhighlighting the issues at hand in the hopes our colleagues will join \nus in striking the right balance, one that preserves foundational \nvalues and constitutional liberties while still allowing us to \neffectively and forcefully prosecute our war on terror.\n  I was a Member of the House in 2008 when the FISA Amendments Act \npassed Congress and was signed into law. I voted for it then, along \nwith most of my Democratic colleagues in the House.\n  In March 2008 many of us in the House viewed the FISA Amendments \nAct--or the FAA, in shorthand--as an improvement over the status quo. \nWhy was that so? It was because it put a legal framework around \nPresident Bush's warrantless wiretapping program and it updated the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act--or FISA, as it is known in \nshorthand--to respond to changes in technology and to hold that \nadministration accountable.\n  As I noted 4 years ago during that debate, the bill also included \nimportant provisions that for the first time required intelligence \nagencies to seek a judge's permission before monitoring the \ncommunications of Americans overseas. That meant the Federal Government \ncould no longer monitor the e-mail or phone calls of Americans overseas \nwithout a warrant.\n  In my remarks, I am going to talk on a number of occasions about \nwarrants and the check they provide on government overreach. That was \nan important part of that debate in 2008. Back in that year, back in \n2008, it was Senator Wyden, who is here on the floor today, who was \ninstrumental in including that particular provision in the final FISA \nAmendments Act legislation. From the perspective of a House Member at \nthat time, I was pleased, glad, and appreciated that we had Senator \nWyden's leadership right here in the Senate.\n  I now have the great privilege to serve on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee with Senator Wyden. I have to admit that from the position I \nnow have, I am viewing the FISA Amendments Act through a different \nlens. As a member of that committee, I learned a great deal more about \nour post-9/11 surveillance laws and how they have been implemented. In \nthe course of my 2 years on the committee, I have determined that there \nare reforms that need to be made to the FISA Amendments Act before we \nrenew it into law.\n  As we prepare to renew the FISA Amendments Act for the first time \nsince 2008, it is important that we take this opportunity to address \nseveral flaws that have become apparent to me and a number of our \ncolleagues. Fortunately, the sunset provision in the original bill \neffectively provides us with that opportunity so that today we can \nensure that the statute still tracks with our foreign intelligence \nrequirements and the interests of the American people. In addition, to \nremain an effective law, the sunset provision helps ensure that the \nFISA Amendments Act's authorities keep up with today's state of \ntechnology.\n  Let me be clear that I strongly believe that for our national \nsecurity, the Federal Government needs ways in which to monitor \ncommunications to ensure that we remain a step ahead of our enemies and \nterrorists. I also strongly believe we need to balance the civil \nliberties embodied in our Constitution with our ongoing fight against \nterrorists.\n  We need only look to recent history to understand why Congress needs \nto keep a tight rein on these surveillance efforts. It was in the \nmonths after 9/11, just shortly after 9/11 that President Bush first \nauthorized what we now refer to as the secret warrantless wiretapping \nprogram. Many legitimate concerns were raised about that program, and \nCongress wisely went back and put some limits on it in that 2008 law. \nBut we have an opportunity to discuss today whether those limits went \nfar enough and whether the circumstances that prompted the creation of \nthe program in 2001 and its passage into law in 2008 still justify its \nexistence today.\n  I am a member of both the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees, \nand I will be the first to say that terrorism remains a serious threat \nto the United States, and we must be as diligent as ever in protecting \nour fellow American citizens. I can also say with confidence that the \nFISA Amendments Act has been beneficial to the protection of our \nnational security.\n  In the Senate Intelligence Committee, I receive regular briefings on \nour efforts to combat terrorism abroad and here at home in the United \nStates, including the benefits and accomplishments of the FISA \nAmendments Act. I think the threats--I should say I not only think, I \nknow the threats we still face today do justify the extension of these \nauthorities. I don't question the value of the foreign intelligence the \nFAA provides. But my question to my colleagues and the administration \nis whether a 5-year straight extension of these authorities, without \nany changes, is the best way forward. In my view, it is not.\n  I recognize that even after Osama bin Laden's death, we still face \nnumerous threats. Make no mistake about it, terrorism is a serious \nthreat to our homeland and to American lives, and terrorism has also \nforced us to have a conversation about our civil liberties and the \nbalance between our privacy and the need to confront threats to our \nNation. I strongly believe our commitment to protect the American \npeople should not force us to abandon the foundational principles that \nmake us a beacon for the rest of the world. This is a false choice. We \nmust, as the Federal Government and the protectors of our Constitution, \nprotect the constitutional liberties of the American people and live up \nto the standard of transparency our democracy demands.\n  As I mentioned, I am the only Senator on our side of the aisle who \nserves on both the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services \nCommittee, and I believe I have a unique perspective when evaluating \nthe critical balance between protecting our national security and the \nrights of American citizens. It is the responsibility of Congress to \nfind that balance between the will of the many and the rights of the \nfew, the security of the country and the freedom of its citizens. In \ntimes of war and crisis, finding this balance--and it is a delicate \nbalance--can be even more challenging, and there are unfortunate times \nin our Nation's history when we have lost sight of our principles and \nwhat the United States represents as a nation.\n  I understand that the law requires the intelligence community to \nconduct oversight of FAA implementation, that the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court reviews the legality of the procedures, and that the \ncongressional Intelligence Committees conduct our oversight of FISA \nprograms. But nearly all of this oversight is conducted in secret. I \nknow my constituents trust me to conduct this oversight, but I believe \nthe people too have a role in keeping a watchful eye on the government.\n  As Senators Rockefeller and Wyden wrote in a letter to the Bush \nadministration officials in 2008, ``secrecy comes with a cost'' which \ncan--and I want to quote these two valued and wise Senators--``make it \nchallenging for Members of Congress and the public to determine whether \nthe law adequately protects both national security and the privacy \nrights of law-abiding Americans.''\n\n  With that general overview, I wish to talk about some of the \nspecifics in this particular bill we are considering today. I would \nlike to get to the core of my concerns.\n  As my colleagues know, section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act \nestablished a legal framework for the government to acquire foreign \nintelligence by targeting non-U.S. persons who are reasonably believed \nto be located outside\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\nthe United States under a program approved by FISA and the FISA Court, \nI should add. Because section 702 does not involve obtaining individual \nwarrants, it contains language specifically intended to limit the \ngovernment's ability to use these new authorities to deliberately spy \non American citizens.\n  Earlier this year Senator Wyden and I opposed the bill reported out \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee extending the expiration date of \nthe FISA Amendments Act of 2008 from December 2012 to June 2017. We \nopposed this long-term extension because we believe Congress does not \nhave an adequate understanding of the effect this law has had on the \nprivacy of law-abiding citizens. In our view, it is important for \nMembers of Congress and the public to have a better understanding of \nthe foreign intelligence surveillance conducted under the FAA so that \nCongress can consider whether the law should be modified rather than \nsimply extended without changes.\n  This has been a longstanding quest for a number of us. In fact, while \nI have been outspoken on this issue, the effort to better understand \nthe FAA's implementation precedes my time on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. Senator Wyden and others have been pressing the intelligence \nagencies for years to provide more information to Congress and the \npublic about the effect of this law on Americans' privacy.\n  I think Senator Wyden and the others would agree with me that to his \ncredit, the Director of National Intelligence in July 2012 agreed to \ndeclassify some facts about how the secret FISA Court has ruled on this \nlaw. So what did we learn from that declassification? Well, \nspecifically, it is now public information that on at least one \noccasion, the FISA Court has ruled that some collection carried out by \nthe government under the FISA Amendments Act violated the fourth \namendment. The court has also ruled that the government has \ncircumvented the spirit of the law.\n  So much about this law's impact remains secret. What do I mean by \nthat? Well, for example, Senator Wyden, I, and others have been trying \nto get a rough estimate of how many Americans have had their phone \ncalls or e-mails collected and reviewed under these authorities. The \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence told us in July 2011 \nthat ``it is not reasonably possible to identify the number of people \nlocated in the United States whose communications may have been \nreviewed'' under the FISA Amendments Act.\n  We are prepared to accept that it might be difficult to come up with \nan exact count of this number, but it is hard for us to believe that \nthe Director of National Intelligence and the whole of the intelligence \ncommunity cannot come up with at least a ballpark estimate. This is \ndisconcerting. Our concern about numbers is this: If no one has even \nestimated how many Americans have had their communications collected \nunder the FISA Amendments Act, then it is possible that this number \ncould be quite large.\n  So how did we respond? Well, during a markup in our committee, we \noffered an amendment that would have directed the inspectors general of \nthe intelligence community and the Department of Justice to produce a \nrough estimate of how many Americans have had their communications \ncollected under section 702. Our amendment did not pass, but we will \ncontinue our efforts to obtain this information because the American \npeople deserve to know.\n  There are those who are satisfied with the law's current privacy \nprotections, and they point out that classified minimization procedures \nguide how government officials handle information on Americans' \ncommunications. But I don't believe those procedures are a substitute \nfor strong privacy protections incorporated into the law itself. Do we \nreally want accountability for those protections to be secret? Do we \nreally want to be dependent upon the good will of future \nadministrations to keep faith with the so-called minimization \nprocedures?\n  That is why I believe the FISA Amendments Act extension should \ninclude clear rules prohibiting the government from searching through \nthe incidental or accidental collection of these communications unless \nthe government has obtained a warrant or emergency authorization \npermitting surveillance of that American. Our founding principles \ndemand no less.\n  Senator Wyden and I offered an amendment during the committee's \nmarkup of this bill that would have clarified the law to prohibit such \nsearches. Our amendment included exceptions for searches that involve a \nwarrant or an emergency authorization, as well as for searches on phone \ncalls or e-mails of the people who are believed to be in danger or who \nconsent to the search, each of which is important.\n  Our amendment to close this backdoor search loophole did not pass in \ncommittee, but we remain concerned--I would say very concerned--that \nthis loophole could allow the government to effectively conduct \nwarrantless searches for Americans' communications. Especially since we \ndo not know how many Americans may have had their phone calls and e-\nmails collected under this law, we believe it is particularly important \nto have strong rules in place to protect the privacy of our fellow \nAmericans.\n  As the majority report noted when the Senate bill passed out of the \ncommittee: ``Congress recognized at the time the FISA Amendments Act \nwas enacted that it is simply not possible to collect intelligence on \nthe communications of a party of interest without also collecting \ninformation about the people with whom, and about whom, that party \ncommunicates, including in some cases nontargeted U.S. persons.''\n  Therefore, I understand that in scooping up large amounts of data, it \nmay be impossible not to accidentally catch some Americans' \ncommunications along the way--seems logical. The language of the law--\nthe collection of foreign intelligence of U.S. persons reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States--anticipates that \nincidental or accidental collection of Americans' e-mails or phone \ncalls would, in fact, occur. But under the FISA Amendments Act, as it \nis written, there is nothing to prohibit the intelligence community \nfrom searching through a pile of communications, which may have \nincidentally or accidentally been collected without a warrant, to \ndeliberately search for the phone calls or e-mails of specific \nAmericans.\n  Again, I understand--and I think I can speak for Senators Wyden and \nothers of us who have this concern--this could happen by accident. But \nI don't think the government should be doing this on purpose without \ngetting a warrant or an emergency authorization regarding the American \nthey are looking for.\n  I have noted that Senator Wyden and I call this the backdoor searches \nloophole. Understandably, the Intelligence Committee doesn't much like \nthat term, arguing there is no loophole. But I think we are going to \nhave to agree to disagree on the terminology. I don't believe, though, \nthat Congress intended to authorize the searches when they voted for \nthe FISA Amendments Act in 2008. I know I certainly didn't.\n  The intelligence agencies have not denied that section 702 gives the \nNSA the authority to conduct these searches, and it is a matter of \npublic record the intelligence community has sought to preserve this \nauthority. If it is not classified that intelligence agencies have this \nauthority and it is not classified they would like to keep it, we think \nit is reasonable to tell the public whether and how it has ever been \nused. Yet when Senator Wyden and I and 11 other Senators asked whether \nintelligence agencies have already done this, we were told the answer \nwas classified.\n  My concern is that this section 702 loophole could be used to \ncircumvent traditional warrant protections and search for the \ncommunications of a potentially large number of American citizens. The \nSenate Intelligence Committee majority report argues there may be \ncircumstances in which there is a legitimate foreign intelligence need \nto conduct queries on data already in its possession, including data \nfrom accidentally or incidentally collected communications of \nAmericans. I would argue, if there is evidence that an American is a \nterrorist or spy or involved in a serious crime, the government should \nbe permitted to search for the communications of that American by \ngetting a warrant or an emergency authorization.\n  In that spirit, Senator Wyden and I have offered this backdoor \nsearches\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\nloophole amendment once again to this bill, and we intend to continue \nto bring attention to this issue until our colleagues grasp what could \nbe at stake should this loophole not be closed. We have also filed a \nsecond amendment which seeks to instill some transparency to \nsurveillance conducted under FISA Amendments Act authorities.\n  What is included in this amendment? It requires the Director of \nNational Intelligence to provide information to Congress that we have \nrequested before but that we have not yet received, including a \ndetermination of whether any government entity has produced an estimate \nof the number of U.S. communications collected under the FISA \nAmendments Act; an estimate of such number, if any exists; an \nassessment of whether any wholly domestic U.S. communications have been \ncollected under the FISA Amendments Act; a determination of whether any \nintelligence agency has ever attempted to search through communications \ncollected under the FISA Amendments Act to find the phone calls or e-\nmails of a specific American without obtaining a warrant or emergency \nauthorization to do so; and finally, a determination of whether the NSA \nhas collected any type of personally identifiable information on more \nthan 1 million Americans.\n  The amendment states the report produced by the Director of National \nIntelligence shall be made available to the public, but it gives the \nPresident the authority to make any redactions he believes are \nnecessary to protect national security.\n  Colleagues, I am going to conclude by restating my belief that the \nAmerican people need a better understanding of how the FISA Amendments \nAct, section 702, in particular, has affected the privacy of our fellow \nAmericans. I also believe we need new protections against potential \nwarrantless searches for Americans' communications. I believe without \nsuch reforms Congress should not simply extend the law for 5 years.\n  We need to strike a better balance between giving our national \nsecurity and law enforcement officials the tools necessary to keep us \nsafe but not damage the very constitution we have sworn to support and \ndefend. National security and civil liberties can coexist. We do not \nneed to choose between them.\n  In Federalist 51, James Madison stated--and I would like to quote \nthat great American:\n\n       In framing a government which is to be administered by men \n     over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first \n     enable the government to control the governed; and in the \n     next place oblige it to control itself.\n\n  The bill that is before us could come closer to that standard if we \nimprove it through some of the amendments being offered by my \ncolleagues and me, but it does not live up to that standard now. The \nAmerican people deserve their privacy, they deserve to know how the \nintelligence community interprets and implements this law, and, \nfrankly, they deserve better than the protections put before us today.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the gravity of the issues at hand \nand seriously consider and contemplate the effect of another 5 years of \nunchanged FAA authorities.\n  I appreciate the attention of the Chair and the patience of my \ncolleagues on this important matter. I yield the floor, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I note the Wyden amendment has not \nyet been called up. Someone may wish to do so.\n  First of all, though vice chairman Chambliss isn't here, he said some \nvery nice things, and I just want him to know that one of the best \nexperiences of my Senate career has been the ability to work in a \nbipartisan way in the Intelligence Committee, to put things together \nbetween both sides, and to have staffs working together on both sides. \nSometimes that isn't possible, but most of the time it is, and I think \nit is the way the Intelligence Committee was supposed to function. The \nfact that it does function that way, I think, is real testimony to Vice \nChairman Chambliss and the work we have done together.\n  I find this particular amendment very frustrating because I have \ntried to be as helpful as I could over many years in getting \ninformation released in a classified form for Members of the committee. \nIn fact, we have been very successful in that regard. There are \napproximately eight big reports a year now that present information in \na classified function. There are two reports from the Attorney General \nand the DNI assessing compliance with the targeting and minimization \nprocedures and the acquisition guidelines of section 702. There are \nalso reports required on the implementation of title VII. That report \nincludes actions taken to challenge or enforce a directive under \nsection 702, and a description of any incident of noncompliance. There \nare annual reviews by each agency responsible for implementing these \nsections, regular reviews by the IG of the Department of Justice and \nthe IG of each agency. It goes on and on and on. Yet there is no \nsatisfaction from some Senators.\n  I believe that the Senators who support this amendment are trying to \nmaximize the public release of this information, but I would encourage \nSenators to remember that this is a classified program. The information \nis available, but it is available in classified form.\n  The proponents of these amendments leave out the fact that each year \nthe program is approved by the FISA Court. This is a court of 11 judges \nappointed by the Chief of the Supreme Court, all of whom are Federal \ndistrict court judges.\n  The administration has decided the program should remain classified, \nand so we do our level best to provide the information on a classified \nbasis and information is declassified when it can be. But the Wyden \namendment goes a step too far. It could remove the classification from \nmost of this program and create a way to make more information public \nthat could well jeopardize the future of the program.\n  I think vice chairman Chambliss would agree with me. One of the \nthings we have seen is that this program is valuable, and the ability \nto collect intelligence and use that intelligence wisely and, with \noversight from appropriate agencies, this program saves lives in this \ncountry. I know there are people trying to attack this country all the \ntime. I know in the last 4 years there have been 100 terrorism-related \narrests. Therefore, the classified information, which is available--but \navailable in a secure room for Members to read--is important. I would \nurge, as vice chairman Chambliss has urged, that Members go and read \nthis information.\n  I would like to quote from the letter sent to Speaker Boehner, Leader \nReid, and Minority Leaders Pelosi and McConnell from the Director of \nNational Intelligence on this provision, section 702, which authorizes \nsurveillance directed at non-U.S. persons located overseas who are of \nforeign intelligence importance. The letter says all of the process--\nand it is pages and pages--is carried out in a classified form but to \ninform the Members who are the ones to provide the oversight. I mean, \nwe are the public check on the Executive Branch. We are not of the \nintelligence community. We are the public, and it is our oversight, it \nis our due diligence to go in and read the classified material.\n  So this amendment is an effort to make more of that information \npublic, and I think it is a mistake at this particular time because I \nthink it will create a risk to the program. I think it will make us \nless secure, not more secure.\n  There are parts of the collection apparatus which are classified, and \nat this stage they are classified for good reason. So I have a \nfundamental opposition to this amendment. But of more immediate \nconcern, we have 4 days to get this bill signed by the President or \nthis section ceases to function--4 days.\n  This is the House bill that is before us. It reauthorizes the program \nto 2017, and we have been through this before. We can make changes. I \nhave tried to work with Senator Wyden, to the greatest extent possible, \nby delving\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\ninto these issues at hearings of the Intelligence Committee and by \nsupporting his requests for information. I have offered to Senator \nMerkley today to work with him to consider whether his proposal should \nbe part of our intelligence authorization bill next year. I don't know \nwhat else to do because I know where this goes, and where it goes is \nthat there may be an intent by some to undercut the program. I don't \nwant to see it destroyed. I want to see us do our job of oversight, \nwhich means reading and studying the classified material and, if \nsomething isn't there, getting it in a classified manner.\n  This is a very difficult issue that requires a great deal of study. \nAnd consider the threats that are out there. If it weren't for the FBI, \nNajibullah Zazi would have blown up the New York subway and it was \nbecause of intelligence received that the FBI was able to follow him \nand eventually arrest him and other co-conspirators.\n  If I thought this country was out of danger, it might be different. \nBut I believe we are still at risk, and I believe there are people who \nwill kill Americans if they have the opportunity to do so. One of our \njobs here in Congress is to see that the intelligence apparatus within \nthe American Government functions in a way so that intelligence is \nstreamlined, that it gets to the right place, that it stops terrorist \nplots before they can be carried out.\n  So, I say this in good conscience to Senator Wyden. My great fear is \nthat all of this information gets declassified and put out in public \nand then something that reveals sources and methods is disclosed, \nperhaps even inadvertently. Then, before we know it, the program is \ndestroyed. I don't want to see this program destroyed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe his time is up.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I believe I control additional time. How \nmuch time does our side have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 39 minutes of general debate time \nremaining to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I am going to be very brief in terms of \nresponding to Senator Feinstein, the distinguished chair.\n  First of all, there is no question the chair of the committee is \ncorrect that this is a dangerous time. That is specifically why, at \npage 6 of my amendment on the report, I include a redaction provision.\n\n       If the President believes that public disclosure of \n     information in the report required by the subsection could \n     cause significant harm to national security, the President \n     may redact such information from the report made available to \n     the public.\n\n  The bottom line: If the President believes any information that is \nmade public would jeopardize our country at a dangerous time, the \nPresident is given full discretion with respect to redaction.\n  Point No. 2. The chair of the committee is absolutely right; this is \nan important time for national security. It is also an important time \nfor American liberties. We know the people of this country want to \nstrike a balance between protecting our security and protecting our \nliberties. So under the reporting amendment all we require is, first, \nan estimate, just the question of an estimate and whether it has been \ndone by any entity with respect to collecting this information--no new \nwork, just a response to the question of whether an estimate has been \ndone.\n  Second, we request information on whether any wholly domestic \ncommunications have been collected under section 702, and then we ask \nwhether there have been any backdoor searches under the legislation. \nFinally, we want a response with respect to what the Director of \nNational Security meant when he said: ``The story that we have millions \nor hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is absolutely false.''\n  That is what we are talking about. I think, without that information, \noversight in the intelligence field will essentially be toothless. This \ninterrupts no operations in the intelligence field. It does not \njeopardize sources and methods. It is, in my view, the fundamentals of \ndoing real oversight.\n  I thank my colleague from Kentucky for giving me this time, and I \nclose by saying: No disagreement with the distinguished chair in the \nfact that there are real threats to this country's well-being and \nsecurity, and that is why the President is given complete discretion in \norder to redact any information that would be made public.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from Kentucky for the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are going to have two or three votes at \n5:30. A number of the Senators who have amendments dealing with the \nsupplemental have agreed to come at that time as soon as the votes are \nover and start debating those amendments tonight. We would like to get \nas much of that debate out of the way tonight as possible so we can \nstart voting at a reasonably early time tomorrow.\n  The debate today on FISA has been stimulating, has been very thorough \nand good. As I understand it, there are three FISA amendments we are \ngoing to vote on tonight. That will still leave Senator Wyden's \namendment, and we will worry about taking care of that tomorrow \nsometime.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 any remaining debate time on the \npending amendments--Leahy, Merkley, and Paul--be yielded back and the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the pending amendments in the \norder provided in the previous agreement; that there be 2 minutes, \nequally divided, prior to each vote and that all after the first vote \nbe 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object. Might I ask tomorrow \nwhen the intelligence votes will take place?\n  Mr. REID. We don't have the intelligence to do that right now.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is too classified.\n  Mr. REID. We have two very important measures to finish. I appreciate \nthe collegiality of the Senators on this most important piece of \nlegislation dealing with the espionage on our country part, and we \nshould be able to work it out tomorrow. But we have 21 amendments we \nhave to dispose of dealing with the supplemental. Some of those will be \nagreed to and would not need votes, but we have a lot of debate time on \nthat in addition to votes. If we just did the votes alone, it would be \n8 hours of voting.\n  We hope to be able to narrow that down, as soon as we have something \nmore definite, so the Senator and Senator Wyden and others can complete \nthe time, and set up a time that is appropriate for Senator Wyden's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the \nleader. I think the chairman and I--and I assume those who have \namendments that will be remaining, I guess one amendment remaining and \nthen final passage. If we could complete debate tonight, we would be \nprepared, at the pleasure of the leader, to go ahead and finalize the \nFISA amendments.\n  Mr. REID. It would be very important to do that. I don't want to \npress the Senator from Oregon. He has been very good and flew all night \nfrom his newborn to get here from Oregon, and he was here at 10 a.m. I \ndon't want to press him anymore.\n  I say, through the Chair, to my friend from Oregon, how does he feel \nabout finishing the debate tonight?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I wish to thank the distinguished leader who has been so \nhelpful in ensuring that we have a real debate.\n  With my colleagues' indulgence, my understanding from the leader is \nwe would have 15 minutes on each side at some point in the morning. If \nwe could proceed with what I thought was the direction we were going, I \nwould very much appreciate it. But it should be limited to 15 minutes \non each side, pro and con, at some point in the session tomorrow.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, through the Chair, if I could ask the \nSenator from Oregon, is the Senator talking 15 minutes on his amendment \nand 15 minutes on passage? Fifteen minutes on each, on your amendment \nand vote on it and go to final passage?\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is fine. Through the Chair, 15 minutes with respect to \nour side reporting the amendment, 15 minutes on the other side, it will \nbe voted on, and then we go to final passage.\n  Mr. REID. I would suggest this. When we come in, in the morning, why \ndon't\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\nwe have this the first order of business. We would have the half hour \nevenly divided, vote on the Wyden amendment, and then final passage. \nThat way we could devote the rest of the day and tonight to the \nsupplemental.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be the case in addition to what I just \ndid here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am going to proceed in my leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, you will excuse me if I am a little \nfrustrated at the situation in which we find ourselves.\n  Last night, President Obama called myself and the Speaker--and maybe \nothers--from Hawaii and asked if there was something we could do to \navoid the fiscal cliff.\n  I say I am a little frustrated because we have been asking the \nPresident and the Democrats to work with us on a bipartisan agreement \nfor months--literally, for months--on a plan that would simplify the \nTax Code, shrink the deficit, protect the taxpayers, and grow the \neconomy, but Democrats consistently rejected those offers.\n  The President chose instead to spend his time on the campaign trail. \nThis was even after he got reelected, and congressional Democrats have \nsat on their hands. Republicans have bent over backward. We stepped way \nout of our comfort zone. We wanted an agreement, but we had no takers. \nThe phone never rang.\n  So now here we are, 5 days from New Year's Day, and we might finally \nstart talking. Democrats have had an entire year to put forward a \nbalanced, bipartisan proposal. If they had something to fit the bill, I \nam sure the majority leader would have been able to deliver the votes \nthe President would have needed to pass it in the Senate and we \nwouldn't be in this mess. But here we are, once again, at the end of \nthe year, staring at a crisis we should have dealt with literally \nmonths ago.\n  Make no mistake. The only reason Democrats have been trying to \ndeflect attention onto me and my colleagues over the past few weeks is \nthat they don't have a plan of their own that could get bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The so-called Senate bill the majority leader keeps referring to \npassed with only Democratic votes, and despite his repeated calls for \nthe House to pass it, he knows as well as I do that he himself is the \nreason it can't happen. The paperwork never left the Senate, so there \nis nothing for the House to vote on.\n  As I pointed out before we took that vote back on July 25, the \nDemocratic bill is, ``a revenue measure that didn't originate in the \nHouse, so it has got no chance whatsoever of becoming law.'' The only \nreason we ever allowed that vote on that proposal, as I said at that \ntime, was we knew it didn't pass constitutional muster. If Democrats \nwere truly serious, they would proceed to a revenue bill that \noriginated in the House--as the Constitution requires and as I called \non them to do again last week.\n  To repeat, the so-called Senate bill is nothing more than a glorified \nsense of the Senate resolution. So let's put that convenient talking \npoint aside from here on out.\n  Last night, I told the President we would be happy to look at \nwhatever he proposes, but the truth is we are coming up against a hard \ndeadline. As I said, this is a conversation we should have had months \nago. Republicans are not about to write a blank check for anything \nSenate Democrats put forward just because we find ourselves at the edge \nof the cliff. That would not be fair to the American people.\n\n  That having been said, we will see what the President has to propose. \nMembers on both sides of the aisle will review it and then we will \ndecide how best to proceed. Hopefully, there is still time for an \nagreement of some kind that saves the taxpayers from a wholly \npreventable economic crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am not sure my distinguished Republican \ncounterpart has followed what has taken place in the House of \nRepresentatives. In the House, as reported by the press and we all know \nit, one of the plans--it did not have a name, it was not Plan B, I \ndon't know what plan it was because they had a number over there--but \nthis plan was to show the American people that the $250,000 ceiling on \nraising taxes would not pass in the House. Why did they not have that \nvote? Because it would have passed. They wanted to kill it. The Speaker \nwanted to show everybody it would not pass the House, but he could not \nbring it up for a vote because it would have passed. A myriad of \nRepublicans think it is a fair thing to do and of course every Democrat \nwould vote for that.\n  The Republican leader finds himself frustrated that the President has \ncalled on him to help address the fiscal cliff. He is upset because \n``the phone never rang.'' He complains that I have not delivered the \nvotes to pass a resolution of the fiscal cliff, but he is in error. We \nall know that in July of this year we passed, in the Senate, relief for \nmiddle-class Americans. That passed the Senate.\n  We know Republicans have buried themselves in procedural roadblocks \non everything we have tried to do around here. Now they are saying we \ncannot do the $250,000 because it will be blue-slipped. How do the \nAmerican people react to that? There was a bill introduced by the \nranking member of the Ways and Means Committee in the House, Sandy \nLevin, that called for this legislation. The Speaker was going to bring \nit up to kill it, but he could not kill it. Then we moved to Plan B, \nthe debacle of all debacles. It is the mother of all debacles. That was \nbrought up in an effort to send us something. He could not even pass it \namong the Republicans it was so absurd--``he'' meaning the Speaker.\n  It is very clear now that the Speaker's No. 1 goal is to get elected \nSpeaker on January 3. The House is not even here. He has told them he \nwill give them 2 days to get back here--48 hours; not 2 days, 48 hours.\n  They do not even have enough of the leadership here to meet to talk \nabout it. They have done it with conference calls. People are spread \nall over this country because the Speaker basically is waiting for \nJanuary 3. The President campaigned on raising taxes on people making \nmore than $250,000 a year. The Bush-era tax cuts expire at the end of \nthis year. Obama was elected with a surplus of 3 million votes. He won \nthe election. He campaigned on this issue.\n  Again, the Speaker cannot take yes for an answer. The President has \npresented him something that would prevent us from going over the \ncliff. It was in response to something the Speaker gave to the \nPresident himself. But again, I guess, with the dysfunctional \nRepublican caucus in the House, even the Speaker cannot tell what they \nare going to do because he backed off even his own proposal. The House, \nwe hear this so often, is controlled by the Republicans. We acknowledge \nthat. I would be most happy to move forward on something Senator \nMcConnell said they would not filibuster over here, that he would \nsupport and that Boehner would support, if it were reasonable. But \nright now we have not heard anything. I don't know--it is none of my \nbusiness, I guess, although I am very curious--if the Republican leader \nover here and the Speaker are even talking.\n  What is going on here? You cannot legislate with yourself. We have \nnobody to work with, to compromise. That is what legislation is all \nabout, the ability to compromise. The Republicans in the House have \nleft town. The negotiations between the President and the Speaker have \nfallen apart, as they have for the last 3\\1/2\\ years. We have tried \nmightily to get something done.\n  I will go over the little drill, to remind everyone how unreasonable \nthe Republicans have been. Senator Conrad and Judd Gregg came up with a \nproposal to pattern what they wanted to do after the Base Closing \nCommission. The Commission would be appointed, they would report back \nto us, no filibusters, no amendments, yes or no, as we did with the \nbase closings. We did a great job there. We closed bases over two \ndifferent cycles, saving the country hundreds of billions of dollars. \nWe brought that up here--I brought it up. We had plenty of votes to do \nit, except the Republican cosponsors walked away and wouldn't vote for \nit. That is where Bowles-Simpson came from.\n\n[[Page S8419]]\n\n  Again, people talked about why don't we do Bowles-Simpson? One \nproblem: The Republicans appointed there would not vote for it, \ngenerally speaking.\n  Then we went through the months and months of talks between the \nPresident and Boehner. Both times Boehner could not deliver because \nthey refused, because of Grover Norquist, to allow any tax revenues \nwhatsoever. We had meetings with Vice President Biden and Cantor. \nCantor walked out of those meetings. He is the majority leader in the \nHouse. We had the Gang of 6, we had the Gang of 8, we had the \nsupercommittee. They were doing good things dealing with entitlements \nand revenues. One week before they were to report by virtue of statute \nI get a letter signed by virtually every Republican: Too bad about the \nsupercommittee, we are not going to do anything with revenues.\n  This is not a capsule of a couple days. This has been going on for \nyears. They cannot cross over the threshold that has been built by \nGrover Norquist. People who are rich, who make a lot of money, they are \nnot opposing raising the taxes on them. The only people in America who \ndo not think taxes should be raised on the rich are the Republicans who \nwork in this building. Any-time the Speaker and the Republican leader \ncome to the President and say we have a deal for you, the President's \ndoor is always open and mine is too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would only add the majority leader has given you his \nview of the last 2 years. I have certainly given you my take on it. The \nAmerican people have spoken, and they basically voted for the status \nquo. The President got reelected, the Senate is still in Democratic \nhands and the House is still in Republican hands and the American \npeople have spoken. They obviously expect us to come together and to \nproduce a result.\n  As I indicated, the President called me and probably called others \nlast night. My impression is he would like to see if we can move \nforward. We do not have very many days left. I have indicated I am \nwilling to enter into a discussion and see what the President may have \nin mind. I know the majority leader would certainly be interested in \nwhat the President has in mind. It appears to me the action, if there \nis any, is now on the Senate side. We will just have to see whether we \nare able, on a bipartisan basis, to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to have to decide, my friend \nsays, how we are going to move forward on a bipartisan basis. Even on \nthe Sunday shows we have just completed, with FOX network, Chris \nWallace pushed one of the Republican leaders very hard: Would you \nfilibuster something the Democrats brought to the floor? He refused to \nanswer the question. He would not say, and he kept being pressed.\n  We are in the same situation we have been in for a long time here. We \ncannot negotiate with ourselves because that is all we are doing. \nUnless we get a signoff from the Republicans in the House and the \nRepublican leader, we cannot get anything done. For them to talk about \na bipartisan arrangement, we have done that. The President has given \nthem one, given them two, given them three, and we cannot get past \nGrover Norquist. We tried hard, but when there is no revenue as part of \nthe package, it makes it very hard. John Boehner could not even pass a \ntax proposal that he suggested over there where he would keep the taxes \nthe same for everybody except people making over $1 million a year. No. \nGrover and the boys said, no, can't do that. He didn't even bring it up \nfor a vote.\n  I am here. I am happy to listen to anything the Speaker and the \nRepublican leader have. They have a way of getting to the President. \nThey don't need my help. I am happy to work with them any way I can, \nbut the way things have been going it is not a good escape hatch we \nhave. They are out of town now for 2 days, 48 hours. That is where we \nare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think all of us understand the gravity \nof the challenge we face. This so-called fiscal cliff has been subject \nto parody and comedy routines, but it is very serious. If Congress \nfails to act, enacting a measure to be signed by the President, the \ntaxes will go up on every single income-tax-paying American--every one \nof them; not just the wealthy but everyone. What it means, frankly, is \nwhether one lives in Connecticut, such as the Presiding Officer, or \nIllinois, such as myself, every family is going to see several things \nhappen automatically. Taxes will go up, the payroll tax cut that has \nhelped this economy is going to disappear, unemployment benefits are \ngoing to disappear for millions of Americans who are searching for \nwork, and many other changes will take place, none of which will be \nfavorable in terms of an economic recovery.\n  I think we ought to stop and reflect for a moment on lessons learned. \nHere is what I have learned. If we are going to solve this problem, we \nneed to do two things. We need to be prepared on both sides of the \ntable to give. That is a hard thing for many people to acknowledge, but \nwe do; we have to be willing to give on both sides of the table. I \nremember Senator Reid receiving a letter after the supercommittee was \nhard at work coming up with a bipartisan proposal. It was signed by \nvirtually every Senator on the other side of the aisle and it said: Do \nnot include a penny of revenue.\n  That was the end of the supercommittee. There was no place to go at \nthat point. They have to be willing to give on revenue, and we have to \nbe willing to give on our side, particularly in the area of \nentitlements. That is painful. I am one of those who believes, \nfrankly--I have said it over and over--Social Security should be taken \nfrom the table and put aside for a separate commission, a separate \ndebate. I do not believe it adds a penny to the deficit, and it should \nnot be a victim of deficit reduction when it has nothing to do with the \ncurrent deficit.\n  Second, I understand the importance of Medicaid to those who are \nyoung, single moms, the disabled, the elderly, those suffering from \nmental illness. Medicaid is critically important, and we cannot let \nthat be devastated, particularly in a struggling economy when so many \npeople are out of work or working at jobs without health insurance.\n  Third, Medicare. In 12 years Medicare will go bankrupt. It will be \ninsolvent. We have to sit down and honestly deal with entitlement \nreform that saves the programs; doesn't lose them to the Paul Ryan \nbudget approach but saves the programs in a fiscally responsible way.\n  That is the first thing we should agree on. Both sides have to come \ntogether and be prepared to give.\n  The second thing is it takes both sides. What Speaker Boehner proved \nto us last week is if they try to do so-called Plan B in the Republican \ncaucus: No hope. But if they take a measure to the floor of the House \nand invite Democratic and Republican support for it, they can pass it. \nI believe they can, as we can in the Senate.\n  That is what needs to be done. We need to have some grassroots \nefforts in the House and the Senate, of Senators from both sides of the \naisle who are prepared to work on a bipartisan basis to solve this \nproblem.\n  To say we should have done this long ago is to overlook the obvious. \nUntil November 6, we didn't know who the President would be for this \nnew administration, and now we do. It would have been a much different \ndebate with a different outcome if the American voters had not chosen \nPresident Obama to be reelected. So we had to wait until November 6, \nhonestly, before we could seriously take on the important and difficult \nissues involved in this debate, but that time has passed.\n  The President has stepped forward and has made a proposal. He has \nmade concessions on his proposal and he continues to be here. He flew \nback from a family vacation that I know is as important to him as it is \nto all our families over the holidays to be here in Washington and to \nbe part of the conversation and dialog.\n  I hope Speaker Boehner will bring back the House of Representatives. \nWe cannot do this alone. We must do this with their leadership and \ntheir cooperation. The point which has been made by Senator Reid over \nand over is that this is an issue and a challenge which we can \nsuccessfully resolve and we must before we go over the cliff.\n  Mr. President, the pending business is amendments to the FISA \nreauthorization bill. I rise to speak about that\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\nlegislation, which the Senate will vote on in a little over an hour.\n  As chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I have some concerns about this law known as the FISA \nAmendments Act. It does not have adequate checks and balances to \nprotect the constitutional rights of innocent American citizens. \nAlthough this legislation is supposed to target foreign intelligence, \nit gives our government broad authority to spy on Americans in the \nUnited States without adequate oversight by the courts or by Congress.\n  It is worth taking a moment to review the history that led to the \nenactment of the FISA Amendments Act. After 9/11, President George W. \nBush asked Congress to pass the PATRIOT Act. Many of us were concerned \nthat the legislation might go too far, but it was a time of national \ncrisis and we wanted to make sure the President had the authority to \nfight terrorism. We did not know then that shortly after we passed the \nPATRIOT Act, the Bush administration began spying on American citizens \nin the United States without the judicial approval otherwise required \nby law and without authorization from Congress.\n  Years later, the Judiciary Committee on which I serve heard dramatic \ntestimony from former Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey about the \nefforts of Andrew Card and White House counsel Alberto Gonzales to \npressure Attorney General John Ashcroft into reauthorizing this \nsurveillance of American citizens while Ashcroft was in the hospital.\n  After the New York Times revealed the existence of the warrantless \nsurveillance program, the Bush administration demanded that Congress \npass legislation authorizing the program. This led to enactment of the \nFISA Amendments Act in 2008. In short, this legislation was born in \noriginal sin.\n  Congress added some oversight requirements and civil liberties \nprotections to the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance \nprogram, but they did not go far enough. That is why I opposed the \noriginal FISA Amendments Act, along with the majority of Democratic \nSenators. I supported an earlier version offered by Senator Leahy, \nchairman of our Judiciary Committee, which would have authorized broad \nsurveillance powers but included civil liberties protections.\n  In 2008, the Bush administration accused opponents of this \nlegislation of not understanding the threat of terrorism. Vice \nPresident Cheney went so far as to say: ``The lessons of September 11th \nhave become dimmer and dimmer in some people's minds.''\n  I am sorry some supporters of this reauthorization legislation have \nrepeated this claim of the Bush administration by suggesting that those \nof us who want to protect the privacy of innocent Americans believe the \nthreat of terrorism has receded. That is not the case. The American \npeople will never forget the lessons of 9/11, and I personally will \nnot. We need to make sure our government has the authority it needs to \ndetect and monitor terrorist communications, but we also need to ensure \nthat we protect the constitutional rights of American citizens.\n  Earlier this year, I received a classified briefing on the FISA \nAmendments Act, and I am as concerned now as I was 4 years ago that the \nlegislation does not include sufficient checks to protect the \nconstitutional rights of innocent Americans.\n  The FISA Amendments Act is supposed to focus on foreign intelligence, \nbut the reality is that this legislation permits targeting an innocent \nAmerican in the United States as long as an additional purpose of the \nsurveillance is targeting a person outside the United States. This is \nknown as reversed targeting of American citizens.\n  The 2008 Judiciary Committee bill, which I supported, would have \nprevented reverse targeting by prohibiting warrantless surveillance if \na significant purpose of the surveillance is targeting a person in the \nUnited States. We have a Constitution and a due process procedure \nspelled out when it comes to surveillance of American citizens. The \nFISA Amendments Act has found a way around it, and I think that is a \nfatal flaw.\n  The FISA Amendments Act permits the government to collect every \nsingle phone call and e-mail to and from the United States. This is \nknown as bulk collection. The 2008 Judiciary Committee bill would have \nprohibited bulk collection of communications between innocent American \ncitizens and their friends and families outside the United States.\n  The FISA Amendments Act also permits the government to search all the \ninformation it collects during this bulk collection. The government can \neven search for the phone calls or e-mails of innocent American \ncitizens, and these searches can be conducted without a court order. \nThis kind of backdoor warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens \nshould not be allowed. Both parties ought to stand for our \nConstitution.\n\n  Earlier in this year in the Judiciary Committee's markup of FISA \nAmendments Act reauthorization, Senator Mike Lee and I offered a \nbipartisan amendment to prohibit backdoor warrantless surveillance of \nAmericans. Unfortunately, our amendment did not pass, so Americans will \nstill be at risk for this kind of surveillance if the FISA Amendments \nAct is reauthorized.\n  I am pleased the Senate will consider a number of amendments that \nwill at least add some transparency and oversight to the FISA \nAmendments Act so Congress and the American people will know about how \nthe government is using this authority.\n  I wish to thank majority leader Senator Reid for ensuring that the \nSenate will have the opportunity to debate and vote on these \namendments.\n  I am cosponsor of the Judiciary Committee chairman Pat Leahy's \namendment which was reported by the committee. This amendment would \nshorten the reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act from 5 years to \n3 years and strengthen the authority of the inspector general.\n  I am also cosponsor of an important bipartisan amendment offered by \nSenator Ron Wyden, who is on the floor. Senator Wyden, together with \nSenator Mark Udall, Senator Lee, and myself, has joined an amendment \nwhich would require the director of National Intelligence to provide a \nreport to Congress that includes, among other things, information on \nwhether any intelligence agency has ever attempted to search the \ncommunications collected under this legislation to find the phone calls \nor e-mails of a specific American without a warrant. Isn't this the \nkind of information Congress and the American people should have?\n  Senator Wyden is a senior member of the Intelligence Committee. He is \noffering this amendment because he has been frustrated in his attempts \nto obtain basic information about the use of surveillance powers by our \ngovernment authorized by the FISA Amendments Act.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Wyden and Senator Mark Udall asked the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence a fundamental question: \nHow many Americans have been subjected to surveillance under the FISA \nAmendments Act? The Office of the Director of National Intelligence \nclaimed it is not possible to answer that question. At a minimum, \nbefore the Senate acts to extend the FISA Amendments Act, Senators \nshould be given any information the intelligence community has about \nwhether innocent Americans have had their private e-mails and phone \nconversations swept up by FISA Amendments Act collection.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the bipartisan amendment that has \nbeen offered by Senators Jeff Merkley and Mike Lee. The Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act is interpreted by a secret court known as \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The Merkley-Lee amendment \nwould require that significant legal interpretations of FISA by this \nsecret court be declassified. The concept of secret law is anathema to \na democracy. The American people have a right to know how the laws \npassed by their elected representatives are being interpreted and \nimplemented.\n  I wish to thank Senators Merkley and Lee for taking up this cause. \nBack in 2003, I worked on a provision in the 9/11 intelligence reform \nbill that would have required the declassification of significant legal \ninterpretations by the FISA Court. Unfortunately, that provision was \nremoved from the final bill at the insistence of the Bush \nadministration.\n  Former Senator Russ Feingold, my predecessor as chairman of the \nConstitution Subcommittee, was also an\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\noutspoken advocate of declassifying FISA Court opinions, and back in \n2008 he held a hearing on the problem of secret law. This is an \nimportant issue, and I hope the Senate will approve the Merkley \namendment.\n  I am not aware of any substantive objections to the Leahy, Wyden, and \nMerkley amendments. The only concern I have heard is that if the Senate \napproves one of these amendments, this bill will have to go back to the \nHouse for final approval. There are still 4 days before the end of the \nyear, when the FISA Amendments Act expires, which is plenty of time for \nthe House to vote on the bill the Senate passes.\n  Even with these amendments, I am concerned this reauthorization of \nthe FISA Amendments Act does not include the checks and balances needed \nto preserve our basic freedoms and liberties. I believe we can be both \nsafe and free. We can give the government the authority it needs to \nprotect us from terrorism but place reasonable limits on government \npower to protect our constitutional rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the legislation \nwe are going to be voting on today. I want to refer to the Leahy \namendment just referred to by the Senator from Illinois.\n  Senator Leahy's amendment will act as a complete substitute to the \nbill that is on the floor and, if passed, it will require a conference \nwith the House of Representatives. It is December 27, and the House is \nnot coming back until the December 30. There simply is not time, even \nif the amendment was substantive enough that it ought to be considered \nfor passage, to get that conferenced with the House and get this bill \non the desk of President by December 31, which is when these provisions \nexpire.\n  The first change the Leahy amendment makes is to reduce the extension \nsunset from December 31, 2017, back to December 1, 2015. That date \ncoincides with the expiration of certain other FISA provisions; namely, \nthe roving wiretap authority, the business records court orders, and \nthe lone wolf.\n  It may seem like it ought to make sense that we have all of these \nexpiring at that time but, frankly--having been involved in the \nintelligence community for the last 12 years--it actually works in \nreverse from that and it would have a negative influence on the \ncommunity itself.\n  If we match the FAA sunset with the PATRIOT Act and IRPTA sunsets, it \nprovides no real benefit to congressional oversight and could actually \nincrease the risk that all these authorities will expire at the same \ntime. If they all expired at the same time, the community would \ncertainly be at a real disadvantage from an operational standpoint.\n  The Leahy amendment also makes a number of modifications to the \nexecutive branch oversight provisions that simply, I believe, are not \nnecessary. For example, the amendment would require the inspector \ngeneral of the Intelligence Community, ICIG, to conduct a mandatory \nreview of U.S. person privacy rights in the context of the FISA \nAmendments Act implementation. If we truly believe this sort of review \nby the ICIG is necessary, we don't need a statutory provision. We can \nsimply get a letter from the Intelligence Committee directing that be \ndone, and it will be done. So trying to think we need a statutory \nprovision on that type of issue--if there is any contemplation that it \nexists--is simply not necessary.\n  I am also concerned the Leahy substitute incorrectly elevates the \nICIG to the same level as the Attorney General and the Director of \nNational Intelligence by adding the ICIG as a recipient of FISA \nAmendments Act reviews that are conducted by the DOJ IG and other \nintelligence community element inspectors general. That doesn't make a \nlot of sense because the attorney general and the DNI are the only ones \nresponsible for jointly authorizing the collection of foreign \nintelligence information under the FAA. They are the ones who need to \nreview compliance assessments conducted by the relevant IGs, including \nthose conducted by the ICIG.\n  If there is concern about whether the ICIG can even conduct these \ntype of reviews, then I think the FAA is clear on that point. Since the \nODNI is authorized to acquire or receive foreign intelligence \ninformation, the ICIG can conduct these reviews to the same extent as \nany other inspector general of an element of the intelligence \ncommunity. He doesn't need redundant statutory authorization.\n  It is important to understand that the word ``acquire'' as used here \ndoesn't mean acquisition in the actual physical collection of foreign \nintelligence information. Rather, ``acquiring'' here simply means to \ncome into possession or control of, often by unspecified means. We know \nthis because in the annual review provision in the very next paragraph \nsought to be amended, the FAA uses the more precise conducting and \nacquisition terminology which clearly indicates that it affects only \nthose elements that are actually collecting foreign intelligence \ninformation.\n\n  This same annual review provision would also be modified by section 4 \nof Senator Leahy's amendment. His changes would expand the agency heads \nresponsible for conducting these annual reviews to any agency with \ntargeting or minimization procedures as opposed to the current law, \nwhich applies to only those agencies that are actually responsible for \nconducting an acquisition; that is, the physical collection of foreign \nintelligence information.\n  Right now, any IC element that receives downstream FISA collection \nmust comply with FISA's retention, dissemination, and use limitations. \nThey don't have any kind of blanket authority to use this information. \nBut the elements required in the annual reviews are geared more toward \nthe actual collectors of the foreign intelligence information than they \nare toward downstream IC elements that are already required to comply \nwith FISA's retention, dissemination, and use limitations.\n  The Intelligence Committee has been conducting oversight on this \ncollection program long before it was ever codified in the FISA \nAmendments Act. We worked closely with the Judiciary Committee to \ncarefully monitor the implementation of the FAA authorities by the \nexecutive branch. In the end, I am fully satisfied the FAA is working \nexactly as intended and in a manner that protects our rights as \nAmericans. As I have just explained, I do not believe Senator Leahy's \nproposed changes are necessary, nor do I believe they improve upon the \ncurrent practice.\n  I wish to just quickly address what the Senator from Illinois said \nabout the collection on U.S. persons. If one is collecting on someone \nwho is in Pakistan and they call somebody in the United States, he may \nbe a U.S. citizen or he may be a non-U.S. citizen, and if we are \ncollecting on him under a proper court order, there can be at times \ncollection on somebody inside the United States. But the FISA \nAmendments Act has a provision for dealing with that so that we have \nwhat we call minimization provisions in place that immediately do not \nallow the use of any information collected on a U.S. citizen in an \nunlawful manner.\n  The FISA Court is very tough, they are very strict, and they don't \njust grant an authority to allow our intelligence community to gather \ninformation on foreign suspects or foreign entities or somebody who is \nworking for a foreign power in any kind of household manner. They are \nvery strict in their requirements of what must be shown in order to be \nable to collect. So in the rare times there is a U.S. citizen on the \nother end of the line, the minimization provisions kick in, and they \nwork. They work very well. The Leahy substitute simply will not allow \nthe community to do the job we need to get done.\n  Secondly, I wish to address the Merkley amendment. Again, I oppose \nthis amendment. When Congress created the FISA Court back in 1978, it \nwas understood that this court would have to operate behind closed \ndoors given the sensitivity of the national security matters the court \nconsiders. Each time FISA has been amended, whether it is section 501 \ndealing with business records or 702 relating to targeting foreign \nterrorists overseas, Congress has maintained the same high level of \nprotection for the court's decisions. The Merkley amendment would make \nthose decisions public.\n  Section 601 of FISA already requires the Attorney General to provide \ncopies\n\n[[Page S8422]]\n\nof all decisions, orders, or opinions of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review \nthat include significant construction or interpretations of the \nprovisions of the entire act. So there are some reporting requirements \nright now in place.\n  The Merkley amendment would further require the Attorney General to \ndeclassify and make available to the public any of those decisions that \nrelate to section 501 business record court orders or section 702 \noverseas targeting provisions.\n  I believe the American people understand there are certain matters \nthat simply do not need to be made public, particularly when it comes \nto dealing with bad guys around the world, men who get up every morning \nand think about ways they can harm and kill Americans. Our folks in the \nintelligence community are doing a darn good job of gathering \ninformation on those types of individuals. Those are not the types of \nFISA Court orders, given by the court to gather that information that \nought to be made public.\n  In matters concerning the FISA Court, the congressional Intelligence \nand Judiciary Committees serve as the eyes and ears of the American \npeople. Through this oversight, which includes being given all \nsignificant decisions, orders, and opinions of the court, we can ensure \nthat the laws are being applied and implemented as Congress intended.\n  If a significant FISA Court decision raises concerns, the \nIntelligence and Judiciary Committees will ask questions--and we have \ndone that from time to time. We hold hearings, we get briefings, we \nreceive notifications and semiannual reports--all designed to give \nCongress good insight into the real-life applications and \ninterpretations of the FISA Act. This amendment does nothing to advance \nthat oversight, but it could cause real operational problems. If we put \nin the public domain declassified opinions or unclassified summaries of \nthe most significant court orders, we would give our enemies a roadmap \ninto our collection priorities and capabilities.\n  I know one of the responses is going to be that the specific \nintelligence sources and methods could be redacted, but that only \nsolves part of the problem. These guys we are dealing with, these bad \nguys around the world are smart guys. They are not idiots. When they \nlook at a declassified piece of intelligence information that has \nredacted portions, they are able to piece the puzzle back together \nagain and figure out exactly who those sources are and what their \nmethods are, which is going to put our intelligence gatherers in \njeopardy from a national security standpoint.\n\n  There is already substantial oversight of sections 501 and 702 by the \nFISA Court, the Department of Justice, the intelligence community, and \nthe Congress. I can't think of any two provisions in FISA that have \nreceived more attention and more scrutiny than sections 501 and 702. \nYet, as a result of this vigorous oversight, we also know these \nsections are two of the most carefully implemented by all of our \ninvestigative authorities.\n  This amendment sets a dangerous precedent and would undermine some of \nour most sensitive investigations and investigative techniques. Passing \nit would also impede our chances of getting a clean FAA extension to \nthe President, as I mentioned earlier in my comments.\n  Lastly, I wish to quickly mention the Paul amendment. Again, I am \ngoing to oppose this amendment because it is inconsistent with the \nConstitution and it contradicts decades of established Supreme Court \nprecedent and Federal law. Contrary to what this amendment says, there \nis no fourth amendment violation when the government gets information \nfrom a third party about a person who has voluntarily given that \ninformation to the third party. The Paul amendment would limit the \nability of our intelligence community and our prosecutors to take \ninformation that a bad guy has given to a third party, and we get that \ninformation from a third party, from that information being used in a \nprosecution against that bad guy.\n  In the U.S. v. Miller 1976 Supreme Court case, the Court stated that \nit ``has repeatedly held that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit \nthe obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by \nhim to Government authorities, even if the information is revealed on \nthe assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the \nconfidence placed in the third party will not be betrayed.'' Clearly, \nthat is language directly contrary to the Paul amendment. The Paul \namendment says the government would always have to either have consent \nor a search warrant to get information held by the third party in a \nsystem of records.\n  This amendment would have a significant impact not just on criminal \ncases, from drugs to violent crime to child offenses, but on national \nsecurity matters. Often, the information obtained from a system of \nrecords as described in this amendment is what we call building-block \ninformation. It is the basic information the law enforcement and \nintelligence communities use to build an investigation long before \nthere may be probable cause. This type of information can be used not \njust to build cases but to rule out people as suspects--in short, \nensuring they won't be subjected to more intrusive and investigative \nmeasures such as search warrants. Yet this amendment elevates building-\nblock information in the hands of a third party to the equivalent of \nprivately held information in which there is reasonable expectation of \nprivacy. Even though a person voluntarily hands over information to a \nthird party, this amendment says we should put the genie back in the \nbottle and now create a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n  What is more, if the government gets information from a third party \nwithout consent or a search warrant, this amendment says it can never \nbe used in a criminal prosecution. The message here to banks, hotels, \nshipping companies, fertilizer stores, you name it: Don't bother being \nGood Samaritans and give law enforcement tips about suspicious \nactivities. We will just take our chances and hope we get enough \nprobable cause in time to stop whatever crime or terrorist act may be \nplanned.\n  Simply stated, this amendment is contrary to case law and contrary to \nconstitutional provisions.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote against the Paul amendment, the \nMerkley amendment, as well as the Leahy amendment when we begin voting \nat 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, will my colleague from Georgia yield for \na question?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Sure. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague.\n  My colleague did address issues regarding the Merkley-Lee amendment, \nwhich has three stages in it designed to be sensitive to national \nsecurity. It says that if the Attorney General determines that an \nopinion is not dangerous to national security, it asks them to release \nit to the public. It says that if the Attorney General finds that it is \nsensitive to national security, to release only a summary so written as \nto protect national security. Then it goes even further to say that if, \nin the Attorney General's opinion, that is not possible, then please \njust give us a report on the process the executive branch has already \nsaid they are doing, which is to go through a systematic process of \ndetermining what they feel should be released independent of any advice \nwe in the Senate might have.\n  So in these three stages, national security is given full \nconsideration at each step. What it means is that in a situation where \nwe have language such as ``the government can collect information \nrelevant to an investigation,'' and the public wonders, well, is that \ninvestigation any investigation in the world, is it--what does \n``relevant'' mean? What does ``tangible information'' mean? There are \ndecisions that may confirm that the plain language operates in a \nfashion that protects the fourth amendment or those interpretations of \nFISA may, in fact, stand the statute on its head and open a door that \nwas meant to be, by what we did when we passed it here, open just a \nslit, to be turned into a wide-open gate.\n  So with those provisions to carefully protect national security, as \nthe Senator so rightly pointed out is necessary, can I perhaps win the \nSenator's support?\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Well, here is my problem with that provision, and it \nis twofold. First of all, there is the proverbial elephant's nose under \nthe tent theory, that this is the beginning of opening other things \ndown the road. I think that in this world in which we operate, this \ncloak-and-dagger world of the intelligence community--and we don't \noften like to think about the fact that it is necessary in modern \ntimes, but it is more necessary today than ever before because of the \nenemy we face--I think there is a real danger in beginning to open any \nof those opinions.\n  The second part of it is kind of tied to that as well. As I said \nearlier, these folks we are dealing with are very smart individuals. \nThese bad guys carry laptops, they communicate with encrypted messages \nthat we have to try to pick up on with the right kinds of \nauthorizations that the FISA Court gives us and do our best to figure \nout what they are doing in advance of them taking any action. And while \nwe may not think about a provision in an opinion coming out of the FISA \nCourt being a tipoff to bad guys about what we are doing or, more \nsignificantly, what they are doing that is alerting us, you better \nbelieve those guys are going to be examining every one of these \nopinions that we make public, and they are going to be reviewing those \nopinions, and they are going to, at some point in time, pick up on some \nsmall piece of information that is going to give them a shortcut next \ntime they plan an attack against America or Americans.\n\n  So I think for us to say that it is the personal opinion of the \nAttorney General that, well, maybe this does not involve national \nsecurity, but maybe it does, and we ought to go through those other \nsteps that the Senator alluded to--those bad guys are going to be \nlooking at every single one of those, and at some point in time it is \ngoing to come back to haunt us.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague for sharing his insights. And \ncertainly national security is extremely important. I obviously reach a \ndifferent conclusion.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment that Senator Lee \nand I have put forward because it appropriately balances national \nsecurity concerns against issues of privacy and the fourth amendment. \nIt says simply that where national security is not affected, the public \nshould be able to see these interpretations of what the statutes we \nwrite in this Chamber mean so the public can weigh in on whether they \nfeel comfortable with where the secret court has taken us and so we can \nweigh in, so we can have a debate on this floor not about our best \nguess about what possible implications might occur from some secret \ncourt opinion, but we can actually share a situation where national \nsecurity is not affected. Well, here is how related to investigations \nit has been interpreted: Oh my goodness. What was intended to be a door \nopen 1 inch is a door flung open like a barn gate, and the fourth \namendment is in serious trouble. That should be debated here.\n  Certainly, the amendment Senator Lee and I have put forward is very \nsensitive to the concerns my colleague has presented. I do appreciate \nhis viewpoints. But, Mr. President, through you I ask my colleagues to \nweigh in on the side that the American people have a right to know what \nthe plain language of the statute actually means after being \ninterpreted by a court.\n  Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, no one disputes the vital importance of our \nnational security. Indeed, in Federalist No. 41, James Madison noted \nthat ``[s]ecurity against foreign danger is one of the primitive \nobjects of civil society,'' and he emphasized that such security ``is \nan avowed and essential object of the American Union.'' Government \nofficials have a solemn duty, particularly in the age of global \nterrorism, to help ensure that the American people are safe and secure.\n  Yet at the same time, the government also exists to do a lot more \nthan just promote security. Its most fundamental purpose is to protect \nour natural and inalienable liberties. Safeguarding individual rights \nand liberties is the bedrock of American Government. In the words of \nour Nation's founding document, the Declaration of Independence, it is \n``to secure these rights [that] Governments are instituted among Men.''\n  In our quest for ever-greater security, we must be mindful not to \nsacrifice the very rights and liberties that make our safety valuable. \nAs Benjamin Franklin put it, ``Those who would give up essential \nliberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty \nnor safety.''\n  I worry that in seeking to achieve temporary safety, some of the \nauthorities we have given the government under FISA may compromise \nessential rights and liberties. In particular, I am concerned about the \ngovernment's ability, without a warrant, to search through FISA \nmaterials for communications involving individual American citizens. I \nworry that this authority is inconsistent with and diminishes the \nessential constitutional right each of us has ``to be secure . . . \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures.''\n  We do not know the precise number of communications involving \nAmerican citizens that the government collects, stores, and analyzes \nunder section 702 of FISA. Whether this number is large or small, I \nbelieve we must enforce meaningful protections for circumstances when \nthe government searches through its database of captured communications \nlooking for information on individual American citizens; otherwise, by \nmeans of these so-called backdoor searches, the government may conduct \nsignificant warrantless surveillance of American persons. I believe \nthis current practice is inconsistent with core fourth amendment \nprivacy protections and needs to be reformed.\n  During consideration of FISA in the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nDurbin and I offered a bipartisan amendment to address this very \nproblem. The language of our amendment is identical to that offered by \nSenators Wyden and Udall during consideration of FISA by the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. The amendment clarifies that section 702 \ndoes not permit the government to search its database of FISA materials \nto identify communications of a particular U.S. person.\n  In effect, it would require the government to obtain a warrant before \nperforming such queries involving an American person's communications. \nThe amendment is limited in scope. It excludes from the warrant \nrequirement instances where the government has obtained an emergency \nauthorization, circumstances when the life or physical safety of the \nAmerican person targeted by the search is in danger and the search is \nfor the purpose of assisting that same person, and in instances where \nthe person has consented to the search.\n  Moreover, the warrant requirement would apply only to deliberate \nsearches for American communications and would not prevent the \ngovernment from reviewing, analyzing, or disseminating any American \ncommunications collected under FISA and discovered through other types \nof analysis.\n  FISA rightly requires that the government obtain a warrant anytime it \nseeks to conduct direct surveillance on a U.S. person. Indirect \nsurveillance of U.S. persons by means of backdoor searches should be no \ndifferent. No one disputes that the government may have a legitimate \nneed to search its FISA database for information about a U.S. person, \nbut there is no legitimate reason why the government ought not first \nobtain a warrant, while articulating and justifying the need for its \nintrusion on the privacy of U.S. persons. Our constitutional values \ndemand nothing less.\n  Unfortunately, we will not be voting on such an amendment later \ntoday, so our reauthorization of FISA will include a grant of authority \nfor the government to perform backdoor searches, seeking information on \nindividual American citizens without a warrant. I believe such searches \nare inconsistent with fundamental fourth amendment principles. For this \nreason, I cannot support the FISA reauthorization, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the bill in its current form.\n\n[[Page S8424]]\n\n  I would like next to speak about a few amendments I think would make \nsome improvements to this legislation, nonetheless. I would like to \nfirst speak on the Merkley-Lee amendment, which would require \ndeclassification of significant FISA Court opinions.\n  The FISA Court is authorized to oversee requests for surveillance \nboth inside and outside of the United States. Given the sensitive \nnature of these requests, it is necessarily a secret court, a court \nwhose rulings, orders, and other deliberations are and remain \nclassified. Yet, although much of the court's work must properly be \nkept confidential, it must not operate without meaningful oversight.\n  Beyond the straightforward application of the law to specific and \nsometimes highly classified circumstances, FISA Court rulings may \ninclude substantive interpretations of governing legal authorities. As \nis true in every court called on to construe statutory text, FISA Court \ninterpretations and applications are influential in determining the \ncontours of the government's surveillance authorities. Unlike specific \nsources of information or particular methods of surveillance \ncollection, which are properly classified in many instances, I believe \nthe FISA Court's substantive legal interpretation of statutory \nauthorities should be made public.\n  A hallmark of the rule of law which is a bedrock principle upon which \nour Nation is founded is that the requirements of law must be made \npublicly available--available for review, available for the scrutiny of \nthe average American.\n  The Merkley-Lee amendment establishes a cautious and reasonable \nprocess for declassification consistent with the rule of law. Its \nprocedures are limited in three key respects:\n  First, the pathway for declassification applies only to the most \nimportant decisions that include significant instruction or \ninterpretation of the law.\n  Second, declassification must proceed in a manner consistent with the \nprotection of national security, intelligence sources and methods, and \nother properly classified and sensitive information.\n  Third, the process contemplates instances where the Attorney General \ndetermines declassification is not possible in a manner that protects \nnational security. In such cases, the process requires only an \nunclassified summary opinion or a report on the opinion that happened \nto remain classified.\n  This modest and bipartisan amendment will help ensure that we are \ngoverned by the rule of law, that government activities are made by \napplying legal standards known to the public, and that we remain, in \nJohn Adams' famous formulation, ``a government of laws and not of \nmen.''\n  I would like next to speak on the Wyden amendment to require a report \non the privacy impact of FISA surveillance. The FISA Amendments Act of \n2008 gave the government broad authority to surveil phone calls and e-\nmails of people reasonably believed to be foreigners outside the United \nStates. Despite the intent that this authority be directed at \nnoncitizens who are located abroad at the moment the surveillance is \ncollected, officials have acknowledged that communications by Americans \nmay be swept up in the government collection of those same materials.\n  I believe it is critical for both Congress and the public to have \naccess to information about the impact of these FISA authorities on the \nprivacy of individual Americans. Only with such knowledge can we \nreasonably assess whether existing privacy protections are sufficient \nor whether reforms might be needed. Yet senior intelligence officials \nhave declined to provide in a public forum the necessary information to \nsuch discussion and such analysis.\n  In particular, it is essential that we learn the extent to which \nAmericans' communications are collected under FISA, whether this \nincludes any wholly domestic communications, and whether government \nofficials subsequently searched through those communications and \nconducted warrantless searches of phone calls and e-mails related to \nspecific American persons. This modest compromise in this modest, \ncommonsense amendment requires the Director of National Intelligence to \nprovide this information and report back to Congress regarding the \nprivacy impact of the FISA Amendments Act. Given the sensitive nature \nof this information, our amendment provides for necessary redactions to \nprotect core national security interests that would be important to our \ncountry and help keep us safe.\n  Providing Congress with answers to these critical questions should be \na relatively uncontroversial exercise. It should be a no-brainer. Only \nwith such information can we do our job of ensuring a proper balance \nbetween intelligence efforts on the one hand and the protection of \nfundamental individual rights and liberties on the other hand.\n  Finally, I would like to speak on the Paul amendment, the Fourth \nAmendment Preservation and Protection Act. The fourth amendment \nprotects the right of the people to be secure in their persons, papers, \nand effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. At its core the \nConstitution protects our right to be free from unwarranted government \nintrusion in our affairs absent probable cause, which the government \nmust set forth with specificity to a court in an application for a \nwarrant.\n\n  It is undisputed that absent exigent circumstances, consent, or a \nwarrant, the government may not intrude upon a person's home and search \nthrough his papers and personal effects. But we no longer keep our most \nsensitive information solely in the form of physical papers, physical \ndocuments, and other tangible things. The explosion of data sharing and \ndata storage has made our economy more responsive and more efficient, \nbut it also creates the potential for government abuse.\n  Congress has a fundamental responsibility to protect the individual \nliberties of Americans by ensuring that the Constitution's core fourth \namendment protections are not eroded by the operation of changed \ncircumstances, by new techniques that are made possible and in some \ncases made necessary by new technology. But Congress has failed to do \nthis.\n  Some court rulings have likewise fallen short of protecting the full \nscope, the full spirit of the fourth amendment as it applies to our \nworld of complex data sharing. Courts have attempted in good faith to \ndetermine whether individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy \nin different kinds of information that they might share with third \nparties, sometimes online, but the results of many of these rulings are \na varied and unpredictable legal landscape in which many do not know \nand cannot figure out whether they can rely on the fourth amendment to \nprotect sensitive information they routinely share with others for a \nlimited business purpose.\n  Congress needs to act to preserve the fourth amendment's protections \nas they apply to everyday uses, including routine use of the Internet, \nuse of credit cards, libraries, and banks. Absent such protections, \nindividuals may in time grow wary of sharing information with third \nparties.\n  I am cognizant that this area of the law is complex. It is full of \nchanges. It is full of instances in which we have to undertake a very \ndelicate balancing act. Nevertheless, much work remains to be done to \nensure that the fourth amendment protections are here and that they are \nreal and that they benefit Americans and they do so in a way that does \nnot interfere with legitimate law enforcement and national security \nactivities. We must not shy away from the task simply because it is \nhard. It is daunting, but it is possible and it is necessary. Congress \nmust act to preserve Americans' constitutional right to be secure in \ntheir persons, their papers, and effects against unreasonable searches \nand seizures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I would like to talk about the FISA Amendments Act. I \nthank Senator Wyden for his leadership on this issue and for offering \nan amendment to this act that I have cosponsored and will speak on in \njust a minute.\n  On our vote tomorrow, I will say that I will reluctantly plan to \noppose the vote on the FISA Amendments Act when we get to final \npassage. There are many reasons for that. I am not naive. I do \nunderstand there are people out there who want to do harm to our \nNation. I very much appreciate the folks in the intelligence community \nwho do\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\ndifficult behind-the-scenes work to keep us all safe. But at the same \ntime, I believe our civil liberties and our right to privacy need to be \nprotected. I do not believe they are sufficiently protected under the \ncurrent law. So simply extending current law for 5 more years is \nirresponsible, and it is not a reflection of our values.\n  There are a few ways this bill falls short. I am especially concerned \nabout the practice of reverse-targeting. The deputy majority leader \ntalked about it about an hour ago.\n  The intelligence community does not need a warrant to conduct \nsurveillance on someone located overseas. I think we can all agree \nthere is no problem there. The problem comes when the intelligence \ncommunity conducts surveillance on someone overseas where the real \npurpose is to gain information about someone right here in America. \nThat can happen without a warrant, and we should not let that happen \nwithout a warrant.\n  Our national security is not threatened if we require this \ninformation to be tagged and sequestered and subject to judicial \nreview. It would merely ensure that the information intercepted \noverseas in the form of communications to or from an American citizen \nwould have to be overseen by the courts. Current law is supposed to \nprohibit this practice, but there really is no way to enforce the \nprohibition. That leaves the door open for abuse. That is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Unfortunately, neither Senator Wyden nor I are able to offer our \namendments that would address this hole in our privacy rights.\n  We can do better. We can also do better when it comes to \ntransparency. The simplest amendment the Senate can approve today is \nthe one I am proud to consponor. It is the Wyden amendment to require \nthe Director of National Intelligence to report to Congress on the \nimpact of FISA amendments on the privacy of American citizens. It is a \ncommonsense amendment.\n  The report could be classified but would no longer allow the \nintelligence community to ignore requests for information from \nCongress. Why in the world do we not require the intelligence community \nto be accountable to us for its actions? It is our responsibility in \nCongress to hold the entire executive branch accountable. If we do not \nask these questions, we are simply not doing our job. That is true \nwhether it is President Obama, President Bush, or some other President.\n  I hope we can adopt the Wyden amendment to improve the reporting \nrequirements of FISA. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of H.R. 1, for the purpose of calling up \nand debating the Coats amendment; that following the remarks of Senator \nCoats Senator Alexander be recognized; the Senate resume consideration \nof the FISA bill, H.R. 5949; and that all provisions of the previous \norders remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/27/senate-section/article/S8425-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8425-S8427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3391.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of December 17, 2012, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am cognizant of the fact that we will \nhave a series of votes beginning in just 15 minutes, and so even though \nthe unanimous consent request on this amendment is for 30 minutes \nequally divided, I am going to try to judiciously use this time between \nmyself and Senator Alexander to explain why we are offering this \namendment, and hopefully our colleagues will be persuaded to support us \nwhen we vote on this probably tomorrow.\n  We are all, of course, sensitive to the pain and damage inflicted by \nMother Nature in the Northeast. In fact, some of the Northeast is \ngetting some more of that pain with a storm up there today.\n  No State or region in our country should be left to fend for itself \nafter a storm as devastating as Hurricane Sandy. It is important to \nunderstand that many things have overwhelmed the ability of the States \nand local communities to deal with some of the effects of this, and \nthat is why the Sandy emergency supplemental is before us attached to \nH.R. 1 and why we will be voting on that, I assume, tomorrow.\n  There are two versions before us; one is the Senate Democrats' \nemergency supplemental proposal. That totals $60.4 billion. It includes \nnearly $13 billion in mitigation funding. That goes for the next storm, \nnot this storm. There is $3.46 billion for Army Corps of Engineers, \n$500 million of which is projects from previous disasters; $3 billion \nto repair or replace Federal assets that do not fall into the category \nof emergency need. There is $56 million for tsunami cleanup on the west \ncoast, which, of course, does not relate to Sandy. There is a lot of \nnew authorizing language for reform of disaster relief programs, which \nI would support through the regular process. But without having gone \nthrough the authorizing committee, I don't think that is a good idea.\n  Our proposed alternative provides $23.8 billion in funding for the \nnext 3 months. We are not saying this is the be-all and end-all of what \nCongress will ultimately fund to meet the needs of those who have been \nimpacted by Sandy. We are simply saying that before rushing to a \nnumber, which has not been fully scrubbed, fully looked at, plans \nhaven't been fully developed yet--and that is understandable--we think \nit most important we provide emergency funding for those in immediate \nneed over the next 3 months.\n  We have carefully worked with FEMA Director Fugate and we have worked \nwith Secretary Donovan at HUD. We have worked through the \nAppropriations Committee to identify those specific needs that get to \nthe emergency situations under which this bill is titled. It provides \nfunding for States to allow them to begin to rebuild but also leaves us \ntime to review what additional funds might be needed.\n  So rather than throwing out a big number and simply saying let us see \nwhat comes in under that number, let us look at the most immediate \nneeds that have to be funded now and provide a sufficient amount of \nfunds in order to do that. In fact, the amount we are providing would \nextend, in terms of outlays, far beyond March 27, but we want those \nmayors and we want those Governors to be able to begin the planning \nprocess of looking how they would go forward. We also want, in respect \nto our careful need, to carefully look at how we extend taxpayer \ndollars.\n  We want to allow this 3-month period of time for which the relevant \ncommittees in the Senate and the House of Representatives can look at \nthese plans, can document the request, can examine the priorities that \nmight be needed and then put a sensible plan in place that hopefully \nwill be an efficient and effective use of taxpayer dollars. Therefore, \nwe have struck from the Democratic proposal all moneys that would go to \nmitigation funding, not saying mitigation funding isn't necessary but \nsimply saying it doesn't meet the emergency need this first 3-month \nproposal addresses. This will give States time to begin to rebuild but \nalso allow us time to review what additional funds are needed for that \nrebuilding.\n  We don't allow authorizing language because we don't believe in \nauthorizing something on an emergency appropriations bill that ought to \ngo through the\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\nauthorizing committee. We focus specifically on Sandy-related needs. \nThere are a number of other needs, as I have just addressed, that are \nperhaps legitimate, that ought to come through the regular process.\n  With that, let me turn to my colleague from Tennessee who has been \nworking with me. I would say our Appropriations Committee, our \nRepublican staff, has gone through this very carefully and tried to \nidentify how we can get money for the essential needs to those people, \nto those communities that need them now. We want to be responsible in \nterms of spending taxpayer dollars by having a period of time in which \nwe can look at the plans for the future and see what additional funds \nmight be needed.\n  With that, I yield for the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here to join the Senator from \nIndiana, and I think I can presumptively speak for everybody in this \nbody. We want to help the people in New York, New Jersey, and other \nNortheastern States that were hurt by Sandy. We have had some pretty \ntough disasters in Tennessee as well. We had a 1,000-year flood 2 years \nago--not a 100-year flood but a 1,000-year flood. We knew the Federal \nGovernment wasn't going to make us whole. We had billions of dollars of \ndamage, 52 counties hurt, but we knew the Federal Government could help \nand it did help and it helped swiftly and that is what we want to do in \nthis case.\n  With all the talk about the money we are about to appropriate, I \nthink it is important to remind those who live in New York, New Jersey, \nand Connecticut what is already being done with money we have already \nappropriated. For example, there are 4,402 FEMA personnel working in \nthose States. There are 514,343 citizens of those States who have \nalready filed individual assistance applications. This is when your \nhome is gone and you need money for rent or you need money to rebuild. \nThose applications are in.\n  Already $1.13 billion has been paid. There are 24 disaster recovery \ncenters in New York, 24 in New Jersey and 1 in Connecticut. $150 \nmillion in disaster loans have already been approved by the Small \nBusiness Administration, and more than 360,000 applications have been \nsent out.\n  The important fact to know is that help for victims of Hurricane \nSandy doesn't depend on what we are about to do tonight. We already \nhave money in the bank. We already have FEMA people on the ground. \nThere is already help available. In my experience in our Tennessee \ndisasters, that help comes in a matter of days, in most cases.\n  So what are we about to do? As Senator Coats said--and I wish to \ncongratulate him for making a very sensible approach toward this--what \nwe are about to say is this is $24 billion more for the accounts that \nare already helping people in the areas hurt by Sandy.\n  For example, there is over $5 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. \nThat is just to make sure there is enough money to fund those half \nmillion requests that are already in. There is $9.7 billion for flood \ninsurance. If you have flood insurance, the Federal Government will be \nable to pay your claim. There is $3.4 billion to repair roads and \nbridges. There is $2 billion for community development block grants. We \nfound in Tennessee that is especially flexible money, which is very \nhelpful. That is $2 billion between now and March. There is also $500 \nmillion for the Small Business Administration.\n  So what is not included in the proposal we are offering. It doesn't \ninclude items that are not related to Hurricane Sandy. This is supposed \nto be about Hurricane Sandy. It doesn't make changes to the Stafford \nAct. What that means is we don't go in, in this emergency \nappropriations bill for the next 3 months, and make wholesale changes \nin the law, make things permanent that are temporary, and streamline \nregulations. They all may be good things to do, but we have a process \nfor making legislative changes.\n  We don't include $13 billion for unspecified future projects. They \nmay be good projects, but if they are, we have a process to consider \nthose projects. The distinguished Senator from California and I are the \nranking members of one of the subcommittees that does some of that. We \nexpect to do that next year. So we are filling the accounts that are \nalready being used to help many people.\n  Finally, if I may say something about process--which I think would be \nmore interesting to the Senators than to the people of New York and New \nJersey--but it is important to know this bill came to the floor in \nrecord time. No one objected to its coming to the floor.\n  It was virtually unanimous, before we even started voting on \namendments, that we agreed to invoke cloture and to have a final vote \nof 51 votes so the bill in some form will pass. In return for that, \nthose of us on the minority side, so far as I know, got the amendments \nwe wanted.\n  I simply want to say to my colleagues that it is still far from a \nperfect process in our effort to continue to improve the way the Senate \nworks. The bill should have gone to committee to begin with. It did \nnot. It could have been amended there. When it came to the floor on \nMonday, and we said come right on, no one objected to that, we should \nhave started voting. We could have voted for 3 days on this bill: \nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, instead of running around trying to see \nwho had amendments. Let us just put them up and vote on them. Then we \nshould have had the cloture vote which, as I said, was done with, I \nthink, only one dissenting objection.\n  So the process has been better but not as good as it should be for \nthe Senate. But Senator Coats' substitute is the right proposal. It is \n24 billion more dollars now for the accounts that are already being \nused to help victims of Sandy.\n  The last thing I would say is this. When there is an emergency, \nCongress has always acted. We don't always do everything in the first \nweek or second or third week because we already have money in the bank \nfor those needs. But in Katrina, for example, there were nine different \nsupplemental appropriations bills over time. The next wave of \nappropriations requests can come to us, and we will go to work on them \nin a few weeks. We can get to work in the committee right away, for \nexample, and Senator Feinstein and I could work on it a few weeks after \nthat. Then the majority leader will bring the bills to the floor--which \nhe did not last year--and we can vote on them and have the second round \nof funding.\n  So I thank the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats, for his hard work on \nthis. We want the people of New York and New Jersey to know we want to \nhelp them, we are helping them, and will continue to be interested in \nthe things that need to be done. It will not make them whole, but it \nwill help them get on their feet, just as we have in Tennessee and just \nas we have in other States across the country after large disasters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time is still \navailable before the call up of the vote on the FISA legislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has approximately 2 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to use those 2 minutes, if I \ncould, to sum up.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his support throughout this \nwhole process. He has been instrumental in helping us work through this \nto find what we believe is a reasonable way to move forward and provide \nthat immediate emergency help that is so badly needed up in the \nNortheast.\n  Let me just give one example of how we came to these numbers. We do \nprovide, through the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations, $32 million for repairs of Amtrak's infrastructure, \ndewatering of tunnels, electrical systems, overhead wires. These are \nimmediate needs, and we want to provide funding for them.\n  There is funding for highway emergency relief directly related to \nSandy. We fund for that. We fund for public transportation \ninfrastructure, immediate needs between now and March. Again, we are \nnot saying there might not be need for more funding after this, but we \nwill at least have had the opportunity to vet that and look to ensure \nthat the money is correctly spent. What we didn't do under that \nappropriations was $30 million of damages\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\nthat come under the FAA existing budget, the funding for highway \nprojects not related to Sandy that are in the Democratic bill and \nmitigation projects unrelated to Sandy.\n  Again, we are not against mitigation, but we are saying let us focus \non Sandy. Let us get the emergency help to those who need it now. Let \nus get it there in an ample amount of time and money for them. Then let \nus take up, through the regular process and we carefully examine how we \nspend the taxpayers' money, providing those needed funds for the real \nemergency but not using this as a bill to lard up with all kinds of \nexcessive spending that isn't needed for this particular emergency.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/27/senate-section/article/S8427-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8427-S8429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FISA AMENDMENTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2012--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 5949.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3437\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 3437 \noffered by the Senator from Vermont.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is a matter I care a great deal about. \nI am concerned that we are rushing to rubberstamp a House bill that is \ngoing to extend the surveillance authorities of the FISA Amendments Act \nfor another 5 years. My amendment would allow the authorities to \ncontinue, but it would give a lot better and more timely oversight.\n  We passed this--and it was not on a last-minute thing--out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in July. We acted quickly so that we would \nnot be acting in this last-minute manner.\n  This has no operational impact on the intelligence community, but it \ndoes ensure the strongest of oversight. I hope Senators will support \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment and to \nindicate that the administration opposes the amendment as well.\n  We have just 4 days to reauthorize this critical intelligence tool \nbefore it expires. That is the reason for having the House bill before \nus today. The House bill is a clean bill. It extends the program to \n2017, when it would sunset and would need another reauthorization. I \nbelieve we must pass the House bill now. I believe 2017 is the \nappropriate date.\n  I am very worried that if we do anything else, if we pass any one of \nthese amendments, we will jeopardize the continuation of what is a \nvital intelligence tool. So regretfully, I oppose the Leahy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Leahy \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. There is a sufficient \nsecond.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown), the Senator from New York (Mrs. \nGillibrand), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Lautenberg), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. DeMint), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. \nInhofe), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), and the Senator from \nAlaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are going to have two more votes tonight. \nThey will both be 10 minutes in duration in addition to the debate time \nthat has already been established. Then we are going to move in a very \ndirect way to complete as much of the debate time as possible on the \namendments on the supplemental. It is extremely important that we get \nthis debate completed tonight so we can start voting in the morning. We \nhave already set up that we will have some votes in the morning. We are \ngoing to come in probably about 9:30 and start voting. We have a lot to \ndo.\n  It would really be good if people who have amendments on the \nsupplemental use their debate time tonight. We are going to have no \nmore votes tonight, but tomorrow there will be a limited amount of \ndebate time. Senator Mikulski will be here tonight, Senator Schumer \nwill be here tonight, and Senator Menendez will be here tonight to help \nmove this, in addition, of course, to the managers of the bill on the \nother side. We hope people will work hard to get debate out of the way \ntonight so we can vote tomorrow. We have a lot of votes tomorrow. I am \nled to believe there are a number of amendments the managers of this \nbill will pass either by voice or some other quick fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, following up Leader Reid's comments, to \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you have these amendments, \nSenator Schumer and I would like to know. We will stay here to offer \nand debate them, as you were accorded under the unanimous consent \nagreement. If you come up and tell Senator Schumer and me now, we can \nget an order and sequence and tell you when we will call you up. \nInstead of everybody standing around, we would actually get a regular \norder and you would know when your amendments are coming up and what \norder you are coming up so that you could plan your evening. Please see \nSenator Schumer and me, and we will work with you to accomplish this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, is it time to speak to amendment No. \n3435?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Merkley-Lee \namendment. I thank him for being lead cosponsor.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is all about supporting the fourth \namendment and opposing secret law. As we all know, in this Nation law \nconsists of both the plain language and the court interpretations of \nwhat the plain language means. In the case of the FISA rulings, the \npublic never finds out the second half and therefore doesn't really \nknow when information will be collected, if you will, that is relevant \nto an investigation. No one ever knows\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\nwhat that means. The public should be able to know and should be able \nto weigh in.\n  This amendment is constructed so it protects national security. It \nsays this will only happen in cases when it is compatible with national \nsecurity to release the FISA findings, and, second, you can do \nsummaries instead, and if summaries are still causing a national \nsecurity problem, a schedule is sufficient as to how the administration \nis reviewing these. It balances national security while it fights for \nthe fourth amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the vice chairman of the committee \nopposes this amendment, as does the administration. We have only 4 days \nto authorize this intelligence tool before it expires. Sending this \nlegislation to the President without amendment is the only sure way to \ndo it.\n  The Director of National Intelligence is engaged in an ongoing \nprocess to declassify significant FISA Court opinions where it is \npossible to do so. I have agreed to work with Senator Merkley to get \nsummaries of FISA Court decisions that can be made public.\n  In sum, the intelligence community strives to be as transparent as \npossible with the public, but legislation that would force its hand and \npotentially risk the exposure of classified information is both \nunnecessary and unwise.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Merkley amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote in relation to \namendment No. 3436 offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Fourth Amendment \nProtection Act. The fourth amendment guarantees that people should be \nsecure in their persons, houses, and papers against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. Somewhere along the way we became lazy and \nhaphazard in our vigilance. We allowed Congress and the courts to \ndiminish our fourth amendment protections, particularly when papers \nwere held by third parties.\n  I think most Americans would be shocked to know that the fourth \namendment does not protect their records if they are banking, Internet, \nor Visa records. A warrant is required to read their snail mail and to \ntap their phone, but no warrant is required to look at their e-mail, \ntext, or Internet searches; they can be read without a warrant. Why is \na phone call more deserving of privacy protection than an e-mail?\n  This amendment would restore the fourth amendment protections to \nthird-party records, and I recommend a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment, as does the \nvice chairman and the administration. This amendment is not germane to \nFISA. It has not been reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, which would \nhave jurisdiction over this matter. It seeks to reverse 30 years of \nSupreme Court precedence of interpreting the fourth amendment. \nAccording to the administration talking points received this afternoon: \nThe amendment would severely limit the effectiveness of law enforcement \nauthorities at all levels of government and will effectively repeal the \nFISA Amendments Act.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume \nconsideration of H.R. 1, the legislative vehicle for the Hurricane \nSandy supplemental.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill has been reported.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to give a sense of the \norder of amendments so Senators may plan their time.\n  We are now back on the supplemental bill, and we have great \ncooperation in getting the pending amendments and debate done this \nevening so we could actually start voting tomorrow morning.\n  So that Senators can have an understanding of how we will start our \nwork this evening, I want to lay out a bit of the schedule. This is not \na unanimous consent request. It is kind of an outline.\n  Our intention is to have the following amendments called up after I \nyield the floor: Senator Cardin to be recognized to call up his \namendment No. 3393; Senator Tester to be recognized for up to 2 minutes \nto call up his amendment No. 3350; Senator Landrieu to be recognized \nfor up to 2 minutes to call up her amendment No. 3415; Senator Coburn \nto be recognized for up to 30 minutes to call up his six amendments: \nNos. 3368; 3369; 3370, as modified; 3371; 3382; and 3383; following \nthat, Senator Merkley to be recognized for up to 5 minutes to call up \nhis amendment No. 3367; and then I have a few I will call up on behalf \nof other Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3393 to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I call up the Cardin amendment that was \nmade in order, amendment No. 3393.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin], for himself and Ms. \n     Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 3393 to amendment \n     No. 3395.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                    (Purpose: To strike section 501)\n\n       Strike section 501.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this amendment is totally \nnoncontroversial. In the bill, they increase the surety bond limits for \nsmall businesses from $2 million to $5 million. It was an amendment I \nworked with Senator Landrieu on in the Small Business Committee. It was \nincluded in the Recovery Act. It expired. It has been very successful. \nIt has generated a lot more contracts than anticipated. Making the \nlimit permanent has no cost.\n  This amendment would strike the provision from this bill since it has \nalready been included in the National Defense Authorization Act, which \nhas passed this body at $6.5 million, made permanent. So there is no \nneed to include this provision in the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  I know of no controversy on this amendment. We do not need any debate \ntime. I am hopeful we will clear this for a voice vote tomorrow.\n  I wish to thank Senator Landrieu for her work and Senator Snowe on \nthe Small Business Committee and thank Senator Mikulski for her work.\n  The Small Business Administration's surety bond program provides a \nguarantee on surety bonds, which are issued by contractors to assure \ncustomers that contract work will be completed.\n  The surety bond program gives small businesses critical support to \nsecure work, which will be especially important during recovery and \nrebuilding efforts after Superstorm Sandy.\n  The underlying bill contains a provision, requested by the \nadministration, which would increase the maximum surety bond guaranteed \nby SBA from $2 million to $5 million.\n  The Defense authorization conference agreement contains a provision \nthat would raise the maximum to $6.5 million.\n  The amendment strikes the provision in the supplemental related to \nSBA surety bonds in order to avoid conflicting with the House and \nSenate's conference agreement in the Defense authorization bill.\n  This amendment is a simple but important technical fix supported by \nChairwoman Landrieu and Ranking Member Snowe of the Small Business \nCommittee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. TESTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, wait. Before the Senator from Montana \nspeaks, why don't we voice vote the amendment now.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Fine. I know of no further requests for time and I am \nprepared for a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Would the Chair withhold?\n  There seems to be--Mr. President, if we could have order, I think it \nwould be helpful for us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Maryland may proceed.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I have no further debate. I am prepared to let it go on a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. Inquiry of the Chair, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. It was my understanding we were going to have ordered \nvotes tomorrow rather than this evening, and I would ask, through the \nChair, the chairwoman of the committee if my understanding is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Replying to the Senator from Oklahoma, for those \namendments we know we have cleared on both sides of the aisle that we \ncan do by voice votes or by consent, we are going to get those done \nthis evening.\n  Does the Senator have an objection to that?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would on this particular--I think we ought to have a \nrecorded vote on this. That would be my request.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Senator Cardin's amendment No. 3393 will be voted on \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3350 to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3350.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Tester], for himself, Mr. \n     Udall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n     Baucus, and Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3350 to amendment No. 3395.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funds for wildland fire management)\n\n       On page 76, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n                        wildland fire management\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Wildland Fire Management'', \n     $653,000,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, \n     That such amount is designated by Congress as being for an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of \n     the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 \n     (2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)(i)); Provided further, That, not later \n     than December 31, 2013, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States shall submit to the Committees on Appropriations of \n     the House of Representatives and the Senate a report on new \n     models or alterations in the model that may be used to better \n     project future wildfire suppression costs.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, Senator Udall of Colorado and I are \noffering this amendment to provide the Forest Service with sufficient \nresources to meet the demands of wildfire fighting this fiscal year.\n  Our amendment to the Sandy supplemental would close the gap between \nthe budget request and the actual expected need for wildfire management \nthis year. Over the last 15 years, the cost of wildfire suppression has \nincreased fivefold, but the Forest Service's budget certainly has not. \nThe reason we have had wildfire suppression increasing by fivefold is \nbecause the frequency and severity of fires have both increased.\n  The Forest Service, instead, has had to borrow money set aside for \nnonfire purposes, cutting into important programs such as timber \nproduction and watershed restoration. Borrowing\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\nagainst other accounts is occasionally unavoidable, but it is generally \nbad policy. We have a chance to avoid this situation by adopting my \namendment No. 3350.\n  The West experienced its worst fire season in decades this past year. \nOver 1 million acres burned in Montana and over 9 million acres burned \nacross the country. Three States had major emergency disaster \ndeclarations due to fire. We cannot afford to get caught unprepared \nthis coming summer. Nearly one-fifth of the West remains in extreme or \nexceptional drought, and over 60 percent of the High Plains remains in \nextreme or exceptional drought. Let's be prepared. Let's be \nresponsible. I would urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment tomorrow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 3350 \nproposed by Senator Tester. These funds are needed because the agency \npredicts it will spend more to fight these fires in fiscal year 2013, \ncausing severe hardship on the agency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3415 to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to discuss amendment No. 3415. It \nis my understanding there is no opposition to this amendment. We may be \nable to voice vote it tonight. But let me take 1 minute to explain it.\n  This is a technical correction to an underlying provision that is \nalready in the bill we will be voting for.\n  In the current law, there is a perverse incentive for local \ngovernments, when they are recovering, to hire outside contractors as \nopposed to maybe working with the workers who are already on the \npayroll--firefighters and police officers. It was not intended to be \nthat way. But because FEMA only reimburses for contractors and not for \nthe local police or firefighters under certain circumstances, we \nbelieve and FEMA believes it is actually spending more money.\n  So the essence of this amendment is to save money, being neutral in \nthe law, so the local officials can make the best decisions whether \nthey want to hire either contractors, if it makes sense, or their own \npeople, if it makes sense, so the recovery can go more efficiently and, \nhopefully, save money.\n  FEMA supports it. The firefighters support it. It is technical in \nnature, which is why I asked the chairwoman tonight if we could voice \nvote it. I do not think there is any opposition.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to the Senator, we have been advised that we will \nnot be voice voting amendments tonight.\n  But I want to just comment that we support the Landrieu amendment No. \n3415, which clarifies the intent of section 609(e) of the pending \namendment to provide FEMA reimbursements for the first responders. This \namendment clarifies the intent that first responders can be reimbursed \nfor wages during a disaster response. But it does not change the \nconditions of reimbursement that already aid an effective disaster \nresponse.\n  We do want to reinforce that both the International Association of \nFire Fighters and the International Association of Fire Chiefs support \nthis amendment.\n  At such time a vote is taken, I will urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to call up the amendment, \nif I could. The staff reminds me I did not do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3415 to amendment No. 3395.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify the provision relating to emergency protective \n                               measures)\n\n       On page 51, strike lines 8 through 23 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) In general.--If the President declares a major \n     disaster or emergency for an area within the jurisdiction of \n     a State, tribal, or local government, the President may \n     reimburse the State, tribal, or local government for costs \n     relating to--\n       ``(A) basic pay and benefits for permanent employees of the \n     State, tribal, or local government conducting emergency \n     protective measures under this section, if--\n       ``(i) the work is not typically performed by the employees; \n     and\n       ``(ii) the type of work may otherwise be carried out by \n     contract or agreement with private organizations, firms, or \n     individuals; or\n       ``(B) overtime and hazardous duty compensation for \n     permanent employees of the State, tribal, or local government \n     conducting emergency protective measures under this section.\n       ``(2) Overtime.--The guidelines for reimbursement for costs \n     under paragraph (1) shall ensure that no State, tribal, or \n     local government is denied reimbursement for overtime \n     payments that are required pursuant to the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.).\n       ``(3) No effect on mutual aid pacts.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall effect the ability of the President to \n     reimburse labor force expenses provided pursuant to an \n     authorized mutual aid pact.''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two \nletters--one from the International Association of Fire Chiefs and one \nfrom the International Association of Fire Fighters--be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                                  Fire Chiefs,\n\n                                  Fairfax, Va., December 27, 2012.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Homeland Security, U.S. Senate \n         Committee on Appropriations, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Landrieu: On behalf of the nearly 12,000 \n     members of the International Association of Fire Chiefs, I \n     would like to express our support for S.A. 3415, an amendment \n     to the supplemental appropriations bill for the relief of \n     communities affected by Hurricane Sandy (H.R. 1). This \n     amendment is technical in nature, but serves an important \n     purpose.\n       The national emergency response system is based on mutual \n     aid agreements in which neighboring fire departments help a \n     community that requires assistance in its response to a \n     disaster. These mutual aid agreements can be local-to-local, \n     intra-state, or inter-state. Many of these agreements include \n     provisions to ensure that the aiding jurisdictions will be \n     reimbursed for their emergency response activities. Because \n     many localities are facing shrinking emergency response \n     budgets, it is important that they be reimbursed soon after \n     they provide assistance through a mutual aid agreement.\n       This amendment makes it clear that the reimbursement \n     provisions in H.R. 1 will not affect these mutual aid \n     agreements. The amendment also will ensure that local \n     jurisdictions receive some assistance for the extraordinary \n     measures that they take to provide aid to their citizens \n     during a disaster. In many cases, the local taxpayers cannot \n     afford these costs on their own.\n       Thank you for offering this amendment that will help many \n     jurisdictions around the nation provide an effective response \n     to disasters in their communities. On behalf of the \n     leadership of America's fire and emergency services, I urge \n     the Senate to adopt this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Chief Hank C. Clemmensen,\n     President and Chairman of the Board.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                                Fire Fighters,\n\n                               Washington, DC., December 27, 2012.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: On behalf of the nation's nearly \n     300,000 professional fire fighters and emergency medical \n     personnel, I am writing to express our support for your \n     amendment to the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriation \n     which is scheduled for consideration by the full Senate.\n       Super Storm Sandy jeopardized the safety of thousands of \n     Americans and required an extraordinary response from \n     emergency workers throughout the region. The costs associated \n     with this response cannot and should not be borne solely by \n     the taxpayers of the affected jurisdictions.\n       Senate Amendment #3415 would ensure that municipalities are \n     eligible to seek reimbursement for costs associated with \n     emergency response operations directly related to Super Storm \n     Sandy. The amendment also builds in protections that prevent \n     federal tax dollars from being used for costs that would have \n     normally been incurred by state and local jurisdictions. This \n     careful balance serves the best interests of both communities \n     impacted by the storm and American taxpayers.\n       We greatly appreciate your diligent efforts to address this \n     important issue, and look forward to working with you to see \n     S. Admt. 3415 become law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Barry Kasinitz,\n                                 Director of Governmental Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask, through the Chair, if the \nchairwoman of the Appropriations Committee would like for me to begin \ncalling up amendments.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes. I wish to thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nbeing willing to debate these amendments\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\nthis evening. I know he has a pressing engagement, and he may proceed \nin whatever order he so chooses.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairwoman.\n  Mr. President, a little perspective before I offer these amendments.\n  We have before us a $60 billion-plus bill. There is no question there \nis great need in response to the devastation that occurred from Sandy. \nBut what the American people need to know as this bill goes through the \nSenate is this bill is not going to be paid for. There is no amendment \nthat has been approved that will allow offsets for this bill.\n  So as we clear this bill through the Senate--the $60-some billion we \nare going to clear--we are actually going to borrow that money. That is \nindisputable. I have spent the last 8 years outlining the waste, the \nduplication, and the fraud in the Federal Government. Those amendments \nwere not made in order that would offset and actually pay for this by \neliminating programs of the Federal Government that do not actually do \nanything to actually better the lives of Americans.\n  I am very appreciative of the opportunity to offer these amendments. \nI would also note we could have done these last week had we had an open \nand moving amendment process. We would not be here today working on \nSandy. We would have finished it last week, but we chose not to do \nthat.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3369 to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 3369 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3369 to amendment No. 3395.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the amount that triggers the requirement to notify \nCongress of the recipients of certain grants and to require publication \n                             of the notice)\n\n       Strike section 1003 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 1003.  None of the funds provided in this title to the \n     Department of Transportation or the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development may be used to make a grant unless the \n     Secretary of such Department notifies the House and Senate \n     Committees on Appropriations and posts the notification on \n     the public website of that agency not less than 3 full \n     business days before either Department (or a modal \n     administration of either Department) announces the selection \n     of any project, State or locality to receive a grant award \n     totaling $500,000 or more.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a fairly straightforward \namendment, and this is not to be construed as an amendment against the \nappropriators but, rather, an amendment for transparency.\n  What the underlying bill states is that 3 days before any grants are \nmade under this process that the Appropriations Committee will be \nnotified--not the whole Congress, not the American people but the \nAppropriations Committee. The reason for that is so the Members of the \nAppropriations Committee can then put out the information to the \nconstituencies who are going to benefit from the grants that come \nthrough this.\n  Actually, the American people need to know the grants that are going \nto be granted through this process, the money that is going to be \nspent. So all this amendment does is change it to where the American \npeople get notified of the grants that are going to be placed as a \nresult of this bill.\n  This is about good government. This is about transparency. This is \nabout letting all the Americans, who are actually going to pay for \nthese grants, know what is going on, when it is going on, and how it is \ngoing on, who is going to get the money, and how much money they are \ngoing to get.\n  It is straightforward, very simple. It just says let everybody know--\nnot a select group of Senators or House Members but everybody in this \ncountry who is footing the bill ought to know where this money is going \nto be spent. They ought to know it at the same time anybody else knows. \nIt is just a transparency amendment so we all know where the money is \nspent, and we know it at the same time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3371 to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment be set aside \nand call up amendment No. 3371.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 3371 to amendment No. \n     3395.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that Federal disaster assistance is available for \n           the most severe disasters, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec. 52007.  (a) Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (in this section referred to as \n     the ``Administrator'') shall review the public assistance per \n     capita damage indicator and shall initiate rulemaking to \n     update such damage indicator. Such review and rulemaking \n     process shall ensure that the per capita indicator is fully \n     adjusted for annual inflation for all years since 1986, by \n     not later than January 1, 2016.\n        (b) Not later than 365 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Administrator shall--\n       (1) submit a report to the committees of jurisdiction in \n     Congress on the initiative to modernize the per capita damage \n     indicator; and\n       (2) present recommendations for new measures to assess the \n     capacities of States to respond and recover to disasters, \n     including threat and hazard identification and risk \n     assessments by States and total taxable resources available \n     within States for disaster recovery and response.\n       (c) As used in this section, the term ``State'' means--\n       (1) a State;\n       (2) the District of Columbia;\n       (3) the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;\n       (4) any other territory or possession of the United States; \n     and\n       (5) any land under the jurisdiction of an Indian tribe, as \n     defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b).\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is another good government amendment.\n  One of the things that has happened since FEMA was set up is that \nwhat has occurred has created a disparity between the States. Let me \noutline, in the last 6 years the State with the most disasters--most of \nyou would not realize--is Oklahoma. We have had 25 certified disasters \nin my State.\n  Now, how did that happen? It has happened because the per capita \ndamage calculation has not been updated through inflation on a regular \nbasis. So what is the effect of that? The effect of that is a State \nsuch as New York or California or Texas can have exactly the same \ndisaster as Oklahoma, but it will not be declared a disaster because \nOklahoma has less than 4 million people but we have X amount of \ndollars, but because we have such a smaller population, we qualify for \na disaster declaration, whereas if the same thing happened in any of \nthose three larger populated States, they would not qualify.\n  So this is actually an amendment that will not be beneficial to my \nState but is beneficial to us as American citizens to create equality \nin how we describe and how we grant disaster declarations.\n  So all I am doing is saying that between now and 2016, FEMA has to \nupdate. It will not have any application to what we are doing today, \nbut it is a good-government amendment so that we will actually have a \nuniform process throughout the country so that disaster declarations \nare appropriately granted to States that appropriately need the Federal \nGovernment's help.\n  Remember, our definition on this is when we have overwhelmed local \nresources. That is the key. Then we use a per capita damage assessment \nto grant the declaration of emergency. So what I am trying to do is to \ncreate some clarity and also equality among the States so that \neverybody is treated equally. Right now, they are not. Quite frankly, \nmy State is much advantaged, to the detriment of the larger States, \nbecause of our lower population, with the same amount of damage.\n  I would ask for concurrence on that amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3382 to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment 3382 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3382 to amendment No. 3395.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require merit-based and competitive awards of disaster \n                          recovery contracts)\n\n       After section 1105, insert the following:\n       Sec. 1106. (a) Prohibition on Use of Funds for Future \n     Disaster Recovery Contracts Not Competitively Awarded.--\n     Amounts appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act \n     may not be obligated or expended for any contract awarded \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act in support of \n     disaster recovery if such contract was awarded using other \n     than competitive procedures as otherwise required by chapter \n     33 of title 41, United States Code, section 2304 of title 10, \n     United States Code, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.\n       (b) Current No-bid Contracts.--\n       (1) Review of contracts.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, Federal agencies shall \n     conduct a review of all contracts to support disaster \n     recovery that were awarded before the date of the enactment \n     of this Act using other than competitive procedures in order \n     to determine the following:\n       (A) Whether opportunities exist to achieve cost savings \n     under such contracts.\n       (B) Whether the requirements being met by such contracts \n     can be met using a new or existing contract awarded through \n     competitive procedures.\n       (2) Competitive award of contracts.--If a Federal agency \n     determines pursuant to the review under paragraph (1) that \n     either subparagraph of that paragraph applies to a contract \n     awarded using other than competitive procedures, the agency \n     shall take appropriate actions with respect to the contract, \n     whether to achieve cost savings under the contract, to use a \n     new or existing contract awarded through competitive \n     procedures to meet applicable requirements, or otherwise to \n     discontinue of the use of the contract.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This is an amendment some people do not like, I will \ngrant you that. But I have some specific examples that are going on in \nNew Jersey right now on why this amendment is needed. We have multiple \ncontracts that were available that could have been utilized in New \nJersey for debris removal. The company that got the contract actually \nis going to charge in excess of 20 percent more to the Federal \nGovernment for doing the same thing another competitive bid would have \ndone. So we are going to spend at least 20 percent more on the contract \nfor debris removal in New Jersey than we need to. That is because \ncompetitive bidding was not a requirement of Federal funds.\n  Here is some history. During Katrina, we know that $11 billion of \nU.S. taxpayer money was either defrauded or wasted. Let me say that \nagain--$11 billion. Let me give the prime example of that. The Corps of \nEngineers was paid $62 per cubic yard to manage debris removal in \nKatrina. Through five layers of contracting, the people who actually \ndid the debris removal in Katrina were paid $9 a cubic yard. So we paid \nsix times what it actually cost to get the debris removal done because \nwe did not have competitive bidding and we had multiple layers coming \nfrom the Corps of Engineers to national contractors, to regional \ncontractors, to local contractors, to the actual guy with a backhoe and \nwith a scoop and a dump truck. So we paid five to six times what it \nshould have cost to actually get the debris removal taken care of. The \nsame thing is going on in New Jersey right now. Right now.\n  So requiring competitive bidding--can there be exceptions to it? Yes. \nAre there times when you cannot do that? Yes. But as a general rule, \nespecially since we are borrowing this money, we ought to be the best \nstewards of it that we can be. All this says is that we ought to \nrequire competitive bidding on these types of contracts to make sure we \nget value.\n  Why did New Jersey choose the more expensive contractor? Because the \nFederal Government is paying for it. This was a contract that was set \nthat had been executed once in Connecticut. Because the Federal \nGovernment is paying for it, there is less decisionmaking about \nprudence and efficiency and effectiveness because there is not State \nmoney paying for it.\n  So what has happened is what was easiest, what was well-connected, \nwhat was well-heeled got the contract, and the one that would have cost \nconsiderably less did not get the contract. I would be happy to \ndemonstrate for any of my colleagues showing them the difference \nbetween these two contracts on debris removal in New Jersey. So the \nsame thing that happened in Katrina we are not learning from.\n  I agree that the debris needs to be picked up. We need to do it \nexpeditiously. We had great opportunity to do that with both \ncontractors, except we are going to pay a lot more because we chose to \ngo a way that greased the sleds for those who were well connected.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3383 to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that \namendment be set aside and amendment No. 3383 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3383 to Amendment No. 3395.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strike a provision relating to certain studies of the \n                          Corps of Engineers)\n\n       On page 16, strike lines 17 through 20 and insert \n     ``Provided''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. This amendment attacks one of the features of this bill \nthat I think steals from the authorizing committees the authority they \nneed to have on authorizing projects. Let me quote the language in the \nbill:\n\n       Provided further that any project that is under study by \n     the Corps of Engineers for reducing flooding and storm damage \n     risks in the future and that the Corps studies demonstrate \n     will cost effectively reduce those risks is hereby \n     authorized.\n\n  With one sentence, we have just taken away the total capability of \nthe authorizing committee to hold the Corps accountable. All I am \nsaying is that we at least ought to have authorizers say whether this \nis a priority. It does not mean they need to stop it, but they ought to \nat least be informed, and the authorization of that ought to go through \na committee.\n  In this bill, 64 percent of the money is not going to even be started \nto be spent until 2 years from now, so there is plenty of time for us \nto create the authorization process rather than to deem the Corps of \nEngineers their own order and desire in terms of projects they wish to \ndo. It is about good government. It is about good input. It is about \ngood oversight. Allowing the Corps just to deem something authorized \nwithout the input of the appropriate committee of this Senate I think \nis inherently wrong and potentially very wasteful.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3368 to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that Amendment No. 3368 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     Amendment numbered 3368 to Amendment No. 3395.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify cost-sharing requirements for certain Corps of \n                         Engineers activities)\n\n       In title IV, under the heading ``construction (including \n     transfer of funds)'' under the heading ``Corps of Engineers-\n     Civil'' under the heading ``DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY'' under \n     the heading ``DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE-CIVIL'' strike ``Provided \n     further, That cost sharing for implementation of any projects \n     using these funds shall be 90 percent Federal and 10 percent \n     non-Federal exclusive of LERRDs:'' and insert ``Provided \n     further, That the Secretary shall determine the Federal and \n     non-Federal cost share for implementing any project using \n     these funds in accordance with section 103 of the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2213):''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Sandy supplemental bill provides the\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers $3.5 billion in funding for new \nconstruction projects. Of that, $3 million from this account is \ndirected toward future mitigation projects, future flood risks for \nareas associated with large-scale flood and storm events, and areas \nalong the Atlantic coast within the boundaries of the North Atlantic \nDivision of the Corps that were affected by Hurricane Sandy.\n  The legislation also increases the Federal cost share for these \nprojects that are funded with this appropriation. It changes it from 65 \npercent to 90 percent. The purpose of this amendment is to bring that \nback to 65 percent. It is not about being a miser. It is not about \nwanting to save money. It is about prudence. It is about sound \njudgment. It is about common sense.\n  What do we know from the 1988 Stafford Act? Here is what we know. \nWhat we know is that when we changed the cost share to an appropriate \nlevel so that we did not get things done on the Federal Government's, \nthe taxpayers' dime without significant participation of local input, \nwhat the studies show is that during that 1-year period, the Federal \nGovernment saved $3 billion because projects did not get funded that \nwere not priorities because of the 65 percent Federal contribution and \nthe 35-percent cost share. So what this does is reintroduce the 65-\npercent Federal payment and the 35-percent cost share to do that. \nAgain, most of these projects are not going to start until 2015. So \npriorities are important.\n  So we are borrowing $60 billion--and this is just the first bill, I \nam told, and I am sure we are going to have to spend more, but \nshouldn't we be more prudent with how we spend dollars that are going \nto be borrowed against our children's future? All this says is revert \nit back to what has been done.\n  The second point I would make is that this is the first time in \nrecent history where we have said--the people of Louisiana had a 65-\npercent cost share to the Federal Government, the people of Texas, the \npeople of Mississippi, the people of Alabama, and all of a sudden, we \nare now going to say: No, that does not apply to the people in the \nNortheast. So it is unfair to the other areas that had major \ncatastrophes that now all of a sudden, in time of extremis in terms of \nour debt and deficit, we are going to all of a sudden change that. Why \nare we changing that, especially since most of this money is not going \nto be spent--is not even going to be initialized--for at least 2 years?\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3370, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be set aside \nand amendment No. 3370 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn], for himself and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 3370, as modified, to \n     amendment No. 3395.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1106. PROHIBITION ON EMERGENCY SPENDING FOR PERSONS \n                   HAVING SERIOUS DELINQUENT TAX DEBTS.\n\n       (a) Definition of Seriously Delinquent Tax Debt.--In this \n     section:\n       (1) In general.--The term ``seriously delinquent tax debt'' \n     means an outstanding debt under the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 for which a notice of lien has been filed in public \n     records pursuant to section 6323 of that Code.\n       (2) Exclusions.--The term ``seriously delinquent tax debt'' \n     does not include--\n       (A) a debt that is being paid in a timely manner pursuant \n     to an agreement under section 6159 or 7122 of Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986; and\n       (B) a debt with respect to which a collection due process \n     hearing under section 6330 of that Code, or relief under \n     subsection (a), (b), or (f) of section 6015 of that Code, is \n     requested or pending.\n       (b) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act or an amendment made by this Act, none of the \n     amounts appropriated by or otherwise made available under \n     this Act may be used to make payments to an individual or \n     entity who has a seriously delinquent tax debt during the \n     pendency of such seriously delinquent tax debt.\n\n     SEC. 1107. PROHIBITION ON EMERGENCY SPENDING FOR DECEASED \n                   INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       None of the amounts appropriated by or otherwise made \n     available under this Act may be used for any person who is \n     not alive when the amounts are made available. This does not \n     apply to funeral costs.\n\n     SEC. 1108. PROHIBITION ON EMERGENCY SPENDING FOR FISHERIES.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or made available in this \n     Act may be used for any commercial fishery that is located \n     more than 50 miles outside of the boundaries of a major \n     disaster area, as declared by the President under the Robert \n     T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 5170 et seq.), for Hurricane Sandy.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Per the further request of Senator Schumer, I put a \ndivision in this amendment so we would have two votes on it, separating \nout the fisheries. Because he felt that was important, I was glad to \naccommodate his needs.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. The Senator was gracious. There are \ntwo separate issues here, one of which I think most of us on this side \nwould accept. The other we could not. To lump them together would have \ntied two issues together that were not fair. The Senator from Oklahoma \nwas extremely gracious. He said right away: We will divide them. He did \nnot have to do that. I very much appreciate that.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to do that. Let me tell you what crux of this \namendment is. When we have disasters, we have real, legitimate needs. \nWe have families who are hurting. We have businesses that are belly-up. \nWe have homes that are destroyed. We have lives that are never going to \nbe put back together no matter how much money we spend.\n  But there are people in our country who do not play by the rules. \nThis amendment is specifically designed to not grant any of this $60 \nbillion to true tax cheats. That does not mean something that is under \ndiscussion or under litigation; that is the ones who have already been \ndeemed tax cheats. And the second thing is to not pay money to people \nwho are deceased already.\n  What did we learn from Katrina? We learned that nearly $1 billion of \nKatrina money went to people who owed billions of dollars to the \nFederal Government. These were not disputable facts, these were real \nfacts. We also learned that we spent significantly over $100 million \ngiving grants and money to people who were deceased. So all we are \nsaying is, on this bill, let's learn from our mistakes and let's not do \nthe same thing.\n  So this puts a prohibition on money going to people who have a \nlegitimate, adjudicated claim by the IRS that they are not paying taxes \nthat are due to the Federal Government; that they, in fact, will not \nparticipate because they did not participate.\n  The second thing is if, in fact, you really don't exist any more in \nlife, you really shouldn't be collecting money off our kids to pay for \nsomething that isn't a real need.\n  The final point of it is to really focus this on the Sandy \nsupplemental, and that is the division on which we will have a separate \nvote, is for funding fisheries. I have no problem with funding \nfisheries. I have a big problem with borrowing from my kids to fund \nthose very fisheries.\n  It is about priorities. We refuse to make priorities, and now that we \nhave a bill that we don't have to cut spending anywhere from--we are \ngoing to borrow it all--we decide that we are going to add everything \ninto it we can. I am not saying there is not a need in Alaska or on the \nwest coast for this. What I am saying is there is a need for us to \nstart making choices. The choice has to be not whether we will pay for \nit, it is what is a lower priority than funding the fishery? We tend to \nwant to not want to make those choices. I am saying, in this amendment, \nthat we ought to have to.\n  We will see what the will of the Senate is. I probably already know \nthe answer to it. But the fact is that all we are doing is stealing \nfrom our kids. All of you know I can document over $200 billion a year \nin duplication, fraud, and waste in the Federal Government. We are not \noffering any of that to eliminate to be able to pay for this.\n  So if we are going to do the $150 million for fisheries, ought we not \nto cut spending somewhere else to pay for it? That is the whole point \nof this.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that amendment be set aside.\n\n[[Page S8434]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I believe I am through, Mr. Chairman, and I would make \nthe following point--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Again, I wish to thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \noffering all those amendments.\n  I would like to comment on Coburn 3370, division 1 on the tax cheats. \nI certainly want to compliment him on that amendment. Every single \nSenator wants to prevent tax cheaters from receiving any funding in \nthis bill. I am for all of those prohibitions on tax cheats. I carry a \nsimilar provision in my usual customary Commerce-Justice bill.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma also was very tentative about modifying it, \nbut he still covers the tax cheats, and also dead people can't get \nFederal funds. The Senator modified it to cover funeral expenses. But \nwe are also being told that this--by the Finance Committee--that this \namendment is not a blue slip issue.\n  I support the Senator's amendment, and if it is agreeable with the \nSenator from Oklahoma, on this side, we would like to take his \namendment tonight.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to have you take it. I have no objection.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Now on the fisheries part, we don't take the fisheries \npart.\n  Mr. COBURN. I understand that.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I oppose the division 2, the fisheries amendment. I \nunderstand the Senator's intention, but his point is that he tries to \nsay that fishery disaster funding should be for communities affected \nprimarily by Stafford Act requirements. The Stafford Act covers FEMA-\ncertified disasters. So in order to get help from FEMA, which is \ngoverned by the Stafford Act, it has to be certified by the President.\n  Fisheries are different because fisheries are covered under an agency \ncalled NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency. It is under \nthe Department of Commerce. So if you think you have a fisheries \ndisaster, you take that to the Secretary of Commerce, who has an \nexplicit criteria in order to qualify. You just can't say: Well, I \ndon't have the fish I used to. Oh, my lobster pots are a little rusty. \nNo. You have to have real criteria that you have been hit. Therefore, \nyou cannot get fisheries assistance unless a fishery disaster has been \ndeclared by the Secretary of Commerce.\n  Fishery disasters are necessary and urgent. Coastal fisheries, our \ncoastal communities--our fisheries are part of their identity, and they \nare certainly part of our economy. They certainly are in my State. And \nthose are the disasters that are covered here. So I hope the amendment \nof the Senator from Oklahoma is defeated.\n  His other amendments, I could comment upon, but I didn't know if the \ngentlelady from Louisiana, who chairs the Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity, of which FEMA is a member--I presume she would want to \ncomment on the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to just say a word broadly \nin response to Senator Coburn's statement and his offering of several \namendments to substantially in some cases and in other cases not so \nsubstantially change this bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding just a minute, and I \nknow the Senator from New York wants to respond as well.\n  Generally, I would like to say that I know the Senator from Oklahoma \nis very sincere. Literally no one in this Chamber has worked harder to \ntry to get more reform and eliminate duplication. But I just wish to \nsay one thing in response. When we have emergencies in this country, \nlike when we go to war, no one comes to the floor to debate how we are \ngoing to offset $1.4 trillion worth of expense for two wars, Iraq and \nAfghanistan. When we came to the floor a couple of years ago to vote \nfor tax cuts, many of us claimed and said at the time there would not \nbe enough money to cover them, we had to borrow money to do that. The \nother side sat quietly and didn't say a word. Why is it that when \nAmericans--when a building is blown up in Oklahoma or when the levees \nbreak in Louisiana or when the worst storm in 50 years comes, we have \nto debate an offset?\n  Now, this bill is not going to be offset; it is going to pass, I \nhope. And I understand Senator Coburn's comments, but I want to say \nthat when Americans are hurting, people can recover if we give them the \nadequate response early enough in the disaster.\n  Secondly, and then I am going to sit down, the thresholds, the \ndebris, and the contracting--there are some legitimate concerns, but \nthere are reforms in the underlying bill that will help to do better \ncontracting, better debris removal, and more efficient cleanup and \nrecovery after a disaster.\n  So I ask the Senator, please, I understand we have a big budget \nissue, but this is not the time to debate the cost of this bill. What \nit is time to debate is what should be in it and what shouldn't, and I \nthink the Senator from New York has more specifics about some of the \nrecommendations.\n  But I thank the chairlady from Maryland for organizing this effort \ntonight, and I will submit more for the record in the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have a lot I want to say in reference to my good \nfriend from Oklahoma, but I know my colleagues from Oregon and Michigan \nhave a time commitment, so I am just going to ask unanimous consent \nthat they be allowed to offer their amendment and then I, using our \ntime on this amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would object to that at this point in time. I would \nhave liked to have had 5 minutes. I have to be somewhere at 7:30. I \ncame down here, but I wanted to make some points before I leave. I was \ntrying to sum up.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Then I will go after the Senator from Oklahoma as well.\n  Mr. COBURN. That is fine.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Did I inadvertently interrupt you?\n  Mr. COBURN. That is fine. I have to leave, but I want to make some \npoints.\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I would like to thank very much Senator \nBlunt and Senator Stabenow, who have worked so hard to bring together a \ncommon vision in how we can address the terrible disasters of drought \nand wildfires that ravaged many parts of the country this last summer.\n  Now, we are no longer in the summer, so we are months late but better \nnow than to wait a single additional day.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Stabenow from Michigan and thank her so \nmuch for working so hard and well on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I first wish to thank Senator Merkley, who has been \ntireless in bringing forward the issues of farmers and ranchers in \nOregon. And to my colleagues who are here on the floor from New York \nand New Jersey, I had the opportunity to be in New Jersey with Senator \nMenendez and to see firsthand, also with Senator Landrieu and Senator \nTester. It is very, very clear that this is a horrific situation and \ndeserves our attention and support.\n  What we are doing with this amendment, as modified--and I want to \nthank Senator Blunt for working with us and cosponsoring the \namendment--is to basically take what we have done and already passed in \nthe farm bill and putting it into this very important disaster \nassistance bill.\n  In the spring, we experienced late freezes that wiped out many fruit \ncrops in a number of States, including Michigan, New York, and \nPennsylvania. In my home State, we had a 98-percent loss of cherry \ncrops, and they don't have access to any crop insurance. We are talking \nabout those who don't have that option to be able to help mitigate \ntheir losses.\n  In the summer, we saw the worst drought since 1956. It left crops \nwithering in the field. All across our country, over 80 percent of the \ncontiguous United States experienced drought conditions. Eleven States \nstill have exceptional drought conditions, and there are 17 States with \nsevere drought conditions.\n  I can't imagine having a disaster assistance bill come through this \nSenate without including help for our farmers and ranchers who have \nbeen hit so very hard this year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment and thank my colleague \nvery much for allowing us to offer it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am sorry that the Senator from Louisiana has left the \nfloor because if she would have checked my voting records, I have not \nvoted for\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\nextending the Bush tax cuts because they weren't paid for. I said that \non the floor. I have not voted to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \nbecause they weren't paid for.\n  So when we hear blanket statements that the other side--``the other \nside'' does not tow the line, as would be expected by the Senator from \nLouisiana, I have to object. The fact is, I have been very consistent \non those issues.\n  I don't think you give a tax cut without cutting spending in the \nFederal Government. That is what the debate is all about.\n  The reason we are here tonight--and we have a $60 billion bill that \nis not going to be paid for except by our grandkids, with interest, \nwhich is going to become $120 billion by the time it is ever paid \nback--is because we don't have the courage to actually go through and \nmake hard choices about what works and what doesn't, what is a priority \nand what is not.\n  Now, I don't have any illusions about my amendments passing. I am \nvery thankful that a couple of them have been accepted. But the real \nproblem that America sees at the end of this year is a problem with us, \nthat we think we can continue to do business the way we have always \ndone it. You know what. We can't.\n  We are going to pass this bill, and it is going to die because the \nHouse isn't going to take it up this year, and we are going to have to \ncome back and do it again. Hopefully, we are going to do it in the best \nway that helps the most people in New York and New Jersey and everybody \nelse who was involved there.\n  Right now, the FEMA money is flowing, and we need to increase the \nmoney. I am all for that. We need to make sure the flood insurance \nmoney goes out right away. But we better get hold of ourselves as a \nSenate and as a nation. We can say we have always done it this way. We \ncan say we can spend $60 billion and not pay for it. We can add all \nsorts of things. We have a crop insurance program for apples, but we \nare not going to cover it. We are going to go--even the people who \nweren't covered are going to get covered even though they didn't \nparticipate. Under this bill, they are going to get covered. So what we \nare going to do is actually undermine the crop insurance program for \napples.\n  But the point is that we are doing the same thing that got us into \nthe trouble we are in. We are at $16.4 trillion in debt. When you \ninclude all the debt the country has in terms of municipalities and \nStates, that is how you compare apples to apples with everybody else. \nWe are at 120 percent debt to GDP ratio. It is killing our economy \nright now. Multiple studies show that it is probably hurting our GDP by \n1.5 percent. That is 1.5 million jobs every year, and we are sitting \nhere talking about we are in a different time, that we don't have $16 \ntrillion worth of debt, that we are not going to have trillion-dollar \ndeficits as far as the eye can see. We are totally disconnected from \nreality.\n  So I am not going to win. I understand that. I understand there is a \nneed, and I want to supply that need, but how we do it is important for \nthe future of this country. It is also important for our kids.\n  So we can rationalize and say that we have always done it this way, \nthat this is the way the rules work, but there is going to be a very \nbig price to pay, and when that price comes, those who are sitting in \nopposition to my amendments are going to see the consequences of that \nopposition played out in the worst possible way.\n  The debt bomb in this country is going to explode, and we are going \nto be held accountable for it whether we are still here or not. Our \nlineage, our reputation, our history as Senators in this Congress is \ngoing to come back to us that we weren't up to the task of making the \nhard decisions that would actually save this country, that would fix \nthe problems and put us on track to grow again and be the America we \ncan be.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time and the chairwoman for her \nconsideration. I thank Senator Schumer for his consideration on the \namendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague and very much appreciate my \ncolleague from Oklahoma. He has left, but we do have a friendship. I do \nbelieve he is a person of integrity. His views about government and \npolitics are quite different from mine. He has put his money where his \nmouth is in a number of places when he has not asked to pay for things \nthat many on the other side did, et cetera. So I thank him.\n  I don't agree with almost anything--well, I agree with maybe one or \ntwo of his amendments. And Senator Mikulski summed up the amendment on \nfisheries very well, so I will talk about some of the other amendments \nand why we object to them. It will take a few minutes, but I think it \nis important to set the record straight.\n  Let me take them in numerical order--first, amendment No. 3368, to \nstrike enhanced cost share for the Army Corps. Well, Mr. President, in \npast supplementals we established an important precedent for local cost \nshare on Army Corps projects that this amendment will strike. We have \ncrucial projects with the Army Corps. As my colleague from New York, \nSenator Gillibrand, knows, and Senators Menendez and Lautenberg from \nNew Jersey, we are naked in heavily populated areas after the storm. \nThis storm was huge. But you would have to be foolish to think there \nwon't be another one, and we need the Army Corps. They are brilliant in \nthe way they are able to protect our coasts. So this needs to be done.\n  If the local cost share were to go to 35 percent--we don't have just \none big State government, we have lots of little localities. Take Long \nBeach, a city of 35,000. It was wiped out--gone, basically. If they \nwere to have to come up with 35 percent of the project, it would be \nhopeless.\n  Now, Katrina got 100 percent. We are not even asking for that. But \nthe 90 percent that has traditionally been given to Army Corps projects \nwhen the damage is so large that it is realized the locality cannot pay \nfor it alone makes eminent sense. The village of Lindenhurst, the \nvillage of Massapequa, the villages on Fire Island all do not have the \nwherewithal.\n  If we were to pass the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, we \nwould get no Army Corps relief. Then when storms much smaller than \nSandy come along, we would be wiped out again. So it doesn't make \nsense. The Long Beach Storm Damage Reduction Project, for instance, has \na local cost share of $35 million. That is more than a quarter of the \nentire city's annual budget. If they had to pay this share, it wouldn't \nget built. The same thing for the little village of Asharoken, which \nwas terribly damaged.\n  Again, in the past, when there has been large damage, the Army Corps \nhas paid 90 percent, localities 10 percent. To change those rules now \nfor New York, after New York taxpayers and New Jersey taxpayers paid \nhundreds of millions of dollars toward projects on the Mississippi or \nthe Missouri River or down in the gulf at a 90-10 percent ratio, would \nbe totally unfair.\n  This amendment would be a crippling amendment, and I strongly urge \nits rejection.\n  On fisheries, again, my colleague from Maryland, our wonderful new \nchair--off to a great start, and I might say, Madam Chair, this being \nyour first bill, you are going like gangbusters, but we didn't expect \nanything less--has laid out the arguments for those fisheries. The only \nthing I would say about them is, hey, that is a disaster too. As she \nsaid, this is not just a case of needing new lobster pots, this is a \ndisaster, and traditionally we have funded disaster relief in \nsupplemental bills, and it doesn't have to be just one area.\n  So I thank my colleagues, particularly those from Maine and from \nAlaska, who put such good work into this, and I also again thank \nSenator Coburn for separating out the tax cheat provisions. Nobody \nbehind in their taxes should get Federal aid. That is a provision I can \naccept and I think most of us on this side will accept.\n  Amendment No. 3371 is the Coburn amendment on the per capita damage \nthresholds. The amendment would require FEMA to actually change the \nindicator by which FEMA determines the locality's eligibility for FEMA \npublic assistance. It would make it much harder for States and local \ngovernments in the future to get Federal aid after a disaster. It \nsounds benign, but\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\nthis is a choke hold on FEMA for many localities and particularly for \nlarger States, such as those we represent.\n  As my colleagues know, the current per capita damage thresholds are \npegged to the Consumer Price Index, and CPI measures the average change \nover time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a specific market \nof basket goods.\n  For New York, the per capita threshold that has to be reached for a \ncounty to be declared a major disaster area is $1.37. The amendment of \nmy colleague would peg the per capita threshold starting at the \ntimeline of 1986. There would have to be such enormous damage in so \nmany localities to get money, and in effect it would double the per \ndamage threshold needed to be declared a disaster area.\n\n  In every State, we have watched as disasters occurred and kept our \nfingers crossed to see if the Federal Government would declare that \narea a disaster. It is based on a formula. The formula is not easy to \nreach. I have had countless counties disappointed, asking me: Why \ndidn't we meet the threshold? But to now make the threshold almost \ndoubly hard to meet wouldn't work.\n  I say to my good friend from Oklahoma--and I know this may not change \nhis view on the amendment because, as I said, he is a person of \nintegrity--for the six major disaster declarations declared in Oklahoma \nover the last 2 years, the damage per person would have had to be \ndouble its current level. I imagine those in Oklahoma who were impacted \nby severe winter storms, tornadoes, and floods wouldn't be happy to \nhear it is harder now--if this amendment were to pass--to repair roads, \nremove debris, and support emergency response efforts.\n  So I would say to every one of my colleagues in every State, if you \nwant to pull back on Federal disaster assistance by changing to an \narcane formula when there is substantive damage, support this \namendment. I hope we will reject it.\n  The next amendment is No. 3382, and I urge my colleagues to vote no \non this. This would place a lot more bureaucratic redtape between \ndisaster victims and the Federal assistance they deserve.\n  Our good friend from Louisiana coached Senator Menendez, Senator \nGillibrand, Senator Lautenberg, and myself about what went wrong with \nKatrina, and one of those things was that the contracting procedure had \nbecome so arcane and so rigid and so difficult that contracts either \nnever happened or they took much too long to do. Now, should we expect \nevery contract to be competitively bid? What about emergency contracts? \nDo we want to have a 6-month bidding process when the damage needs \ncorrection in 90 days--picking up debris, building back a beach that \nmight face a storm in 30 days? Second, we in New York have our own \ncompetitive bidding requirements. Those can suffice. Why have double \nsets of them? And sometimes the States and localities have to waive \nthem when there are true emergencies.\n  So sometimes our colleagues are placing us in a catch-22. They say: \nYou don't spend disaster relief fast enough; you stretch it out over \nsuch long periods of time. Then they impose requirements that make sure \nwe don't spend the money fast enough. It doesn't make sense.\n  If the amendment by Senator Coburn passes, it will guarantee disaster \naid could be delayed for months and years, and the consequences of \nthat--the economic cost, the danger to our coastlines, our localities, \nour small businesses, and the human cost--would be a terrible, terrible \nway to go. I believe this is a Trojan horse that will cripple efforts \nto bring quick, efficient, and honest disaster aid to our localities, \nand I urge its defeat.\n  Amendment No. 3383. This strikes ACOE studies and authorization. Now, \nagain, we don't want the rules changed on us. Sometimes we have \nimproved the rules to make sure we learn from the mistakes of past \ndisasters, but to just change the rules from past supplementals makes \nno sense.\n  As many of us here know, the project of getting coastal protection \nbuilt by the Army Corps can be mired in redtape and delays. Every one \nof us has experience there. What is taking you so long, Army Corps? The \nprovision being struck by amendment No. 3383 is designed to accelerate \ncritical protection projects and get rid of the redtape.\n  I know my colleague from Oklahoma believes in less bureaucracy and \nmore efficiency. Well, if this passed, we would be giving the people of \nStaten Island or Massapequa more bureaucracy. For a decade, for \ninstance, the Corps had delayed a protection project for the South \nShore of Long Island due to lack of funding and authorizations from \nCongress. They decided and they said it made sense, but they didn't get \nit done. Had these seawalls been built, it is almost certain lives \nwould have been saved and millions of dollars in property damage \navoided.\n  So in this bill, such as with Katrina, we are accelerating the \nability to do that. We are accelerating it in Long Beach. In 2005 Long \nBeach rejected a project I helped to push to build dunes to protect \nthat flat, low-lying area with low-lying homes from storms. The Army \nCorps has done the study. The Army Corps has said: Here is what is \nright; let's move forward. Under the amendment of my friend, we could \nnot, even though all the preliminary work has been done.\n  So I urge a ''no'' vote on this amendment.\n  OK, I think I have addressed the major amendments to which I object. \nAs I said, I don't object to every one of my colleagues' amendments, \nbut I object to the major ones, and I hope we can have a bipartisan \namendment.\n  Mr. President, for 100 years, when disaster has struck, we have been \none America. We have said: We know any locality, even large localities \nsuch as New York, New Jersey, and Maryland, won't be able to handle \nthat sort of disaster relief on its own. And in wisdom, we have said: \nWe are one united people. And the people of the other regions, the \nother States, will come to the aid of this area that has been crippled. \nWe can't change the rules now.\n  Those of us from New York and New Jersey say: Aha. Some of my \nconstituents and I am sure some of the constituents of Senator Menendez \nare saying: Aha--now that it is New York and New Jersey, they are \nchanging the rules. Not fair. We have been there. We have been there \nfor our colleagues whenever they have had disasters, and praise God, we \nhaven't had that many until recently, but we need you.\n  You will need us. Given all the changes in the world, there will be \ndisasters that strike everywhere else. We want to be with you, and we \ndon't want to see the process so encumbered and so weighted down that \nrelief cannot come. The sum total of these amendments would be to do \nthat.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues, hopefully in a bipartisan vote, to \nreject them.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. First, I wish to thank the distinguished chairwoman of \nthe Appropriations Committee for the work she and her staff have put \ntogether. It is remarkable considering the timeframe they were in. Of \ncourse, the late Senator Inouye, with his staff as well that the \nchairwoman has inherited, did an exceptional amount of work along with \nSenator Landrieu. Certainly the people of the Northeast thank you very \nmuch.\n  I think Senator Schumer has done a good job overall of talking about \nour concerns about these amendments, but I want to give a little \ngreater depth and certainly a New Jersey perspective to them.\n  I do not question the motives of our distinguished colleague from \nOklahoma. He has been consistent in that. I don't question his \nconsistency. Even though I haven't checked the record, I will take his \nword that even on tax cuts and war spending he has been consistent. But \nI do question the consequences of some of his amendments--consequences \nto the people of the Northeast, consequences to the people of New \nJersey, consequences in the future as it relates to other disasters.\n  At one point, he talked about courage in a fiscal sense. Let me tell \nyou, courage is what people in New Jersey are looking at each and every \nday when they find their businesses closed and are trying to sum up the \ncourage to open again. Courage is those who have lost their homes and \nare trying to reopen their homes, which they could not even do for the \nholidays. They were certainly not home for Christmas.\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\nCourage is looking at that every day and trying to figure how you move \nforward. Courage is many of the small municipalities, many that lost \ntheir police and fire departments and are working with others to create \npublic safety as they rebuild the very essence of their departments. \nThat is courage, real courage in the face of incredible challenge.\n  Two of the amendments dealing with the Army Corps go straight to that \ncourage. I came to the floor over the last 2 weeks several times and \nshowed a host of visuals to our colleagues to understand that we are at \nthe lowest level of protection. It is akin to an individual whose \nimmune system is virtually gone. I said then, all we need is a \nnor'easter to come through and we will see the consequences of having \nno defenses.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday we suffered a nor'easter. It wasn't the \nworst of what we could have received, but for several parts of New \nJersey it was certainly bad news because those communities that are \ndefenseless as a result of not having Army Corps-engineered beaches \ncaught the worst of it again. In Sea Bright and Mantoloking and a host \nof other communities along the Jersey shore, they caught the worst of \nit again and all the fears and all the nightmares of what they went \nthrough under Sandy were relived once again.\n  When you talk about changing the rules on the Army Corps' \nparticipation in terms of what he wants as a 90-10 split, No. 1, that \nchanges the rules. Just to make sure I was right about this, I asked \nSenator Landrieu of Louisiana: Wait a minute. In Katrina, wasn't there \na 90-10 split? She said, Yes; and in some cases up to 100.\n  The people of the Northeast, the people of New Jersey and New York, \ndeserve no less in their disaster. There are a whole host of \ncommunities even with a 90-10 split that are going to find it \nincredibly difficult--when 20 or 25 percent of their ratable base is \ngone--to fund the 10 percent that we are asking them. We believe they \nshould have skin in the game. But even at that 10 percent, they are \ngoing to have enormous difficulties funding that 10 percent to get the \nlifesaving, property-saving, fiscally responsible solution in having \nArmy Corps-engineered beaches.\n  So 90-10 is still a challenge to a whole host of communities. Go to \nthe proposition that our colleague from Oklahoma has, and we basically \nnullify their ability to protect their citizens. I always thought the \nNo. 1 priority of any government--Federal, State or local--was to \nprotect their citizens. Certainly, the Senate should be protecting its \ncitizens, whether it is abroad or at home. In this respect, we cannot \nprotect our citizens along the New Jersey coastline if, in fact, we \ncannot have these engineered beaches and if, in fact, we cannot afford \nto have those engineered beaches.\n  So talk about being fiscally responsible. Instead, we will pay \nbillions in repetitive-loss damages, and we will lose lives as we lost \nin New Jersey. I want to save lives and I want to save property and I \nwant to save the Federal Government from paying repetitive losses. That \nis why that amendment is certainly not one we can accept by any stretch \nof the imagination. It is unfair to the people of the Northeast because \nit changes the rules of the game, and it is unfair in terms of our \nobligation to the public safety. I, for one, do not want to be casting \na vote that ultimately leaves my fellow New Jerseyans or fellow \nAmericans at risk when I could have saved their lives. I am certainly \nnot going to do that, and I hope this Chamber is not going to do that.\n  Secondly, with reference to the other Army Corps of Engineers \namendment, which would suggest that those projects that are already \nwell underway to being determined and that, in fact, are cost-effective \nand can save lives and save property and save ratables and save \nrepetitive losses cannot be approved, would be, in essence, to \nguarantee that at the lowest rate of our defenses we will just suffer \nan entire winter of incredible misery, no, we cannot have that \namendment pass.\n  Thirdly, with reference to the question of acquisition, the Governor \nof New Jersey made that decision. I can't speak for him, but my \nunderstanding is he made that decision from FEMA-approved contracts. If \nFEMA needs a better process to go ahead and negotiate and/or bid in \nadvance of a generic contract, so be it. But a delayed recovery is a \nfailed recovery. I want my colleagues to remember that 10 days after \nHurricane Katrina, this Chamber passed two separate bills amounting to \n$60 billion. It has been nearly 2 months since we had Superstorm Sandy \nand nothing has passed. Who among us would be content with the counsels \nof patience and delay if, in fact, we were shivering in the cold; if, \nin fact, our families had no home; if, in fact, they had been displaced \nfrom their schools; if, in fact, their businesses that they worked a \nlifetime and took out debt and now are closed may never open, who among \nus would be happy with the counsels of patience and delay? So we cannot \nhave a set of circumstances that creates a series of delays.\n\n  I am all for the good governing amendments of saying to those who are \nin debt to the Nation that they, in fact, cannot receive any benefits \nor those who are deceased. Of course, they should not receive any \nbenefits. But the rest of this is about creating delay after delay that \nis in the midst of a biting winter. We just had the first nor'easter \nyesterday. We cannot ultimately accept those types of changes that put \nus in a process in which, in fact, we will not be able to successfully \nmove the elements of being able to recover.\n  This constant reference that a great part of the money--the \noverwhelming part of the money will not be spent, I think I heard 2015, \nis simply not the case. Whether it be Army Corps of Engineers projects \nthat have already been approved and authorized but not funded that are \ncritical to our defenses, those are ready to go. They just need money. \nThe flexibility we have sought in this bill, working with an incredible \ninsight from what happened in Hurricane Katrina and what worked and did \nnot work, that flexibility will allow money to flow to business people \nare at the crucial point of trying to decide: Can I open? Because I \nneed to know what the government is going to do for me, as part of my \nequation as to whether I open this business. Because low-interest loans \nfrom the SBA, even a long-term proposition, is still more debt. Many of \nthese businesspeople that I have met up and down New Jersey have told \nme: Senator, I took out money to start this business. I took a debt to \nstart this business. I took out further debt through the great \nrecession. More debt doesn't necessarily mean I will succeed, but a \ngrant, as we authorize through CDBG block grants, can very well make \nthe difference between me reopening and not and hiring back people and \nbeing able to have and be part of that ratable base and paying toward \nthe greater good of the State and the Nation. That is what is at stake \nas well. That money is going to flow if we do this the right way as \nthis bill envisions. So this suggestion that it is going to take years \ndown the road is simply not true.\n  Secondly, I think we lose sight that while, yes, this is about New \nJersey and New York and Connecticut, it is about a region--a region \nthat employs 10 percent of the Nation's workforce and accounts for 11 \npercent of the entire Nation's GDP. That is 12.7 million workers and \n$1.4 trillion in productivity. If we want to see that region continue \nto contribute to the gross domestic product growth of this country, to \ncontinue to contribute to the employment, to continue to contribute to \nthe Federal coffers, we need to help it to be able to help themselves, \nnot to turn our back on them. That is what is at stake.\n  Finally, I would just say there is a whole host of other disasters, \nand the committee has been very focused on saying nothing goes into \nthis bill that isn't disaster related, one disaster or another. Because \nthere has been no other disaster funding that there has been a vehicle \nfor, whether it be wildfires or crop disasters--I personally welcome \nthat, because as I have said many times, this is the United States of \nAmerica. There is a reason we call it the United States of America. It \nis so we are all in this together. So I welcome the fact that we can \nhelp other fellow Americans through this vehicle, whether it be about \nwildfires or crop disasters or estuaries and fisheries that were hurt \nin other parts of the country at different times. So be it. Because \nthat is what being the United States of America is all about.\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\n  But we need to pass this bill tomorrow. We need to reject these \namendments--particularly the ones that I and Senator Schumer have \ntalked about--because they will fail us in our recovery. It will \nundermine our ability to protect our people.\n  Finally, I would just simply say we need to pass it so the House can \nconsider this bill as its vehicle when they come back on Sunday. This \nbill has been out there for weeks. The President's proposal has been \nout there for over 1 month. Everybody knows what has been asked. \nEverybody knows what is involved. Everybody has seen that the Senate \nalready voted for cloture; therefore, there is going to be a bill here \nat the end of the day. There is no reason why the House cannot seek to \npass this and respond to our fellow citizens in the Northeast. That is \nwhat being the United States of America is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I seek recognition to rebut the Coburn \namendment and also to offer two amendments. But before I do, I just \nwish to thank my colleagues, particularly those who have amendments. I \nwish to thank them for their cooperation and being willing to offer \nthem and speak tonight, on both sides of the aisle.\n  I would also note the Senator from New York and the Senator from \nConnecticut also wish to speak. Senators whose States have been very \nhard hit should have the opportunity to speak, and I am going to take \nmy rebuttal of the Coburn amendments and just abbreviate them.\n  With the exception of being willing to accept the amendment where you \ncannot get emergency assistance if you are a tax cheater or if you \npassed away, with the exception of a funeral benefit, I object to the \nCoburn amendments. My objections have been so well articulated by the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Schumer, and by the Senator from New Jersey, \nMr. Menendez.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Coburn amendment No. 3369. \nThis amendment makes no sense. It would require the Departments of \nTransportation and Housing and Urban Development to make public any \ngrant announcement three days before either department announces the \ngrant. In other words, do something three days before you are going to \ndo it.\n  I understand the Senator's intent, which is to eliminate the ability \nof Members to have a brief advance notice of pending grant \nannouncements. However, in trying to weaken Congress' legitimate \noversight role, the amendment overreaches. More importantly, I don't \nagree with this effort to cede Congress' role in these notifications. \nTherefore, I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. President, not everything in the Senator's amendment No. 3371 is \nobjectionable. Unfortunately, it is loaded down with at least two \nprovisions that make it impossible to support related to FEMA efforts \nto aid disaster victims and help communities rebuild.\n  First, returning funds appropriated in this bill that have not been \nobligated and spent within two years to the Treasury is unreasonable. \nFEMA will of course obligate the funds provided in this bill in less \nthan two years. However, spending the funds to complete the rebuilding \nof schools, hospitals, police stations, surge barriers, floodgates, and \nlevees will take longer. Communities will need time to do the proper \nplanning, competently bid for projects, fulfill State action plans, do \nsite selection and development, complete audits and then request for \nthe federal government to reimburse the eligible costs in the right \namount. To do this responsibly and within the bounds of proper \noversight, it will take more than two years to reimburse the eligible \nexpenditures.\n  On the one hand, the Senator wants FEMA to spend the money faster \nwhile on the other hand he imposes more restrictive and time consuming \nFederal standards for competition.\n  The second objectionable provision in this amendment is to cap FEMA's \nrecovery assistance to States at 75 percent of the costs of damages. \nThis ties the hands of the Nation to support the needs of the victims \nof the most severe disasters.\n  The Stafford Act currently requires that FEMA provide assistance at \n75 percent of the cost of the recovery. However, in cases where damages \nhave proven to be extremely severe FEMA can increase its share to 90 \npercent. The adjustment to 90 percent is based on an objective formula \nthat considers per capita damage, which must reach over $131 per \nperson. The threshold is difficult for states to reach unless they \nexperience a severe event.\n  I oppose this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3382\n\n  This amendment would require merit-based and competitive awards of \ndisaster recovery contracts. This amendment would prohibit the use of \nany disaster funds for contracts not competitively awarded pursuant to \nthe Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR. This would appear unnecessary, \nbecause the FAR already limits non-competitive contracts to one year, \nin general.\n  The amendment would also require a review of disaster recovery \ncontracts that were awarded prior to enactment of the Supplemental that \nweren't competitively bid. For any contracts not competitively bid, \nagencies would be required to achieve cost savings or to award a new \ncompetitive contract, and discontinue the original contract.\n  The requirement for retroactive review of contracts that were awarded \nbefore the date of enactment for which other than competitive \nprocedures were used for the purpose of determining if additional cost \nsavings can be achieved or whether a new contract should be pursued \nwould pose a significant burdensome and disruptive task.\n  The amendment would require hiring up additional contracting staff to \nhandle the ``looking back review'' and potential ``re-competition'' \nenvisioned in order for the current staff to contract for the supplies \nand services needed to respond to and recover from Hurricane Sandy. \nSince there is a limited number of contracting officers available to \nFederal agencies, complying with this provision, should it be enacted, \nhas the very real potential to limit DHS's ability to meet ongoing \nmission requirements.\n  Furthermore, no date or parameters are established for conducting and \ncompleting these reviews, so agencies would not know how far back to \nreview. One could assume the amendment means only those currently \noperating contracts, but it does not specify.\n  For those agencies in the midst of recovery efforts for Hurricane \nSandy, is the intent that they stop ongoing efforts (to include \nobligating those additional funds that are coming) to undertake such a \nreview? How can the workforce still supporting the disaster be handling \nthe ongoing efforts to support the disaster and at the same time be \nreviewing what they did in November?\n  Complying with this mandate, should it be enacted, has the very real \npotential to adversely impact the Government's ability to meet their \nongoing disaster recovery missions.\n  This amendment requires agencies to terminate contracts if cost \nsavings can be realized. The burden of the analysis alone would be \ndaunting especially since no threshold is specified. This amendment \nwould require agencies to review even purchase card orders. Terminating \ncontracts for convenience is not inexpensive--there significant \nadministrative costs, and it is labor-intensive.\n  This amendment would be onerous and costly and will hinder the \nrecovery and repair effort. Therefore, Mr. President, I recommend that \nthis amendment be opposed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3383\n\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 3383. The \nproviso that my friend proposes to strike authorizes projects for the \nCorps to construct that would reduce the impacts from flooding and \nprovide storm damage reduction. I agree with my friend that the \nprovision that he proposed to strike could be read as overly broad and \nauthorized projects for construction that were not intended nor could \nthey be constructed with the amount of funding that was provided.\n  Senators Feinstein and Boxer have addressed the shortcoming of that \nprovision by striking it with an earlier amendment--No. 3421 and \nreplacing it with new text. This new text no longer authorizes an \nundefined set of projects. Rather, it directs funding to be utilized to \nconstruct projects in areas that suffered direct inundation impacts \nfrom\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\nHurricanes Sandy and Isaac. This provides a defined scope for the work \nthat the Corps can construct with the funds provided.\n  The provision requires that the projects to be undertaken must be \ncost effective, technically feasible and environmentally acceptable. I \nthink my friend would agree that should be the goal of all of the Corps \nprojects that we fund. Voting for this amendment would undo the defined \nrequirements and scope for these projects that we previously voted for.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3370\n\n  Mr. President, I oppose Division 2 of amendment No. 3370. Division 2 \nof this amendment tries to steer fishery disaster funding for \ncommunities only affected by Hurricane Sandy by citing Stafford Act \nrequirements and limiting funding for area within \\1/2\\ mile from \nshore.\n  But the Stafford Act overseas disasters on land. The Act has \nabsolutely no bearing on fishery disasters, fishery disasters are \ndeclared by the Secretary of Commerce according to Federal Fishery and \nCommerce laws at the request of the State Governors.\n  Fishery disaster needs are necessary, urgent, unanticipated and these \ncoastal fisheries are not bound by some arbitrary \\1/2\\ mile boundary.\n  Under this amendment all federally declared fishery disasters would \nmiss out on much needed financial assistance, even those communities \naffect by Hurricane Sandy. Fishery disaster funding is not just about \nfixing damaged boats and waterfronts. It is about rebuilding smarter \nfisheries so that businesses and coastal communities stand a better \nshot of avoiding future disasters. I strongly urge my colleagues to \noppose this amendment.\n  Mr. President, in the interest of time, I think we all agree why the \nvery intent to save money by adding delay and bureaucracy will cost \nmoney and will cost time, in terms of getting people back on their \nfeet, both in their home and in their livelihood. Remember what we \nseek: helping people get their life back and helping them get their \nlivelihood back. I think that has been very well articulated.\n  I would now also like to take the opportunity to call up and dispose \nof two amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3403\n\n  I call up, on behalf of Senator Leahy, amendment No. 3403.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for Mr. Leahy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3403.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide authority to transfer previously appropriated \n    funds to increase security at United States embassies and other \n                            overseas posts)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. INCREASED EMBASSY SECURITY.\n\n       Funds appropriated under the heading ``Administration of \n     Foreign Affairs'' under Title VIII of Division I of Public \n     Law 112-74 and as carried forward under Public Law 112-175, \n     may be transferred to, and merged with, any such other funds \n     appropriated under such title and heading: Provided, That \n     such transfers shall be subject to the regular notification \n     procedures of the Committees on Appropriations.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment simply provides authority \nto the State Department to transfer up to approximately $1 billion in \nOverseas Contingency Operations funds appropriated in Fiscal Year 2012 \nfor operations. in Iraq, which are no longer needed in Iraq due to \nreduced operations there, and to use these funds for increased security \nat U.S. embassies and other overseas posts identified in the \nDepartment's security review after the Benghazi attack.\n  Making additional funds available for these purposes is one of the \nrecommendations of the Accountability Review Board chaired by \nAmbassador Pickering and Admiral Mullen.\n  The amendment permits the transfer of funds between the Diplomatic \nand Consular Programs and Embassy Security Construction and Maintenance \naccounts, which would otherwise be precluded due to percentage \nlimitations on such transfers.\n  According to CBO the amendment has no outlay scoring impact.\n  We all want to do what we can to prevent another tragedy like what \noccurred in Benghazi. The State Department has done a review, and these \nfunds will be used to expedite construction of Marine security guard \nposts at overseas posts, and to build secure embassies in Beirut, \nLebanon and Harare, Zimbabwe.\n  There is nothing controversial about this amendment. These are \nexisting funds. There is no new appropriation. The amendment has no \nscoring impact. It is simply a matter of allowing unobligated, prior \nyear funds to be used for a different purpose of higher priority--\nprotecting our diplomats stationed in dangerous places around the \nworld.\n  That amendment will be voted on tomorrow.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3426 to Amendment No. 3395\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have an amendment on behalf of Senator \nHarkin. I call up amendment No. 3426.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3426.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To make a technical correction)\n\n       On page 81, strike lines 9 through 13 and insert the \n     following: ``Provided further, That obligations incurred for \n     the purposes provided herein prior to the enactment of this \n     Act may be charged to this appropriation: Provided further, \n     That funds appropriated in this paragraph may be used to make \n     grants for renovating, repairing, or rebuilding non-Fed-''.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this amendment makes two very technical \ncorrections that are necessary for proper implementing of funding for \nthe Department of Health and Human Services in the supplemental. First, \nit deletes the term ``response activities for hurricane Sandy'' and \nreplaces it with ``the purposes provided herein.'' That is a small \nverbal change but ``response activities'' has a limited meaning. This \nchange does clarify that funds may also be used to cover additional \nrecovery and related costs connected to Hurricane Sandy. Second, it \nadds the phrase ``to make grants'' to clarify that the Department of \nHHS has specific grant-making authority for renovating, repairing, and \nrebuilding non-Federal facilities involved in NIH research. For \nexample, an academic center of excellence, well known for its work, \nparticularly in cancer research, will have the opportunity to rebuild.\n  I recommend support of this amendment. Senator Shelby has signed off \non it. I believe it is not controversial. CBO says it does not score at \nall, and I understand the minority staff on the Labor-HHS \nAppropriations Committee has also signed off on those changes.\n  Mr. President, that amendment, too, will be voted on tomorrow if not \naccepted. Tonight we are just not accepting amendments and we are not \nvoice voting them.\n  I also want to note we have two Members on the floor whose States \nwere hard hit. One is the Senator from New York about whom Senator \nSchumer has spoken. I know Senator Gillibrand wishes to speak. The \norder we will follow is Senator Gillibrand will speak for such time as \nshe may consume to be followed by the Senator from Connecticut and such \ntime as he may consume in speaking on behalf of the bill.\n  Before the Senator speaks, though, a word to the Senator from \nConnecticut. Connecticut has been hit twice--first by the hurricane and \nthen by what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary. For those of us who \njoin with you, we just want the people of Connecticut to know they are \nnot alone. As the Senator from New Jersey who spoke earlier said, you \nknow we are the United States of America. Where there was a disaster in \none State, we all have to respond as if it were a disaster in all \nStates. The attack on one child in Connecticut--we have to protect all \nchildren, in Connecticut and in every single State in this Union. I \nhope, as we find those solutions, we do act as a union, the United \nStates of America.\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\n  Once again, our sympathy and condolences, and I yield the floor to \nthese very able Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I thank the chairwoman for her \nleadership on this essential bill. I can't thank her enough for her \ntenacity and determination to meet the needs of so many affected \nfamilies in our State.\n  I also thank Senator Landrieu for her leadership to help craft this \nbill in a way that has transparency and accountability and to learn \nfrom the mistakes of the past with Hurricane Katrina. She has worked \novertime to make this bill a reality and I thank her.\n  Of course, I thank my colleague Senator Schumer for his extraordinary \nleadership and Senators Menendez and Lautenberg on behalf of their \nState. It makes a huge difference. But I do want to start where Senator \nMikulski left off and give recognition to Senator Blumenthal.\n  During the holidays, we often reflect on our blessings. We think \nabout what is going well in our lives. We are very thankful for what \nhas been given to us, whether it is the health of our children, being \nin a safe, warm home, whether it is having a good job, whether it is \nhaving a business that is profitable--whatever those blessings are, \nthat is what the holidays are about, being grateful for them.\n  This holiday will be a very difficult time for so many families in \nNew York and New Jersey and Connecticut. There were many loved ones \nlost during Hurricane Sandy. There were many children lost in \nConnecticut. When a loved one is no longer around the dining room \ntable, when there are gifts that were bought that were not able to be \ngiven, it is a very sad time for our country.\n  What I am urging my colleagues to remember is what that loss feels \nlike in their own States. We have seen so many tragedies this last \nyear. We have seen so many disasters over the last several years. As \nSenator Mikulski has said and Senator Schumer has said: This country \nalways stands together in these times of disaster and grave need. When \nit was Hurricane Katrina, we stood by that State, that region; \nimmediately, within 10 days, we delivered $60 billion of aid and relief \nto the families in need. We did the same thing for Florida. Hurricane \nAndrew left devastation in its wake. We did the same thing when \ntornadoes hit Joplin, MO, and Tuscaloosa, AL. We stand by families in \ntimes of need. It is the job of the Federal Government to keep our \nfamilies and communities safe. It is what we do. It is that gratitude \nwe have when others come to our side in that moment of great need that \ndraws this body together.\n  What I am urging most is that we all do count our blessings during \nthese holidays, we do look to what we have and know there are many \nfamilies who are going without--without a warm home, without that loved \none who has been lost. We know from this disaster children were taken, \ngrandparents were taken, husbands and wives were lost. So the least we \ncan do is help a community rebuild from that devastation.\n  It starts with homes. We saw so much loss in our State. We worked out \nthat we needed about $17 billion to rebuild the homes in New York and \nwe asked for a community development block grant to cover that. Our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will have a substitute bill, \na substitute bill that will cut funding drastically. It is akin to, if \nyou have 5-alarm fire, you are just sending one firetruck because that \nis all you want to pay for today.\n  They have cut that money for housing from $17 billion to $2 billion, \nso what you are saying to the families in New York, New Jersey, and \nConnecticut in the region: We are just not going to rebuild your house.\n  FEMA right now provides individual assistance up to $31,000 for each \nhomeowner. You cannot rebuild a home for $31,000--particularly not in \nNew York. If you did not have insurance that covered or your insurance \nclaims didn't pay out or your insurance companies said, sorry, it was a \nflood, you are not covered, what are you supposed to do? You are \nhomeless. You have nowhere to go with your family.\n  That is what we have to address in this bill. We have to provide the \nresources for these families to rebuild. The businesses are suffering. \nI can tell you, I saw many businesses where the structures were in \nrubble, but every business owner I talked to said to me: I am a New \nYorker. I am going to rebuild. I am going to rebuild better. I was born \nhere. I am going to stay here.\n  That determination and that gratitude for what they have and what \nthey will have is what is going to make the difference.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for giving us a chance to advocate on \nbehalf of our families. We do need the help of everyone in this Chamber \nto do the right thing, to stand by others in their gravest time of \nneed. That is what we have always done and that is what we must do now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, for her kind and generous \nwords about the recent tragedies we suffered in Connecticut and her \nsense of compassion and kindness. I also thank her for her vision, \ncourage, and leadership on the legislation that is before us.\n  I want to associate myself with the very eloquent and powerful \nremarks made by both Senators from New York and the Senator from New \nJersey today.\n  I strongly oppose the amendments that would constrict and delay aid \nthat is as vital to Connecticut as it is to the other States of the \nregion that were hammered and pummeled by Superstorm Sandy on the night \nit hit our area. The scope and scale of destruction made it one of the \nlargest natural disasters to affect our Nation. It left millions of \npeople without homes or electricity, and it cost tens of billions of \ndollars in damages to governments, businesses, and residents. The sweep \nand depth of destruction in human impact and financial effect was \nsimply staggering. Our response should match its historic magnitude. We \nmust think big, act big, and go forward with a vision to meet the needs \nof the people in America.\n  As has been said, we are the United States of America. We meet \ncatastrophe with the resources and commitment that is necessary to make \nsure people are treated fairly. Delay or reduction in resources is \nunfair. In effect, delay is denial, just like justice delayed is \njustice denied. It would be unjust to delay the resources by the kinds \nof amendments and proposals that have been offered and in effect reduce \nthe amount of resources that can be available.\n  The estimates about the disaster can occupy much time on this floor, \nand I am going to be brief in describing what I think is necessary \nbecause I have spoken previously before committees of this body. \nSuffice it to say that right away we need to redouble our efforts to \nreduce the personal costs and property damage from this storm and also \nto prevent that kind of damage in future storms. We can invest now or \npay later. We will pay much more later if we fail to invest now.\n  The path toward enlightened protection and preparation must include \ninfrastructure improvements for Stamford's floodgate, the efforts on \nthe Housatonic River to stop flooding, and electricity security \nmeasures such as the establishment of microgrids and increased \navailability of generators for senior citizen housing. These are \nexamples of what can be done if we invest wisely now, and that is part \nof what this supplemental can do.\n  It is vitally necessary that we are prepared because these kinds of \ndisasters are, in fact, becoming the new normal. This storm is the \nfourth major disaster for the State of Connecticut in the past 19 \nmonths, and it is the fourth major disaster declaration for our State \nin that time. There was record snowfall in January of 2011, and later \nin 2011 Tropical Storm Irene hit our State, as well as a highly unusual \nOctober snowstorm. Now we have Superstorm Sandy. These kinds of natural \ndisasters demand the kind of response that the Senate can do if it \napproves this measure without these amendments that restrict and delay \nthese efforts.\n  We are building our infrastructure to 100-year storm levels, but \nunfortunately 100-year storms are happening just about every year. We \nhave to be\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\nprepared for the new normal by hardening critical infrastructure and \ntaking time and spending money to construct an infrastructure \nassessment that will allow States and municipalities to know what \ninfrastructure is at risk and what needs to be done to mitigate that \nrisk. Failing to meet the immediate needs of these areas is not only \nunkind, it is unwise.\n  As the Senator from New York just remarked, sending one firetruck to \na 5-alarm fire is not only unkind, it is unwise. Rebuilding a house for \na family that had three bedrooms and restricting it to one bedroom or \nno bedrooms is unkind and unwise because it will fail to provide \nhousing for that family.\n  I urge this body to provide the funding that Connecticut, New York, \nand New Jersey need to mitigate flooding and other damage from this \nstorm and from future storms and make sure these States receive the \nkind of aid that is necessary so we can not only repair and rebuild but \nalso prepare and prevent this kind of catastrophe in the future.\n  Again, I thank all of my colleagues who have been so instrumental in \nreaching this point. I urge my colleagues to come together in the \nspirit that the United States has always done when it has faced these \nkinds of catastrophes. We have always done the right thing even in the \nface of fiscal austerity for regions and areas of our country that have \nbeen hard hit through no fault of their own and that need this kind of \nimmediate relief.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of two \ncritical issues for my state--much-needed Emergency Watershed \nProtection Funds in the Supplemental Appropriation for Disaster \nAssistance and a Udall-Tester amendment that would add $653 million for \nU.S. Forest Service firefighting and wildfire prevention.\n  Let me begin by making one point absolutely clear: this is an \nemergency. Some have questioned the need for this funding and have \nasked why we wouldn't limit dollars just to Hurricane Sandy areas. The \nshort answer is that it is the smart thing to do, the right thing to do \nand the fair thing to do. I know these fires may seem like just another \nstory on CNN for some folks, but they have had devastating impacts in \nmy state and throughout the west. Wildfires destroy communities and \ntheir devastation persists for decades.\n  The country faced the third worst wildfire season in the nation's \nhistory last year, with more than 9.2 million acres burned--including \nthe Waldo Canyon and High Park fires, the two most destructive fires in \nColorado history. Next year is projected to be much worse, yet the U.S. \nForest Service will enter the 2013 fire season with a projected budget \nshortfall for preparing for and fighting these fires. They will also \nhave only eight large air tankers compared to 44 in 2000--which puts \nthem at a serious disadvantage in being able to attack these blazes. \nThe Udall-Tester amendment would address this critical issue and \nprovide $653 million to close the budget gap between what the Forest \nService has and what they absolutely need. This is nothing to sneeze \nat, but for perspective this amounts to only one percent of the \nemergency funds that would be sent to support Hurricane Sandy recovery.\n  These funds will enable pre-positioning of ground crews, hot shots, \nand air support in places where wildfire risk is very high. This is a \nsmart investment because early attack is critical to stop fires from \nbecoming mega-fires that devastate communities, take lives and \nproperty, and threaten water supplies. It also helps ensure that the \nForest Service doesn't have to rob other accounts such as timber, \nwatershed, and wildlife programs. Raiding other Forest Service funds is \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul: These other funds help eliminate dead wood \nand other fuels in our national forests, thus reducing future fire \nrisks.\n  And the risks wildfires pose persist long after the final embers are \nextinguished. That is why we also are seeking to fully fund the \nEmergency Watershed Protection Program. Communities across this \ncountry--including many impacted by Hurricane Sandy--are at risk of \ncatastrophic flooding and contaminated drinking water. This investment \nof $125 million in the bill before us is critical to help ensure that \nthese communities do not face further debilitating and life-threatening \nimpacts from these recent disasters.\n  In my state, the Emergency Watershed Protection Program is essential \nto protecting and restoring critical watersheds that are damaged by \nwildfires. This is especially true of the most devastating wildfires in \nColorado's history last summer--which, if left unaddressed, could cause \nserious flooding, landslide and other risks that threaten the lives of \nresidents in my state.\n  The High Park and Waldo Canyon fires tragically took lives, burned \nmore than 100,000 acres, and led to catastrophic loss of property, \nincluding well over 300 homes in Colorado's second-largest city. But \nthe initial impact could pale in comparison to the long-term impacts.\n  Without rehabilitation and restoration, the watersheds that provide \nmunicipal and agricultural water supplies are at risk from landslides, \nflooding and erosion, which could result in serious infrastructure \ndamage, water supply disruptions and even loss of life. Stabilizing and \nprotecting these communities' watersheds is not only the right thing to \ndo, it is also fiscally responsible.\n  If we do not quickly address these watersheds, taxpayers could face \nhundreds of millions of dollars in costs from what otherwise would have \nbeen a minor storm.\n  We need to fix what is wrong, and give these communities the peace of \nmind they deserve.\n  And I want to remind my colleagues that Congress has historically \nprovided Emergency Watershed Protection (or EWP) assistance for earlier \ndisasters before moving on to confront the needs created by subsequent \nevents. As of December 10, 2012, an estimated $47 million is needed to \nmitigate damaged watersheds in the aftermath of other presidentially-\ndeclared Stafford-Act disaster areas in Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana, \nFlorida, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Utah, and Wisconsin. This is \nin addition to the $40 million needed for communities affected by \nHurricane Sandy. We cannot leave these communities behind to suffer the \neffects of less recent disasters--whether they faced disaster from \nwildfire, hurricane or flood.\n  Mr. President, Coloradans unfortunately have already experienced some \nof these effects. For example, the usually crystal-clear Poudre River \nhas been flowing black due to ash and runoff from the fire. This forced \nthe downstream city of Fort Collins to shut off their water intake for \nover 100 days. Further downstream, the city of Greeley shut off their \nwater intakes for 36 days and are still only able to take a small \nfraction of their normal intake.\n  This photo shows a water main that supplies 75 percent of the backup \ndrinking water supply for the City of Colorado Springs--our second \nlargest city. This pipe used to be buried 8 feet deep but is now \nexposed due to runoff from the fire area.\n  How much more of an emergency do we need, when our most basic \nresource--drinking water supplies for three of Colorado's largest \ncities and its families and businesses--is threatened?\n  I'll give you one more example. The flood potential in the burned \nareas is now 20 times higher than before the fire, which means that \nareas are experiencing 100-year floods from the same amount of rainfall \nthat would have caused a 5-year flood before the wildfires.\n  Look at this photo. This is Highway 14, which is the major east-west \nartery through northern Colorado. This mudslide is one of many that \noccurred during one very minor rainstorm after the High Park fire. \nThese mudslides on our major roads put people, property, and commerce \nat risk. Already, families in the Colorado Springs vicinity have \nreceived at least four flash-flood warnings since the Waldo Canyon \nfire. The need for stabilizing this ground and restoring the burned \nareas on both federal and private land is critical to public safety, \npublic health and the prevention of another disaster.\n  I stand to support the recovery of the communities devastated by \nHurricane Sandy. But, I want to ensure that my colleagues here \nunderstand the gravity of the situation we're facing in Colorado and \nother states that are also confronting disaster needs. If we do not act \nright away, communities across this nation will see unnecessary flood\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\nrisks, contaminated water supplies, and even tragic deaths caused by \nour inaction.\n  So when someone asks whether EWP is necessary or critical, the answer \nemphatically is yes! For many of our communities in Colorado, this is \ntheir #1 priority in Congress and I'm not going to let their critical \nneeds go unmet. I ask each of my colleagues to support this important \nfunding in the bill before us today.\n  I thank you for your attention and request that my statement appear \nin the appropriate place in the Record.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations bill for Hurricane Sandy. This is a \ncritically important bill for the States that were affected by this \nstorm--not only New York and New Jersey, which saw almost unimaginable \ndevastation and loss of life, but States like my home State of Rhode \nIsland, which experienced significant damage.\n  There has been a long tradition in the Senate in working together to \nrespond to major disasters in our States. The Appropriations Committee \nhas been an important venue for the kind of bipartisan cooperation that \nhas made these efforts possible. In large part that has been the result \nof the efforts of members like our late-Chairman Dan Inouye who \ncreated, by his example, an environment of comity and respect. That has \nbeen the unique ethos of our committee. Under the leadership of our new \nchairwoman, Senator Mikulski, it will continue.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and \nRelated Agencies, I also want to take a moment to talk about the $1.45 \nbillion included in the bill for environmental recovery and restoration \nneeds.\n  We must fund recovery efforts and rebuild public facilities that were \ndamaged. But we also need to look ahead to projects that will allow our \ncommunities and our public lands to withstand future storms and natural \ndisasters. I am pleased that the Interior section of this bill \naddresses both needs.\n  The bill contains $435 million in essential funding to rebuild \nnational parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, and other public \nfacilities damaged by Hurricane Sandy.\n  I particularly want to call attention to the $348 million included to \nfund immediate construction needs at more than 25 Park Service units \nthat were damaged during the storm. These funds will help the Park \nService take necessary steps to reopen a number of heavily visited \nunits to the public--including the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, \nwhich suffered extensive damage during the storm.\n  We need to get this work started now so that we can get these parks \nreopened. And because the need is so great--the amount requested by the \nPresident is nearly five times the annual line-item construction \nbudget--it's imperative that we give the service the funds in this \nsupplemental as soon as possible.\n  I also want to note that the bill also provides $78 million for \nimmediate reconstruction and recovery needs for the more than 30 \nwildlife refuges that also sustained tremendous damage during the \nstorm.\n  These funds will be used for emergency stabilization needs, to \nreplace or reconstruct facilities, roads, and trails, and to fund \nimprovements needed to lessen anticipated damage from future storms.\n  The bill also provides $810 million for the EPA State Revolving Fund \nprograms, including $700 million for clean water needs and $110 million \nfor drinking water needs, for States that faced the greatest impact \nfrom Hurricane Sandy. These funds will complement funds from other \nFederal agencies and provide targeted funding to upgrade water \ninfrastructure to protect against future flooding, storm damage, and \nother natural disasters.\n  Already, there is a huge estimated need for these funds. In fact, EPA \nestimates that there are approximately 700 drinking water and \nwastewater facilities in States affected by Sandy that need to make \ninfrastructure upgrades that will make them less susceptible to \nflooding and extreme weather events.\n  This is exactly the kind of work that needs to be undertaken so that \nwe can get ahead of the curve and prepare for the next storm or natural \ndisaster. I understand that there are some who believe that some of \nthese investments do not constitute an emergency, but as those who \nlived in the path of storms from Andrew to Katrina to Sandy can attest, \nthere is no time to waste or wait. I hope that this chamber can move \nswiftly to pass this supplemental appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Friday, \nDecember 1, when the Senate resumes consideration of H.R. 1, the \nlegislative vehicle for the Sandy supplemental, the Senate proceed to \nvote in relation to the amendments to the bill under the previous \norder; that all remaining time under the previous order with respect to \nthe amendments be yielded back; that there be 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to each vote, with the exception of the following: 4 minutes \nequally divided prior to each of the votes in relation to the Coburn \namendments; 10 minutes equally divided prior to the votes in relation \nto each of the Paul amendments; 8 minutes equally divided prior to the \nvote in relation to the McCain amendment No. 3355; and 10 minutes \nequally divided prior to the vote in relation to the Lee amendment; and \nthat all other provisions of the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I said December 1--wishful thinking. The order should \nsay Friday, December 28.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the great State of Hawaii has been \nrepresented in the United States Senate by two of the longest serving \nSenators, and they happen to have shared the name Daniel. This year, \nSenator Akaka--with more than 3 decades of service in Congress--now the \nSenior Senator from Hawaii will return to his native State and enjoy \nretirement.\n  Senator Akaka has represented the people of Hawaii in a variety of \nways. Most recently, as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, he \nhas worked tirelessly to support vital programs that provided \neducation, healthcare, housing and other basic services for tribes \nacross the country. Having attended college on the GI bill, he has been \nan advocate for improving education for all students. He also has been \na strong supporter of veterans and a proponent of protections for \nwhistleblowers seeking to expose waste, fraud and abuse in government.\n  On a personal note, I have always appreciated Senator Akaka's strong \nsupport for the National Guard, and in particular the Hawaii Guard. His \nmilitary roots go back to his own distinguished service in World War \nII. But he was one of the earliest and most senior adopters of the \nGuard empowerment legislation when I teamed with Senator Bond, Senator \nGraham, and so many others to enact. Senator Akaka stood with the men \nand women of the National Guard in demanding representation among the \nNation's most senior\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\nmilitary advisory body. This stand was not an easy one to take. He was, \nin fact, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to co-sponsor the Leahy-Graham bill, and his support sent a \npowerful statement that some of our most knowledgeable Senators with \nthe specific responsibility of overseeing our armed services recognized \nthat it was time to give the Guard a stronger voice. Among his many \nother achievements, Senator Akaka will be remembered for his strong \nsupport of and friendship with the Guard.\n  Senator Akaka has brought a calm and insightful presence to his work \nand the people of Hawaii are fortunate to have had such a great \nrepresentative in both the House and the Senate. I wish Senator Akaka \nand his family the best in his retirement from Congress.\n\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  Mr. President, for more than 2 decades, Senator Kent Conrad has \nrepresented the people of North Dakota in the United States Senate.\n  I have had the privilege to serve with several hundred senators since \nI came to the Senate nearly 38 years ago. The list is short for those \nwho are extraordinary both for their talents, and for their personal \nfriendship. Kent Conrad is on that list. In fact, he defines it in many \nways. Senator Conrad has reached across the aisle and demonstrated what \nbipartisanship truly means.\n  Rooted in his days as a tax commissioner in North Dakota, Senator \nConrad has been a leading voice in Congress in difficult and complex \nbudget debates. His floor charts are legendary, explaining complicated \nfiscal matters in terms many others can understand. As Chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and as a senior member of the Finance Committee, he \nhas been a key player in the fiscal debates that have dominated the \ndiscourse in Washington as the country has recovered from the Great \nRecession. He has led bipartisan efforts to reduce the deficit, and \nhelped create the 2007 taskforce with Republican Senator Judd Gregg to \naddress long-term fiscal challenges. Senator Conrad has also been \ndedicated to advancing American interests abroad. I have been fortunate \nto travel with Senator Conrad and his wife overseas, most recently to \nthe Eurozone, where he again brought his expertise in economic, \nbudgetary and fiscal policies to the table as we discussed the \npotential U.S. impacts of the European Union's financial crisis.\n  He has always put North Dakota first, but Senator Conrad has never \nneglected the needs of other parts of the country. He is a champion of \nthe farm bill, and understands the details and nuances of agriculture \ncommodity programs perhaps better than any other member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee. Whether fighting for North Dakota's farmers, or \nfighting for the Nation's fiscal health, he has been a great partner. I \nwas particularly moved by his support for Vermont in the wake of \nTropical Storm Irene.\n  Senator Conrad has been one of the most important voices in the \nUnited States Senate for the past 25 years. He is one of the giants of \nthe Chamber today. We will miss his expertise, but we know our \nfriendships will continue. Both Marcelle and I wish our friends Kent \nand his wife, Lucy, the best.\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Mr. President, a Senator of 24 years, Senator Joe Lieberman this year \nretires from this Chamber. He has represented the people of Connecticut \nfor years, first as a State Senator, and then as the State's Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Senator Lieberman has been a constant voice in national security \nmatters. I worked with him in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, to establish the Department of Homeland Security, \nand since then, he has served as the top Democrat on the Homeland \nSecurity and Government Affairs Committee. He has worked to strengthen \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency in the aftermath of disasters, \nincluding Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  I worked with Senator Lieberman in 2002 on the E-Government Act, a \nkey privacy law that required the government to improve access to \ninformation on the Internet. A chief architect of that bill, it has \nbecome an important transparency law and a valuable tool in protecting \nindividual privacy protections.\n  Senator Lieberman has been a dedicated proponent of examining the \nimpacts of climate change. He has worked to find a compromise to move \nthe Senate forward on meaningful climate change and cap-and-trade \nlegislation. And, despite Connecticut's small dairy industry, Senator \nLieberman has been a true partner in advancing the needs of dairy \nfarmers in Vermont and across the country.\n  Senator Lieberman has earned the respect of both Democrats and \nRepublicans. Like so many other retiring Senators, he has urged the \nSenate to pursue avenues of bipartisanship. The bipartisan legacy he \nleaves is one example we can all follow moving forward. I wish him and \nhis wife, Hadassah, the best in his retirement.\n\n\n                             Jeff Bingaman\n\n  Mr. President, born in Texas and raised in New Mexico, Senator Jeff \nBingaman for nearly 30 years has represented the State he has been \nproud to call home. Lawyer, advocate, environmental stalwart these are \njust a few of the terms that can be used to describe Senator Bingaman.\n  A longtime public servant, Senator Bingaman has served his Nation in \nthe Army Reserves, in his State as an Attorney General, and, since \n1983, has served the people of New Mexico in the United States Senate. \nAlong the way, he has earned a reputation for being fair and bipartisan \nno small feat in today's polarized Congress.\n  Senator Bingaman has been a fierce advocate for the environment, and \nhas worked hard to expand conservation and end tax breaks for big oil \ncompanies. I was proud to work with him on legislation to increase the \nproduction of biofuels and to modernize the Federal Government's \napproach to protecting the environment. As chairman of the Senate's \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, he has worked tirelessly to \nadvance energy independence, an issue so important to many, including \nthose in New Mexico.\n  A supporter of a comprehensive approach to reforming our immigration \nsystem, Senator Bingaman has supported a responsible and thoughtful \napproach to protecting our Nation's borders. Like me, he opposed ill-\nadvised legislation which was regrettably enacted in 2006 to build \nelectronic and other forms of surveillance along every land and \nmaritime border. A Senator of a southern State, Senator Bingaman \nopposed the effort to construct a costly fence along our southern \nborder.\n  Senator Bingaman has been a force here in Washington, but he has \nnever lost sight of the needs of the constituents at home that he \nrepresents. He has worked to secure Federal funds for critical needs in \nNew Mexico, and for education development and transportation \nimprovements.\n  Jeff's moderate temperament has led to many successes both in the \nhalls of Congress, and in his home State. I wish him and his wife Anne \nall the best in retirement.\n\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  Mr. President, the people of Wisconsin have elected and reelected \nSenator Herb Kohl to represent them in the United States Senate four \ntimes. Since coming to the Senate in 1989, I have been honored to serve \nwith him on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where his commitment to \nmatters involving antitrust, juvenile justice, and technology has \nafforded us many opportunities to work together. We have partnered in \nother important areas, too from our states' shared interest in a \nvibrant and supported dairy industry, to important housing assistance.\n  Everyone likes Senator Kohl. He is a consensus builder, and is always \nseeking a bipartisan solution. That approach led to a bipartisan \ninvestigation in the Judiciary Committee over Ruby Ridge. It led to \nenactment of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nReauthorization Act, and economic espionage bills.\n  Senator Kohl has been a constant champion for the nation's dairy \nfarmers from those in Wisconsin to those in Vermont. His Superb Milk \nHouse at the Wisconsin State Fair is a hit every year. A tradition he \nbegan in 1990, it still sells glasses of milk for just 25 cents. I was \ndelighted to hear he intends to keep the Milk House running even after \nhe leaves the Senate. Wisconsin and Vermont dairy farmers have not \nalways agreed on how best to support the industry, but Senator Kohl's \ncommitment has never wavered.\n  As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, Senator Kohl has\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\nkept the needs of some of the most vulnerable around us the elderly \nfront and center during his time in the Senate. His support for the \nHousing Assistance Council, which helps improve housing conditions for \nthe rural poor with an emphasis on the poorest of the poor has been \nsteadfast, and I was pleased to work with him to ensure that in an age \nwithout earmarks, this important council was qualified to compete for \nFederal financial support. He has been a longtime partner in rural \nhousing issues a partnership I will miss.\n  Senator Kohl has worked tirelessly for the people of Wisconsin both \nas a Senator and as a philanthropist. Since 1990, he has provided \nannual grants totaling $400,000 to Wisconsin students, teachers, and \nschools through the Herb Kohl Educational Foundation Achievement Award \nProgram.\n  When Senator Kohl announced his retirement, he stated that he never \nbelieved it was his Senate seat, but that it belonged to the people of \nWisconsin, and that is just who Herb Kohl is. Even in retirement, I \nhave no doubt he will remain dedicated to the people of Wisconsin. \nServing with him for more than two decades has been an honor and a \nprivilege. The Senate will miss him.\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  Mr. President, although he has served just one term in the U.S. \nSenate, retiring Senator Jim Webb is no stranger to public service. A \nhighly decorated combat veteran of Vietnam, Jim Webb's prior public \nservice as an Assistant Secretary of Defense and a former Secretary of \nthe Navy uniquely suited him as a fierce defender of our troops serving \noverseas, and when they come back home.\n  Senator Webb has been a positive force on a number of issues, and \nparticularly through his roles on the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nArmed Services Committee, and the Veterans' Affairs Committee. His \ncommitment to our Nations' veterans and to supporting and strengthening \nour military has been a cornerstone of his Senate career.\n  I worked with Senator Webb on a number of issues in the last 6 years, \nespecially on prison reform and the criminal justice commission. His \ninitiative is something the Senate and our judicial system, should \nfollow and set as a guide.\n  Senator Webb brought a unique perspective to the Senate based on his \nyears of dedicated public service. He has been a powerful advocate for \nmilitary and veterans' issues and criminal justice reform, all while \npromoting Virginia's best interests. I wish him and his family the very \nbest in the future.\n\n\n                               Ben Nelson\n\n  Mr. President, as a Senator from a rural State, supporting our \nNation's farmers is something close to my heart. Senator Ben Nelson \nshares that commitment, and has been a long-time champion of \nlegislation to protect American agriculture and our Nation's farms in a \nrough economy. Senator Nelson's work for rural communities has \nbenefited his home State of Nebraska, but his support of agriculture \nhas helped Vermonters, too. These are among the legislative issues on \nwhich Senator Nelson has had an impact since he came to the Senate in \n2001.\n  As a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \nSenator Nelson has been an active participant as we have tried to move \nthe 2012 Farm Bill through Congress. One of the most pressing pieces of \nlegislation before us today, he has fought tirelessly for Nebraska's \ninterests in that bill, as well as the interests of the Nation's \nagricultural industry as a whole.\n  While he has worked on a number of legislative matters in the last \ndecade, I particularly appreciated Senator Nelson's support for my \neffort to give the National Guard a seat at the table of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff as a former Governor. He understood that this multi-\nyear effort was done to recognize that the men and women of the \nNational Guard serve our country with unmatched loyalty and that they \nand their families make sacrifices every day. He recognized that they \nare indeed deserving of full representation at the highest levels of \nthe Pentagon. In 2010, Senator Ben Nelson was awarded the Harry S. \nTruman Award for his commendable work with the Guard. Since the \nNational Guard has taken on an increased role in overseas conflicts, \nSenators like Ben Nelson have stepped up to give them the recognition \nand support they deserve.\n  I commend Ben's loyalty to Nebraska and to economic sustainability \nacross the country. His dedication to sustainable energy is rare in our \nmodern political climate. Rather than folding to the issues that divide \nus and ignoring the future of our farms and environment, Senator Nelson \nhas taken a strong stance on controversial and difficult issues and has \nmanaged to open the minds of many of his colleagues with time, bringing \npeople together around the possibility of creating positive change. \nThrough it all, he has kept the needs of his State in mind, even as he \nhas worked to create a brighter future for the entire country.\n  Senator Nelson is an honest man, a level-headed public servant, and a \nfriend to many. True to his roots, he has built a legacy in the Senate \nthat will last after he has moved on from the halls of the Capitol. I \nwish him the best in his retirement from Congress.\n\n\n                                Jon Kyl\n\n  Mr. President, there are many times when those of us in the Senate \ndisagree. It is when we can find ways to work together, across party \nlines, to advance meaningful legislation that we can really make a \ndifference. One of the things I have always appreciated about Senator \nJon Kyl is his commitment to his word. This year will mark his last in \nthe U.S. Senate. I have welcomed his partnership on many issues, from \ncyber legislation to matters protecting crime victims. He was a key \nally in our efforts to make the first meaningful reforms to the \nNation's patent system in nearly 60 years. And we have worked together \non issues relating to National security and border security.\n  Fewer Senators are more hard working than Jon Kyl. He is a constant \npresence in the Judiciary Committee, where he has served as the top \nRepublican on the Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee. He is active in the \nFinance Committee. And of course, he holds a key position within his \ncaucus, serving as the Republican Whip.\n  I have, of course, most closely worked with Senator Kyl in his nearly \n2 decades of service on the Judiciary Committee. There, he has \nchampioned a number of important issues, from crime victims' rights to \nantiterrorism legislation. We have been close partners on intellectual \nproperty legislation, from patent reform to copyright and trademark \nprotections. And, even in the most contentious of national security \nissues, we have worked to find common ground on such issues as the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  On Capitol Hill, Senator Kyl is known throughout the Senate for his \ndedication and work ethic. He is a great ally and a formidable \nadversary; in Congress, there is often no higher praise. He is a good \npersonal friend and, I wish him and his family all the best as he takes \non his next challenge.\n\n\n                             Richard Lugar\n\n  Mr. President, I have served with hundreds of Senators in my nearly \n38 years representing Vermont in Washington. Few embody the \nstatesmanship that you find in Senator Richard Lugar. For more than 36 \nyears, Senator Lugar has represented the State of Indiana in the United \nStates Senate--the longest-serving Republican Senator here today. It \nhas been an honor, a privilege and a joy to work with him to advance so \nmany important legislative issues.\n  Senator Lugar exemplifies the ideal of bipartisanship that is too \noften lacking today in Washington. Although we come from different \npolitical views, Senator Lugar and I worked shoulder-to-shoulder to \nreach across the aisle to find compromise and common ground on two Farm \nBills--the Leahy-Lugar bill, and the Lugar-Leahy bill. That \ncollaborative effort, which led to reforms at the Department of \nAgriculture resulting in the savings of billions of dollars, is an \nexample of how well the Senate can function when bipartisanship is the \norder of business. Whether he chaired the Agriculture Committee, or I \ndid, we always found a way to work together.\n  Perhaps Senator Lugar is most well-known for yet another bipartisan \neffort, the 1991 Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction. Nunn-Lugar \nwas enacted to protect Americans from the threat of nuclear weapons in \nthe\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\nformer Soviet Union. Ever since it became law, Senator Lugar has \ncontinued his efforts to reduce the threat of nuclear annihilation. In \n2007, after a trip to Russia, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine, Senator Lugar \nand then-Senator Barack Obama crafted the Lugar-Obama Proliferation and \nThreat Reduction Initiative to decrease the number of hidden \ntraditional weapons around the world. Senator Lugar's ability to build \nstrong relationships with party opposites such as President Obama \nresulted in legislation that benefits citizens of Indiana, but also the \nentire Nation.\n  As a leading member and former Chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Lugar has championed human rights around \nthe world. Most recently he advocated aggressively for ratification of \nthe bipartisan Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. A \nrecognized leader in international affairs, Senator Lugar has supported \ncauses eradicating hunger, to combatting terrorism wherever it occurs. \nHe has promoted sound, reasonable immigration reforms to encourage the \nbest and brightest to come to America. And he has warned of the \ncatastrophic risks of climate change.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Lugar and I reached a pair of milestones \ntogether. I was honored to cast my 14,000th vote in the United States \nSenate. I was delighted that Senator Lugar, on the same vote, reached \nthe 13,000 marker. Ours has been a partnership of more than three \ndecades, and to share this milestone with Senator Lugar was a memory I \nwill cherish.\n  A couple of years ago, Dick and I found ourselves sitting down \ntogether in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing room, speaking with \na reporter about the importance of bipartisanship in Congress. We both \nrecalled with fondness our earliest days in the Senate, sitting on the \nfarthest ends of the dais, and struggling to hear what the most senior \nmembers of the panel were saying. We suspected--no doubt correctly--\nthat this was not happening by accident. From those days sitting \ntogether was born a friendship that has spanned three decades. In his \nfarewell in this Chamber, Senator Lugar cautioned that many in Congress \n``have not lived up to the expectations of our constituents to make \nexcellence in governance our top priority.'' Every day in this Chamber, \nDick Lugar made excellence his top priority. He is a pillar of the \nSenate, a mentor to many, and a role model to those to come. And I will \nmiss my friend.\n\n\n                             Olympia Snowe\n\n  Mr. President, in today's U.S. Senate, moderates are few. At the end \nof this Congress, we will lose another: Senator Olympia Snowe, who has \nserved the State of Maine in the U.S. Senate for nearly 2 decades. She \nhas spent nearly her entire adult life in public service, and the \npeople of Maine have revered her dedication to her home State and to \ncivic engagement.\n  Just the 23rd woman to serve in the United States Senate, Senator \nSnowe has risen through the ranks in her tenure in this body, most \nrecently serving as the top Republican on the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee. There she has focused on promoting women in \nsmall business. She was instrumental in establishing Women's Business \nCenters through the Small Business Administration, a network of nearly \n100 centers designed to level the playing field for women looking to \nstart a small business. Most recently, she has worked to advance \nlegislation to establish a task force specifically devoted to women \nentrepreneurs.\n  Senator Snowe has been a great friend to the environment as well. She \nhas worked closely with me to protect our national forests and \nenvironment. She has partnered with me to strengthen the Forest Legacy \nProgram--important to both Vermont and Maine--as well as the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. She has been a stalwart advocate for the \nCommunity Development Block Grant program, and for years, she and I \nteamed together to protect this important community development \nprogram. Senator Snowe has been a strong supporter of the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. The shared challenges of our \nStates--rural, New England States have given us many reasons to work \ntogether, and our partnership in these issues is one that I will miss.\n  Notably, Senator Snowe, at a time when so many simply tow the party \nline, never feared voting her conscience over her political \naffiliation. Her support for the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct, which spurred development amid the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression, was instrumental in funneling necessary resources to \nthe States. She supported advancing comprehensive health care reform \nlegislation to the Senate floor, so the Senate as a whole could debate \nthe issue. And she has stood up for women in important health care \nchoices.\n  When Senator Snowe announced earlier this year that she intended to \nretire, she lamented the partisan shift she has seen in Congress. \nDuring her long career in public service, Senator Snowe put her State \nand the Nation first. It's a lesson we can all follow. I wish Olympia \nthe best in her retirement and I will truly miss serving with her. Her \nfarewell speech to the Senate should be required reading in every High \nSchool and college--civics and government classes.\n\n\n                          Kay Bailey Hutchison\n\n  Mr. President, when the 112th Congress adjourns, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison will retire, having been the 22nd woman to serve in the \nUnited States Senate. With nearly 20 years of service to this Chamber, \nSenator Hutchison has been a pioneer in her home State of Texas. The \nfirst woman elected to the U.S. Senate from that State, her record of \npublic service began long before she came to Washington.\n  Senator Hutchison's dedication to her constituents, and to the \nadvancement of the Nation, has been easy to see. When she helped to \nestablish the Academy of Medicine, Engineering, and Science of Texas, \nTAMEST in 2004, she put a spotlight on the importance of encouraging \nadvancements in science and of supporting research and development. She \nhas understood that protecting our Nation's ability to innovate is as \nvital to our economic security as anything else.\n  I am proud to have worked with Senator Hutchison on a variety of \npieces of legislation over the years, having served with her on several \nsubcommittees of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Among our \ngreatest achievements, I believe was our partnership on federal AMBER \nAlert legislation, which won unanimous support in the Senate and which \nwas enacted in 2003. The AMBER Alert Act was a signature achievement, \nand an example of what can be done when partisanship is cast aside, and \nwe work together.\n  Senator Hutchison has worked tirelessly to advocate for her State and \nfor the good of the Nation. I wish her and her family all the best.\n\n\n                              Scott Brown\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Scott Brown came to the Senate in an \nuntraditional manner: winning a special election to fill the seat left \nby one of the giants of the Senate, Ted Kennedy. While his tenure has \nbeen just 3 years, I have appreciated Senator Brown's willingness to \nwork across the aisle on two very important issues: reauthorizing the \nViolence Against Women Act, and working to end human trafficking.\n  It happens that I have authored legislation to address these two very \nissues, and so it has been through the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act and the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act that I have seen Senator Brown take a dedicated \napproach to protecting victims of violence. He is a cosponsor of both \nthese bills, a strong supporter of the goals behind them, and a vocal \nproponent of their enactment.\n  Senator Brown has also been a friend of National Guard. Himself a \nGuardsman for over 30 years, he was one 68 cosponsors of my Guard \nEmpowerment Act, to give the head of the National Guard a seat with the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, where decisions are made every day about our \nNation's military, including the National Guard and Reserve. As a \nGuardsman himself, he understands the strains placed on families here \nat home when the Guard, like any unit of the military, is deployed, as \nhas happened so many times in the last decade. I appreciated Senator \nBrown's support on this important law.\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\n  Senator Brown has charted his own path in his short time here in the \nSenate, and I expect the ventures he undertook while serving here will \ncontinue. I wish him and his family the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/27/senate-section/article/S8449-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THANKING LUTHERAN CHURCH CHARITIES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this past week we have all watched, grief-\nstricken, the terrible school shooting in Newtown, CT, and the heart-\nbreaking funerals of those beautiful little children. There are no \nwords to adequately express our sorrow for those touched by this \ntragedy. But there is an organization that is helping to bring comfort \nand healing to Newtown in a way that requires no words.\n  One day after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, a group \nof golden retrievers from the Chicago area made a cross-country journey \nto provide solace to the Newtown community. The Lutheran Church \nCharities sent five of their ``comfort dogs'' to help console grieving \nfamily members and others touched by the Sandy Hook Elementary School \nshooting. Accompanying these special dogs are handlers who are trained \nto speak or pray with mourners or simply to sit quietly with them.\n  In all, nine comfort dogs from Lutheran Church Charities have helped \nto comfort Newtown residents. Some of these remarkable dogs attended \nPresident Obama's speech at an interfaith gathering at Newtown High \nSchool, another comforted mourners at Newtown's Christ the King \nLutheran Church, the location of funerals for two of the slain \nchildren. The dogs even made an appearance on CNN with host Don Lemon.\n  This is how Tim Hetzner, president of Lutheran Church Charities, \nexplained the dogs' healing powers: ``Dogs are nonjudgmental,'' he \nsays, ``They are loving. They are accepting of anyone. It creates the \natmosphere for people to share.''\n  That is exactly what they have done in Newtown.\n  A woman visiting a Newtown memorial told one reporter: ``It's a very \nsolemn time. With the dogs here, it seems like it's a little ray of \nsunshine.''\n  A child from Newtown said simply that the dogs ``help you get over \nhow sad it is.''\n  Sadly, the comfort dog program began after another gun tragedy. In \n2008, after a gunman killed five students at Northern Illinois \nUniversity, a group of dog caretakers associated with Lutheran Church \nCharities visited the NIU campus in hopes of offering a healing \ndistraction to students. The trip was so successful that a few weeks \nlater students petitioned university leaders to bring the comfort dogs \nback.\n  The initiative has since grown from a handful of dogs in the Chicago \narea to 60 dogs in 6 states. Comfort dogs have traveled across the \nNation to console people in the aftermath of major tragedies such as \nHurricane Sandy and the tornado that hit Joplin, MO.\n  When the K-9 comfort dogs are not responding to a tragedy, they visit \npeople in hospitals, nursing homes, and parks. Each dog has a Facebook \npage, Twitter account, and email so those who meet the dogs can keep in \ntouch.\n  The unconditional love of comfort dogs has helped countless children \nand adults to cope with tragedy and begin to heal from their suffering. \nOn behalf of a heartbroken but grateful Nation, I want to express my \nheartfelt thanks to all of the comfort dogs of Lutheran Church \nCharities especially Abbi, Barnabas, Chewie, Chloe, Hannah, Luther, \nPrince, Ruthie, and Shami--and to their handlers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/27/senate-section/article/S8449-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CHRIS COWART\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a staff member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee who will be retiring at the end of \nthis session of Congress. Her name is Christine Cowart, and for the \npast 6 years, she has served as the Chief Clerk of the Committee. She \nhad previously served a term of 8 years as Chief Clerk under Senator \nSam Nunn.\n  I know that 14 years sounds like a lot of time to most people, but \nthat barely scratches the surface of Chris' service to the Senate. In \nfact, Chris holds a special place in the record books. In an \norganization like the Senate, known for some long-serving members, \nChris would fall within the top ten list of longevity for senators, and \nno member currently serving has been here in the Senate longer than \nChris.\n  The mere fact that she will be completing almost 41 years of service \nto the Senate is truly a remarkable accomplishment, especially in \ntoday's world where changing jobs has become the norm. And if that were \nall of her record, that would be amazing. But that is only part of the \nstory. Chris made invaluable contributions to getting each of 41 of the \n51 total National Defense Authorization Acts we have done annually \nsince 1961. As Chief Clerk, it was her duty to shepherd the Armed \nServices Committee's annual set of hearings, meetings, and briefings \nthat lead up to the DOD Authorization Act each year. Her duties also \nincluded showing the ropes to new senators and new staffers alike.\n  Chris took to heart the ideals of service she dedicated almost all of \nher adult life to service to her country and to the Senate. I remember \nChris recounting how her father had escorted her here to the Russell \nSenate Office Building for her first interview with the Committee in \nthe summer of 1972, shortly after she graduated from college. She said \nshe didn't have any difficulty in deciding what to do after her father \ntold her, ``Take the job.''\n  Chris' father was a career Navy man, having flown maritime patrol \naircraft for the Navy during World War II and thereafter. He instilled \nin Chris the value of patriotism and service to country that she so \nexemplifies in her life.\n  During her service to the Committee, she served as mentor, confidant \nand advisor to the staff as they experienced weddings, divorces, births \nand deaths.\n  Chris has been a rock for the Committee, and I know I speak for all \nof the members and staff when I say, ``Chris, thank you for your \nservice to the Armed Services Committee, to the Senate and to the \ncountry. You have set a standard of dedication and professionalism for \nall of us, and we will miss you!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/27/senate-section/article/S8449-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8449-S8451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss our Nation's \nneed to adopt a balanced budget amendment and to bring the Senate's \nattention to the Alabama Legislature's recent call for Congress to send \nsuch an amendment to the States for ratification. This is a thoughtful \nand well-reasoned resolution. Many other States have made similar \nresolutions. Our Nation is on the precipice of the most predictable \nfiscal disaster in our history and Congress has failed to act to remove \nthe danger. U.S. gross Federal debt is now over $16.3 trillion; U.S. \ndebt per person is over $53,000, higher than that of Greece; and for \nthe fourth straight year, our Nation's deficit will exceed $1 trillion. \nThe Federal Government cannot continue spending more than it takes in, \nand the people of Alabama clearly know that.\n  The American people understand the necessity of living within one's \nmeans and balancing budgets. We see that as American families across \nthe Nation are working to pay off their debt. In fact, American \nfamilies have improved their balance sheets by reducing their \noutstanding credit card debt by 17 percent since 2008, over $150 \nbillion. The people expect no less of their State governments. Forty-\nthree of the 50 States, including my home State of Alabama, have \nbalanced budget requirements.\n  Unfortunately, as States and families across the Nation cut spending \nand balance budgets, the Federal Government continues to spend more and \nhas increased its debt by more than $4 trillion since 2008. This \nspending course will at some point wreck our economy, just as it has \nwrecked that of Greece, Spain, and Italy. Now, more than ever, it is \ncrucial that Congress adopt a balanced budget amendment and send it to \nthe States for ratification. The surging debt crisis we face is so \nsignificant that we must have a balanced budget constitutional \namendment. It has come close to passing before. When Senators and \nCongressmen have no alternative but to live within their means, like so \nmany of our States, they will figure out a way to do it. But if \nCongress is not required by the Constitution to\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\nbudget responsibly, then history has shown that Congress will not act \nresponsibly.\n  The people of Alabama understand these issues and the importance of \nbalancing the budget. That is why the Alabama State Legislature has \npassed a resolution urging Congress to send a balanced budget amendment \nto the States for ratification. The people of Alabama are well aware of \nthe dangers we face. Introduced by Senator Arthur Orr of Decatur, AL, \nwith several of his colleagues in the legislature, this resolution \nacknowledges that ``the budget deficits of the United States of America \nare unsustainable and constitute substantial threat to the United \nStates government.'' The resolution calls for Congress to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment, and if the Congress fails to do so, then for \nCongress to call a constitutional convention to propose such an \namendment. I applaud Senator Orr and his colleagues, Senators Scofield, \nSanford, Holtzclaw, Williams, McGill, and Beason, for bringing \nattention to this issue and introducing this resolution. We will only \nsee more grassroots movements like this to pass a balanced budget \namendment if Washington continues to fail to meet the challenges of our \ntime.\n  It is not just my constituents in Alabama who are upset. Recent \npolling has shown that this Congress has one of the lowest approval \nratings in history. The American people are becoming disillusioned and \nlosing faith in their elected government as we fail to address the \ncrises of our day. Indeed, we are not even working openly to deal with \nthis great challenge. It is sad that Congress cannot even perform its \nbasic business, as seen in the failure of the Senate to pass one \nregular appropriations bill this year or a budget in nearly 4 years.\n  The Senate is supposed to be the world's great deliberative body. \nUnfortunately, the leader of this body and his majority party will not \neven propose a budget to the American people. When I came to the Senate \nin 1997, I voted for a balanced budget amendment that fell one vote \nshort of the 67 it required for adoption. How much better off would we \nhave been today, how much less debt would we have placed on our \nchildren and grandchildren had that amendment been passed? Last year, \nRepublicans put forward a plan to cut, cap, and balance our Nation's \nbudget which would have solved all our fiscal problems. But the \nDemocrat majority would not let it pass.\n  I applaud the members of the Alabama legislature for adopting and \nGovernor Robert Bentley for signing this resolution. House Speaker Mike \nHubbard and Senate Pro Tempore Del Marsh and their members have spoken \nclearly. This resolution exhibits leadership and wisdom not found here \nin Washington, DC. It is time we listen to the States and to our \nconstituents and adopt a balanced budget amendment to the United States \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis resolution adopted by the Alabama Legislature and signed by \nGovernor Robert Bentley urging the United States Congress to submit a \nbalanced budget amendment to the States or to call a convention to \npropose such an amendment to the United States Constitution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Whereas, the reluctance of the federal government to incur \n     debt and other obligations was established early in American \n     history, with deficits occurring only in relation to \n     extraordinary circumstances such as war; yet for much of the \n     20th century and into the 21st, the United States has \n     operated on a budget deficit, including the 2010 budget year, \n     which surpassed an astounding $1,300,000,000,000, an annual \n     deficit that exceeded the entire gross state product of many \n     of the states; and\n       Whereas, an exception to this pattern was at the turn of \n     the 21st century; in FY 2001, America enjoyed a $128 billion \n     budget surplus; and\n       Whereas, since FY 2001, America has been burdened with 10 \n     consecutive years of deficits, to-wit:\n       FY 2002: $158 billion deficit\n       FY 2003: $377 billion deficit\n       FY 2004: $413 billion deficit\n       FY 2005: $318 billion deficit\n       FY 2006: $248 billion deficit\n       FY 2007: $161 billion deficit\n       FY 2008: $459 billion deficit\n       FY 2009: $1.4 trillion deficit\n       FY 2010: $1.3 trillion deficit\n       FY 2011: $1.5 trillion deficit (estimated); and\n       Whereas, as of January 2011, America's accumulated national \n     debt exceeded $12 trillion now estimated at over $13 \n     trillion: and\n       Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office projects that, if \n     current trends continue under the White House's proposed \n     budget, each of the next 10 years has a projected deficit \n     exceeding $600 billion and\n       Whereas, the budget deficits of the United States of \n     America are unsustainable and constitute a substantial threat \n     to the solvency of the federal government as evidenced by the \n     comments of Standard and Poor's on April 18, 2011, regarding \n     the longer term credit outlook for the United States; and\n       Whereas, Congress has been unwilling or unable to address \n     the persistent problem of overspending and has recently \n     increased the statutory limit on the public debt and enacted \n     a variety of legislation that will ultimately cause the \n     federal government to incur additional debt; and\n       Whereas, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility \n     and Reform in its report The Moment of Truth includes \n     recommendations to reduce the Federal deficit that have not \n     been considered by the United States Congress; and\n       Whereas, the consequences of current spending policies are \n     far-reaching; United States indebtedness to governments of \n     foreign nations continues to rise; costly federal programs \n     that are essentially unfunded or underfunded; mandates to \n     states threaten the ability of state and local governments to \n     continue to balance their budgets; moreover, future \n     generations of Americans inevitably face increased taxation \n     and a weakened economy as a direct result of the bloated \n     debt; and\n       Whereas, many states have previously requested that \n     Congress propose a constitutional amendment requiring a \n     balanced budget, but Congress has proven to be unresponsive; \n     anticipating situations in which Congress at times could fail \n     to act, the drafters of the United States Constitution had \n     the foresight to adopt the language in Article V that \n     establishes that on application of the Legislatures of two-\n     thirds of the several states, Congress shall call a \n     convention for proposing amendments; and\n       Whereas, in prior years the Alabama Legislature has called \n     on Congress to pass a Balanced Budget Constitutional \n     Amendment, many other states have done the same, all to no \n     avail; and\n       Whereas, a balanced budget amendment would require the \n     government not to spend more than it receives in revenue and \n     compel lawmakers to carefully consider choices about spending \n     and taxes; by encouraging spending control and discouraging \n     deficit spending, a balanced budget amendment will help put \n     the nation on the path to lasting prosperity; Now therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of Alabama, both Houses thereof \n     concurring, That the Legislature of the State of Alabama \n     hereby respectfully urges the Congress of the United States \n     to propose and submit to the states for ratification a \n     federal balanced budget amendment to the United States \n     Constitution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That, in the event that Congress does not submit \n     a balanced budget amendment to the states for ratification on \n     or before December 31, 2011, the Alabama Legislature hereby \n     makes application to the United States Congress to call a \n     convention under Article V of the United States Constitution \n     for the specific and exclusive purpose of proposing an \n     amendment to that Constitution requiring that, in the absence \n     of a national emergency (as determined by the positive vote \n     of such members of each house of Congress as the amendment \n     shall require), the total of all federal appropriations made \n     by Congress for any fiscal year not exceed the total of all \n     federal revenue for that fiscal year; and be it further\n       Resolved, That, unless rescinded by a succeeding \n     Legislature, this application by the Alabama Legislature \n     constitutes a continuing application in accordance with \n     Article V of the United States Constitution until at least \n     two-thirds of the Legislatures of the several states have \n     made application for a convention to provide for a balanced \n     budget; and be it further\n       Resolved, That, in the event that Congress does not submit \n     a balanced budget amendment to the states for ratification on \n     or before December 31, 2011, the Alabama Legislature hereby \n     requests that the legislatures of each of the several states \n     that compose the United States apply to Congress requesting \n     Congress to call a convention to propose such an amendment to \n     the United States Constitution; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this application is rescinded in the event \n     that a convention to propose amendments to the United States \n     Constitution includes purposes other than providing for a \n     balanced federal budget; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the copies of this resolution be provided to \n     the following officials:\n       1. The President of the United States.\n       2. The Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives.\n       3. The President of the United States Senate.\n       4. All members of the Alabama Delegation to Congress with \n     the request that this resolution be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as an application to the Congress of the \n     united States of America for a convention to propose an \n     amendment to provide for a federal balanced budget in the\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\n     event that Congress does not submit such an amendment to the \n     states for ratification on or before December 31, 2011; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be provided to the \n     Secretaries of State and to the presiding officers of the \n     Legislatures of the other states.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/27/senate-section/article/S8451-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        IN MEMORY OF LOST LIVES\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

DISCLOSURE OF DECISIONS, ORDERS, AND OPINIONS OF THE \n                   FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Secret law is inconsistent with democratic governance. \n     In order for the rule of law to prevail, the requirements of \n     the law must be publicly discoverable.\n       (2) The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh \n     Circuit stated in 1998 that the ``idea of secret laws is \n     repugnant''.\n       (3) The open publication of laws and directives is a \n     defining characteristic of government of the United States. \n     The first Congress of the United States mandated that every \n     ``law, order, resolution, and vote [shall] be published in at \n     least three of the public newspapers printed within the \n     United States''.\n       (4) The practice of withholding decisions of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court is at odds with the United \n     States tradition of open publication of law.\n       (5) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \n     acknowledges that such Court has issued legally significant \n     interpretations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \n     of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) that are not accessible to \n     the public.\n       (6) The exercise of surveillance authorities under the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 \n     et seq.), as interpreted by secret court opinions, \n     potentially implicates the communications of United States \n     persons who are necessarily unaware of such surveillance.\n       (7) Section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861), as amended by section 215 of \n     the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107-56; 115 Stat. 287), \n     authorizes the Federal Bureau of Investigation to require the \n     production of ``any tangible things'' and the extent of such \n     authority, as interpreted by secret court opinions, has been \n     concealed from the knowledge and awareness of the people of \n     the United States.\n       (8) In 2010, the Department of Justice and the Office of \n     the Director of National Intelligence established a process \n     to review and declassify opinions of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court, but more than two years later no \n     declassifications have been made.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     each decision, order, or opinion issued by the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Court of Review that includes significant \n     construction or interpretation of section 501 or section 702 \n     of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 \n     U.S.C. 1861 and 1881a) should be declassified in a manner \n     consistent with the protection of national security, \n     intelligence sources and methods, and other properly \n     classified and sensitive information.\n       (c) Requirement for Disclosures.--\n       (1) Section 501.--\n       (A) In general.--Section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i) Disclosure of Decisions.--\n       ``(1) Decision defined.--In this subsection, the term \n     `decision' means any decision, order, or opinion issued by \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review that includes \n     significant construction or interpretation of this section.\n       ``(2) Requirement for disclosure.--Subject to paragraphs \n     (3) and (4), the Attorney General shall declassify and make \n     available to the public--\n       ``(A) each decision that is required to be submitted to \n     committees of Congress under section 601(c), not later than \n     45 days after such opinion is issued;
