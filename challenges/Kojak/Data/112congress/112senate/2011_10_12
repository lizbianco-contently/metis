Madam President, Republican obstructionism was once again \nin evidence last night, and it has cost this Nation millions of jobs.\n  Last night, Republicans blocked the American Jobs Act, President \nObama's plan to create 2 million jobs by giving tax cuts to businesses \nand middle-class families and investing in modern roads, bridges, and \nschools.\n  It is not the first jobs bill they have blocked this Congress, \nalthough I hope it will be the last. But it seems as if the Republicans \ndo not really want to put Americans back to work. They believe a weak \neconomy means a weak President. So even though they have supported each \npiece of the American Jobs Act in the past, they blocked this job-\ncreating legislation in the hopes of doing political damage to the \nPresident.\n  But we have not given up on creating jobs in America, and we will not \nlet Republican political games stand between Congress's most important \nduty: to put 14 million Americans back to work.\n  Passing the American Jobs Act would have been a step in the right \ndirection. Economists of every stripe agree it would have impacted the \neconomy immediately and put up to 2 million people back to work.\n  Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's and economic adviser to \nSenator John McCain's Presidential campaign said this:\n\n       Given the high odds of another recession in the next few \n     months, it is vital for Congress and the administration to \n     provide some near-term support to the economy.\n\n  Zandi says the American Jobs Act could shave a percentage point off \nthe unemployment rate. Conversely, he warned that without immediate \naction\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\nthe likelihood is high of a double-dip recession. So the last thing we \nshould be doing right now is wasting time, but that is what Republicans \nare forcing us to do.\n  Last night, a majority of the Senate voted to take up this bill. But \nRepublicans will not put politics aside for a moment, even when the \nprice of their stubbornness is struggling families and failing \nbusinesses.\n  I say it again: Democrats are not going to give up on creating jobs. \nWe will introduce the American Jobs Act piece by piece.\n  I had two conversations last night while the vote was taking place \nwith Republicans, and both Republican Senators said they would like to \njoin in moving some pieces of this legislation. So we are going to do \nthat, and I am glad to see there is some interest by my Republican \ncolleagues in doing that.\n  Many of the ideas we will advance will be proposals Republicans have \nsupported in the past, as I have already indicated. I think they will \nhave to explain to the American people--at a time of record \nunemployment--why they continue to oppose job-creating tax cuts for \nsmall businesses and the middle class and other proposals they have \nsupported in the past. So, as I said a minute ago, I look forward to \nworking with my Republican colleagues in moving forward parts of this \nbill they like. At the end of the day, if they do not do this, their \nmotive will be crystal clear: politics.\n  So I hope Republicans will be able to see past partisan posturing to \nsupport their own past proposals when we consider them individually in \nthe next few weeks.\n  Take, for example, the payroll tax cut. My friend, the Republican \nleader, has supported payroll tax cuts in the past. Most Republicans \nhave. This is what my friend, the Republican leader, said about the \nsame tax cut in 2009. I quote:\n\n       It would put a lot of money back in the hands of businesses \n     and in the hands of individuals. . . . Republicans, generally \n     speaking, from Maine to Mississippi, like tax relief.\n\n  So that is part of the American Jobs Act.\n  Another Republican Senator sponsored a bill to give tax credits to \nbusinesses that hire out-of-work veterans. Yet that same Republican \nSenator voted against the same proposal last night. It was part of the \nbill last night.\n  Republicans have supported these proposals in the past. They should \nhave supported them yesterday. But Democrats care so much about \ncreating jobs that we will give our Republican colleagues another \nopportunity to do the right thing, and we will move forward in the best \nway we can to put these matters before the American people, if \nnecessary, piece by piece.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6398-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have worked hard to be in the posture \nwe are in today to have votes on these trade bills. My friend, the \nRepublican leader, has heard me say this too much, but I do not favor \nthese bills. But a majority of this Senate does, and I believed it was \nimportant we move these forward. I have worked with the Republican \nleader to do it today. I think it is important to do it today. We have \nthe President of Korea here in America.

Madam President, before my friend, the majority \nleader, leaves the floor, let me remind him and our Senate colleagues \nand the American people that Republicans were prepared to vote on the \nPresident's second version of the stimulus bill last night. In fact, I \noffered a unanimous consent that we have that vote--not the motion to \nproceed to it but the actual vote. I am not going to renew that request \nat the moment but just would say to my friend, we are happy to have \nthat vote. We were happy to have it last night.\n  With regard to the pieces of it, my friend is correct; some of the \npieces of this second stimulus might well be appropriate. I have \nrecommended to the joint select committee--that he and I appointed 50 \npercent of--that they take a look at some of the pieces of it which \ncould well be included in a product we are going to get before \nThanksgiving before the Senate and the House.\n  So, again, we would be happy to vote on the entire package. We were \nhappy to do it last night and also happy to look at pieces of it. We do \nhave, as the majority leader and I have discussed before, important \nwork to do in the Senate. We have the trade agreements we are going to \napprove tonight. We have three appropriations bills we are going to go \nto after that--the basic work of government, which we have not done in \nthe last few years, the American people would like to see us do. We \nalso have a joint select committee set up that could look at parts of \nthe proposal to which the majority leader is referring. So I have some \noptimism that we will be able to come together on pieces of it that we \nthink make sense.\n  I will say that as far as I know, there is not a single Republican \nwho thinks it is a good idea to raise taxes on over 300,000 business \nowners, which is what would happen under the so-called millionaires' \nsurtax. So there are parts of it we very much disagree with. We have \ndivided government. Neither party controls the entire government. We \nwill only be able to pass those things we do agree on. I think there \nare parts of the package my friend refers to that could well be agreed \nto at some point this year on a bipartisan basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6398-4", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6398-S6399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FREE-TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, later today the Senate will show that \nDemocrats and Republicans can, in fact, work together to make it easier \nfor American businesses to create jobs.\n  By passing free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South \nKorea, we will help the economy, and we will put the lie to the \nridiculous Obama campaign claim that Republicans are somehow rooting \nagainst the economy. Nothing could be more ridiculous and absurd as to \nsuggest that Republicans are somehow rooting against our economy.\n  In fact, if President Obama were willing to work with us on a more \nbipartisan piece of legislation, nobody would even be talking about a \ndysfunctional Congress. There would not be any reason to.\n  But, as we all know, that does not fit in with the President's \nelection strategy. The White House has made it clear that the President \nis praying for gridlock--he is actually hoping for gridlock--so he has \nsomebody besides himself to point the finger at next November.\n  That is a big mistake. The American people will not tolerate their \nown President putting politics ahead of working with Congress on the \nkind of bipartisan legislation that we know both parties could agree on \nright now.\n  So this morning I would like to repeat my call to the President to \nput the political playbook aside and work with us instead on the kind \nof bipartisan, job-creating legislation the American people truly want.\n  The trade bills we will be voting on tonight are a good start. There \nis no reason we should have had to wait nearly 3 years for this \nPresident to send them to Congress for a vote, but they are a good \nstart nonetheless--3 years late but still very important to do.\n  Now let's move on to some other things. We have pointed to areas such \nas regulatory reform, tax reform, and energy exploration where the \nparties could help create jobs without raising taxes or adding to the \ndeficit.\n  It is just the kind of bipartisan cooperation that the American \npeople are actually demanding from us, and what I am saying this \nmorning is that Republicans are eager and willing to join Democrats in \nmaking that happen.\n  The Presidential election, for goodness' sake, is 13 months away; 13 \nmonths from now is the Presidential election. There is plenty of time \nto campaign. Why don't we put that off for a while and do what we were \nsent here to do?\n  But right now we have an opportunity to work together. Let's put \naside the political playbook and focus\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\non results. I know that does not come easy for some around here. The \nsenior Senator from New York, for example, made it pretty clear \nyesterday that he is more interested in drawing a contrast with \nRepublicans than he is in actually passing bipartisan legislation that \nwe know will spur job growth. But I do not believe the 14 million \nAmericans looking for work right now care more about contrast than \nabout jobs. The jobs crisis we are in calls for lawmakers to rise above \nthese games.\n  Americans expect us to do something to help create jobs. That is what \nwe should be doing. That is why Republicans will continue to seek to \nfind Democrats who are more interested in jobs than in political \nposturing and work with them on bipartisan legislation such as the \ntrade bills we will vote on tonight.\n  What we will not do, though, is vote in favor of any more misguided \nstimulus bills because some bill writer slapped the word ``jobs'' on \nthe cover page. The stimulus bill with the word ``jobs'' slapped on the \ncover page and wrapped around a talking-point tax hike is not our idea \nof what is good for America. We refuse to raise taxes on the very \npeople Americans are depending on to create jobs. We need to be looking \nfor ways to make it easier to create jobs, not harder.\n  For nearly 3 years, Republicans have told Democrats again and again \nthat we are willing and eager to work with the Democrats anywhere, \nanytime, on real job-promoting legislation on which both sides could \nagree.\n  I have been calling on the President to approve these three free-\ntrade agreements since the day he took the oath of office. All the \nPresident had to do was to follow through on these agreements and send \nthem up to Congress, and we would have had an early bipartisan \nachievement that did not add a single dime to the deficit, that would \nhave convinced people the two sides could work together, and that by \nthe President's own assessment created tens of thousands of jobs right \nhere at home. But he did not. The President chose to push a highly \npartisan stimulus bill instead that the administration said would keep \nunemployment below 8 percent. We all know how that turned out. Nearly 3 \nyears later, the only thing left is the nearly $1 trillion it added to \nthe debt and the government programs it created. As for jobs, well, \nunemployment has been above 8 percent for 32 months straight, and \naccording to the Labor Department, there are now 1.5 million fewer jobs \nthan there were then.\n  It is time to try something different. Republicans have proposed a \nnumber of ideas that would not only represent a change in direction but \nwould also attract broad bipartisan support. There is no good reason \nwhatsoever for the President and Democrats in Congress to prevent us \nfrom doing these things. As I see it, the President actually has a \nchoice: He can spend the next 13 months trying to get Republicans to \nvote against legislation which will not create sustainable private \nsector jobs and which is designed to fail in Congress or he can work \nwith us on legislation that will actually encourage small businesses to \ncreate jobs and is actually designed to pass.\n  There is an entire menu of bipartisan job-promoting proposals the \nPresident could choose to pursue over the next year. Republicans hope \nhe works with us to approve them. Americans are waiting. We are ready \nto act. The free-trade agreements we are voting on tonight are a good \nfirst step. They demonstrate the way Washington can actually help \ntackle the jobs crisis, not by spending borrowed money to create \ntemporary jobs--spending borrowed money to create temporary jobs. We \nhave tried that. This will lower barriers to private enterprise, \nunleashing the power of the private sector to make and sell products, \nexpand market share, and in doing so create sustainable private sector \njobs that will not disappear when the Federal cash spigot runs dry. But \nif we are going to tackle the enormous challenges we face, we need to \ndo much more than that. With these trade agreements, we are showing we \ncan work together to create jobs and help the economy. We can and must \ndo more of this kind of thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6399-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I come to the floor today--thankfully \nfor the last time, I hope--in support of the pending free-trade \nagreements with Korea, Panama, and Colombia. For nearly 3 years we have \nheard the administration say the right things. Yet there were countless \ndelays. It has been 1,566 days since the U.S.-Korea Free Trade \nAgreement was signed, 1,568 days for the Panama agreement, and 1,786 \ndays since we completed negotiations with Colombia. Finally, though, I \nbelieve the waiting has ended, and the administration took action and \nhas submitted these agreements for a vote. I am eager to vote for all \nthree FTAs this evening and to see their job-creating power in action. \nBy the administration's own estimates, these agreements will spur a \nquarter of a million new jobs.\n  We should all be able to agree that the benefits of trade are \nsignificant. In my home State of Nebraska alone, more than 19,000 jobs \nand more than $5.5 billion in revenue were directly tied to exports in \nthis last year. With these agreements, these statistics will only \nimprove. Nebraska is a big agricultural State, and these three \nagreements eliminate tariffs and other barriers on most agricultural \nproducts, including beef, corn, soybeans, and pork--all products grown \nin Nebraska. In fact, according to the Farm Bureau and economic \nanalysis from the USDA, full implementation of those agreements will \nresult in nearly $2.5 billion increases in U.S. agricultural exports \neach year. In Nebraska, this increase in agricultural exports is \nexpected to total about $125 million per year and add another 1,100 \njobs to our State.\n  The benefits for my home State are not hard to see. In fact, they \nwould be hard to miss. As the Nation's fourth largest exporter of feed \ngrain and a key beef State, the U.S.-Korea agreement holds great \nopportunity and promise for Nebraska. It immediately eliminates duties \non nearly two-thirds of U.S. agricultural exports to Korea. U.S. \nexports of corn for feed enter at zero duty--zero duty immediately. For \nthe second largest corn State, that is a significant leveling of the \nplaying field. And it phases out the 40-percent tariff on beef muscle \nmeat and the 18-percent tariff on variety meats.\n  The Colombia agreement offers great opportunities to both \nmanufacturing and the agricultural sector. Just one example: Nebraska \nmanufactures and exports irrigation pivots to customers all over the \nworld. Currently Colombia imposes a 15-percent duty on pivots, which \nwould be eliminated by this trade agreement. This will allow Nebraska \nmanufacturers to compete on a level playing field with European \ncompanies.\n  The Colombia agreement also eliminates barriers for many Nebraska \nagricultural products, including beef, corn, soybeans, pork, and wheat. \nIn particular, the agreement immediately eliminates the 80-percent duty \non some\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\nof the most important products to the U.S. beef industry--prime and \nchoice cuts of meat. The Colombia agreement eliminates all tariffs on \nwheat and barriers on corn and on soybeans.\n  Unfortunately, during these years of delay I referenced at the start \nof my comments this morning, negotiators for other countries saw an \nopportunity. Negotiators from the European Union, Argentina, and Canada \nsaw the void the U.S. companies, workers, and farmers should have been \nfilling, and they acted. As a result, our exporters now face even \ngreater competition in these markets. For example, when the U.S.-\nColombia agreement was signed, American wheat farmers supplied 70 \npercent of the Colombian market. In 2010, U.S. wheat growers supplied \nonly 45 percent of that market. During that time, the United States \nlost market share in Colombia to competitors such as Argentina and \nCanada that did not wait on the sidelines, and now they enjoy duty-free \naccess. Because of unnecessary delays, our farmers have lost out in \nmarkets they dominated when this agreement was signed. But if we act \nquickly, if we pass these agreements tonight, U.S. producers can work \nto build back market share.\n  I am confident that Nebraska farmers, businesses, workers, and those \naround the country can compete with anybody in the world, and in doing \nso we can create jobs here at home. By the administration's estimates, \nthe Korea, Colombia and Panama Free Trade Agreements will create, as I \nhave referenced, 250,000 U.S. jobs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce took a \nbroader view; they have an estimate of 380,000 jobs to be created. But \neither number is worth celebrating.\n  In May, the President called for ``a robust, forward-looking trade \nagenda that emphasizes exports and domestic job growth.'' I am glad the \nPresident has turned these words into action on these long overdue job-\ncreating agreements. These three bipartisan votes should have been near \nthe top of the agenda 3 years ago. By now, we should be voting on new \nagreements this administration has negotiated, not the leftover work of \nthe past administration.\n  During the challenging economic times our Nation has endured, we \nshould have been exerting every ounce of energy to get our economy \ngoing. That is not done by heavyhanded government regulation and \nmassive, unsustainable new government spending. It is accomplished by \nlowering and removing barriers so our job creators can flourish in a \nglobal environment. That is what we have today--an opportunity to give \nour job creators a chance to flourish in the global environment. We \ncannot ignore that the fastest growing opportunities for American \nbusinesses, farms, and ranchers are not in the United States or outside \nour borders, they are overseas in rapidly developing countries where 95 \npercent of the world's population lives. I sincerely hope those long \ndelays have not hurt our ability to negotiate high-quality trade \nagreements, but more importantly, I hope it has not hurt the ability of \nAmericans to compete in these growing markets.\n  I look forward to working with the administration over the rest of \nthis Congress on forward-looking trade efforts. Real progress forward \nwould produce even more opportunities.\n  I am optimistic this morning. I am optimistic that my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle will join me in voting in favor of the trade \nagreements with Korea, Panama, and Colombia. Together, we can allow \nhard-working Americans to create jobs here at home.\n  I hope these three agreements are the beginning, not the end.\n  Following today's vote, we should rejoice in an accomplishment, but \nmore work remains to be done. I am prepared to tackle this endeavor, as \nI did when I was Secretary of Agriculture. For the sake of our Nation, \nI hope to find willing partners on these three votes and, in the \nfuture, more trade agreements and additional opportunities.\n  Before yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nduring the quorum calls be divided equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I was on the phone earlier this week \nwith a friend in Delaware. We were talking about these free-trade \nagreements negotiated by the Bush administration and fine-tuned by the \nObama administration. My friend said: Why do we have free-trade \nagreements anyway? I said: Let's go back a little bit in time. At the \nend of World War II, when the baby boomers and my sister and I came \nalong, the United States was on top of the world. Our industrial \ninfrastructure was strong. We were a vibrant economy. We had come out \nof the Great Depression with all guns blazing, while a lot of the rest \nof the world lay in ruin. Some of the nations that would go on to \nbecome our greatest competitors, including China, Korea, and some \nothers as well, were in the midst of wars of their own, and eventually \nthey would be governed--at least in part in Korea--by a Communist form \nof government. So the competition wasn't that great.\n  Then things started to change. The competition got a whole lot \nstronger. I remember when I was a kid growing up, at Christmas time we \nwere opening presents around the Christmas tree. I grew up in Danville, \nVA. We received a knickknack or something from friends of our family, \nand my father turned it over and it said ``Made in Japan.'' He and my \nmom kind of sneered at that, as if it were unworthy of us--anything \nbeing made in Japan.\n  Things have changed--in some ways for the better and in other ways \nmaybe not. For a long time, we were the 800-pound gorilla in the room. \nIn terms of auto sales, I think we had about 90 percent of the market \nshare in the United States--maybe more than that--well into the latter \npart of the last century. Now we don't. Our market share in cars is \nless than 50 percent. The quality is good, but the market share is \nless. If we look at the amount of cars that come to us from Korea, they \nwill roughly export 500,000 vehicles to the United States this year, as \nthey did last year and will next year. We will export barely 5,000 cars \nto them. Think about that. Roughly, for every 1 American car we sell \nthem, they sell us about 100. That is not free trade. As it turns out, \nit is not fair trade either. They don't put tariffs on their cars. They \nhave nontariff barriers--a very clever way to keep our vehicles out. It \ncould have to do with the environmental equipment on the car, the fuel \nsystem, transmissions, you name it. They find all kinds of ways to keep \nour vehicles out. We don't do that or play that game. They take \nadvantage of that.\n  We wish to sell in a place such as Panama. In this country, a lot of \npeople like the white meat of the chicken. Overseas, a lot of people \neat the dark meat. It is an opportunity to export the dark meat for us. \nIf we want to export leg quarters, drumsticks, and thighs in Panama, \nnormally, a package of leg quarters costs $10 here, and there is a 260-\npercent tariff for those leg quarters going into Panama. They have to \npay $36. I don't know what that translates into pesos, but they pay $36 \nfor $10 worth of chicken.\n  We allow other countries, whether it is Korea, Panama, Colombia or \nmany other nations, to sell their goods and products at will into our \ncountry, without much at all in the way of barriers, without \nimpediment, without tariff barriers or nontarrif barriers. But they \nimpose barriers against us. The reason why flows from the situation we \nwere in at the end of World War II, when we were such an economic \njuggernaut. Other countries wanted to protect their markets a little \nbit from the 800-pound gorilla in the world, which was us.\n  While we are still a strong and vibrant nation, we no longer dominate \nworld markets. We want to make sure we have access to other markets in \nways we have not had in recent years in some countries.\n  I would like to think of one of the roles of government, and one of \nthe major roles of government, is to provide a nurturing environment \nfor job creation and job preservation. That includes a lot of things. \nThat includes\n\n[[Page S6401]]\n\nmaking sure businesses, large and small, have access to the credit; it \nmeans that when folks come up with an idea, we have an innovative \neconomy and a lot of technology; when people come up with new \ntechnology and new ideas, they go to the Patent Office to file it and \nthey end up getting the patent and they don't end up in years of \nlitigation.\n  Businesses like predictability, and that is part of the environment \nwe need to provide. We need to provide a workforce where the people can \ncome out of our schools and can read, write, think, do math, and have a \ngood work ethic. We have to have common sense in regulations. \nObviously, we need regulations, and we need to consider cost-benefit \nrelations. As we do those regulations, we can get input from all sides.\n  We need predictable tax policies--tax policies that are progrowth. We \nalso need access to foreign markets. Folks who build products in this \ncountry need access to foreign markets. In too many cases, we don't \nhave that. These trade agreements are attempting to change that. Very \nsoon, for that family in Panama who has to pay $36 for the same amount \nof drumsticks and thighs that now cost $10 here, that is going to \nchange. We are going to start exporting and selling cars in Korea. They \nwill still be able to sell theirs here, but we will sell tens of \nthousands of cars in Korea in a year or two.\n  In my State, we used to make a lot of cars. We had a GM plant and a \nChrysler plant. They are now gone. But starting next year, a new plant \nwill start up, and they will make some of the most beautiful cars in \nthe world. Some are already being made, called the Karma. It gets about \n70 miles per gallon. It is a drop-dead beautiful vehicle. Starting late \nnext year, they will be making it a less-expensive car. We want to make \nsure they use our Port of Wilmington to ship those cars around the \nworld. It would be nice to sell some of those in Korea or in Latin \nAmerica and South America, as well as in Europe.\n  For my State, 80 percent of our agricultural industry, believe it or \nnot, is chickens. I don't know what it is like in Iowa or in Florida or \nNew York, but 80 percent of ours is chickens. Agriculture is one of the \ntop three sectors of our State's economy--80 percent chickens. One out \nof every five chickens we raise in the Delmarva Peninsula is exported \nto another country. This is not chickenfeed; this is a big deal for us \nin Delaware.\n\n  This is important for our ability to export vehicles, our ability to \nexport chemicals, plastics, poultry, and the ability for us to export \nsome of our services--the work we do in financial services with banking \nor insurance. A lot of those companies would like to be able to do \nbusiness in Korea or Latin America. This legislation will enable them \nto do that.\n  I think a lot of people will vote for the agreements today with \nPanama and with South Korea. Even some of the labor unions--the UAW and \nothers--support the South Korea agreement. There is still skepticism \nand concern, understandably, regarding the agreement with Colombia. As \neverybody in the Chamber knows, and a lot of people in this country \nknow, for years, labor leaders, organizers have been the target of \nassassinations in Colombia. According to the Colombians, in 2001, I \nbelieve there were about 205 assassinations in that 1 year alone in \nColombia. The numbers are a little bit confusing because that includes \nfolks who are not necessarily labor organizers but who are educators \nand maybe members of labor unions--205 people in 1 year. Can you \nimagine in this country if 205 labor leaders, organizers, and teachers \nwere murdered in a year? That is a much smaller country than ours. The \nnumbers have come down.\n  In one of our conversations yesterday with some labor unions in \nDelaware, one shared the latest number reported by the Colombian \nGovernment; I think it was 22 in the early part of this month. That is \n22 too many. About half those folks killed were teachers who have been \ntargeted by criminal elements and drug folks, drug gangs, because of \nthe threat that teachers and educators pose to the ability of the drug \nfolks to destabilize that country. So they are targets as well.\n  The Colombian Government has provided almost like a witness \nprotection service down there, but it is somewhat different. They don't \ntake people and change their identities and move them and hide them. \nThey actually provide extra protection for folks who are believed to be \nat risk. That caused a reduction of almost 90 percent in the \nassassinations over the last decade. Even if it is just one or two, we \nknow that is too many.\n  The question for us is, Do we ignore the progress or do we say, no, \nwe are not going to ratify a free-trade agreement with Colombia until \nthere are no assassinations? We have a saying: Don't let the perfect be \nthe enemy of the good. That may trivialize this particular argument, \nand I would not suggest that is the standard we should use. But \nsubstantial progress has been made. We have embedded in that trade \nagreement environmental provisions, labor provisions, that are now part \nof the agreement. We have done the same with Panama and Korea. There is \nan implementation schedule that the government is expected to follow \nand has been followed. It has been certified by the President. They are \ntaking the steps they are supposed to be taking in order to further \nreduce the level of violence. Overall, rather extraordinary progress \nhas been made in Colombia.\n  A friend of mine who works there in the Embassy described to me the \ndifference is between night and day.\n  It wasn't all that long ago when gunmen rounded up 11 supreme court \njustices in Colombia and took them into a room and shot them all dead. \nWe know it is not just teachers or labor leaders who are being targeted \nfor assassination and have been targeted but people at the highest \nlevels of that country's government--government leaders, people who run \nfor office, officeholders, law enforcement officers, judges, all kinds \nof people.\n  For the most part, it has changed. It is a lot better. The question \nis, Do we reward the improvement made or do we say, no, that is not \nenough, come back when you are pristine clean, pristine pure? For me, \nit is one I wrestled with and others have as well. I think, in this \ncase, we can vote with our hopes, and our hope and expectation is that \nthis progress has been realized and will continue.\n  There is one last thing I wish to mention before I finish.\n  Any number of folks have said to me: You know, NAFTA didn't help us \nall that much--Mexico and Canada--and so how do we know these trade \nagreements will help us? We learned some things from NAFTA. One of the \nthings we learned is if we have environmental concerns, we ought to \nembed in the agreement the rest of those environmental concerns--\nactually addressing them in the treaty. We have done that with all \nthese nations. We have done the same thing with respect to labor \nprovisions. They are actually embedded in the agreement.\n  The other thing I have said to folks who are concerned this isn't in \nour best interest and it will not help us economically, I don't agree \nwith that. But think about this. To say this is not going to help us is \ncounterintuitive. Think about it. We allow these countries to sell \ntheir goods and services in our country without impediment. We don't \nkeep them out. We don't impose, for the most part, tariff or nontariff \nbarriers. But if we want to sell our goods and services there, they \nimpose these barriers--tariff or nontariff barriers. Under a free-trade \nagreement, the barriers that others put up to keep our goods and \nservices out pretty much go away and in some cases pretty fast.\n  It is hard for me to say: Well, if we are going to let them ship \ntheir goods and services to us--continue to--and they are going to \neliminate their tariff and nontariff barriers, why shouldn't we do \nbetter? We will do better. We make great chicken, we build great cars, \nhave great chemical products, and excellent financial services. Those \nproducts will sell and we will be able to grow our economy.\n  The last problem is this. For us to come out of this recession--and \nwe have come out of the recession officially, but there is still a lot \nof hurt and pain all over the place, including in my own State, but for \nus to come out of it, we need to grow the economy--we need to grow the \neconomy--and we need to grow it across the world. We make any number of \nproducts in this country. Some are products--cars, chickens, chemicals, \nplastics--and others are services. They are\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\nas good as any in the world. We want to make sure we have access to \nsell them anywhere in the world, including these three countries. Their \nconsumers will be better off and our producers and our businesses will \nbe better off. That is why I am happy to support these agreements.\n  The last thing I want to do is to acknowledge the excellent \nleadership Senator Baucus has provided for us. Senator Grassley is on \nthe floor, and I know these are issues he cares a lot about. The \npartnership he and Senator Baucus have had over the years is a model \nfor the Senate.\n  They are not on the floor now, but I also want to mention Senator \nBlunt and Senator Portman, two of our Republican colleagues, who joined \nwith me to make sure at the end of the day we didn't just vote for \nthree free-trade agreements but we also had the opportunity to vote and \nput in place trade adjustment assistance to ensure those workers in \nthis country who might be negatively affected or displaced would have \nthe opportunity to get unemployment compensation and have the \nopportunity to get job training so they will be treated fairly as well. \nIt is the personification of the Golden Rule: Treat other people the \nway we want to be treated.\n  So we have succeeded in not just passing three free-trade agreements, \nwhich I think will help our economy overall, but we will also look out \nfor the people who might be adversely affected. So I want to thank \nSenator Grassley and the other Republicans who provided the support to \nmake that happen too. And again to Senator Baucus: A job well done.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor to anyone \nelse who is here and wants to speak at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, can you believe it, we are finally here. After \nseveral years of waiting for these trade agreements to come to the \nCongress, it looks as though we are going to be able to vote on them, \npass them, and send them to the President for his signature, and they \nwill become law.\n  Quite frankly, I thought soon after May 10, 2007, we would be voting \non the Colombia trade agreement because President Bush was anxious to \nsend it to the Hill. But the Democrats took over the Congress after the \n2006 election, and the way it was negotiated by the Bush administration \nwasn't good enough. There wasn't enough negotiation to go far enough on \nlabor and environment, so the new Democratic- controlled Congress said \nwe have to do more on those negotiations for environment and labor.\n  So more was renegotiated, and on May 10, 2007, there was a news \nconference announcing a bipartisan result between the Bush \nadministration and the Democratic Congress on an agreement with \nColombia on better environment and labor issues that had been reached. \nSo a bipartisan agreement, particularly when you have a Democratic \nCongress and a Republican President, you would have expected that right \naway we would be having at least Colombia up here. At that time, South \nKorea wasn't completely negotiated. But the other party turned into a \nprotectionist party and so nothing has happened until now. The \ngoalposts have been moved several times, but the free trade reality of \ncreating jobs has come back to the other political party. So I am glad \nwe are here at last, even though it may be 4 years late. We are doing \nthe right thing, even though it is being done later than it should have \nbeen done.\n  Everybody knows that every day in this Congress, and rightly so, with \n9.1 percent unemployment, the topic is jobs. And that is as it should \nbe. The question gets asked a lot: What policies can we implement here \nin the Congress to create jobs or at least to encourage jobs. With over \n9 percent unemployment in this country, we should, in fact, be talking \nabout how to have an environment that creates jobs, and freeing up \ntrade is one of the best ways to create jobs. These aren't just \ncreating jobs, these are good-paying jobs. On average, jobs related to \ninternational trade pay 15 percent above the national average.\n  The truth is for years we have known one clear and simple way to \ncreate jobs and stimulate growth in our economy, and that is \ninternational trade. The Colombia, South Korea, and Panama trade \nagreements will create and support thousands of jobs, and I believe \neven hundreds of thousands of jobs. So we must implement the trade \ndeals reached with Panama, South Korea, and Colombia, and we must do it \ntoday, even though it should have been done, in the case of South \nKorea, a year ago and in the case of Panama and Colombia 3 or 4 years \nago.\n  We entered into these agreements back in 2006 and 2007, and there is \nno excuse why we have had to wait nearly 5 years--until now--to get to \nthem. Yet congressional Democrats, and later President Obama, continued \nto move the goalposts, putting up barriers that prevented their \nconsideration and passage until this day. There is no clearer or easier \nway of creating jobs in the near term, and good jobs lasting for a long \nperiod of time, than passing these trade bills and doing it now. Thank \nGod the President has said he would sign them.\n  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, 100,000 jobs \nwill be created by the implementation of these trade agreements. There \nare estimates from other sources that suggest the number of jobs may be \neven higher. The administration--and I believe rightly so--believes \nthat the higher number of jobs being created would be in the few \nhundred thousand. The Obama administration estimates in the case of the \nKorea trade agreement alone 70,000 additional jobs for the U.S. \nworkforce will be created.\n  Not only do these trade agreements expand opportunities for U.S. \nworkers, they also present tremendous opportunities for American \nagriculture. It is estimated that the Korean agreement could increase \nthe price farmers receive for pigs by $10 per head. So you see in the \ncase of Delaware, where Senator Carper says it is good for his poultry \nindustry because that is so dominant there, where larger livestock is \nso dominant in the Midwest, in my State of Iowa, it is going to be a \nvery good agreement as well.\n\n  The Colombian agreement will level the playing field for U.S. corn \nfarmers so they can begin to reclaim some of the market share they lost \ndue to high tariffs for our products going down there. We have lost \nmarkets not just because of the high tariffs but because Colombia, in \nthe last 5 years, has reached agreements with other countries that have \nallowed those countries, through their agricultural products--\nparticularly grain--to take over the share of the Colombian market that \nAmerican agriculture previously had.\n  The agreement with the country of Panama will bring about better \nopportunities for a variety of agricultural products, including beef, \npoultry, and pork, to name a few.\n  We have been waiting a long time to get to this point, and so, as I \nhave said two or three times, because I am satisfied we are going to \nget the job done, I am eager to cast my vote in support of all three \nagreements. But as the finish line nears on these agreements, the \nAmerican people should be asking why President Obama has dragged his \nfeet on these agreements for so long. There has been a lot of wasted \ntime and tax dollars with stimulus programs that were supposed to \ncreate jobs but did not produce any measurable amount of jobs; whereas, \nif these agreements had been in place, these jobs we are talking about \ncreating from this day forward would probably have already been \ncreated. The stimulus plan failed to do what President Obama promised \nAmericans, but I am telling you these trade agreements will do what \nPresident Obama promises the American people, they will do in the way \nof creating jobs.\n  Of course, the President wants to try it again with yet another \ncostly stimulus program, as we were debating yesterday. We don't need \nmore government spending to create jobs. We know that doesn't work. \nWhat we need to do is create an environment so the private sector will \ncreate jobs. We know what works, and these agreements are part of what \nworks to create jobs. We need to continue opening markets for U.S. \nexports, and that is what these agreements will do. We need to pass \nthese trade agreements and do it now. American workers need them now \nand the unemployed need the new jobs that will be created as a result \nof these agreements.\n  But for the economic future of our country, we should not stop with \nthese\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\nthree trade agreements. The President can provide certainty to \nbusinesses, farmers, and workers by renewing his commitment to \nexpanding trade opportunities. The best way to do that is to ask \nCongress to renew his authority to negotiate free-trade agreements \nthrough a long-used cooperative process between the Congress and the \nexecutive branch of government, involving the Congress giving the \nPresident what is called trade promotion authority so he can work \nfurther agreements.\n  In January of 2010, the President said he wanted to double exports by \n2015, and that was welcome news. But actions speak louder than words, \nMr. President. The President has repeatedly delayed these trade deals. \nHe has routinely dodged the question of when he would request authority \nfor trade promotion to negotiate new agreements, and he has not laid \nout a clear strategic plan for in fact reaching the trade goals he \nexpressed at the beginning of 2010. We are now nearly 2 years further \ndown the road from that discussion he had.\n  While it may be tough to reach the goals of doubling exports by 2015, \nwe can still push on toward that goal, as we should. The more we do to \nopen new markets and then get out of the way, the more we will help our \nstruggling economy. There are three steps to continue helping U.S. \nbusinesses, farmers, and most of all the workers of America--\nparticularly the unemployed workers of America. First, we need to pass \nthese three trade agreements with no more political gamesmanship by \nthis administration, and I think we are over that hurdle. Secondly, \nCongress should pass trade promotion authority so the administration \ncan responsibly seek opportunities for greater market access for U.S. \nproducts. Finally, the administration must make it a top priority to \nactually seek more opportunities for opening foreign markets for our \nproducts.\n  We live in a global economy. We once led the way in forming trade \nagreements and expanding trade relationships. The rest of the world \nwaited for the United States to take the first step.\n  In recent years, we have lost our way. The rest of the world isn't \ngoing to wait on the United States as they did for the last 60 years. \nThat is why we have lost market share in Colombia that I just spoke \nabout as one example.\n  We need to reestablish our position as a world leader in opening and \nexpanding markets. Passing these trade agreements is crucial and long \noverdue, but it is a necessary first step. The next step is for the \nPresident to seek trade promotion authority and get back in the game \nleading the rest of the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to help U.S. businesses, farmers, our workers, \nand, most importantly, our unemployed workers by voting in support of \nthe Panama, Colombia, and South Korea trade agreements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I compliment my colleague for his kind and good words on \nthe floor. He is a great leader in the Senate, and the Senator from \nIowa is one of the truly great people I have met.\n  Today, we are finally considering our free-trade agreements with \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea. It has been 9 long years since the \nauthority to negotiate these trade agreements was passed by Congress, \nand it has been over 4 years, as the distinguished Senator from Iowa \nsaid, since each of these agreements was signed.\n  After a burst of international economic engagement under President \nBush, we witnessed nothing but passive indifference by the 111th \nDemocrat-led Congress and then, in more recent years, by the Obama \nadministration.\n  While purporting to support trade and seemingly acknowledging its \nbenefits, the current administration took little concrete action to \nadvance these or any trade agreements for years. In fact, the opposite \nwas true. Instead of devising ways to gain their approval, President \nObama used his time to create excuses for not supporting any of the \nthree agreements.\n  Finally, early this year, under relentless political pressure from \nCongress and from American businesses and farmers who will benefit from \nthese agreements, the administration's excuses slowly melted away. \nThen, with every reasonable excuse gone and with bipartisan support for \npassing the agreements building and the end in sight, President Obama \nthrew another obstacle in the path of their consideration. This time he \nmade new demands for more spending on domestic worker retraining \nprograms. Let's consider that at a time when virtually every government \nspending program faces intense scrutiny and many programs are being \ncut, this administration demanded more spending for a program of \ndubious value and with an unproven track record. In doing so, the \nPresident put his thirst for more spending ahead of the interests of \nthe broader American economy that would benefit from these agreements \nentering into force, and he risked the tens of thousands of jobs his \nown administration insists these agreements will create. His reckless \ndemands ground any progress we had achieved to pass the agreements to a \nhalt. Accordingly, it took months for Congress to unravel this \nsubstantive and procedural Gordian knot of the President's own making. \nMeanwhile, U.S. workers continued to lose ground as our foreign \ncompetitors completed agreements to benefit their workers at our \nexpense.\n  With today's vote, our Nation can hopefully begin to awaken from its \ntrade stupor and confront the opportunities and challenges the world \neconomy offers once again. Frankly, I am baffled by this \nadministration's disregard for trade. They should know better. Our \ncountry benefits from free-trade agreements, and the reason is simple: \nThe tariffs of our trading partners are generally significantly higher \nthan are those of the United States. Free-trade agreements even the \nplaying field for U.S. exporters by lowering the tariffs of the United \nStates and our trading partners to the same level of zero.\n  For those who say they demand fair trade, it is hard for me to \nconceive of fairer trade than that--a level playing field where our \nproducts and services enjoy the same access and protections that \nforeign goods and services enjoy here in the United States. By leveling \nthe playing field, free-trade agreements promote U.S. exports. Indeed, \nU.S. exports to our free-trade-agreement countries increased at a \nfaster rate than U.S. exports to the rest of the world from 2009 to \n2010. Moreover, in 2010, U.S. exports to our free-trade partner \ncountries constituted 41 percent of all U.S. exports. Yet the United \nStates has free-trade agreements with only 17 countries, and that is \nout of the 234 countries on which the U.S. Department of Commerce \ncollects trade data. So our exports to our free-trade-agreement \npartners--just 17 countries--come close to dominating U.S. exports.\n  Let's look at this another way. The combined population of our free \ntrade agreement partner countries is only about 310 million, while the \nworld population is approximately 7 billion. So almost half of U.S. \nexports go to the less than 5 percent of the world's population that \nlives in countries with which we have free trade agreements. To me, it \nis clear that if we really want to double exports over the next 5 \nyears, among the best tools available to us are our free trade \nagreements.\n  The export numbers under our recent free trade agreements certainly \nbear this out. Staff economists at the U.S. International Trade \nCommission share these observations on the benefits of the recent free \ntrade agreements. They wrote last month that ``the United States has a \nsignificant and sustained trade surplus with recent FTA partners.'' In \nan analysis of recent free trade agreements that excluded oil trade, \nthese economists noted that the U.S. trade surplus with these recent \nfree trade agreement partners grew from $1.7 billion in 2005 to $16.7 \nbillion in 2010, and they stated that this expanded trade surplus was \ndriven mainly by a $24.5 billion increase in U.S. exports to those \ncountries. During this same period, U.S. non-oil exports to the recent \nFTA partner countries increased by 23 percent, while non-oil imports \nfrom those countries grew by only 3 percent.\n  So the facts are clear that the recently implemented U.S. free trade \nagreements have benefited the United States. There is little doubt that \nthe pending U.S. free trade agreements will do the same. As with \nexisting U.S. free trade agreements, the free trade agreements with \nColombia, Panama, and\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\nSouth Korea will level the playing field for U.S. exporters. They will \neliminate the significant disparity between tariffs imposed by \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea on imports from the United States and \ntariffs that the United States applies im imports from those countries.\n  According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, U.S. exports to \nthese countries may increase by up to $12 billion following \nimplementation of these agreements. The U.S. International Trade \nCommission also estimates that these agreements, once implemented, \ncould expand the U.S. GDP by over $14 billion.\n  Let's take a moment to review the unique benefits of each of these \nagreements. The South Korea FTA is in many ways the gold standard for \ntrade agreements. South Korea's economy is worth over $1 trillion, and \nthis agreement enables American workers and companies to take advantage \nof it.\n  The FTA incorporates state of the art intellectual property rights \nprotections, significantly expands services sector market access, opens \na large agriculture market, and offers new market access for American \nmanufacturers. It adopts the most advanced regulatory, non-tariff \nbarrier, and investment provisions of any FTA thus far and champions \nthe rule of law which is so critical to an effective and fair rules-\nbased trading relationship.\n  For my home State of Utah, South Korea is already an impressive \nmarket. South Korea imported more than $294 million of goods from Utah \nin 2009 alone. Implementation of the agreement will help boost Utah's \nexports even more, as over two-thirds of our exports to Korea will \nbecome duty-free immediately.\n  The sectors that will immediately benefit from the agreement's tariff \ncuts reflect Utah's economy, including computers and electronics, \nmetals and ores, machinery, agriculture, and services.\n  But the benefits of this agreement for Utah go far beyond just \nreducing tariffs. By adopting the strongest intellectual property \nrights, regulatory reforms, investment protections, and transparency \nprovisions, the South Korea FTA will ensure that our companies, \nfarmers, and workers realize the full potential of the South Korean \nmarket. By protecting the ideas of America's entrepreneurs and \nproviding a level playing field, U.S. workers and job creators stand to \nbenefit significantly from implementation of this agreement.\n  Panama plays a unique and important role in international trade. The \nconstruction of the Panama Canal bridged East and West, allowing us to \nlink economies across the globe. Today, Panama is building towards an \neven more interconnected future as it engages in an ambitious $5.25 \nbillion construction project to broaden and deepen the canal. The \nPanama FTA will provide our companies and workers with access to this \nand other government procurement projects.\n\n  Panama is one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America, \nhaving experienced a decade of economic growth that has at times \nreached double digits. Panama's GDP is expected to more than double by \n2020. Passing this agreement will provide significant new access for \nU.S. companies and workers to this growing market.\n  Bear in mind that today, 98 percent of Panama's goods enter the U.S. \nduty free. Our trade agreement turns this into a two-way street, \nensuring that 87 percent of U.S. goods will enter Panama duty free \nimmediately once we get this agreement implemented.\n  Panama is also one of the world's financial hubs and in recent years \nhas taken giant leaps to increase its fiscal transparency. This \nfinancial industry underpins a services market worth over $20 billion. \nOur services firms will have guaranteed access to this market once we \nthe FTA enters into force. Our farmers and ranchers will gain \nadditional market access through tariff reductions and a fair and \ntransparent, science-based regulatory environment which will enable \nthem to sell more products to Panama's growing consumer class. The \nagreement will foster greater customs transparency, which will benefit \nboth exporters and importers, including Utah companies who currently \nexport almost $4.5 million per year in goods to Panama.\n  The Colombia agreement will also help our exporters. Our agreement \nwith Colombia will transform a one-way preferential trade relationship \ninto a two-way street, giving U.S. exporters fair access to a large and \ngrowing consumer market. Colombia's economy is the third largest in \nCentral and South America. Colombia is also the third largest recipient \nof U.S. exports in Latin America. In fact, in 2010 the U.S. sold more \nproducts to Colombia--approximately $12 billion--than to Russia, Spain, \nTurkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, South Africa, \nThailand, and the Philippines.\n  The agreement will affect the lives of farmers and workers across the \nUnited States in a positive way. A good example of the agreement's \npositive effects can be found in my home State of Utah where workers at \nAC Med, a Salt Lake City company that exports hospital beds to \nColombia, will see tariffs of 20 percent eliminated immediately upon \nimplementation of this agreement.\n  Implementation of this agreement will result in over 80 percent of \nU.S. exports of consumer and industrial products to Colombia becoming \nduty free immediately, with the remaining tariffs being phased out over \n10 years.\n  The agreement will also provide significant new access to Colombia's \n$134 billion services market, will require the use of fair and \ntransparent procurement procedures protecting United States companies \nin Colombia against discriminatory or unlawful treatment, protect \nintellectual property rights, and increase access for U.S. service \nproviders, telecommunication companies, and agricultural exporters.\n  There are a number of reasons beyond the economic benefits to the \nUnited States economy to support our trade agreement with Colombia in \nparticular. Colombia is a strategic ally of the United States. In a \npart of the world where the United States has too often lacked friends, \nColombia is a sound and steadfast ally. In fact, I can think of no \nother countries in South America with which the United States has \ncloser, stronger, and more positive relations.\n  While Colombia has a long democratic tradition, undemocratic forces \nhave tried over the years to topple its government. Determined to keep \nthese armed entities from destroying their democracy, Colombians fought \nfor decades against these forces. Far too many brave men and women lost \ntheir lives and their livelihoods in this struggle.\n  The United States stood by the side of these Colombians, devoting \nsignificant resources in the fight against drug traffickers and narco-\nterrorists through Plan Colombia. The accomplishments of Plan Colombia \nhave been significant, but there is more work to be done. Continued \neconomic growth will be key to helping Colombia further solidify its \ndemocratic gains and strengthen the rule of law. This FTA can \ncontribute to both our economies while strengthening democracy in \nColombia and helping our friends.\n  Each of these agreements will enhance our economic competitiveness \nand provide new opportunities for our exporters. Our Nation has been \ndenied the benefits of these agreements for long enough. As President \nObama himself has said, it is time to put country before party, and \nsupport each of these important trade agreements. I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote for each of these agreements.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                          Iranian Bombing Plot\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to speak on the trade \nbills, but first I would like to comment on the fact, as the Senator \nfrom Utah has reminded us, of the sacrifice a lot of young Americans \nare enduring.\n  One of the more difficult tasks that I have is to sign the letters of \ncondolence to the families on the loss of one of their members anywhere \nin the world having to do with the armed services.\n  I might say that another major part of our protection of our national \nsecurity is the young men and women we do not hear about, the men and \nwomen of the intelligence community all across the globe who likewise \nare protecting our national security interests, many times in direct \ncoordination with the U.S. military. From time to time, we have \ncasualties in the intelligence community as well.\n\n[[Page S6405]]\n\n  I just want to again express my profound thanks and gratitude to \nthose across the globe who are protecting the national security \ninterests of our blessed country.\n  It is interesting because we just learned of a plot that was a threat \nto our security interests. Can you believe--a plot to assassinate a \ndiplomat here in our Capital City of Washington; a plot that has \nintrigue like a B novel, that brings in the Mexican drug cartels; a \nplot that, according to the Attorney General, has been hatched by high \nlevels of the Iranian Government. Now, the question is, who is in \ncontrol in the Iranian Government? Is it the Supreme Leader? Is it the \nPresident, Ahmadi-Nejad? Is it what this plot was traced to, which is \none arm of their governmental apparatus, the Revolutionary Guard, the \nQuds Force? It doesn't seem that Iran has its act together.\n  Even though we hear the protestations by the Iranian Ambassador at \nthe United Nations that this is all a fabricated lie, this perpetrator \nhas already confessed. According to the news reports, they are saying \nthis plot included bomb attacks, plotting on the Saudi and Israeli \nEmbassies here in Washington, and that is all here in our National \nCapital. It was, according to the Attorney General, conceived, \nsponsored, and directed from Iran. This is obviously a flagrant \nviolation of international law.\n  An FBI informant, in the transcript the Justice Department released \nyesterday, asked the alleged plotter whether he was worried about \ninnocent people being killed by a bombing in a restaurant where the \nsupposed plot was to have taken place, where the Saudi Ambassador was \ngoing to be dining. In a reference to his Iranian superiors, this \nbomber said, ``They want that guy done'' even if ``a hundred go with \nhim.'' The people of the United States have every reason to be \noutraged, to view this plot as an outright attempt to assault our \nNation and our allies. I appreciate the Secretary of State calling for \ntougher sanctions. I want to hear what the administration is going to \ndo, to make it very clear that these kinds of actions are not going to \nbe tolerated.\n\n  I thank, again, the intelligence community, which is how I started my \ncomments. I thank the intelligence community for what they are doing \naround planet Earth, day in and day out, gathering the information that \nprotects us.\n  I want to comment on the matter at hand, the trade bills. I thank the \nchairman and the ranking member for their hard work in bringing to the \ntable and shepherding these trade agreements through the Finance \nCommittee and now here to the Senate. I came here to talk about what is \ngood about these agreements and other people are coming here to talk \nabout what is good, but all you hear is people want to blame the \nadministration for something. Why don't we say something good?\n  Not only are these agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama \ncritical to the U.S. economy, they are certainly critical to the \neconomy of my State of Florida, and they send an important signal that \nthe United States is not going to turn its back on economic engagement. \nThese trade agreements are creating a level playing field for American \ncompanies by removing foreign barriers to U.S. exports and U.S. \ninvestment. And, by the way, some of us would not have let these trade \nagreements go forward unless there had been also the passage of the \ntrade adjustment assistance, which is assistance for workers who might \nbe displaced as a result of the trade bills, especially with regard to \nretraining.\n  The bottom line of these trade bills, then, means real jobs for \nstruggling American workers. If there is any doubt with regard to an \neconomy such as Florida's, there is no question that trade with \nColombia, trade with Panama, trade in our agricultural sector with \nSouth Korea, is in the interests of my State. But this is also in the \ninterests of the economy of the United States.\n  The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates American economic \noutput will grow more from the U.S.-Korea agreement than from the last \nnine trade agreements of the United States combined; just from this one \nagreement with Korea, more economic output than the last nine \nagreements combined. The administration has taken extra steps to obtain \nthese labor protections I talked about and further labor protections in \nthe agreement with Colombia and the necessary tax transparency in the \nagreement with Panama. There is no question that free trade, if it is \ndone right, creates jobs and opportunities. My State, Florida, is the \nlaunching point, the gateway to Latin America. Thousands of jobs in \nFlorida depend on maintaining a vibrant commerce in the economic \nrelations with our trading partners to the south. If we fail to move \nthese agreements with Colombia and Panama, we are going to run the risk \nof losing these jobs.\n  I often say why does Florida reflect the Nation in a lot of our \npolitical mood? It is because the country has moved to Florida. But \nwhat is also reflective of Florida, Florida is increasingly a \nreflection of the Western Hemisphere because of all our ties into \nCentral and South America and the Caribbean.\n  Under these agreements we are going to pass, emerging industries in \nFlorida, such as aerospace, will be able to increase sales abroad while \nwe are going to be able to hire more people here at home. In the \nagricultural sector, our ranchers, our farmers, our growers are going \nto significantly benefit from these agreements. Korea's 54-percent \ntariff on certain citrus products is going to be eliminated immediately \nor reduced to zero over 5 years. Do you know who that helps? It helps a \nspecialty section of citrus called the Indian River region, the region \nthis Senator grew up in, on the banks of the Indian River. The delicacy \nfruit of the world comes from the Indian River region. They are a huge \nexporter of fresh grapefruit, and especially that grapefruit going into \nKorea as a result of this agreement is going to be helpful.\n  The changes will create new export opportunities for the entire \ncitrus industry and the tariffs on Florida beef exports to Korea will \nalso come down. A lot of people do not know--the Presiding Officer \nbeing from New York, people they do not know that New York is a great \nagriculture State. A lot of folks do not know that Florida is not only \nhow they would identify it--citrus--but it is a huge agriculture State. \nA lot of people do not realize how much the beef industry, the ranches \nthis Senator grew up on, are so much a part of our economy, and among \nthe 50 States Florida is a leader among beef ranches. This is all going \nto benefit as a result of this trade agreement with Korea.\n  The Colombia and Panama agreements include important protections to \nprevent Brazil, a major producer of orange juice, from shipping orange \njuice through these other countries to the United States.\n  These trading agreements are important for strategic reasons as well. \nObviously Colombia is a key ally in the region. You have to give credit \nwhere credit is due to the Colombian Government, the previous \ngovernment of President Uribe and the present government, for the close \nworking relationship with the U.S. military, as well as our \nintelligence community. Give credit where credit is due, that the \nGovernment of Colombia pulled off that ruse that helped us bring our \nthree American hostages, who were held by the FARC for years, out of \nthe jungles. South Korea and Panama are strategic partners and share \nregional interests in security and economic stability.\n  With all of these trading partners, we are bound by our commitment to \nfreedom and the rule of law, and these trade agreements are certainly \ngoing to help us solidify our converging aspirations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, it is my understanding we are in \nmorning business and I am allowed 10 minutes; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no restriction on floor \ntime.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Marvelous. Before the Senator from Florida leaves, let \nme say, from the banks of the Indian River to the prairies of Kansas \nand Dodge City, I know many people do not quite grasp the fact that \nthere are a lot of cowboys in Florida. Obviously we have a lot of \ncowboys in Dodge City. From the wheat we want to export to Colombia, \ndespite their trade agreements\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\nwith other countries, and you want to export citrus, beef--the same \nkind of thing--it just shows you from Kansas to Florida, we have \nsimilar interests. I thank the Senator for his comments and for his \ncomments yesterday in the markup in the Finance Committee, and for his \nsupport. A lot of my remarks will be duplicative of his. That shows \nyou, in regard to Florida and Kansas, we have a very strong mutual \ninterest.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. And also in a bipartisan way that we are \nsupporting this. Isn't that a wonderful term to suddenly throw around, \n``bipartisanship,'' where we can come together, not as partisans, not \nas ideologs, but in the best interests of the country?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I share the Senator's views, and I am very hopeful this \nwill not be the last trade agreement we see. I, again, thank him for \nhis comments and his work.\n  Madam President, some of my remarks will be duplicative of those of \nSenator Hatch and those of the Senator from Florida, as I have \nindicated, but on behalf of our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and \nmanufacturers, service providers, I rise today to add my voice to the \nchorus of strong support for passing the pending trade agreements with \nColombia, Panama, and Korea.\n  I will be candid with you. I am not trying to be a ``bad news bear'' \nhere, but I was not all convinced this day would ever come. But after \nlearning that the President was sending the trade agreements to \nCongress, I think the word I thought of in my head was ``finally,'' \nmaybe five ``finallys,'' because it has been 5 years that the U.S. \ntrade agenda has been put on hold and frankly was hostage to demands by \ncertain environmental groups, labor groups, and a rewrite of the trade \nadjustment assistance. But yesterday under the perseverance of the \nchairman, Senator Baucus, and others on the committee, finally the \nSenate Finance Committee did pass the trade agreements.\n  We had a markup. It was amidst protesters. It was not a unique \nsituation, but one that the chairman handled very deftly. I call to the \nattention of Members in regard to their interests in the trade \nagreements, if they have any possible concerns, read the remarks by \nSenator Hatch and by the chairman, by Senator Crapo, Senator Wyden, and \nSenator Kerry--more especially Senator Wyden. He got a little static \nfrom the audience, undeservedly.\n  The good news is, the pending trade agreements add up to $13 billion \nin additional exports and estimated 250,000 jobs.\n  A few big picture highlights: Right now, Korea imposes on average a \n54-percent tariff for ag products. Upon implementation, two-thirds of \ncurrent tariffs are immediately eliminated, with most zeroing out after \na decade. For beef producers--and that is a big thing for Kansas--that \nmeans the 40-percent tariff on beef products will be phased out over 15 \nyears. Around 75 percent of the ag and non-ag exports entering Colombia \nwill be duty free upon implementation of the agreement. Duties on many \nother tariff lines will be phased out over a 5- to 10-year period.\n  For Panama, while reducing import duties is important, the expansion \nof the Panama Canal is not only an important project for U.S. bidders, \nit is geographically key for international commerce and transportation \nand security for the region.\n  But from the agricultural perspective, just for the aggies, the three \npending trade agreements represent $2.5 billion upon full \nimplementation; in regard to exports, more than 22,000 jobs. The Kansas \nFarm Bureau estimates the three agreements in total are expected to \nincrease direct exports by $130 million for Kansas agricultural \nproducers and an additional 1,150 jobs.\n  Finally, these trade agreements will help put American workers and \nexporters on a level playing field with our competitors and hopefully--\na tough job--regain lost market share.\n  Let me emphasize that in the case of two of these agreements, Panama \nand Colombia, under normal conditions their exports already have duty-\nfree access to the U.S. market. The pending agreements merely create a \ntwo-way trade and allow U.S. exporters the same treatment we already \ngrant their countries. It makes one wonder what all the fuss was about. \nThe 5-year fuss and delay hurt us, not them. That is the point I think \neverybody should finally discern.\n  Yet for 5 years, 3 years under this administration, the goalposts \ncontinued to shift and action was delayed indefinitely--2 years under \nthe previous administration, basically with objections by the House of \nRepresentatives. As a consequence, U.S. producers and exporters lost \nmarket share to our competitors.\n  Let me give an example. Over the past 2 years, U.S. wheat producers \nhave already lost market share to Argentina, which receives \npreferential trade treatment based on a regional trade agreement. In \njust 2 years, the U.S. share of the Colombian wheat market dropped by \n30 percent. Including corn and soybeans, the lost market share jumps to \n57 percent.\n  In addition, the largest food processor in Colombia--Nutresa--\nannounced shortly after the Canada-Colombia trade agreement went into \neffect that they were sourcing all of their wheat purchases from \nCanada, accounting for half of all wheat imports. Previously, U.S. \nwheat growers were the largest suppliers of wheat in Colombia.\n  In July, the Korea-European Union trade agreement--not U.S. \nagreement, European Union agreement--went into effect, and within the \nfirst month, according to Korean Customs, European Union exports are up \n34 percent. That is market share going to the European Union, not the \nUnited States. Notably, aerospace equipment increased a whopping 1,693 \npercent. We can see where that is going. Kansas is a major player in \nthe aviation sector. We exported $2.7 billion in transportation \nequipment last year. Considering the European Union agreement, we can \nsee what happens with lost market share.\n  Finally, with regard to the United States and future trade and trade \nin general, the United States must be trusted to stand by its word. \nTrust in our word in trade means everything. The dithering on these \ntrade agreements has not been lost on our trading partners or the world \nat large. It is just not economic growth and job creation we have \ngambled with. All the back and forth and increased demands on our part \ncalls into question our integrity. Is the United States a dependable \npartner and ally?\n  As the former chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am \nquite familiar with who is a friend to the United States and who is \nnot. In the 31 countries and 10 territories that make up the U.S. \nSouthern Command, there is a growing sense of anti-Americanism. \nVenezuela's President, Hugo Chavez, is a perfect example.\n  A decade ago, Colombia was essentially a failed state suffering from \na war waged between the guerilla groups and the paramilitary groups, \nthe FARC and the ELN. Much has changed over 10 years under the \nleadership of then-President Uribe and continued by President Santos--\nan amazing job.\n  U.S. support during this time has helped establish a firm \nrelationship and form a key ally in an increasingly hostile area. So \nstrengthening our economic relationship just makes sense. The \nunjustified delay on our part is not only embarrassing, it has \npotentially damaged our credibility, in my view.\n  As Kansans and the rest of our Nation continue the slow and bumpy \nclimb out of these tough economic times, we must do all we can to \nfoster economic growth. Opening foreign markets to U.S. goods, \nservices, and agriculture is an obvious and long overdue part of the \nsolution. But we can't stop with passing these three trade agreements, \npat ourselves on the back, and call it a day. I assure my colleagues \nthat our foreign competitors are not stopping. In fact, it has been \nreported that there are approximately 100 trade agreements being \nnegotiated right now, give or take, that do not include the United \nStates--100.\n  We, the United States, are negotiating one, initiated in the waning \ndays of the Bush administration--the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. \nThe TPP provides critical access to the ever-growing Asia-Pacific \nregion and has the potential to include other countries later in the \nfuture.\n  While negotiations continue, there will soon come a point when talks \nwill\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\nstall because the U.S. negotiators' hands are tied without the \nprotection of trade promotion authority or fast track, as some refer to \nit. Without TPA, negotiating countries will have little reason to \nnegotiate much less make any difficult concessions until they know the \nUnited States is serious. Fast track provides the substance to these \ntalks.\n  So why is TPA not a priority? I am concerned that as the \nadministration quietly defers on seeking trade promotion authority, \nnegotiators will be unable to negotiate, and trade will take a back \nseat once again. The signal may well be--and I hope this is not true--\nthat these trade agreements will be the last under the current \nadministration.\n  Now, let me get off the ``Bad News Bears'' stuff and the stubborn \nfacts and the 5-year delay. Let me give credit to the President for \nfinally--yes, finally--sending these trade agreements to Congress. But \nlet's not become pacified with the long overdue action. In order to \nstay competitive with our foreign partners, we need to stay in the \ngame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will speak for up to 10 minutes, but I \nwould first defer to the Senator from Michigan for a unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I ask unanimous \nconsent that immediately after Senator Vitter has completed his \nstatement I be recognized for up to 30 minutes, and that I may yield \ntime during that 30-minute period to Senators on this side as we \ncontrol the 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, today is the 1-year anniversary of \nPresident Obama and Secretary of Interior Salazar finally lifting the \nformal moratorium on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico following the BP \ndisaster. But simply lifting the moratorium did not solve the problem. \nI return to the Senate floor today to again say that still, a year \nlater, that problem is not solved because there is a continuing permit \nlogjam.\n  It started with a de facto moratorium. Now there has just been a \ntrickle of permits, and there is a continuing permit logjam that has \ndramatically shut down and slowed energy activity in the Gulf of \nMexico. That must change.\n  Of course, this is vitally important for my State of Louisiana and \nthe livelihoods of tens of thousands of my citizens. That must change \nfor the good of the country as well, for our economic well-being and to \nincrease our revenues to address deficit and debt.\n  As we talk about jobs and various jobs bills and jobs proposals, we \nmust focus on the domestic energy sector, and we must change the \nsituation. We must reverse this virtual shutdown of the gulf for the \ngood of the country, and I hope we do that.\n  To that end, I joined Congressman Jeff Landry yesterday in a meeting \nwith Obama Director Michael Bromwich and other high-ranking \nadministration officials who have to do with this very permitting and \nleasing process. We wanted to sit down with these officials in the \nObama administration to again make this very point. The formal \nmoratorium was lifted a year ago, but the problem persists, and we need \nto do better. We need to issue permits at a much more healthy pace. We \nneed to get that important domestic energy activity back up and running \nin the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n  Recently, there was an independent study by HIS Global Insight which \nput some hard numbers on this situation. That study said leasing in the \nGulf of Mexico is down about 65 percent from pre-formal moratorium \nlevels. It also pointed out that the waiting line of people and \ncompanies to get permits has almost doubled. It has increased 90 \npercent.\n  So what does that mean? That means far less activity in the gulf, far \nless energy activity for the country, and far fewer jobs--jobs we need \nnow more than ever in this horrible economy.\n  Let me give some other relevant numbers. As of the end of September--\njust a few weeks ago--there were 21 floating rigs in the Gulf of \nMexico, of which about 18 are currently drilling wells. That compares, \npremoratorium, to 33 floating rigs with 29 drilling wells at that time. \nThat is a 37-percent drop in both the number of rigs and those \ndrilling.\n  Since the moratorium began, 11 rigs have left the Gulf of Mexico. \nOnly one of these has returned. In addition, three more are sitting \nidle. Seven of these rigs have left to go to African countries, \nincluding Egypt, Nigeria, Liberia, and the Republic of Congo. Three \nhave gone to South America, mostly to Brazil and French Guiana; and the \nremaining rig was mobilized to Vietnam. This all translates to about 60 \nwells lost based on the original contract terms for these rigs.\n  The loss of these rigs isn't just loss of equipment; it is loss of \nimportant energy and economic activity, and it is loss of jobs. It is \nlost spending of $6.3 billion and an annual loss of direct employment \nof 11,500 jobs over just 2 years. When we look at indirect employment, \nit is a multiplier that brings that lost job figure to way more than \nthat.\n  Again, it started with the formal moratorium. The formal moratorium \nwas lifted 1 year ago today, but the problem persists because there was \na de facto moratorium, and there is still a permit logjam.\n  Another example of this enormous problem isn't just permitting. \nAnother example is lease activity by the administration. Again, that is \ncompletely separate and apart from permitting. But the dramatic decline \nin lease sales, lease activity that the administration is putting out, \nshows the same problem mindset. What do I mean?\n  Well, in the last fiscal year, the administration had no new lease \nactivity--zero, nothing, nada. What that means is--just a few years ago \nthe income to the Federal Government from lease sales was almost $10 \nbillion, and that has fallen like a rock through the floor and is now \nzero. That is another indicator of a problem mindset in this \nadministration, leading to a dramatic economic slowdown. We need to \nreverse this. We need to do better for the economy, for jobs, and for \nthat important revenue it brings to the Federal Government which could \nlower deficit and debt.\n  So as we talk about the need to create good American jobs, as we also \ntalk about the need to grapple with our deficit and debt situation and \ndramatically lower deficit and debt, as we talk about the need for \nrevenue to be part of that picture, domestic energy has to be part of \nthe solution, and it can be a big and productive part of the solution \nto both of those huge problems--the need to create good American jobs \nand the need to lower deficit and debt. If we aggressively pursue \ndomestic energy production, starting in the gulf, fully reopening the \ngulf, getting the permit process to a pace at least equal to pre-formal \nmoratorium levels, get lease activity back online, and then expand to \nother areas of our resources off the Atlantic, Pacific, offshore \nAlaska--we have enormous resources that are now off-limits to energy \nproduction--if we do that, we can grow jobs, we can grow Federal \nrevenue and lessen deficit and debt, and we can help attack both of \nthose major economic problems for the country.\n  Again, yesterday, I met, along with Congressman Landry, with Director \nBromwich to make those points, to give specific examples of what we can \nbe doing to go down that path in favor of good American jobs and \nlowering the deficit and debt. I hope it made a difference. Ultimately, \nonly time will tell. But this needs to be part of our overall economic \napproach. This needs to be part of our deficit and debt reduction \napproach, and it can make a major contribution to solving both of these \nproblems.\n\n  I hope in a bipartisan way we will do that, and urge that in the \nSenate, and the administration will break through the negative mindset \nthey have had for several years and do that in an aggressive way. Our \ncountry needs it. Our workers need it. We need it as taxpayers to lower \nthe deficit and debt, and this would be a very productive way forward.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           American Jobs Act\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, more than 14 million Americans are \nwithout work. The American Jobs Act would help up to 2 million \nAmericans get work or keep their jobs. It would prevent the layoffs of \nhundreds of thousands of teachers, police, firefighters, and other \nfirst responders. The jobs bill would give tax cuts to millions of \nsmall businesses. It would give incentives to those businesses to hire \nnew workers. The American Jobs Act would provide a payroll tax cut to \nmillions of American families. It would help our returning veterans \nfind jobs. The American Jobs Act would put thousands of construction \nworkers on the job repairing crumbling schools, building and repairing \nroads and bridges.\n  The chief economist for Moody's, Mark Zandi, estimates that this \nlegislation would add 2 percentage points to economic growth and would \nreduce the unemployment rate by up to 1 full percentage point. \nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg believe this bill ``would help avoid a \nreturn to recession.'' Those are their words. That is what the majority \nof our economists say from both sides of the aisle, across the \npolitical spectrum.\n  How does it do this? The bill uses ideas that both Democrats and \nRepublicans have supported in the past. It would not add a dime to the \nFederal deficit, and its provisions are overwhelmingly popular with the \nAmerican people, according to all of the public opinion polls.\n  We should be debating this bill. We should be offering amendments, as \nthe majority leader said we would be doing. We should be improving it. \nWe should be preparing to vote on it so millions of American working \nfamilies can get the relief they need. We should do this so we can \ndemonstrate to our constituents and to the world that we will come \ntogether to act in the face of crisis. Yet here we are roadblocked \nagain. Why are we roadblocked? Because our Republican colleagues last \nnight voted not to allow us to even begin to debate legislation that \nhas ideas so many of them have supported in the past.\n  Senate Republicans are once again walking down the filibuster road. \nThe vote last night was not a vote on the American Jobs Act. Because \nthe filibuster rules of the Senate require 60 votes, Senate Republicans \nlast night were able to prevent the Senate from proceeding to a bill \naddressing the jobs crisis. We all know the rules of the Senate give \nthe minority the power to stop us from holding this debate, but \nexercising that power, as they did last night, is profoundly mistaken. \nWhat they are doing when they do that is they are using a filibuster to \nprevent the Senate from even debating this bill. What that does in turn \nis elevate partisan interests over the good of the country.\n  A number of us are going to be speaking today because we are deeply \nconcerned--concerned that Republicans once again have signaled to an \nanxious and skeptical nation that we cannot address a great challenge \nof the day. We are deeply concerned that the single most important need \nin this country--jobs--will not be debated and remedies will not be \nsought because the Republicans once again are walking down the \nfilibuster road.\n\n  If Republicans oppose this bill, which is their right, vote against \nit. Better yet, if Republicans oppose this approach, for heaven's sake, \noffer an alternative jobs bill, offer a substitute, an alternative, \nsomething where the American public can compare what is in our jobs \nbill with what Republicans presumably favor. They oppose ours without \nsaying what they favor, except vague references to less regulation. \nEverybody is in favor of eliminating wasteful regulations, but nobody \nbelieves you can do serious deficit reduction or create serious numbers \nof jobs by just freezing regulation.\n  By the way, the small business community does not believe that. The \nsurveys which were taken of small businesspeople by their own \norganizations say the biggest problem small business has is not \nregulation, and it is not taxes; it is a lack of demand. This bill \nhelps to create demand by putting dollars into the pockets of our \nworkers. There is a tax cut here which is very important to help \nstimulate that demand.\n  So what is coming across to the American public loudly and clearly \nthese days is that the Democrats here in the Senate have an \nalternative. The Republicans are filibustering that alternative without \noffering one of their own. Now, the majority could seek to break this \nfilibuster by forcing the Republicans to sustain the filibuster and to \ntry to wear them down. That process, however, at this time in this \nCongress is not a practical approach because it takes weeks or even \nmonths to break a filibuster. It is just simply too late in the session \nfor us to practically be able to do that. And, by the way, the American \npeople should not have to wait that long in any event for us to act.\n  But there is another way to overcome a filibuster. It is not just \nforcing the filibusterers to filibuster--that is one way to do it; it \ntakes usually months in order to succeed, but it would dramatize where \nthe obstruction is--but the other way to overcome a filibuster is for \npublic opinion to wear down the Republican wall of obstruction. That is \nprobably the only practical path available for overcoming this \nfilibuster at this time of this Congress.\n  I hope the President will use his bully pulpit to make clear to the \nAmerican people that it is the obstructionism of filibustering \nRepublicans that prevents us from taking action on a jobs bill. The \nPresident has very effectively gone around the country supporting his \njobs bill. I commend him for doing that. But what we need him now to do \nis to take that bully pulpit, which is unique to the President and to \nthe Presidency, and use that bully pulpit to make it clear to the \nAmerican people that filibustering Republicans are obstructing us from \neven taking up a jobs bill.\n  The majority leader has made it clear that this is open to amendment. \nIf the Republicans have a better idea, they can offer a substitute. But \nwhat is going on here now is that, without any alternative of their \nown, they are preventing us from addressing the major issue of this \ncountry.\n  The Republican leader last night repeatedly asked unanimous consent \nto send this bill back to the calendar if we did not get 60 votes to \nproceed. The Republican leader wants this bill to go away. Well, this \njobs bill is not going to go away. It should not go away. And the \nRepublican leader is engaging in wishful thinking if he believes that \nbecause he and his colleagues on that side of the aisle are \nfilibustering a jobs bill, that means the filibuster is going to \nsucceed and this bill is simply going to be returned to the calendar.\n  The majority leader has said he is going to try again. Senator Reid \nsaid specifically he is going to bring this bill back again by using \nhis rights, after he made it clear last night he is going to reconsider \nthis bill. He has the right to do that because of the way in which he \nvoted last night. He voted with the prevailing side at the end in order \nthat he could reconsider this bill--a technical way that he could. He \nalready had expressed his view very strongly supporting cloture, but he \nalso, in order to bring this bill back under the same cloture motion, \nthen filed a motion to reconsider as a Member of the prevailing side at \nthe end, after he switched his vote so he could do so.\n  I commend the majority leader. I commend him for taking that action. \nI commend him for signaling to the American people, to the media, to \nour colleagues on both sides of the aisle that he is going to try \nagain. We are not simply going to fold our tent and go away. The \nmajority leader is going to move to reconsider at a time he believes is \nappropriate, and then there will be another effort to break a \nRepublican filibuster so we can at least debate this critically \nimportant legislation.\n  Madam President, I am going to read from an analysis on the jobs plan \nby Mark Zandi that I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record. \nMark Zandi is an economist at Moody's.\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\n                   [From Economy.com, Sept. 9, 2011]\n\n                   An Analysis of the Obama Jobs Plan\n\n                            (By Mark Zandi)\n\n       President Obama's jobs proposal would help stabilize \n     confidence and keep the U.S. from sliding back into \n     recession.\n       The plan would add 2 percentage points to GDP growth next \n     year, add 1.9 million jobs, and cut the unemployment rate by \n     a percentage point.\n       The plan would cost abut $450 billion, about $250 billion \n     in tax cuts and $200 billion in spending increases.\n       Many of the president's proposals are unlikely to pass \n     Congress, but the most important have a chance of winning \n     bipartisan support.\n       President Obama's much-anticipated jobs plan is a laudable \n     effort to support the struggling economy. The plan would go a \n     long way toward stabilizing confidence, forestalling another \n     recession, and jump-starting a self-sustaining economic \n     expansion. If fully implemented, the Obama jobs plan would \n     increase real GDP growth in 2012 by 2 percentage points, add \n     1.9 million jobs, and reduce the unemployment rate by a full \n     percentage point, compared with current fiscal policy.\n       The president's plan includes a wide range of temporary tax \n     cuts and spending increases. Among its widely anticipated \n     provisions are one-year extensions of this year's employee \n     payroll tax holiday and the full expensing of business \n     investment. Surprisingly, the plan would also increase the \n     size of the temporary payroll tax cut and creatively expand \n     it to employers. The president would also help state and \n     local governments pay teacher and first-responder salaries, \n     boost funding for unemployment insurance while meaningfully \n     reforming the Ul system, and launch several infrastructure \n     initiatives.\n       The plan has its drawbacks. It isn't cheap, costing \n     taxpayers an estimated $450 billion. Of that, approximately \n     $250 billion takes the form of tax cuts, while another $200 \n     billion comes through spending increases. The president \n     proposes paying for his plan with additional deficit \n     reduction beginning in fiscal 2014, but he does not \n     explicitly say how this is to be accomplished. The plan also \n     results in weaker growth in 2013, as most of the tax cuts and \n     spending increases are temporary and fade during the year. \n     Presumably the economy will be strong enough to handle it by \n     then, but that is far from certain. Moreover, the plan fails \n     to address the ongoing foreclosure crisis and housing slump, \n     major impediments to the recovery.\n       In the current political environment, it is less than \n     likely that most of the president's plan will pass Congress. \n     Our current baseline outlook assumes that the payroll tax \n     holiday for employees is extended for only one more year. \n     There is a fighting chance that broader payroll tax cuts for \n     employees and employers could become law, but the odds aren't \n     high enough at this time to change our baseline assumptions.\n\n\n                      Why more support is critical\n\n       There are compelling reasons why the Obama administration \n     and Congress should provide more fiscal support to the \n     economy. Most obviously, the U.S. is struggling to avoid \n     recession as confidence flags. To complicate matters, federal \n     fiscal policy is quickly becoming a significant drag on \n     growth; state and local governments are already a weight. The \n     Federal Reserve has resumed easing monetary policy, but with \n     interest rates near zero, the Fed cannot lift the economy by \n     itself. Moreover, with the government's borrowing costs as \n     low as they have ever been and no indication that public \n     borrowing is crowding out private activity, there is ample \n     room to fund more near-term fiscal support, particularly if \n     it is paid for with additional long-term deficit reduction.\n       The U.S. economy is on the cusp of another recession. \n     Businesses have stopped hiring and households are spending \n     more tentatively. Bankers are re-evaluating whether it makes \n     sense to continue easing credit standards and wondering if \n     instead they should be battening down the hatches again. \n     Declining stock prices and widening credit spreads suggest \n     investors are also losing faith.\n\n\n                          Crisis of confidence\n\n       Recession risks are uncomfortably high largely because \n     confidence is low. The economy has fundamental problems, \n     including the foreclosure crisis, a surfeit of residential \n     and commercial real estate, and yawning government deficits. \n     But even more serious is that investors, consumers and \n     businesses appear shell-shocked by recent events.\n       Confidence normally reflects economic conditions; it does \n     not shape them. Consumer sentiment falls when unemployment, \n     gasoline prices or inflation rises, but this has little \n     impact on consumer spending. Yet at times, particularly \n     during economic turning points, cause and effect can shift. \n     Sentiment can be so harmed that businesses, consumers and \n     investors freeze up, turning a gloomy outlook into a self-\n     fulfilling prophecy. This is one of those times.\n       The collective psyche was already very fragile coming out \n     of the Great Recession. The dramatic loss of millions of jobs \n     and double-digit unemployment have been extraordinarily \n     difficult to bear. Businesses have also struggled with a \n     flood of major policy initiatives from Washington, led by \n     healthcare and financial regulatory reform. The lengthy \n     political battle over raising the nation's debt ceiling and \n     Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. debt eviscerated what \n     confidence remained. While the loss of S's AAA rating has \n     little real significance--Treasury yields have fallen since \n     the downgrade--it unnerved investors, judging by the plunge \n     in stock prices. Consumer and small-business confidence \n     gauges are as low as they have been since the Great \n     Recession.\n       Consumers and businesses appear frozen in place. They are \n     not yet pulling back--that would mean recession--but a loss \n     of faith in the economy can quickly become self-fulfilling. \n     Whether the current crisis of confidence produces a double-\n     dip recession depends critically on how policymakers respond. \n     Washington must act aggressively to stabilize sentiment and \n     lift flagging expectations.\n       If no changes are made to current federal fiscal policy, \n     the economic impact of that policy will shift from acting as \n     a small drag this year to subtracting 1.7 percentage points \n     from real GDP growth in 2012. For context, at the peak of the \n     federal fiscal stimulus in 2009, federal policy added 2.6 \n     percentage points to real GDP growth. Yet as the impact of \n     federal policy shifts from a stimulus to restraint, the \n     private sector must grow faster for the economy to simply \n     grow at its potential. In 2012 that potential is estimated at \n     2.7%; to reach it, private sector GDP would need to grow well \n     above 4%. That seems unlikely given the weak pace of \n     recovery.\n       The biggest drag next year under current federal policy \n     comes from the scheduled expiration of two stimulus measures \n     at the end of 2011: the current 2% employee payroll tax \n     holiday and the emergency unemployment insurance program. Not \n     extending the programs will shave 0.9 percentage point off \n     2012 real GDP growth and cost the economy some 750,000 jobs. \n     The end of other fiscal stimulus measures enacted in 2009 \n     will further reduce economic growth.\n       State and local government actions are already producing \n     serious drags on the economy. Spending cuts and tax increases \n     will shave an estimated 0.5 percentage point from real GDP \n     growth this year and almost as much in 2012. The impact can \n     be seen clearly in the job market. State and local \n     governments have cut close to 700,000 jobs since their \n     employment peaked three years ago and are continuing to shed \n     workers at a stunning rate, averaging nearly 40,000 per \n     month. Many of those losing their jobs are middle-income \n     teachers, police, and other first responders.\n       The need for more federal fiscal support is increasing as \n     the Federal Reserve's ability to respond to the weak economy \n     diminishes. The Fed recently took a bold step by stating its \n     intention to keep short-term interest rates near zero until \n     mid-2013. This has brought down long-term interest rates and \n     provided some support to stock prices. The Fed can provide \n     even more help by extending the maturity of the Treasury \n     bonds it owns and by purchasing more long-term bonds through \n     another round of quantitative easing. But these ideas are not \n     without problems, chiefly that they are becoming less \n     effective in stimulating the economy.\n\n\n                       The Fed can't do it alone\n\n       Acknowledging this in his recent Jackson Hole speech, Fed \n     Chairman Ben Bernanke focused attention on fiscal \n     policymakers. Bernanke explained that Congress and the Obama \n     administration must follow through on plans for long-term \n     deficit reduction but also must provide additional near-term \n     support to the economy. Monetary policy alone may not be able \n     to prevent another recession.\n       Additional fiscal help for the economy wouldn't be \n     desirable or even possible if the federal government's debt \n     costs were rising or if government borrowing were tightening \n     credit for households and businesses. But there is no \n     evidence that such crowding out is occurring. Ten-year \n     Treasury yields have fallen below 2%, a near record. This is \n     in part because of the Fed's actions, but the U.S. also \n     remains the global economy's safe haven. Whenever there is a \n     problem anywhere, the investment of choice is a Treasury \n     bond--witness the current flight to Treasuries sparked by \n     financial turmoil in Europe. Borrowing costs for households \n     and businesses also remain extraordinarily low, with fixed \n     mortgage rates closing in on a record low of 4% and Baa \n     corporate bond yields (the lowest investment grade) nearing a \n     50-year low below 5.5%.\n\n\n                    Assessing the plan's components\n\n       The president's jobs plan includes a wide range of \n     temporary tax cuts and spending increases. The plan would \n     cost close to $450 billion over 10 years, with slightly more \n     than $250 billion coming from tax cuts and $200 billion from \n     spending increases. For context, the plan's cost is equal to \n     about 3% of current GDP and just over half the $825 billion \n     ultimate price tag for the 2009 Recovery Act.\n       The largest tax cuts include an extension and expansion of \n     the payroll tax holiday for employees and a creative new \n     payroll tax holiday for employers. Employers would be able to \n     cut their payroll taxes in half on up to $5 million in \n     taxable wages annually. Small businesses, many of whom are \n     cash-strapped, would enjoy a sizable albeit temporary boost \n     in their cashflow. Businesses will also pay no additional \n     taxes on any wages that rise from the year before, up to $50 \n     million. This would give firms a substantive incentive to \n     increase hiring and should result in a larger economic bang \n     for the buck--additional GDP per tax dollar--than previous \n     job tax credits such as last year's HIRE Act.\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\n       The president has also proposed a tax credit for businesses \n     that hire people unemployed longer than six months--a group \n     that, astonishingly, includes half the jobless. The longer \n     these workers remain unemployed, the harder finding work \n     becomes as their skills and marketability erode. Structural \n     unemployment thus rises as a long-term threat; it appears to \n     have already risen from around 5% before the Great Recession \n     to closer to 5.5% currently.\n\n\n                   Doing infrastructure the right way\n\n       The Obama plan's most significant spending increases, \n     totaling more than $100 billion, are for infrastructure. Such \n     development has a large bang for the buck, particularly now, \n     when there are so many unemployed construction workers. It \n     can also help remote and hard-pressed regional economies and \n     produces long-lasting economic benefits. Such projects are \n     difficult to start quickly--``shovel ready'' is in most cases \n     a misnomer--but since unemployment is sure to be a problem \n     for years, this does not seem a significant drawback in the \n     current context.\n       More serious concerns are the expense of infrastructure \n     projects and their often political rather than economic \n     motivation. A creative way to address these concerns is \n     through an infrastructure bank--a government entity with a \n     federal endowment, able to provide loans and guarantees to \n     jump-start private projects. These might include toll roads \n     or user-supported energy facilities or airports. Private \n     investors and developers would determine which projects to \n     pursue based on what works financially rather than \n     politically. The infrastructure bank would take time to \n     launch, however, and thus would not produce quick benefits.\n\n\n                     Unemployment insurance reforms\n\n       The president also proposes more funding for unemployment \n     insurance, but in combination with some much-needed reforms \n     to the UI system. One idea involves scaling up a Georgia \n     program that places unemployed workers at companies \n     voluntarily for up to eight weeks at no charge to the \n     businesses. Along with their unemployment benefits, workers \n     receive a small stipend for transportation and other \n     expenses, training, and a tryout with the employer that could \n     lead to a permanent job. Employers can potentially abuse the \n     program by recycling unemployed workers, but the program \n     seems to have had some success since it began in 2003.\n       Another idea to reform UI is to more broadly adopt ``work \n     share'' as an alternative to temporary layoffs and furloughs. \n     Instead of laying off workers in response to a temporary \n     slowdown in demand, employers reduce workers' hours and wages \n     across a department, business unit, or the entire company. \n     The government then provides partial unemployment insurance \n     benefits to make up for a portion of the lost wages. Work \n     share exists in 17 states and several countries overseas, \n     including Germany, where it is credited for contributing to a \n     relatively strong recovery.\n\n\n                        Saving vital public jobs\n\n       Like the temporary extension of unemployment insurance \n     benefits, work share has a large bang for the buck, since \n     distressed workers are likely to quickly spend any aid they \n     receive. Work share's economic effectiveness even exceeds \n     that of straight UI benefits, because it reduces both the \n     financial and psychological costs of layoffs. Work share can \n     particularly help firms that expect reductions to be \n     temporary, by reducing their costs for severance, rehiring \n     and training.\n       Hard-pressed state and local governments would also receive \n     additional relief under the president's plan. While state \n     governments appear to be working through their near-term \n     budget problems, local governments are still struggling with \n     flagging property tax revenues. The biggest casualties are \n     teachers and first responders, and Obama's plan would help \n     with their salaries through the end of the 2013 school year.\n\n\n                     From a headwind to a tailwind\n\n       The president's plan would provide a meaningful boost to \n     the economy and job market in 2012. Compared with current \n     fiscal policy, the plan adds 2 percentage points to real GDP \n     growth, adds 1.9 million payroll jobs, and reduces \n     unemployment by a percentage point. Federal fiscal policy \n     would go from being a powerful headwind next year to a modest \n     tailwind.\n       Of the 1.9 million jobs added in 2012 under the president's \n     plan, the largest contributor would be the extended payroll \n     tax holiday for employees, which adds approximately 750,000 \n     jobs. The payroll tax holiday for employers is responsible \n     for adding 300,000 jobs, although this may be understated; \n     quantifying the impact of this proposal is difficult. \n     Infrastructure spending adds 400,000 jobs--275,000 jobs are \n     due to additional unemployment insurance funding and 135,000 \n     jobs result from more aid to state and local governments.\n       One potential pitfall of the president's plan is that the \n     boost to growth and jobs fades quickly in 2013. Additional \n     infrastructure spending and aid to state and local \n     governments continue to support growth, but the benefits of \n     the tax cuts peter out. The hopeful assumption is that the \n     private sector will be able to hold up as government support \n     abates. While reasonable, it is important to acknowledge that \n     policymakers hoped for the same thing last year when they \n     passed the one-year payroll tax holiday and extended \n     emergency unemployment insurance through 2011.\n\n\n                     Also needed: Help for housing\n\n       The president's plan is large, but in some key respects it \n     is not complete. Most notably, it does not directly address \n     the foreclosure crisis and housing slump, save for some added \n     funding for neighborhood stabilization. The President did \n     mention in his speech that he would be working with the FHFA \n     (Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's regulator) to facilitate more \n     mortgage refinancing; this would be a significant plus for \n     housing and the broader economy if he is able to break the \n     logjam in refinancing activity.\n       With some 3.5 million first-mortgage loans in or near \n     foreclosure and more house price declines likely, it is hard \n     to be enthusiastic about the recovery's prospects. A house is \n     most Americans' most important asset; many small-business \n     owners use their homes as collateral for business credit, and \n     local governments rely on property tax revenues tied to \n     housing values.\n       Most worrisome is the risk that housing will resume the \n     vicious cycle seen at the depths of the last recession, when \n     falling prices pushed more homeowners under water--their \n     loans exceeded their homes' market values--causing more \n     defaults, more distress sales, and even lower prices. That \n     cycle was broken only by unprecedented monetary and fiscal \n     policy support.\n\n\n                            Other criticisms\n\n       The president's plan will be criticized for many other \n     reasons. Some will argue that he should have proposed massive \n     public works, like the Depression-era WPA. Others will say \n     the plan should have included broader reforms to corporate \n     taxes or even immigration. While these suggestions may have \n     merit as policies, they seem like steps too far given what \n     lawmakers need to do and how quickly they need to do it.\n       Given the current political environment, it is unlikely \n     that much of what the president has proposed will become law, \n     but nearly all the proposals have some bipartisan support. An \n     extension of the current payroll tax holiday for employees \n     seems most likely to pass and is included in the Moody's \n     Analytics baseline economic outlook. The proposed expansion \n     of the employee tax holiday and the new payroll tax holiday \n     for employers are also possible. The president's spending \n     initiatives, while worthwhile, seem like longer shots.\n\n\n                     Policymakers need to work fast\n\n       The risk of a new economic downturn is as high as it has \n     been since the Great Recession ended more than two years ago. \n     A string of unfortunate shocks and a crisis of confidence are \n     to blame. Surging gasoline and food prices and fallout from \n     the Japanese earthquake hurt badly in the spring; more \n     recently, the debt-ceiling drama, a revived European debt \n     crisis, and the S downgrade have been especially \n     disconcerting. Confidence, already fragile after the \n     nightmare of the Great Recession and Washington's heated \n     policy debates, was severely undermined.\n       Whether the loss of faith in our economy results in another \n     recession critically depends on how policymakers respond. \n     Whether they will succeed in shoring up confidence is a \n     difficult call. The odds of a renewed recession over the next \n     12 months are 40%, and they could go higher given the current \n     turmoil in financial markets. The old adage that the stock \n     market has predicted nine of the last five recessions is apt, \n     but the recent free fall is disconcerting. Markets and the \n     economy seem one shock away from dangerously unraveling. \n     Policymakers must work quickly and decisively.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is what Mark Zandi said about the President's job \nproposal:\n\n       [It] would help stabilize confidence and keep the U.S. from \n     sliding back into recession.\n       [It] would add 2 percentage points to GDP growth next year, \n     add 1.9 million jobs, and cut the unemployment rate by a \n     percentage point.\n       The plan would cost about $450 billion, about $250 billion \n     in tax cuts and $200 billion in spending increases.\n       Many of the president's proposals [may be] unlikely to pass \n     Congress, but the most important have a chance of winning \n     bipartisan support.\n\n  They deserve bipartisan support. Again, most of these proposals have \nbeen made by Republicans, not just by Democrats. But even if we cannot \nget the Republicans to support the proposal--because at least on the \nspending side it is the President's proposal; on the revenue side, it \nis now a Democratic Senate proposal in terms of the millionaires' \nsurcharge--but if the Republicans will not vote for it, if they will \nnot offer a substitute, an alternative of their own, if they will not \nseek to amend it to improve it, for heaven's sake, allow us to take up \nthis bill.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I say thank you to Senator Levin.\n  Yes, I try to explain this. I was on some radio calls this morning \nwith stations in Dayton and Cincinnati and all over the State, and the \nquestions they\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\nasked were just that: Wait a minute, OK, I understand people being \nagainst a proposal, but why would the leader of one political party say \nabout a jobs bill--when unemployment is this high in the Senator's \nState and my State and millions and millions of Americans want jobs and \ncannot find them--why would they say: Let's not even put it on the \nfloor for discussion.\n  The rules of this place are peculiar, obviously, but why would you \nsay: I am not even willing to bring it up for a vote. I am not even \nwilling to debate it. I am not even willing to set the stage so we can \ndiscuss it.\n  People do not want to hear about process. I understand that. But \npeople do want us to do something about jobs. The first step is, you \nhave a debate--you bring the bill forward, you have a debate, you offer \namendments, and then you come up with something.\n  Last night, as you recall, I say to Senator Levin, right before the \njobs bill vote, we had a huge bipartisan vote, with 63 votes for the \nChina currency bill. To do what? I know the Senator has advocated for \nyears that we have a level playing field in our dealings with China so \nthat so many Chinese companies do not get an advantage selling here and \nso that so many Michigan and Ohio companies do not get a disadvantage--\na currency tax; a tariff, if you will--when our companies in Michigan \nand Ohio try to sell into China.\n  So I guess I am curious as to the Senator's thoughts on why we would \nnot even set up ourselves--why Republicans would not want to at least \ncome together and say, let's debate it. Then maybe we can make some \ninteresting amendments we can come together on, like we came together \nbipartisanly just 24 hours ago--less than that--fewer than 24 hours \nago, to come up with a real jobs bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wish there was an explanation which was satisfactory or \nan answer which was satisfactory to Senator Brown's question. I am \nafraid the only answer I can come up with is because this started off \nas President Obama's job bill. It has been changed. Now we have a \ndifferent source of funding for it. We have a millionaire's surcharge \nin there which will fund these critically important programs, these \njob-creation programs.\n  I cannot think of any other reason, other than they think it will \nsimply go away. What is an explanation? Maybe it was in the unanimous \nconsent request of the Republican leader last night: I ask unanimous \nconsent that this bill not be amendable--no amendments would be in \norder under his unanimous consent proposal--and then when it does not \nget 60 votes, which he knew it would not get, that it be immediately \nreturned to the calendar.\n  That is what he asked twice last night--immediately be returned to \nthe calendar. The Republican leader wants this bill to go away. It \ncannot go away. It should not go away. It will not go away. The \nmajority leader has already said he is going to move to reconsider the \nvote last night. I expressed the hope, in my remarks, that the \nPresident use his bully pulpit not just to support the jobs bill, which \nis critically important--he is doing a good job as he goes around the \ncountry--but to make it clear where the obstruction is; that the \nRepublicans will not allow us to consider a jobs bill, amend it if they \nwant to try, substitute their own if they have one, which so far they \ndo not. But let us debate this bill. I hope the bully pulpit of the \nPresident is used, not just to support a jobs bill, which is so \ncritically important, but to point out where the obstruction is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to join Chairman Levin in his plea \nthat we be allowed to consider this legislation. The greatest crisis we \nface in the United States, for families all across the country, is \njobs. The President has proposed a bill that is going to help us begin \nto deal with that job crisis, and he proposed a way to pay for it. An \noverwhelming portion of the country, the polling is definite, supports \nthe President's proposal and our proposal, as modified by Senator Reid, \nto have a surcharge on individuals making over $1 million.\n  So we have a bill that responds to the greatest need, that is paid \nfor by doing what the American people overwhelmingly want us to do, and \nwe cannot get it on the floor for debate, for amendment, and finally \nfor passage. We are not able to respond to this crisis because we have \nbeen frustrated by our colleagues who refuse to let us take up the \nbill. The American people are demanding we act--the message is being \nsent far and wide in many different mediums--and we get it directly \nfrom home, and it is: Do something. It might not be perfect. It might \nnot solve the problem immediately. But do something. Do not just stop \ndebate, stop progress, stop discussion on the issues that are so \ncritical to this country.\n  Again, we are in a serious jobs crisis. We have seen the latest job \nreport showing some sort of improvement but not enough, and we have to \ndo more. If we do not pass the American Jobs Act, then we are going to \nbe in a situation where--and this is one of the great ironies--the \ndeficit will get worse, not better. One of the most direct ways to \nbegin to deal with the deficit is to put people to work so they can \nresume their participation in the economic life of this country and \ncontribute not only to their own well-being and that of their family \nbut the growth of the country, and the robustness of our economy. In \nthat way, we can address the deficit.\n  So this refusal to act does not even serve the goal of deficit \nreduction. Again, I wish to emphasize this: We have a bill that has \nmeasures in it that are proven, that are bipartisan, that will put \npeople to work, and that are fully paid for by a tax that is \noverwhelmingly supported by the American people. If we do not act, the \njobs crisis and our deficit will persist.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Michigan \nfor bringing us together and making the point, as clearly as we can \nmake it, that last night we had a chance to launch maybe the most \nimportant single issue in debate that we can consider in the Senate. We \nhad a chance to bring both parties to the floor of the Senate and ask \nfor the best ideas each of us has to move the economy forward.\n  The President has a plan. I think it is a good one. I support the \nplan. I think it is a reasonable way to move this economy forward and \nput people to work. But it is the nature of the legislative process \nthat some will disagree with one aspect of it, some with others, and \nMembers may have their own ideas to bring to the floor. That is what \nthis branch of government is all about, that we have this debate, an \nopen debate, Democrats and Republicans on the floor, and at the end of \nthe day vote on something to move forward with together.\n  But last night not one single Republican Senator would join us in an \neffort to bring this matter to a debate on the floor. In fact, the \nSenator from Michigan has made the point over and over that the \nRepublican filibuster requiring 60 votes to break the filibuster is \nstopping the majority from acting in the Senate on the issue of \ncreating jobs--a Republican filibuster. That is problematic. It is \ntroublesome. It is frustrating.\n  Because I am sure in Michigan, where they have been wracked for years \nnow with unemployment and businesses struggling--we have similar \nproblems in Illinois, 14 million Americans unemployed across the board. \nTake a look at what the Senator from Kentucky comes and tells us every \nday as Republican leader. He tells us that one of the big problems with \nthis bill, as he sees it, is it is paid for. He does not like the fact \nthat President Obama has paid for it and certainly does not like the \nway he paid for it. The way he paid for it is to impose a surtax of 5.6 \npercent on people making more than $1 million a year. That generates \nenough revenue, over a 10-year period of time, that we can give a \npayroll tax cut to working families across America, and we can provide \ntax incentives for businesses to hire unemployed veterans and people \nwho have been out of work for a long time.\n  The money generated from that millionaire's tax is going to end up \nallowing us to save, in my State, 14,000 teacher, firefighter, and \npolicemen jobs that otherwise would be lost. It will allow us to put \nmoney into modernizing our schools--which we need to do\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\nin Illinois and across the country, in Minnesota, Michigan, in Montana \nand every State and to build the basic infrastructure that America \nneeds to be successful. Senator McConnell has said over and over, he \nwill not agree to this tax hike.\n  Let's take a look at what middle-income Americans are paying as an \neffective Federal tax rate as opposed to the wealthiest in America, the \npoint made over and over by President Obama and a point worth repeating \ntoday. Middle-class families in America, people making between $50,000 \nand $75,000 a year have an effective Federal tax rate of 14.9 percent. \nThe wealthiest 1 percent, those making over $1 million a year, their \neffective Federal tax rate, 12 percent; 14.9 percent for middle-class \nfamilies, working families; 12 percent for the wealthiest. What is \nwrong with this picture? What is wrong with it is that working families \nacross America struggle paycheck to paycheck, and they are paying a \nhigher Federal tax rate than the wealthiest people in America.\n\n  I think everyone in America has to sacrifice. Now I know, some of the \nmost vulnerable in America cannot. Physically, mentally they cannot \nrise to this challenge. But the rest of us, for goodness' sake, have to \nbe prepared to sacrifice. Working families are already sacrificing, \nliving paycheck to paycheck. To ask the wealthiest people in America, \nwho are comfortable in this country because of the greatness of our \neconomy, this open and transparent system, this rule of law we have, to \nask them to pay a little more so America can move forward is not \nunreasonable.\n  I would say this: At the end of the day, when the economy picks up \nand moves forward, and it will, the folks in the highest income \ncategories are going to do quite well. It is the bottom line. They are \ngoing to do well. The ones I have run into, the ones I have talked to \nwho are fortunate enough to be in this category--I know a few of them--\nsay: This is not unreasonable, Senator. Why do the Republicans oppose \n$1 in additional taxes to get the American economy moving forward?\n  But that, of course, is the reason the Senate Republicans, not a \nsingle one of them, would support bringing this jobs bill from the \nPresident to the floor. A second reason is fairly obvious. It is the \nPresident's plan. For many of them they are in full campaign mode now. \nThey do not want to give this President anything that looks like a \nvictory. So they are not going to vote for anything that has his name \non it. In fact, they will oppose things which historically they have \nsupported. When President Bush came forward with his own stimulus plan \nto create jobs, supported by the Republicans, it had a payroll tax cut \nin it--a payroll tax cut for working families. It also had tax breaks \nfor businesses to hire the unemployed. That is what President Obama \nproposes, and now the Republicans have said: Oh, we liked it as a Bush \nplan. We do not like it as an Obama plan. What is the difference? The \nname.\n  I do not think the American people are going to cut us any slack if \nthey believe we are spending more time designing bumper stickers for \nnext year's election than we are in designing an economy that moves \nthis country forward. I think they expect us--they demand of us--that \nwe respond to this. When the Republicans impose a filibuster on \nPresident Obama's jobs act it is wrong. Let us have, as Senator Reid \nasked for last night, let us have the motion to proceed, let's get on \nthis matter, and let's do it this week.\n  I wish to say a word as well--Senator McConnell comes to the floor \nfrequently and says: Whoa. There is a big jobs bill coming up, the \ntrade agreements. Listen, trade agreements can expand opportunity for \nthe sale of goods and services. That is a fact. But when we look at the \nscheme of things and look at these trade agreements, the proposal I \nhave read says the South Korea Trade Agreement would expand U.S. \nexports by $10 to $11 billion and support up to 70,000 jobs. That is a \nlot of money and a lot of jobs, except when we look at the universe--\n$10 to $11 billion in additional exports to Korea at a time when we \nhave a $15 trillion economy. Good but not good enough. We need to make \nsure we are expanding jobs at a greater rate to get people back to \nwork. The other two trade agreements are much smaller in comparison. So \nto argue that these trade agreements are the engine that will pull us \nout of the ditch and drive the economy forward is to completely \noverstate the positive impact which they might have.\n  I would say to my friends on the Republican side, do not believe that \nvoting for a trade agreement that generates $10 billion more in exports \nand 70,000 jobs will solve the problems we face in America.\n  Yesterday, I went to a place called Career Tech in Chicago, funded by \nthe Federal Government, an effort to take people who have been out of \nwork for a long time and get them back into the workforce. They are \nintroducing workers who had successful careers at businesses that \nclosed to a new world, the world of social media, the world of \ninformation technology. They are learning. With that new education and \ntraining, they are getting new jobs.\n  I asked them about what life was like unemployed. Some of them have \nbeen out of work for over 2 years. I said to them: The President wants \nto extend unemployment benefits for those out of work. A lot of folks \non the other side of the aisle are saying: Oh, we already tried that. \nWe are not going to try that again. I said: What would happen to your \nfamily without unemployment benefits? To a person they said: I am not \nsure if we could have survived.\n  They are basically making the mortgage payment, paying utility bills, \nputting food on the table--the basics. So if the Republicans are \nopposed to unemployment benefits for those who cannot find a job, no \nmatter how hard they try, unfortunately, that is going to have a \ndevastating impact on working families across America.\n  For a footnote, I asked each one of them: What happened to your \nhealth insurance when you lost your job? They lost their health \ninsurance. Think about it, Mom and Dad. Think about your responsibility \nto one another and to your kids with no health insurance. I mean, that \nis what happens to an unemployed person. Life is not a crystal \nstaircase for these folks. They are just basically trying to get by and \nfind a job. We need to help them. It is time for the Republicans to \nstop the filibuster and bring the Obama jobs bill to the floor. If they \nhave better ideas, present those ideas as amendments. Our people will \npresent their ideas. Let's have a full-throated debate about moving \nAmerica forward. But for goodness' sakes, let's not stop the American \neconomy cold in its tracks in an effort to preserve a Republican \nfilibuster.\n  It is time for us to move together in a bipartisan nature as a \nCongress in both political parties. I thank my colleague from Michigan \nfor bringing us together for this conversation. There is nothing more \ntopical that we face.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Colombia remains the most dangerous country \nin the world for trade unionists and workers seeking to exercise their \ninternationally recognized right to organize and bargain collectively. \nThe International Trade Union Confederation reported that in 2010 \nColombia had 49 union worker assassinations. That is more than the rest \nof the world combined. To make matters worse, a 2011 ILO report found \nthat the majority of the cases of violence against workers in Colombia \nhad not been investigated nor had the perpetrators been brought to \njustice. That is simply unacceptable and the United States should not \nenter into a free trade agreement with a country with such an atrocious \nhuman rights record.\n  The Colombian government has failed to enforce its laws, adhere to \nits international commitment on worker rights, or to prosecute those \nwho commit acts of violence against workers. This repression of \nfundamental labor rights presents a threat to the lives of the workers \nin Colombia and a threat to the livelihoods of the workers in the \nUnited States who are forced to compete against a country that doesn't \nplay by the rules.\n  I have written several letters to the administration expressing \nconcerns about entering into a free trade agreement with Colombia until \nthese worker rights abuse concerns are adequately addressed. The \nagreement before us does not adequately address them, and as a result I \nwill oppose H.R. 3078, the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement \nImplementation Act.\n  The Obama administration recognized the need to address these \nconcerns before the free trade agreement\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\ncould be submitted to Congress and reopened the Bush administration-\nnegotiated U.S.-Colombia FTA to try to address them. That resulted in \nthe action plan related to labor rights agreement reached between the \nU.S. and Colombia on April 7, 2011.\n  The action plan lists steps Colombia must take to improve its record \non antilabor violence and, if rigorously implemented and enforced, \ncould protect Colombian workers' internationally recognized rights. \nUnfortunately, we gave up any leverage we had to ensure this outcome \nwould occur when we failed to link the action plan to the FTA or its \nimplementing legislation. Both House and Senate Democrats during \ncommittee mark up of the bill proposed an amendment that would have \ncreated a link between the two, but Republicans blocked any reference \nto the labor action plan in the Colombia FTA.\n  I disagree with the administration's conclusion that Colombia has \nmade enough progress on implementing the Action Plan to send the U.S.-\nColombia FTA implementation act to Congress. Because this free trade \nagreement is being considered under fast-track procedures, Members of \nCongress like me, who would like to amend it to make improvements such \nas linking entry into force of the Colombian FTA to Colombia meeting \nits obligations under the action plan, cannot do so.\n  Yes, Colombia may so far have technically met its commitments under \nthe action plan. But it has done this only in the narrowest sense, and \nnot in a way that really tries to address the labor problem. For \ninstance, in Colombia, only workers who are directly employed by a \ncompany or business can form a union and collectively bargain. To get \naround allowing workers to form unions and collectively bargain, \nColombian employers have formed cooperatives, or made other \narrangements to hire their employees as contractors rather than as \ndirect employees. The action plan addressed these abuses by requiring \nColombia to pass legislation and regulations to prohibit such misuse of \ncooperatives and contract employees. Colombia did pass legislation and \nregulations that looked good on paper, but they were undermined when \nColombia decided to narrowly interpreted the new law and regulations as \napplying only to cooperatives. This is leaves plenty of ways for \nemployers to continue the same practice under a different guise.\n  Given the lack of full implementation of the action plan to date, and \nwithout a provision explicitly inking implementation of the FTA to \nColombia addressing anti-union violence, impunity and fundamentally \ndeficient labor laws under the action plan, the legislation is \nfundamentally flawed and I cannot support it.\n  I recognize that we currently do not have two-way trade with Colombia \nbecause most Colombian exports enter the U.S. duty free under the \nAndean Trade Preferences Act. Some might say we should adopt the U.S.-\nColombia FTA so U.S. exports can face lower tariffs in Colombia. But \nColombia's market is small compared to the U.S. economy and as a result \nthe ITC estimates the overall effect of the U.S. Colombia FTA on the \nU.S. economy is likely to be small. To me it is more important to \ninsist that any country to which we enter a free trade agreement abide \nby internationally recognized labor standards and that plans to \nimplement compliance actions be enforceable.\n  Mr. President, I will vote in favor of H.R. 3080, the United States-\nKorea Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. I will do so because the \nObama administration has succeeded in improving the automotive \nprovisions in the Bush administration-negotiated original agreement. \nThe result is that U.S. made vehicles now have a better opportunity to \ngain access to the historically closed South Korean market.\n  For too long, trade with South Korea has been a one-way street. The \nAmerican market has been open and South Korea's market persistently \nclosed by using a combination of tariff and nontariff barriers \nconstructed to keep U.S. products out. This was most pronounced in the \nautomotive sector, which makes up the majority of our trade deficit \nwith South Korea. For instance, in 2010 South Korea shipped 515,000 \ncars to the United States while U.S. automakers exported fewer than \n14,000 cars to South Korea. In 2010, we ran a $10 billion trade deficit \nwith South Korea. Our trade deficit with South Korea in the automotive \nsector accounted for all of that $10 billion. Correcting our deficit in \nthe automotive sector would go a long way to fixing our overall trade \ndeficit with South Korea.\n  The original 2007 U.S.-Korea FTA negotiated by the Bush \nadministration was fundamentally flawed. The agreement called for \nsignificant concessions from the United States but would have \nperpetuated a skewed playing field that unfairly disadvantages U.S. \nautomotive exports. It would have left in place the ever-shifting \nregulatory regime South Korea has used to effectively bar U.S. autos \nfrom the South Korean market. For example, South Korea has imposed so-\ncalled auto safety regulations that are unique to Korea and don't have \nanything to do with safety such as the location of towing devices or \nheadlights or the color of turn-signal lamps. This means that no \nvehicle built outside of Korea can be sold in Korea without special and \nexpensive modifications and testing to meet these Korean requirements.\n  The failure to address these and other arbitrary, ever-changing \nregulations was one of the main reasons the agreement was not brought \nbefore the Congress for approval for so long. I was opposed to that \nagreement and as cochairman of the Senate Auto Caucus I spoke out \nagainst it.\n  I am pleased that President Obama recognized the importance of the \nU.S. automotive industry and reopened the agreement to negotiate \nsignificantly improved terms for U.S. auto exports to South Korea.\n  Importantly, the revised agreement will prevent South Korea from \nrelying on discriminatory, rotating safety regulations as it has in the \npast to keep out U.S. auto imports. It does this by requiring South \nKorea to recognize 25,000 vehicles built to meet U.S. safety standards \nper automaker per year as meeting South Korean safety standards. This \nis an increase from 6,500 in the 2007 agreement. The revised agreement \nalso includes an auto-specific safeguard designed to protect against \npotential surges of South Korean cars and trucks once the applicable \ntariffs are eliminated.\n  Under the original 2007 agreement, almost 90 percent of South Korea's \nauto exports to the United States would have received duty-free access. \nBut why should we have reduced our few remaining tariffs to South \nKorean auto exports unless we were assured greater access to the South \nKorean markets for our auto exports? For instance, the U.S. auto tariff \nis only 2.5 percent compared to the South Korean auto tariff of 8 \npercent. The revised agreement corrected this inequity by reducing \nKorea's 8 percent duty to 4 percent immediately and to zero in year 5 \nwhile delaying elimination of the duty on South Korea's auto exports \nuntil year 5, giving U.S. automakers the time to build a brand and \ndistribution presence that will reverse decades of South Korean \nprotectionism.\n  The 2007 agreement was flawed also in how it dealt with the growing \nfield of electric vehicles. The 2007 agreement would have allowed for a \n10-year phase-out of the 8 percent South Korean tariff on hybrid \nelectric passenger vehicles and the 2.5 percent U.S. tariff. That was \nnot a fair deal for U.S. electric car exports. It's bad enough that the \ncurrent South Korean electric car tariff is more than three times the \nU.S. tariff. The 2007 agreement would have locked in place for 10 years \nSouth Korea's electric car tariff advantage. Why in the world would we \nagree to that? Thankfully the Obama administration did not. Under the \nrevised agreement, the South Korean tariff on electric cars immediately \ndrops from 8 percent to 4 percent. Then the 4 percent South Korean \ntariff and the 2.5 percent U.S. tariff are phased out over 5 years. \nThough the tariffs are still not completely symmetrical, it's a big \nimprovement over the original deal. And importantly, this phase-out now \ntracks the EU-Korean FTA, so U.S. automakers will now not be \ndisadvantaged compared to European auto makers in the South Korean \nmarket as they would have been under the 2007 agreement.\n  Stakeholders, including Members of Congress, the United Auto Workers \nand U.S. auto companies, pushed hard for improved market access in the \nU.S.-Korea FTA. Thanks to the improvements the Obama administration has\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\nnegotiated, the UAW, Ford, GM and Chrysler as well as the Motor & \nEquipment Manufacturers Association, MEMA, among others, support the \nagreement. They think it will result in their being able to sell more \nU.S.-made vehicles in South Korea. Specifically, Chrysler has stated \nthat as a result of the FTA it expects to sell 20,000 units per year in \nSouth Korea by the end 2014 compared to the paltry 2,638 passenger \nvehicles it sold there in 2010, and that the company plans to expand \nits dealer network to 30 outlets from the current 16.\n  These additional U.S. auto exports translate into badly needed \nAmerican jobs. The 2007 ITC report on the expected impact of the U.S.-\nKorean FTA estimated U.S. exports to South Korea would increase by $10-\n$11 billion annually. The administration estimates that an additional \n$11 billion in exports would mean around 70,000 more jobs annually. In \nan updated ITC report requested by Senator Wyden to assess the impact \non American jobs of the FTA tariff and tariff rate quota reductions on \ngoods based on current economic conditions, the ITC concluded that the \nagreement has the potential to create about 280,000 American jobs.\n  The agreement also has strong labor and environmental provisions that \nwere agreed to in May 2007 at the insistence of Democratic Members of \nCongress, led by my brother, Congressman Sandy Levin, the ranking \nmember of the House Ways and Means Committee. They include the \nenforcement of a commitment to adopt and enforce internationally \nrecognized labor and environmental standards and agreements.\n  It is high time we insisted on a different trade model that fights \nfor a level playing field for American exports and American workers. I \nbelieve the revised U.S.-Korea FTA moves significantly toward that \nmodel and I will vote in favor of the legislation to implement it.\n  Mr. President, I will support legislation to implement the U.S.-\nPanama Free Trade Agreement. The Obama administration has taken \nimportant steps to address concerns about worker rights and \nenvironmental protections in Panama that represent a significant \nimprovement over the original agreement negotiated by the Bush \nadministration. And, after years of pressure from those of us concerned \nabout the abuse of offshore tax shelters, Panama has finally removed a \nmajor impediment to this free trade agreement by agreeing to and \nbeginning to implement a tax information exchange agreement.\n  For 6 years, the Bush administration failed to conclude a tax \ninformation exchange agreement with Panama. In 2009, I joined with \nCongressman Doggett in a letter to President Obama making clear that we \ncould not support a free trade agreement with Panama unless that \ncountry upheld its international obligations under the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development's standards for transparency. The \nOECD found in September 2010 that Panama has ``potentially serious \ndeficiencies'' in its laws on tax transparency. Thanks to pressure from \nthe OECD, the Obama administration and those of us in Congress who \noppose offshore tax haven abuse, Panama negotiated an information \nexchange agreement that took effect earlier this year.\n  Panama also agreed in negotiations with the Obama administration to \nuphold internationally recognized labor rights, making changes in its \nlaws to protect collective bargaining rights. These changes have \nremoved a major obstacle to approval of this free trade agreement.\n  With Panama's agreement to meet international standards for tax \ntransparency and labor rights, I believe the agreement before us will \nprotect workers in both countries, and the interests of U.S. taxpayers \nwho are tired of seeing others dodge their tax obligations using \noffshore tax havens.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to lend \ntheir swift support to the pending free trade agreements with South \nKorea, Colombia, and Panama that have at last come before this Chamber. \nIn approving these FTAs, we have an opportunity to show the American \npeople that we in Congress are prepared to set aside partisan politics \nand come together to do something truly important to help our nation at \na time when our economy is under unprecedented pressure.\n  Simply put, free trade agreements like the ones before us today are \nnot a choice for the United States--they are a necessity. As President \nClinton used to point out, only 4 percent of the world's population \nlives in the United States, and there is only so much we can sell to \neach other. Creating new jobs and growing our economy requires tapping \ninto the other 96 percent. And that requires breaking down trade \nbarriers and lowering tariffs so that American goods can reach more \nconsumers at a price they can afford.\n  That is precisely what these three FTAs will accomplish. This \nlegislation is a jobs bill that won't add a dime to the deficit. \nInstead, it will add $10 to $12 billion to our GDP, grow U.S. exports \nby $13 to $15 billion, and support an additional 100,000 American jobs.\n  These FTAs are not only critical for our economic recovery, however. \nThey are essential to our global leadership and our national security.\n  In the case of the Korea-U.S. FTA, known as KORUS, the success or \nfailure of this measure is inseparable from U.S. leadership in the \nAsia-Pacific region. The balance of power in Asia will determine the \nshape of the 21st century and whether it will be an American century or \na Chinese century. Our friends and allies across this region are \nlooking to Washington. In the face of a rising Beijing, they want to \nknow if the U.S. is a country they can count on, or whether we are in \nretreat. From Japan to India to Australia, there is no test for \nAmerican leadership today that is more urgent than approving our FTA \nwith South Korea.\n  That is because the competition for the future in the Asia-Pacific is \nas much about economic power as it is about military power. Since 2000, \napproximately 50 free trade agreements have been put in place in East \nAsia alone, with approximately 80 additional agreements currently under \nnegotiation. The United States is party to just four FTAs in the Asia-\nPacific region.\n  Passing KORUS is the first step to righting this wrong and restoring \na balance of economic power that favors America. Doing so will send an \nunequivocal message across the Asia-Pacific of American strength and \ncommitment. It will also deepen one of our most important alliances in \nthe world, with the Republic of Korea--a dynamic, free market democracy \nthat has climbed from the depths of poverty and the devastation of war \nto become a model for the entire planet and a great global ally in the \ncause of freedom.\n  The economic benefits of KORUS are also extraordinary. This FTA will \nincrease exports of American goods to Korea by around $11 billion once \nthe agreement is fully in effect, supporting as many as 70,000 \nadditional jobs here in the United States.\n  The agreement will also grant American firms greater access to \nKorea's $580 billion services market, creating new jobs for American \nworkers in sectors from delivery and telecommunications services to \nenergy and environmental services.\n  While South Korea is on the cusp of becoming our third-largest free \ntrade partner after Canada and Mexico, free trade agreements with \nColombia and Panama also offer enormous opportunities for the United \nStates and will open the way for tremendous growth here in our own \nhemisphere.\n  Colombia is the oldest democracy in Latin America and one of \nAmerica's most steadfast allies in that region. Like South Korea, \nColombia is a great global success story--a country that has overcome \nnarco-insurgency and terrorism, and a pro-American bulwark against Hugo \nChavez's corrupt authoritarianism.\n  By completing this FTA, the U.S. will strengthen not only our \nColombian allies, but also our shared values of democracy, rule of law, \nand the free market across Latin America.\n  The U.S.-Colombia FTA will also strengthen our own economy--expanding \nU.S. exports by more than $1.1 billion, increasing U.S. GDP by $2.5 \nbillion, and creating thousands of U.S. jobs. Keep in mind, currently \nColombia collects $100 in tariffs on U.S. exports for every $1 the \nUnited States levies on Colombian goods. With this FTA, that will end.\n  Similarly, the U.S.-Panama FTA will eliminate tariffs and other \nbarriers to\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n\nU.S. exports, promote economic growth, and expand trade with one of the \nfastest growing economies in Latin America. American companies will be \ngranted immediate access to Panama's $21 billion services market, \nincluding priority areas such as financial services and \ntelecommunications. Panama's economy expanded 6.2 percent in 2010, with \nsimilar annual growth forecasts through 2015. All of this translates to \nmore opportunities for American workers.\n  Some have argued that free trade agreements threaten to increase our \ntrade deficit. However, as the U.S. Department of Commerce recently \npointed out, in recent years, U.S. manufacturers have run a $47 billion \ntrade surplus with our FTA partners; by contrast, we have incurred a \ntrade deficit of $823 billion with countries where no FTAs are in \nplace.\n  Time is of the essence. If we delay any further on these agreements, \nit will cost our country dearly in jobs and growth. The rest of the \nworld is not standing still.\n  The European Union finalized a free trade agreement with South Korea \nover the summer, and Canada implemented a free trade agreement with \nColombia just weeks ago. If we do not act, jobs and market share that \ncould have gone to U.S. companies will instead head to their \ncompetitors in Europe and Canada. That is why we must act now.\n  In conclusion, let me underscore how important it is that these FTAs \nare the beginning, not the end, of a revived American global trade \nagenda. In order to get our economy back on track, in order to create \nthe new jobs we need, in order to lead the world economically, the U.S. \nmust have a forward-looking, optimistic trade liberalization vision.\n  That is true not only in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America but also \nin the Middle East where millions of people who have long suffered and \nstagnated under thuggish dictators are at last grasping for greater \npolitical freedom and economic opportunity. More than foreign aid, \ncountries like Tunisia and Egypt need the U.S. and Europe to lower \ntrade barriers. That is why I believe so strongly that the U.S. should \nimmediately begin negotiations for an FTA with Tunisia. Tunisia is a \nsmall country, but it is the place where the Arab Spring began and \nconsequently critical to the future of Arab democracy.\n  I strongly urge the Obama administration to begin negotiations on a \nfree trade agreement with Tunisia as quickly as possible. The freer the \nflow of world trade, the stronger the tides for economic progress, \nprosperity, democracy and peace will be.\n  Beginning today with the passage of these critical free trade \nagreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, we take another step \ntowards restoring our economy and strengthening our global leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will yield briefly to the Senator \nfrom Montana, and I ask that we set an order. I thought I was scheduled \nto speak, but apparently it is up in the air. I will defer to the \nSenator from Montana and ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nfollow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the English poet, Thomas Gray, once said: \n``Commerce changes the fate and genius of nations.''\n  The United States has always understood that commerce improves our \nfate and sharpens our genius. We know opening the channels of commerce \ncreates new opportunity, generates new ideas, and forms new \npartnerships.\n  We know global commerce makes us more competitive, more innovative, \nand more productive--but also sometimes more difficult.\n  Today, the Senate has a historic opportunity to build on this legacy \nby approving our free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South \nKorea. These agreements will increase exports of U.S. goods and \nservices. They will create tens of thousands of good-paying American \njobs. They will bind us even more closely to the three important \nallies.\n  Colombia, especially, has returned from the brink of becoming a \nfailed state to being the third largest economy in Latin America and \none of its most respected leaders. It is astounding just how far \nColombia has come. It has a lot further to go, but considering the \nstate of Colombia 15, 20 years ago, with the narcotics trade, \nparamilitary forces, and assassinations, it is amazing how far they \nhave come. A lot of this goes to the courage of the Colombian people, \nand especially to the leaders. It has not been easy, to say the least.\n  Panama is the crossroads of global commerce and among the fastest \ngrowing economies in the Western Hemisphere.\n  South Korea is the world's 15th largest economy, our seventh largest \ntrading partner, and a strategic ally in a very volatile region of the \nworld.\n  Now, more than ever, we need to expand commerce and improve our \neconomic fate. Clearly, with unemployment at 9.1 percent, our economy \nis growing too slowly. Consumer demand is too weak, and American \nworkers, farmers, and ranchers are desperately seeking new markets and \ncustomers for their products.\n  The Colombia, Panama, and South Korea trade agreements will help U.S. \nexporters gain new customers in three lucrative and fast-growing \nmarkets. They will increase U.S. exports by up to $13 billion each \nyear. They will boost our GDP by more than $15 billion, and they will \nsupport tens of thousands of urgently needed American jobs. It will \nhelp the jobs picture--clearly, it will not solve it, but it will help.\n  These agreements will help folks such as Errol Rice, a fifth \ngeneration cattle rancher from Helena, MT. Earlier this year, Errol \ntestified before the Finance Committee on the importance of the South \nKorea trade agreement. He told us that South Korea is the fourth \nlargest market in the world for U.S. beef, and it is growing rapidly.\n  Errol welcomed the commitments I secured to increase funding for \nmarket promotion and fully implement our bilateral beef import \nprotocol. But he underscored that our position in the South Korean \nmarket is at risk. Australia, a large beef exporter, is racing to \nconclude its own trade agreement with South Korea. By approving our \nagreement with South Korea today, we will help Errol and all American \nranchers maintain their competitive edge, increase sales, and create \njobs in their communities.\n  Trade agreements improve our economy only if they create a level \nplaying field for U.S. exporters. We cannot allow our trading partners \nto gain unfair advantage by failing to respect workers' rights or \nprotect the environment.\n  That is why the Colombia, Panama, and South Korea trade agreements \ninclude robust labor and environmental commitments that were basically \nmade in 2007, with all the labor and environmental framework included \nin these agreements. These commitments require our trading partners to \nuphold internationally recognized labor rights, including the right to \norganize and bargain collectively. That is in the agreement.\n  They also required our partners to protect the environment, and these \nobligations are fully enforceable, just like the commercial obligations \nin the agreements. In many cases, our free-trade agreement partners \nhave gone the extra mile to meet our high standards. Colombia is the \nbest example. Many of us are concerned about labor violence in \nColombia. We believe the death of even one union member is one too \nmany.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the progress Colombia has made in \nrecent years and the commitment of the Colombian Government to continue \nthat progress.\n  Colombia demonstrated this commitment in April when President Obama \nand Colombian President Santos agreed to the Labor Action Plan. In that \nplan, Colombia made specific and groundbreaking commitments to \nstrengthen worker rights, protect workers from violence, and prosecute \nthe perpetrators of violence.\n  Colombia has fulfilled every commitment to date. It has hired 100 new \ninspectors to enforce workers' rights. It has cracked down on the abuse \nof cooperatives. It has expanded protection of union members. It has \nsentenced to prison 47 people found guilty of killing\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n\nunion members. There is still more to be done, but Colombia has \ndemonstrated remarkable progress.\n  By approving the free-trade agreement, we will be able to enforce \nlabor rights in Colombia, including the rights addressed by the action \nplan. If we reject the agreement, however, we lose our ability to \nensure that labor conditions in Colombia will continue to improve. This \nis a very important point. Other countries' trade agreements with \nColombia don't have the labor protection provisions. The U.S. one does \nhave labor protection provisions that are very strong. If we don't \nratify this agreement, then workers in Colombia will not be protected \nbecause other agreements don't protect them.\n  These trade agreements will also help us rise to the challenge of \nChina. Today, China is the No. 1 trading partner for South Korea and \nNo. 2 partner for Colombia and Panama. If we approve these agreements, \nwe will give American exporters a leg up on competitors from China and \nother countries. If we reject them, China's advantage and influence in \nthese markets will only grow.\n  After we approve these agreements, we should begin thinking about the \nnext steps for our trade agenda. We should invite our new free-trade \nagreement partners to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, \nnegotiations. We need to negotiate a Trans-Pacific Partnership \nAgreement and extend these agreements to better facilitate even more \njobs in America.\n  Colombia, Panama, and South Korea have demonstrated that they are \nwilling to make the far-reaching commitments that our trade agreements \nrequire. Their participation in the TPP negotiations will help us \nachieve a high-standard 21st-century agreement that spans the Pacific.\n  Thomas Gray was correct when he said commerce changes the fate and \ngenius of nations. There is no better example than the United States. \nWe have benefited greatly from trading with foreign nations. In these \ntough economic times, we need to embrace these benefits now more than \never. For the sake of American exporters seeking to grow and create \njobs, let's approve these three free-trade agreements.\n  One final point. I think it is fair to say that as we engage in \ncommerce worldwide in countries around the world, we are not totally \npure. We don't wear white hats, and other countries are not Darth \nVaders and wear black hats. But it is true the shade of gray of our \nhats are a lot lighter shade of gray than the shade of gray of their \nhats, which is a darker shade. That is especially true in the American, \nAsian, and African countries--maybe a little less true in European \ncountries.\n  These agreements are no-brainers. Why do I say that? Because with \nrespect to Colombia and Panama, products, goods, and services coming to \nour country today are virtually duty free, virtually no tariffs, or \nnontariff trade barriers.\n\n  On the other hand, American products going to those countries today \nface very high tariffs and trade barriers, especially with agriculture \nbut also in manufacturing goods. The figures are quite startling, \nfrankly. So it is a no-brainer. These are, for the first time \nvirtually, free-trade agreements. It is a freebie for U.S. exporters \nand American companies exporting products into Colombia and Panama. \nThey are really free.\n  With respect to Korea, it is very similar. Korean manufacturing \ntariffs, tariffs that Korea has on U.S. goods are more than twice as \nhigh as U.S. tariffs on Korean-manufactured goods. Tariffs that U.S. \ncompanies face in trying to export to Korea are twice as high today as \nare the tariffs the Korean manufacturers face when they try to sell \nproducts in the United States. The average Korean tariff on U.S. \nagricultural goods is 54 percent. The average tariff on American \nagricultural goods that we are trying to sell in Korea is 54 percent, \nabout 5 times as high as the tariff on Korean agricultural products as \nthey attempt to ship to the United States.\n  That is why this is a no-brainer. This is so simple. Everybody should \nbe for this agreement. It creates a more level playing field. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this agreement. When they read the agreement and \nunderstand the terms, it should go through with no opposition because \nwe are, in fact, helping Americans, American jobs.\n  The only wrinkle I hear about is Colombia. I have been there. When \none is in Colombia--and I have known their leaders, the past two \nPresidents--it is clear that they have made huge progress. If we reject \nthis agreement, I submit that the progress made thus far will slip, and \nthe conditions in Colombia will start to deteriorate.\n  We must pass these three trade agreements. Also, the U.S. political-\ngeopolitical position in South America is critical. If we adopt this \nagreement, that will enhance America's geopolitical position in South \nAmerica. If we don't do it, Colombians are going to say: We have given \nup on the United States. We have been trying to negotiate this for over \n5 years. Then where are they going to go? They will embrace Venezuela \nor China.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I also rise today to speak in favor of \nthe pending free-trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and \nColombia.\n  More than 50 million Americans work for companies that engage in \ninternational trade. Currently, U.S. exporters operate at a distinct \ndisadvantage in countries where U.S. goods face high tariffs or \ndiscriminatory regulations. Passage of these three free-trade \nagreements will erase those disadvantages and allow our American \nbusinesses to compete on a level playing field in the global \nmarketplace.\n  For far too long, these trade agreements have sat on the President's \ndesk. This delay has hurt our competitive advantage and cost American \njobs. Moreover, the administration's slow walk of these bills has \nencouraged some of our major trading partners to go forward and quickly \nnegotiate their own trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and \nColombia, putting their workers at an advantage over U.S. workers.\n  Canada has already approved trade deals with both Colombia and \nPanama. The European Union has passed agreements with all three \ncountries. Canadian and EU workers and farmers are reaping the \nadvantages of greater access to these markets.\n  Creating jobs, increasing investment, and growing the U.S. \nmanufacturing and farming sectors should be our top priority. With a \n9.1-percent unemployment rate, this is a no-brainer: export more, make \nour products more competitive by lowering the tariffs, and create jobs \nin America. What could be more clear?\n  If we fail to act, American businesses will continue watching from \nthe sidelines as other countries enjoy duty-free trading and continue \nto gain an advantage over American companies and employees.\n  It has been estimated that failure to implement just the Colombia and \nSouth Korea Free Trade Agreements would lead to a decline of $40.2 \nbillion in U.S. exports. The net negative impact on U.S. employment \nfrom these trade and output losses could total nearly 400,000 jobs.\n  Small businesses in America will be the largest beneficiary of these \nfree-trade agreements. These are the businesses that account for the \nlargest group of U.S. exporters. Indeed, more than 97 percent of the \nU.S. companies that export are small businesses, and they account for \none-third of the total U.S. merchandise exports.\n  Our farmers and ranchers will also benefit from these agreements as \nthe exports of our agricultural products have historically suffered \nfrom high tariffs and other nontariff barriers.\n  South Korea. The South Korea Free Trade Agreement will be America's \nlargest free-trade agreement in Asia. South Korea is our Nation's \nseventh largest trading partner and the United States is South Korea's \nthird largest trading partner. The White House has estimated that when \nthe free-trade agreement with South Korea is fully implemented, U.S. \nexports to South Korea will increase by $11 billion annually and add as \nmany as 70,000 U.S. jobs.\n  The pending agreement will open the door for increased U.S. exports \nto South Korea of our automobile products, which are among the U.S. \nindustries and workers that will benefit. It should also be noted that \napproval of this free-trade agreement will send a strong message that \nwe stand with our\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\nallies in Asia and will further strengthen our long and positive \nrelationship with South Korea.\n  Right here in our own hemisphere, the implementation of the U.S.-\nPanama Free Trade Agreement will guarantee American companies access to \nPanama's $21 billion in services. This includes priority areas in \nfinancial, telecommunications, computer, distribution, express \ndelivery, energy, environmental and professional services.\n  Once implemented, 88 percent of U.S. commercial and industrial \nexports to Panama will become duty free. The remaining tariffs would be \nphased out over a 10-year period. We need to act now in order to \npreserve current exports to Panama and pave the way for more. Panama \nhas recently signed free-trade agreements with Canada and the European \nUnion.\n  Nearly 5 years have passed since the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement was signed by the United States and Colombia on November 22, \n2006. Last year, U.S. exports to Colombia totaled $12 billion, with \nmany of those subject to the high tariffs. Our exporters have paid \nnearly $4 billion in duties to Colombia since that agreement was signed \n5 years ago.\n  The Colombian Congress approved the free-trade agreement less than 1 \nyear after it was signed. After 5 years, the Congress is only now \nfinally considering this agreement. That is not the way to treat a \nfriend.\n  With passage of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, 80 percent of U.S. \nexports of consumer and industrial products to Colombia will be duty \nfree immediately, with remaining tariffs phased out over 10 years. The \nU.S. International Trade Commission has estimated that this agreement \nwill increase the U.S. gross domestic product by $2.5 billion.\n  On another front regarding Colombia, they once had one of the worst \ndrug cartel problems in our hemisphere. With their determination and \nintegrity and with our help, Colombia's Government and law enforcement \nsystems have substantially cleaned out the Medillin and Cali drug \ncartels. To acknowledge their sacrifice this should have been the \neasiest of the free-trade agreements to quickly have confirmed.\n  We have waited 5 years, as Colombia has done so much for itself to \nclean up the cancer in their system. We should have done this 5 years \nago. So I hope there is no hesitancy now and there is overwhelming \nsupport in this Senate for this free-trade agreement.\n  In conclusion, with so many American businesses and workers \nstruggling during this prolonged economic slump, it should be the \neasiest thing we do to enact these three free-trade agreements. Exports \nsupport millions of jobs in this country. These agreements will promote \nAmerican sales in markets where we have been at a disadvantage for too \nlong.\n  It was disheartening that this administration let these agreements \nlanguish for many months without taking action. We now have the chance \nto approve those before us today--these three--which are good for our \nbilateral relations with these three countries, for working Americans, \nfor farmers and ranchers throughout our system, and for our struggling \neconomy.\n  I am very pleased these votes are being scheduled for today. We know \nthe South Korean President is going to address a joint session of \nCongress tomorrow and to have these done and, hopefully, signed by the \nPresident when the South Korean President comes is the welcome gift he \nhas been looking for, for a long time.\n  I so look forward to having these three free-trade agreements with \nthese countries that have shown they want to do business with America, \nthey want to have free and fair access into their country for our great \nproducts and our great workers, and we should let them have it without \nfurther delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Alex Glass\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as every one of our colleagues knows, so \nmuch of what we do depends on the hard work and commitment of the \ndedicated staffers who toil behind the scenes on behalf of us and the \nconstituents we represent. I wish to take a few minutes to recognize a \nmember of my own staff who has been with me for many years, through \ngood times and bad, and whose work ethic, competence, intelligence, and \npassion for public service is truly deserving of admiration and \nrecognition as she now moves on to a new job, after more than 10 years \nof service in my office.\n  Alex Glass came to work for me on April 2, 2001. We hired her on as \nthe deputy press secretary. She had graduated from Bryn Mawr the year \nbefore and had gone to work for the Gore for President campaign before \njoining my staff. Alex was similar to many young people who make their \nway to our Nation's Capitol after college. She was passionate about \npublic service, wanted to make a difference, and cared deeply about her \ncountry and the serious issues we faced.\n  From the start, I knew Alex was a strong addition to my team. But \njust a few months later, it became clear to me she was much more. It \nwas a Tuesday morning. We were right here in the Nation's Capitol. My \ncommunications director happened to be traveling that week. So even \nthough Alex had just joined my staff, she was my only press staffer \nhere that day.\n\n  As we all remember, a little bit after 9 a.m., we got word in the \nCapitol that planes had struck the World Trade Center. Shortly after \nthat, I looked out the window of the Capitol and saw black clouds of \nsmoke filling the sky above the Pentagon. It was September 11, 2001, a \nday of unspeakable tragedy and devastating loss for our Nation. For \nthose of us here in Washington, DC, and those in New York, and for \nfamilies across America, it was a day of great confusion, uncertainty, \nand fear.\n  On that day, Alex stepped up for me, she stepped up for our office, \nand she stepped up for our constituents. Alex felt the same way every \none of us did that day. But right away, she realized families in my \nhome State of Washington were going to want to hear from their elected \nofficial in this time of national crisis. She was calm, she was \ncollected, and she was already thinking ahead to what we were going to \nneed to do that day.\n  So before we even evacuated, she quickly scribbled down the phone \nnumbers of the major press outlets in Washington State, and then \nthroughout that dark day and into the night, Alex and I stayed together \nand, through our State's press, I was able to reach out to families who \nwere desperate for news and who needed to know that, despite this \ntragedy, their government remained strong. That day, I knew what Alex \nwas made of, and I saw that spirit and dedication again and again over \nthe next 10 years because Alex always knew what this job was all \nabout--it was about helping people and solving problems.\n  I remember so many times I was in the room with my staff, where we \nwere discussing one issue or another. Every once in a while, we would \nhear a soft voice from the chair to my left--Alex only talks when she \nhas something to say--and in the clearest and most concise way, she \nwould help bring our discussion from the theoretical to the practical: \nHow does this affect families in our State? How will these policies \nhelp the people I was sent to represent? These were the questions that \nwere always on Alex's mind because she knew those were the most \nimportant questions to me.\n  So many times over the years I would wake and check my e-mail and see \nan article Alex had forwarded to me--stories about veterans who weren't \ngetting the care they deserved, workers who couldn't find a job or \nfamilies falling through the cracks. She didn't include a comment with \nthose stories. She knew she didn't have to. She just passed them along \nbecause she knew I would want to see them. She understood it was those \npeople, the ones in those stories, whom I came to DC to fight for. Alex \nisn't from Washington State, but she dove into her adopted State with \ngusto, and within a few months she knew more about the issues facing \nour local communities than most people from Washington.\n  I remember one time--and I never thought I would tell this story out \nloud--Alex and I were in Port Angeles, and someone thought it would be \na good idea for us to travel in a helicopter to our next event. It may \nhave\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\nbeen a good idea, but Alex and I--5 feet tall, both of us--had to put \non these huge bright orange flight suits that were made for someone \nmuch bigger than either of us. I just remember catching her eye and we \nstarted laughing at each other and at ourselves. She and I had so many \nmoments such as that together because Alex is very serious about her \nwork, but she doesn't take herself seriously. She is much fun to be \naround, and she has a fantastic sense of humor, which is good for me \nbecause I don't think there is anyone I have spent more time with in my \ncar traveling around Washington State than Alex.\n  On a particularly stressful or long day on the road, Alex always made \nsure we had cookies in the car, which I very much appreciated. Once, \nduring a busier day than usual, I remember Alex and I having a \nconversation about all the fun places we had to pass by in the car as \nwe drove to the next events but never had time to stop and visit.\n  We resolved to find the time to visit some of those when things got a \nbit slower, and I haven't forgotten about that. One day Alex and I are \ngoing to visit that alpaca farm up in Skagit Valley.\n  Alex also knew there was nothing I liked more than doing events where \nI could wear my jeans and tennis shoes, and I know she fought hard to \nmake sure that happened as often as possible; and, Alex, I appreciate \nthat.\n  Alex always had my back. She was always ready to get done what needed \nto get done. Back in 2004, I was facing a tough reelection campaign in \nmy State. Alex had a life here in DC, but I went to her and I asked her \nto move back to the State to help me. I wanted her there, not because \nshe is just good at her job and knows my voice so well--though she \ncertainly is and does--but because she shares values, and I had every \nconfidence that she would know exactly how I would want to tell my \nstory and get my message out to the people in Washington. And Alex, \nwithout blinking, said yes. She packed up her bags and boxed up her \napartment, she put her pet bunny in the car--I think this may be one of \nthe most well-traveled rabbits in all of America--and she drove all the \nway across the country to fight by my side in Washington State. I don't \nknow if I could have done it without her.\n  Alex then, after that election, came back here to DC and spent 6 \nyears as my communication director. Then she did it all over again--\nuprooting her life, packing up that bunny, and driving all across the \nState when I needed her out in Washington State again last year. After \nshe finished that job, I asked Alex to come back here to Washington, \nDC, to serve as my senior adviser and provide me with counsel and \nadvice as I took on new challenges, and I was grateful when she \naccepted and got to work.\n  But 10\\1/2\\ years after Alex Glass first started working for me, the \nmoment came that I knew was always going to come but never looked \nforward to. Alex knocked on the door of my office and walked in, and \nbefore she could say a word I knew exactly what she had come to tell \nme. I gave her a hug. We talked. There may have been a few tears shed. \nBut I always knew that Alex has the skills, the talent, and the \nexperience to do absolutely anything she wants to do, and I am proud \nthat she has chosen to continue working in public service and has \naccepted a job at USAID.\n  Although she is moving on, her amazing work and strong influence in \nmy office will continue. Her words and her ideas have helped shape so \nmuch of what I have done and how I have communicated with my \nconstituents. I can't tell you how many Washington State reporters have \ncome over to me to thank me. They told me how helpful Alex was, how \nresponsive and how good she was at connecting the policy debates here \nin Congress to the struggles of families and communities in our State.\n  Alex didn't just keep this to herself. She helped build and mentor a \nstrong team in my office that knows what we are trying to do and \nunderstands my voice and how I want to communicate with the people I \nrepresent.\n  I have had many members of my staff come and go in my time here in \nthe Senate. Many of them have been outstanding. Every one of them has \nadded value and done good work for me and my constituents. But there \nare very few I have come as close to as I have to Alex.\n  Over the last 10 years, Alex, you have been like a member of my \nfamily, truly like a daughter to me. You have gone to the mat time and \ntime again for me. You have been through thick and thin with us. You \nhave sacrificed so much for me and my office, and I can't express \nenough how deeply I appreciate it. I know there is nothing you wouldn't \ndo for me, and I hope you know I feel the same way about you. So on \nbehalf of everyone in my office, all the constituents I represent, I \nwant to thank you for the years of service to Washington State and to \nthe Nation. You have been my voice, my adviser, my confidante and, most \nimportantly, my friend. It has meant so much to me. And although I know \nit will continue, you aren't going away very far, I am going to miss \nseeing you in the office and hearing your voice almost every day.\n  So, Alex, as you start this exciting new chapter in your professional \nlife, remember what Rob and I would say to you when times got tough out \nin the State: Shoulders up. Shoulders up. You have helped me keep mine \nup for more than 10 years, and I wish you luck now as you tackle your \nnext challenge with the same heart, gusto, and good humor that you \nbrought to our office every day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6418-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1692 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am happy to rise today to speak about \nthe three trade agreements that are working their way over to the \nSenate. At a time when unemployment is over 9 percent and we have over \n14 million Americans out of work, it is past time for us to take up \nthese three important agreements. These agreements with Korea, \nColombia, and Panama are going to create jobs and put Americans back to \nwork. That is why it is so important we move, and move on a bipartisan \nbasis, to get them done.\n  With 95 percent of consumers living outside of our borders, we need \nto proactively help American workers, farmers, and service providers \nsell their products all around the world. The President himself has \nsaid that repeatedly. Just last month he came to Ohio and said he wants \nto be sure more products are stamped with the three proud words ``Made \nin America.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  One way to do that is to get these trade agreements done. Finally, we \nhave the opportunity to vote on them. This will help us to gain market \naccess for U.S. workers to about 100 million consumers.\n  Unfortunately, while these agreements have been sitting on the shelf \nfor over 4 years, our workers, our farmers, and our service providers \nhave lost market share. They have fallen behind because other countries \nhave completed agreements, and their workers and their farmers, their \nservice providers have gained market share that\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\nwe should have had. According to the National Association of \nManufacturers, by waiting for 4 years to take up these agreements, \nAmerican workers have lost over $12 billion in wages.\n  So I am glad the agreements are here. They should have been here \nsooner. Again, this, to me, should be a lesson that we learn as a \nCongress, a Senate. We need to have more agreements, and we need to \nhave them negotiated constantly on behalf of our businesses and our \nworkers.\n  While we have waited for the President to submit these agreements to \nCongress for a vote, other countries have moved forward and have gained \nfootholds in other markets. The European Union and Korea, along with \nCanada and Colombia, have negotiated, completed, and put into force \ntheir own trade agreements they started to negotiate after we were done \nwith ours. In other words, we finished our negotiations, they then \nbegan negotiations, they ratified their agreements, and they are now in \neffect taking market share away from us.\n  We have seen the U.S. market share be reduced in Colombia and in \nKorea because of these agreements. A good example would be our exports \nof agricultural products to Colombia. We have seen them drop from 70 \npercent of the market for corn, wheat, and soybeans to less than 30 \npercent of the market just since we completed the agreement with \nColombia. Because, again, the President did not send these agreements \nforward for ratification, we have been on the sidelines while farmers \nin my State and around the country have lost out.\n  We are falling behind in Korea too. When we started discussing an \nagreement with Korea, the United States was Korea's biggest trading \npartner. Since then we have slid down the ladder, with China, Japan, \nand the Europe Union jumping ahead of us. According to the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's Office, in just over a decade, our share of Korea's \ngoods imports has fallen from 21 percent of their market to 9 percent \nof their market, while China's share of the Korean market has increased \nfrom 7 percent to 17 percent. We are now at 9 percent; China is now at \n17 percent. This has happened, again, since we began negotiations or \ndiscussions about negotiations with Korea. By standing still we are \nstill allowing China and our competitors to get a leg up in this \ncrucial Asian market.\n  According to the President's own metrics, these three agreements \ntogether will create over 250,000 new jobs. Conversely, according to \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, if we fail to move forward on these \nagreements, we would lose 380,000 jobs--again, because we would lose \nmarket share that we already have to these other countries that are \nnegotiating agreements while we sit on the sidelines.\n  The nonpartisan U.S. International Trade Commission says these three \nagreements will increase U.S. trade exports by nearly $13 billion each \nyear.\n  When I was the U.S. Trade Representative, I had the privilege of \nlaunching the Korea agreement, actually in a room right next to the \nChamber. This agreement is called KORUS. I did so with Korean Trade \nMinister Kim in February of 2006. At that time, many people said this \nagreement would be very difficult to negotiate. Some criticized us for \nlaunching it thinking this economy was too big, to complicated, that we \nwould not be able to get a meaningful agreement. We took the chance \nbecause we saw the incredible potential for trade liberalization, and \nit would drive greater economic growth in the United States and U.S. \njob creation--and also because of the importance of the alliance with \nthe Republic of Korea.\n\n  It turns out the skeptics were wrong, and we now have before us this \nweek, in the Senate, to vote on the largest free-trade agreement, \nlargest export agreement this Congress has looked at in almost two \ndecades.\n  Korea is a vital market for U.S. exports already. It is America's \nseventh largest trading partner, and their economy is now growing by \nmore than 6 percent per year.\n  KORUS eliminates tariffs on over 95 percent of U.S. exports of \nindustrial and consumer goods to Korea within the first 5 years of the \nagreement. The agreement's intellectual property rights provisions \ncontain stringent protections for American intellectual property--\nextremely important to some of our service companies and other \nexporters. This gives American companies additional access to Korea's \n$850 billion services market.\n  America has a large services trade surplus, actually, in services \nright now, both globally and with Korea, and this agreement will allow \nAmerican service companies that are the best in the world to expand and \nsell more products to a country of more than 48 million people.\n  KORUS is supported by the United Auto Workers, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and many other business and export-related groups. Let me \nread an excerpt, if I could, from the United Auto Workers' statement \nearlier this year about the Korean agreement. The UAW said the Korea \nagreement and related auto provisions ``will protect current American \nauto jobs . . . will grow American auto industry jobs . . . includes \nlabor and environmental commitments, and . . . has important \nenforcement mechanisms.''\n  The KORUS agreement opens an important market for American farmers \nand ranchers as well. According to the International Trade Commission, \nKORUS will expand American agricultural exports by $1.9 billion to $3.8 \nbillion per year. In my own State of Ohio, KORUS, along with Panama and \nColombia, will increase Ohio's agricultural exports by nearly $55 \nmillion annually--just to Ohio.\n  KORUS will eventually phase out the 40-percent Korean tariff on U.S. \nbeef and will immediately eliminate the 5-percent Korean tariff on \nsoybeans, resulting in a $3 million annual increase in Ohio soybean \nexports. Soybeans are the biggest export crop in Ohio. In fact, 1 of \nevery 2 acres of soybeans in Ohio is planted now for export.\n  KORUS also opens the door for American manufacturing jobs. In Ohio \nover 25 percent of manufacturing jobs now depend on exports. Over $31 \nbillion of U.S. manufacturing goods were exported to Korea last year. \nIn fact, Korea was our fastest growing export destination in the world, \nwith a 37-percent increase over 2009. When American-manufactured goods \nare exported to Korea, they face an average tariff now of about 9 \npercent. With passage of this agreement this 9-percent tariff will fall \nto zero and in most cases immediately. However, due to this agreement \nwe talked about earlier between the European Union and Korea going into \nforce about 100 days ago, on July 1, EU exports to Korea are now on the \nrise because 90 percent of their goods can now enter Korea duty free. \nAgain, it is important we move forward, and move forward quickly, to \navoid losing more American share which is difficult for us to regain.\n  The Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote an editorial recently entitled, \n``Korea Free Trade Deal Will Help U.S. and Ohio.''\n  The piece talked about the benefits of the Korean agreement, \nparticularly for manufacturers and autoworkers. The editorial concluded \nby saying:\n\n       Trade can help drive recovery. This deal with a longtime \n     ally will help.\n\n  They are right.\n  Another important agreement is the U.S.-Colombia trade promotion \nagreement. Colombia is a growing economy in Central and South America, \nto which the United States exported over $121 million in goods last \nyear. This agreement with Colombia is a clear victory for U.S. workers. \nDue to preference programs that are already in place, nearly 90 percent \nof the exports from Colombia to the United States have entered our \nmarket tariff free. So we largely have a one-way free-trade agreement \nwith Colombia already. Due to these preference programs, this agreement \nwill be a huge benefit to U.S. workers and U.S. businesses, because \nU.S. exports to Colombia have faced an average tariff of about 14 \npercent. So, historically, 90 percent of their goods come in duty free \nwhile ours face much higher tariffs when they enter Colombia. This \nisn't fair trade, and this agreement will fix that. It will assure that \nthe one-way trade that advantages Colombian exports instead of American \nexports is balanced.\n  The agreement will lower the 14-percent average Colombian tariff to \nzero, allowing over 80 percent of U.S. consumer and industrial products \nexported to Colombia to become duty free immediately. The agreement \nalso immediately eliminates duties on about 70 percent of U.S. farm \nexports, including\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\nsoybeans, wheat, barley, flour, and beef.\n  The Colombia agreement also establishes new transparency rules on \nnontariff barriers to trade; in other words, not a higher tariff, but \nother barriers in the country, so-called nontariff barriers, that keep \nour products out.\n  Further, it establishes new commitments on the environment and labor, \nan area on which Colombia is improving and proactively addressing.\n  The agreement also protects U.S. intellectual property with enhanced \nprotection for copyrighted entertainment products, software, and U.S. \ntrademarks.\n  Finally, we have an important agreement with Colombia's Latin \nAmerican neighbor, Panama, another key ally to the United States. \nPanama is one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America. Last \nyear, $46 million worth of Ohio goods were exported to Colombia. Panama \nis a vital strategic partner for the United States, since nearly two-\nthirds of the Panama Canal's annual transits are either from or to U.S. \nports.\n  Moreover, the ongoing $5 billion Panama Canal expansion project \npresents unique opportunities for American exporters such as Rockwell \nAutomation, which employs nearly 3,000 Ohioans. At Rockwell's Twinsburg \nfacility in northeast Ohio, they produce controllers and automation \nsystems that open and close the doors of the Panama Canal's locks and \ndivert the water. They are bidding on more work in Panama. However, \nthey say they are currently working with one hand tied behind their \nback because their competitors have an advantage in Panama, because we \ndon't have a trade agreement. So this Panama export agreement will help \ncompanies such as Rockwell by cutting tariffs, protecting their \nintellectual property, and giving them more investment certainty.\n  Upon entry into force, Panama will immediately eliminate its tariffs \non over 87 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial goods and \non more than half of U.S. agricultural exports. Eighty-five percent of \nU.S. exporters to Panama are small and medium-sized companies. That is \nover 7,000 American small and medium-sized companies that export to \nPanama and will thus benefit from this agreement.\n  Let me speak about a couple of Ohio products that are exported to \nthese markets. The Step2 Company, headquartered in Streetsboro, OH, is \nthe largest American manufacturer of preschool and toddler toys. They \nemploy over 800 Ohioans. They like to export to Korea and Panama, and \nthey want to take advantage of these agreements. Lincoln Electric's \n3,000 employees in Euclid and Mentor export welding products and \nequipment to Korea, Colombia, and Panama from northeast Ohio. These \nagreements don't just help Lincoln Electric export more, they also will \nhelp Lincoln's customers export more.\n  Another Ohio company is PRO TEC Coating, a U.S. Steel joint venture \ncompany located near Findlay. PRO TEC Coating employs about 250 Ohioans \nand creates steel that meets the most demanding specifications of U.S. \nautomakers. The Korean agreement will open a big potential market for \nU.S. auto exports, which will help companies throughout the automotive \nsupply chain to be able to get more business, and PRO TEC Coating is \none.\n  Gorilla Glue, one of my favorite named companies in Cincinnati, OH, \nmy hometown, has over 100 employees and they export their premium line \nof adhesives and tapes to Panama, Colombia, and Korea. They want this \nagreement because they will be able to expand their exports and create \nmore jobs in Cincinnati.\n  While these agreements bring large economic benefits, those \nresponsible for our national security also recognize the geopolitical \nbenefits of building economic ties with key regional allies. In \ntestimony earlier this year before the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nGEN Douglas Fraser, who is Commander of U.S. Southern Command, \ndescribed the Colombian agreement as ``a very positive, beneficial \naspect for our cooperation because of a growing capacity to support the \ncapabilities of the armed forces and law enforcement.''\n  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \nstrongly support these agreements, noting the importance of an effort \nthat leverages all elements of national power to protect our interests \noverseas. Secretary Panetta confirmed the role these increased economic \nties have on promoting regional security, with Colombia as a prime \nexample of a key ally in a continent with ever changing political \ndynamics. When it comes to international economics and security, there \nis no question of the critical role Panama plays. With 20 percent of \nour trade to Asia passing through Panama, building on this historically \nstrong relationship will signal our commitment to engaging with Central \nAmerica.\n  When President Obama submitted these agreements to Congress last \nweek, he said, ``The agreements I am submitting to Congress today will \nmake it easier for American companies to sell their products in South \nKorea, Colombia, and Panama and provide a major boost to our exports. \nThese agreements will support tens of thousands of jobs across our \ncountry. . . .''\n  While these agreements are late, the President is right. These are \nimportant job-creating and export-opening agreements. They have strong \nsupport from Members of both parties and, more importantly, they are \nsupported by American workers and businesses.\n  Again, the lesson we should learn here is that we need to give the \nPresident the authority he has yet to ask for to negotiate further \nagreements. Because in these last 4 years while these agreements have \nbeen pending, while the President has not sent them during his \nadministration--and prior to that when President Bush was blocked by \nthe House from moving them forward--we have not been negotiating \nadditional agreements. I am told there are over 100 bilateral trade \nagreements being negotiated right now. The United States is not a party \nto any of them. That is not acceptable because we are losing out. Our \nworkers, our service providers, and our farmers are losing out and we \nwill not have the sustained recovery we all hope for unless we engage \nmore in these international markets.\n  I wish to commend so many in this body who have been patient, \npersistent, and even passionate in promoting these agreements over the \nyears. When I was U.S. Trade Representative, I worked closely with then \nChairman Grassley, with Chairman Baucus, with Senator Hatch, and others \non the Finance Committee to promote these agreements. Those Senators \nare to be commended today. We will hear a lot from Senator Baucus and \nSenator Hatch, I am sure, about the importance of these agreements, but \nI want to underscore the key role they played even early on in ensuring \nthat these agreements could be here before us today.\n  I commend the staff of the Finance Committee, who have worked \ntirelessly over the years to ensure that we could be here with this \nopportunity today. Other Senators played a key role--Senator Blunt, \nSenator Kerry, and others whom I should be naming but I am not--to make \nsure we have this opportunity to move our country forward by enacting \nthese agreements.\n\n  Finally, I wish to thank the dedicated staff at the Office of the \nU.S. Trade Representative who make these agreements possible. Again, I \nhad the privilege to lead this nimble and effective agency, comprised \nof remarkable public servants who relish the agency's mission, which is \nto knock down barriers to U.S. products so we get a fair shake. They \nbalanced this challenge with aggressively enforcing our international \ntrade laws, which is also part of the mix. We need to both expand \nexports in open markets and ensure that trade is fair, and that we are \nenforcing both the international standards and U.S. laws with regard to \ntrade. They do it very well. Without our negotiators' commitments to \nresolving some of these very complex and sometimes controversial \neconomic issues, we would also not be here today. So I commend them. \nFor all of those professionals with whom I have had the honor to serve \nand for those who are there now serving under Ambassador Ron Kirk, who \nhas also been a strong promoter of these agreements, I thank you for \nyour efforts.\n  Finally, I urge my colleagues who are on the fence--and some of them \nhave talked to me--to take a strong look at the economic and \ngeopolitical benefits of these agreements. We don't do much around here \nthat is bipartisan these\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\ndays. Yet we have a country that is crying out for it. This is an \nexample of where we can come together as Republicans and Democrats, \nrealizing that for 14 million Americans out of work, we need to move \nour economy forward. This is a clear example of where we can indeed \ntake steps that are bipartisan, where we have a consensus to be able to \ncreate jobs and opportunity in the United States of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak for a couple \nof moments about the three pending trade agreements that the Senate is \nconsidering, those with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia. I wish to \nstart by highlighting what I believe the American people are most \nconcerned about right now--certainly the people I represent in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. Wherever I go, other than sending us a \nmessage that they want us to work together to solve problems they \nconfront in their lives, the No. 1 issue, the No. 1 priority in terms \nof the work we can and should be doing, and thankfully are starting to \nmove forward on, is a series of steps to improve the job market and to \nreduce the unemployment rate.\n  As we have so often said, we have more than 14 million Americans out \nof work. In Pennsylvania, we were on the way last year of lowering the \nrate of that number substantially. We went from approaching 600,000 \npeople out of work to going below 500,000. Now, unfortunately, the \nnumber has shot back up to above 500,000 people out of work. So the No. \n1 issue, bar none, is jobs, and that is why this debate about trade and \nthese agreements is so important.\n  Jobs are the key consideration for Americans. They should be the key \nconsideration for us, and they are, in short, the biggest challenge we \nhave. So we need to ask a series of questions, and I have at least \nthree major questions about these trade agreements, but all center on \nthat issue of jobs.\n  We have had a series of debates in the last couple of weeks which I \nthink have been pretty instructive on both jobs and on efforts to \nachieve bipartisanship. We had a significant period of time we spent on \ntrade adjustment assistance legislation. I was one of the leaders of \nthat, and, thankfully, we were able to pass trade adjustment assistance \nto help workers who are displaced by unfair trade and, in many cases, \nhave tremendous challenges getting from here to there--getting from a \nposition of joblessness because of unfair trade to training and \neducation and preparation for a new job or a new career.\n  We also just completed a debate about China's currency policy. We \nknow our recent history proves that when China cheats on its currency, \nwhich it has over a long period of time, we lose American jobs. So the \nSenate spoke in a loud voice, in a bipartisan way, to indicate that we \nare overdue. It is long past time to get tough with China. If they are \ngoing to cheat, there will be consequences when they cheat on their \ncurrency. So we have had some interesting debates, and we have focused \non jobs and we have focused on working together.\n  Finally, let me make a point before I get to the three basic \nquestions I have. The Joint Economic Committee, which I chair, released \na report today, and the report is entitled ``Nowhere to Go: Geographic \nand Occupational Immobility and Free Trade.'' It is dated today, \nOctober 12. I commend to my colleagues this report by the Joint \nEconomic Committee. I won't go through the whole report, but here is \nthe conclusion of the report itself:\n\n       Given the already high national unemployment rate and \n     depressed home values still evident in most states, policies \n     that seek to liberalize trade may impose even larger costs \n     on--\n\nolder workers and workers who don't have a college education, \ntherefore--\n\n     bolstering the need for additional investments in training or \n     other forms of trade-adjustment assistance.\n\n  So when people lose their jobs as a result of unfair trade and \nbecause of the ravages of what happens in the international \nmarketplace, what happens to an individual, to a company, and to a \ncommunity, if they are older workers and if they don't have an \neducation level that is commensurate with allowing them to adjust and \nto be able to respond to those dramatic changes, they will be much \nworse off. I think that is why these trade agreements are so important \nto debate.\n  We have limited time for debate and we have limited time for full \nconsideration, but I think we are going to have a number of hours to \nput some questions on the table. The first question I have is will \nthese trade agreements protect and create jobs in Pennsylvania, the \nState I represent, and across the country?\n  We know manufacturing is the core or probably the most important part \nof our job creation analysis. If we are making things, producing goods, \nengaged in advanced manufacturing, in new manufacturing--that we are \nseeing all over the country--if we are doing that at high levels and \nwith big job numbers, we are moving in the right direction. But, \nunfortunately, economic policies and trade policies have inhibited and \nbadly damaged our ability to create manufacturing jobs.\n  I know in Pennsylvania manufacturing is especially critical to what \nis still the largest source of jobs in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania--that sector of our economy. The benefits to manufacturing \njobs, of course, extend beyond individual companies, individual \nbusinesses. The economic benefits of a strong manufacturing sector are \nexperienced throughout the economy. They have a ripple effect, \nmultipliers beyond just that company.\n  In Pennsylvania, according to research commissioned by the \nPennsylvania Industrial Resources Centers, for every $1 increase in \ndemand for products manufactured in this country, that leads to a gain \nin gross value to the economy overall of $2.52. So $1 in by way of \nmanufacturing and $2.52 in return.\n  Furthermore, manufacturing jobs create and support middle-income \nfamilies. We know the wage level is higher and, therefore, those \nfamilies can benefit tremendously. In 2008, the average annual \ncompensation of a worker in the manufacturing sector was over $65,000. \nThe average pay for the rest of the workforce was $10,000 less. Each \ngood-paying job in the country allows for more money to flow back into \nthe economy. We know that.\n  Given the importance of protecting these critical manufacturing jobs, \nwe must ask ourselves: Will the trade agreements with South Korea, \nColombia, and Panama create jobs, especially in the manufacturing \nsector? Unfortunately, the answer to that question is no. All we need \nto do is look at the history. This is not theory. All we need to do is \nlook at recent history.\n  Trade-related job expansion has been, unfortunately, an unfulfilled \npromise to the people of Pennsylvania and across the country. In 1993, \nthe United States entered into the so-called NAFTA agreement, North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, which promised to deliver hundreds of \nthousands of jobs across the United States. Those gains were not \nrealized, especially in a State such as Pennsylvania. From 1993 to \n2002, 525,094 workers were certified as displaced under NAFTA, \naccording to the Department of Labor.\n  Overly optimistic job creation estimates were not the only flawed \nprojection. At that time, leaders suggested that NAFTA would expand \ndemand for American exports. That never came to be. In 1993, the United \nStates had a small trade surplus with Mexico. Let me say that word \nagain: We had a ``surplus'' in our trade with Mexico. By 2010, just 17 \nyears later, according to Census Bureau statistics, we had amassed a \ntrade deficit of $66.4 billion with Mexico. Our trade relationship with \nCanada tells the same story--a widening trade deficit from $10 billion \nin 1993 to $28.5 billion in 2010.\n  So we know and everyone knows this, that a trade deficit does lead to \njob losses. In Pennsylvania, we have seen a dramatic decline in \nmanufacturing employment since NAFTA was implemented, losing a total of \n308,100 manufacturing jobs. That is one State in that time period; so \nmore than 300,000 jobs lost just in Pennsylvania.\n  With this experience, we need to take a close look at the \ngovernment's projections for the pending agreements that are before us \nright now. While the International Trade Commission predicts our \nbilateral trade with Korea will improve--that is the assertion--the \ntotal U.S. trade deficit is predicted\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nto get larger which, if past experience is any gauge, will mean job \nlosses, not job gains.\n  According to the International Trade Commission, the agreement with \nColombia means--and I am quoting--\n\n       There is likely to be minimal to no effect on output or \n     employment for most sectors in the U.S. economy.\n\n  That is according to the International Trade Commission.\n  About the Panama agreement, the same commission concluded that the \nimpact of the Free Trade Agreement ``would likely be small because of \nthe small size of the Panamanian market relative to total U.S. trade \nand production.''\n  Simply put, even the always optimistic International Trade Commission \ndoes not see these agreements as job-creating measures. That is \nquestion No. 1, a direct question on jobs.\n  Question No. 2: Will this agreement create a level playing field? I \nwould assert the answer is no to that question.\n  Panama, while a very small economy, has one advantage to lure foreign \ninvestment. It remains a tax haven for companies that incorporate \nwithin its borders. As recently as 2009, Panama was listed on all major \ntax haven lists maintained by the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development, the so-called OECD; Global Forum on Taxation; the \nNational Bureau for Economic Research; and the Internal Revenue \nService. While the tax information exchange agreement signed since then \nmay address these issues, this same organization, the Organization for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development, has yet to evaluate whether \nPanamanian law will allow for effective enforcement pursuant to these \nagreements. Given the lack of definitive progress, I am concerned that \nthe Panama trade deal remains silent on this very basic issue.\n  Let me move to the question of what happens as it relates to Colombia \non this basic question about a level playing field.\n  Additionally, as it relates to Colombia, despite efforts to move that \ncountry toward a regime that tolerates workers' rights, Colombia \nremains one of the most dangerous places in the world for union workers \nto be working. While it has been greeted with great fanfare, nothing in \nthe so-called labor action plan negotiated between the United States \nand the Colombian Government--nothing--has required Colombia to \nestablish a measurable system for enforcement of these labor rights \nprior to ratification or implementation of the agreement. In fact, \nColombian companies can skirt many of the provisions in the so-called \naction plan--for example, by forcing new hires to sign a pledge \noffering higher salaries based upon a number of conditions, including \nnot joining a union.\n  Given the weakness of this plan, it is not surprising that violence \nagainst union workers remains commonplace in Colombia. Twenty-two union \nmembers and organizers have been killed in Colombia this year. Six \nCatholic priests known for working for the rights of the poor have also \nbeen targeted for assassination this year, leading the Catholic Bishops \nConference of Colombia to call for protection of its clergy. Imagine \nthat: union workers and priests needing protection in a country such as \nColombia.\n\n  Additionally, a June 8 study by the International Trade Union \nConfederation condemned the ongoing problems for labor organizers in \nColombia.\n  One simple comparison speaks volumes. In total, 49 union members were \nmurdered in Colombia in the year 2010--49 people. All other countries \ncombined had 41 killings of this kind. I do not think that needs any \nmore emphasis.\n  I am going to move now to a couple of comments as they relate to this \nlevel playing field question as it relates to South Korea.\n  We had a long debate and a good debate and a good consensus on a \nbipartisan basis as it relates to China's currency policy. I believe we \ntook a positive step forward in passing through the Senate a bipartisan \nbill to get tough with China when they cheat on their currency.\n  All the while, we did not say much about another country that has had \ncurrency problems, and that is South Korea. We know they have their own \nrecord on currency, and I am troubled by South Korea's currency \nmanipulation over time. They devalued their currency at least in very \nspecific time periods that we are aware of at least twice--once in 1998 \nand once in 1988. In fact, the most recent Treasury ``Report to \nCongress on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies''--a long \nname for a currency report--this report is dated May 27, 2011. It noted \nthat South Korea intervened ``heavily'' in its currency market during \nthe financial crisis and has continued uninterrupted since. So it has a \nhistory, but we also have current information, current evidence, recent \nevidence that South Korea has been intervening heavily in its currency \nmarket. Treasury urged--urged--South Korea to ``adopt a greater degree \nof exchange rate flexibility and less intervention.'' I think we could \nget a little tougher than that, be a little more direct and maybe have \nsome consequences, but that is the extent that Treasury is willing to \ngo.\n  So as we debate a trade agreement with a major country such as South \nKorea, we ought to know something about their currency policies, \nespecially in the aftermath of bipartisan currency legislation as it \nrelates to China.\n  I am pleased the Senate has passed this currency legislation this \npast week, and we are all hoping the House of Representatives will move \nquickly to consideration and passage of the currency legislation. But \nwe should not be entering into a trade agreement with South Korea at a \ntime when we know their currency policies are at best suspect and I \nthink worse than that.\n  Finally, let me lead to the last question of the three. The third \nquestion I have is: Does the agreement provide new opportunities for \nmanufacturers in Pennsylvania as well as other States to export their \ngoods?\n  The benefits of the agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama \nhave been, in my judgment, overstated, while the risks have been \nlargely ignored. Rather than opening a new market for Pennsylvania \nfarmers or Pennsylvania manufacturers, I fear the benefits to the \nUnited States are likely to be minimal at best.\n  There are specific reasons the South Korea deal fails to deliver for \nPennsylvania exporters as well. First, the most recent benefits are \nbased upon an overly optimistic projection for agriculture. These \nprojections, compiled by supporters of the agreement, assume that a cut \nin tariffs will immediately equal a growth in market share. We know \nfrom past experience that Asian markets, including South Korea, have \ncome up with a host of unjustified nontariff restrictions to keep U.S. \ngoods, particularly beef, out of their country. These barriers to free \ntrade are likely to limit export potential and are largely unaddressed \nin the agreement.\n  There are other troubling clauses, as well, dealing with, in this \ncase, the beef industry. The South Korea agreement will allow American \nbeef packagers to use Canadian or Mexican cattle and then export the \npackaged Mexican and/or Canadian beef as ``American'' beef. This \npolicy, while great for beef packagers, undercuts U.S. ranchers.\n  Another problem with the Korea deal is which goods will qualify for \nthe ``Made in South Korea'' designation or sticker. Which will qualify \nfor that? And therefore, if they have that, they are allowed to enter \nthe U.S. duty free. Under the rules of origin in annex 6-A of the \nagreement, 65 percent of the value of many goods, including \nautomobiles, shipped duty free to the United States can come from \noutside--just imagine this--outside of South Korea and still be \nconsidered ``Made in South Korea.'' That defies description. It is \ninternally inconsistent at best, and it is contradictory for sure. This \nstandard is lower than the European Union agreement, where only 55 \npercent of content can be foreign and once again places our companies \nat a comparative disadvantage to international competition. \nFurthermore, this policy opens the door for products primarily made \nfrom Chinese parts to enter the United States duty free. That makes no \nsense at all.\n  Earlier I posed these questions. The first I posed was: Will these \nagreements create a substantial number of new jobs? They will not. If \nprevious agreements are any indication at all, the South Korea, \nColombia, and Panama agreements will not create jobs in the\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\nway they are projected to and will, in fact, lead to job losses, \nespecially in manufacturing.\n  The second question: Will the agreements help create a level playing \nfield? They will not. The agreements fail to address critical issues \nsuch as violence against union members, as well as currency \nmanipulation by, for example, South Korea.\n  The third question: Does the agreement provide new opportunities for \nAmerican manufacturers to export? Proponents have overstated the \nbenefits. Certain industries and firms are likely to benefit for sure, \nwhile others will not.\n  While it is clear that in its failure to address nontariff barriers \nto trade, the agreement leaves American firms unprotected on an unlevel \nplaying field.\n  Finally, based upon this set of questions and, more importantly, the \nanswer to those questions, I will vote against the agreements with \nSouth Korea, Panama, and Colombia.\n  It is my job as a Senator from Pennsylvania to fight for Pennsylvania \njobs, and for too long the needs and the concerns of the jobs of \nPennsylvania's workers have been last on the list when it comes to \ntrade agreements. The fact is that past trade agreements have failed \nPennsylvania and our workers, and I refuse to support new foreign trade \nagreements without reasonable debate and adequate answers for the \nquestions that I pose and especially as it relates to jobs and the \nimpact on workers.\n  Instead of moving ahead quickly with what is a broken model, we need \nto focus on the biggest picture: formulating a strategy that helps \nAmerican manufacturers, that leads to job creation, and that creates a \nstronger middle class. We need a trade policy in the United States of \nAmerica. We do not have one right now. We need one that is bipartisan \nin nature.\n  To make real, sustained progress, Washington needs to have a \nstrategy. We must develop and commit ourselves to a national \nmanufacturing strategy as part of a trade policy that includes job-\ncreating trade agreements, not job-killing trade agreements. \nManufacturing is the heart and soul of our Commonwealth and our \ncountry. Our future's success depends upon developing policies that \nallow our people to create jobs and compete in the global production of \ngoods. I know our workers are up to it. If we give them the tools and \nthe agreements and the policies to do just that, they will outcompete \nanybody in the world, any country in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me begin by concurring with much of what the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has said. I think he is right-on. Like him, I rise \ntoday in strong opposition to the unfettered free-trade agreements with \nKorea, Colombia, and Panama. Let's be clear. One of the major reasons \nwhy the middle class in America is disappearing and why poverty is \nincreasing and why the gap between the very wealthy and everybody else \nis growing wider is directly related to our disastrous, unfettered \nfree-trade policy. If the United States is to remain a major industrial \npower, producing real products and creating good-paying jobs, we cannot \ncontinue the failed, unfettered free-trade policies that have been in \nexistence for the last 30 years.\n  We need to develop trade policies--I know this is a radical idea--\nthat work for working people and not just the CEOs of large \ncorporations. What we must do is rebuild our manufacturing sector and \nonce again create millions of good-paying jobs where workers are \nproducing real products made in the United States of America.\n  Over the last decade, more than 50,000 manufacturing plants in this \ncountry have shut down. Let me repeat that. In the last decade, more \nthan 50,000 factories in this country have shut down. Over 5.5 million \nfactory jobs have disappeared.\n  Back in 1970, 25 percent of all jobs in the United States were \nmanufacturing jobs, often paying workers a living wage, decent \nbenefits, pensions. Today, that figure is down to just 9 percent.\n  In July of 2000, there were 17.3 million manufacturing workers in \nthis country. Today, there are only 11.7 million.\n  According to a recent study conducted by a well-respected economist \nat the Economic Policy Institute, permanent normal trade relations with \nChina has led to the loss of 2.8 million jobs. In fact, the United \nStates has lost an average of about 50,000 manufacturing jobs per month \nsince China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\n  I was in the House of Representatives when PNTR with China was \npassed. I can remember all of the fine speeches from the President on \ndown, Republicans, Democrats: Permanent normal trade relations with \nChina is going to open up that great market, going to create millions \nof jobs in America. It was not true. Free trade with China ended up \ncosting us 2.8 million jobs. You don't have to be an economist to \nunderstand that; all you have to do is walk into any department store \nin America and buy a product. Do you know where that product is made? \nIt is not made in the United States of America, it is made in China.\n  We all now understand what that trade agreement was about. It was not \nto open markets in China for American products, it was to open China so \ncorporations in this country could shut down here, throw American \nworkers out on the street, and move there in order to pay workers \npennies an hour. That is what those trade agreements are about. There \nis no doubt in my mind that--certainly to a much lesser degree because \nthey are smaller trade agreements--trade agreements with Korea, Panama, \nand Colombia will continue that same process.\n  The U.S. Department of Commerce has reported that over the last \ndecade, U.S. multinational corporations slashed 2.9 million jobs. Now \nthe biggest advocate of unfettered free trade, of NAFTA with Mexico, of \nPNTR with China, of these trade agreements, is corporate America. It is \nthe chamber of commerce, it is the National Association of \nManufacturing. They spend huge sums of money on lobbying and campaign \ncontributions in order to make Congress vote for these great trade \nagreements.\n  Let me repeat. Over the last decade, these very same corporations \nthat want us to pass these disastrous trade agreements slashed 2.9 \nmillion American jobs. Furthermore, what we have learned is that during \nthat same period of time--and here is the kicker--these same \ncorporations have created 2.4 million jobs. The only problem is that \nthose jobs were created in China, Mexico, and other low-wage countries.\n  What we have here is that key advocates for continuing this \ndisastrous trade policy are precisely the people who have been slashing \njobs in America, closing down factories, and hiring people abroad. And \nI would suggest that Members of the Senate might want to think twice \nabout listening to the advice of people who have been laying off \nmillions of American workers.\n  Oddly enough, again we have one of the leading advocates for these \ndisastrous trade agreements--it is the chamber of commerce. Well, some \nyears ago, the chamber of commerce, to its credit, was pretty up front. \nThey said outsourcing is a good idea. They recommended to American \ncorporations: Shut down in America and move abroad. It is good for your \nstockholders.\n  Do you really want to take the advice of people who believe that \noutsourcing and throwing American workers out on the street is a good \nidea? I do not think so.\n  Today we are hearing all of this talk about how these trade \nagreements are going to create new jobs. We heard it before. It is the \nsame old movie. The American people understand it is a bad movie. It is \nan unfactual movie.\n  During the Clinton administration, we were told by Republicans and \nDemocrats and then-President Clinton that NAFTA would create 100,000 \nAmerican jobs over a 2-year period. That is what we were told about \nNAFTA. Well, results are in on NAFTA. Instead of creating 100,000 \nAmerican jobs, the Economic Policy Institute has found that NAFTA \ndestroyed more than 682,000 American jobs, including the loss of \n150,000 computer and electronic jobs.\n  I do not understand why, when you have a policy that has failed and \nfailed, you want to continue that policy. Football teams that have \ncoaches with losing records get rid of those coaches. When you have a \ntrade policy that has\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\nresulted in millions of American workers losing their jobs, you do not \ncontinue that same philosophy.\n  The issue here is not just Mexico and NAFTA, it is not just PNTR with \nChina, it is obviously what is going to happen with the trade \nagreements that are before us today, Korea, Panama, and Colombia.\n  The Economic Policy Institute has estimated that the Korea Free Trade \nAgreement will lead to the loss of 159,000 American jobs and will \nincrease the trade deficit by nearly $14 billion over a 7-year period. \nWhy would you want to go forward with those ideas? Why would you want \nto go forward with a trade agreement that will increase our trade \ndeficit?\n  President Obama has estimated that the Korea Free Trade Agreement \nwill support at least 70,000 American jobs. But the headline of a \nDecember 7, 2010, article in the New York Times says it all: ``Few New \nJobs Expected Soon From Free-Trade Agreement With South Korea.'' \nAccording to this article, the Korea Free Trade Agreement ``is likely \nto result in little if any net job creation in the short run, according \nto the government's own analysis.''\n\n  Let me touch on one particular aspect of the Korea Free Trade \nAgreement that I find especially troubling and that I think the \nAmerican people, to the degree they understand this and learn about it, \nwill also find troubling; that is, this particular free-trade agreement \nwill force American workers to compete not just against the low-wage \nworkers in China or Vietnam or Mexico, they are going to be forced to \ncompete against the virtual slave labor that exists in North Korea, the \nmost undemocratic country in the world and a country itself whose \ngovernment will financially benefit from this, with the dictatorship of \nKim Jong Il.\n  We all know that under current law the United States has an embargo \non all North Korean goods--for a very good reason. Workers in North \nKorea are the most brutalized in the world, have virtually no \ndemocratic rights, and are at the mercy of the most vicious dictator in \nthe world. But after the South Korea Free Trade Agreement is signed \ninto law, the United States would have a new obligation to allow South \nKorean products to come into our country tariff-free that contain major \nparts made by North Korean workers who make pennies an hour.\n  According to a January 2011 report from the Congressional Research \nService, ``There is nothing to prevent South Korean firms from \nperforming intermediate manufacturing operations in North Korea and \nthen performing final manufacturing processes in South Korea.'' In \nother words, there is a huge industrial park in North Korea. South \nKorean companies own that park. Workers there are paid horrendously low \nwages, and some of those wages go right to the North Korean Government. \nProducts made in that industrial park in North Korea will go to South \nKorea and then will come back into the United States as part of that \nso-called free-trade agreement.\n  Today, over 47,000 North Korean workers currently are employed by \nmore than 120 South Korean firms, including Hyundai, at the Kaesong \nIndustrial Complex in North Korea.\n  This facility is located just 6 miles north of the demilitarized \nzone, with direct road and rail access to South Korea and just an \nhour's drive away from Seoul.\n  These North Korean workers officially make a minimum wage of 35 cents \nan hour, but they actually make less than that.\n  Instead of paying these workers directly, Hyundai and the other South \nKorean firms pay the North Korean Government. How is that? South Korean \ncompanies--major companies--pay the North Korean Government. They take \na piece of the action, which is going to the most undemocratic, vicious \ndictatorship in the world. The products then go to South Korea, and \nthey are part of the free-trade agreement with South Korea.\n  In 2007, Han Duck-soo, who was then the Prime Minister of South Korea \nand is the current South Korean Ambassador to the United States, said \nthis:\n\n       The planned ratification of the South Korea-U.S. free trade \n     agreement will pave the way for the export of products built \n     in Kaesong [North Korea] to the U.S. market.\n\n  So what we have now is American workers being forced to compete \nagainst desperate people all over the world, who are making a tiny \nfraction of the wages that are paid in America, and forced to compete \nagainst countries where there are no environmental standards, where \nworker unions are not recognized or respected.\n  But now it gets even worse. American workers are now being forced to \ncompete against the virtual slave labor in North Korea as part of this \ntrade agreement.\n  What about the Colombia Free Trade Agreement? It is understandable \nwhy the CEOs of multinational corporations would like this free-trade \nagreement. After all, Colombia is one of the most anti-union countries \non the planet.\n  Since 1986, over 2,800 trade unionists have been assassinated in \nColombia--more than the rest of the world combined. Think about it for \na moment. If we found out that 50 CEOs had been assassinated in \nColombia last year instead of trade leaders, do you think we would be \non the verge of approving a free-trade agreement with that country? \nFrankly, I don't think so.\n  Lastly, let me say a brief word about Panama and the Panama free-\ntrade agreement. Panama's entire economic output is only $26.7 billion \na year or about two-tenths of 1 percent of the U.S. economy. Nobody can \nlegitimately claim that approving this free-trade agreement will \nsignificantly increase American jobs.\n  Then why would we be considering a stand-alone free trade agreement \nwith Panama? It turns out that Panama is a world leader when it comes \nto allowing wealthy Americans and large corporations to evade U.S. \ntaxes by stashing their cash in offshore tax havens. The Panama Free \nTrade Agreement will make this bad situation much worse.\n  Each and every year, the wealthiest people in our country and the \nlargest corporations evade about $100 billion in U.S. taxes through \nabusive and illegal offshore tax havens in Panama and other countries.\n  According to Citizens for Tax Justice:\n\n       A tax haven . . . has one of three characteristics: it has \n     no income tax or a very low rate income tax; it has bank \n     secrecy laws; and it has a history of non-cooperation with \n     other countries on exchanging information about tax matters. \n     Panama has all three of those. . . . They're probably the \n     worst.\n\n  Let me conclude--and I will be back on the floor later to amplify on \nthese remarks. I will conclude by saying this: If you go out to any \ncommunity in America and you ask the people in those communities--\nespecially working people--do you think our current free-trade \nagreements, such as NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with \nChina, have worked, and have they been creating jobs in your community \nor have you seen factories shut down, I suspect that in almost every \ninstance people will say these free-trade agreements are not working \nfor American workers. They are costing us jobs.\n  That is what the American people understand to be true because it is \ntrue. So it seems to me that when you have a history of failed trade \npolicies--policies that have enabled and encouraged large corporations \nto shut down in this country and move abroad, it is insane to continue \nthat policy if you are serious about creating jobs in America, \nrebuilding our manufacturing sector, and trying to address the crises \nfacing the middle class today.\n  We need new trade policies. Trade unto itself is a good idea. \nEverybody believes in trade. But you need trade policies that are \ndesigned to help ordinary working people and not just wealthy CEOs.\n  I feel very strongly that the policies we are debating today--trade \npolicies with Korea, Panama, and Colombia--are nothing more than \nextensions of disastrous trade policies of the past. They should be \ndefeated. We should come together and develop new approaches to trade, \nwhich will benefit all our people and not just CEOs or multinational \ncorporations.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Sanders has raised some \nquestions about our trade policy. I do believe we need to examine our \ntrade policies more carefully. As I have said in the last few days, we \nneed to defend our legitimate interests as a nation, and I have \nsupported legislation that would curtail China's ability to manipulate \nits currency to gain a trade advantage over us.\n  Trade agreements are not a religious thing with me. I think some of \nthe free traders are accused of believing it is a religious thing--that \nwhatever you do to further trade, even if we are at a disadvantage, \nsomehow it is still better for us to sign these agreements; that we \nshould just do this and not worry about it--cancer will be cured, peace \nwill occur in the world, we will all be better friends, and things will \nhappen good.\n  Things do tend to happen good when you have a trading relationship \nwith a nation. I will support all three of these trade agreements. But \nI believe it is healthy to have Senators examine and make sure that \nthese are the kinds of agreements that advance our national interest. \nIs this the kind of trading partner we feel comfortable signing an \nagreement with? Will they honor it? Do we have prospects for improved \ntrade over the years that could help both our countries?\n  Any business that does business with another business presumes it \nwill be beneficial to them, and the other company that agreed to do \nbusiness with this other company assumes it will be good for them. \nCertainly, any kind of contract, any kind of agreement that is a \nlegitimate agreement of value benefits both parties. That is very \nachievable. It can be achievable in the trade world.\n\n  I believe that with regard to Colombia, South Korea, and Panama, we \nhave reason to believe they will be good trading partners. Colombia is \nthe longest democracy in South America. They had to go for over a \ndecade dealing with narcotrafficking, a Communist guerrilla force, and \nwe were able to help them defeat their enemy. They are now prospering. \nThey have elections. The Congress is doing a good job. They are \nhonoring their agreements. The people of Colombia are positive about \nthe people in the United States. I have been there and I appreciate \nthat.\n  As a native of Alabama and on the gulf coast, it is a direct shot \nsouth to Colombia. We have every reason to believe we can have a \npositive trading relationship with Colombia.\n  Panama is much smaller, but they have done well. A lot of people \ndoubted their ability to function successfully as a government. I think \nPanama has been doing very well, and they believe in trade and want to \nbe good trading partners. All of these will have to be watched. South \nKorea is one of our best allies in the world. We have huge amounts of \nsoldiers there and basing in Korea. We do many things together. Korea \nhas invested billions of dollars in the United States of America.\n  The Hyundai plant that makes the Sonata automobiles--one of the most \npopular automobiles in America today--is in Montgomery, AL. There are \n3,000 workers, plus additional suppliers, many of which are Korean \ncompanies that have invested here and hired Alabamans--Americans--to \nwork in their plant, and they do this around the country. They are \nhonorable and when they sign agreements, you can expect them, as well \nor better than most nations, to adhere to it. They are disciplined \npeople with integrity and they are smart and well educated. They are \nallies--strategic allies.\n  So in each one of these agreements, it is my best judgment that it \nwill be beneficial to us. For example, with regard to Colombia, under \nthe Andean Trade Agreement, basically, they can import products into \nthe United States with no duty, for the most part. But this agreement \nis critical to them producing their tariffs on the products that we \nship to Colombia. Colombia buys a lot of our products. They are one of \nthe best customers we have in South America. They have a positive view \nof the United States. I have a very positive view of Colombia.\n  My thought on these agreements would be that, yes, I think each one \nof these agreements has been negotiated sufficiently well to ensure \nthat we will have a beneficial relationship. It will help us be more \neconomically strong than we would be if we did not have these \nagreements. We are in a world economy. It makes no sense to me to think \nwe can just build a wall around the United States and stop trade from \noccurring. That doesn't make sense to me. But I do believe that each \nand every trade agreement has to be carefully considered, and I expect \nthe USTR to enforce the laws we pass.\n  We need to be sure we have the mechanisms in place to assure that \nthose with whom we agree to trade will follow fair trade, will follow \nthe terms of the contract, and will otherwise follow the requirements \nof a decent trading partner. I believe all three of these countries \nwill do that. I think all three of these countries represent decent \ngovernments.\n  All three of these countries are allies of the United States. With \nregard to all three of these countries, I believe the signing of these \ntreaties will enhance our economic vitality and will be good for us. I \nsuggest, however, that it is not going to be an overnight boom. Trading \nis a two-way street. We will have economic advantage, and that is \nsufficient to me. It will be felt over decades. It has been said by \nsomeone--and I see Senator McCain and he can probably remember who said \nit--that there has never been a war between two countries, both of \nwhich have a MacDonald's.\n  Now, I don't know if that is accurate anymore or not, but most of the \nwars we get into are with countries that are isolated, backward, and \ninsular. Trade can reduce the chance of war and hostile relations \nbetween nations. It can build positive relations.\n  So from that point of view, Mr. President, I think these trade \nagreements are agreements I can support. I believe my colleagues, if \nthey analyze them, will reach the same conclusion. We are showing \nsubstantial increases in our exports to all three of these countries, \nand I do believe our exports would increase more with these agreements \nif they are ratified.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Brown, be next to speak following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support ratification of the three free-\ntrade agreements we are debating. They are long overdue, and they are \nimportant to job creation in this country. While we have waited around, \nthese countries have concluded free-trade agreements with other \ncountries, much to the detriment of American exports.\n  The best example I can cite of that is several years ago, 40 percent \nof the imports of agricultural products into Colombia were from the \nUnited States of America, while today only 20 percent of their \nagricultural imports are from the United States because while we have \nbeen waiting, Colombia has concluded free-trade agreements with other \nnations which have given them access to their markets while we were not \nable to expand. One of the ironies of all this is, thanks to a rather \ncomplicated process that took place during President Clinton's \nadministration, the results of the Andean trade preference agreements \nmeant there were tariffs on U.S. goods going into Colombia but no \ntariff on Colombian goods coming into the United States.\n  But why I am here this afternoon, Mr. President, is because what has \nbeen unremarked on--and which was outrageous about this whole process \nwe have been through in these times of fiscal difficulties--is that \nroughly $1.3 billion is going to be spent on the so-called TAA, trade \nadjustment assistance. I would like to remind my colleagues the TAA was \nadopted in order to satisfy many of the concerns of labor and others at \nthe time of the passage of other free-trade agreements, and like other \ngovernment programs, spending on the TAA has grown and grown and grown \nand grown.\n  By the way, this was supposed to be for individuals, and, originally \nat least, individuals who have lost their jobs as a result of jobs \ngoing to the countries which free-trade agreements were entered into.\n  In 2006, it was $735 million; in 2007, $779 million; and in 2008, \n$791 million.\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\nBut following the so-called stimulus package--and the stimulus was \nsupposed to be temporary--it ballooned to $1.1 billion.\n  Additionally, according to the Department of Labor, Congress \nallocated more than $975 million to fund other TAA services, including \n$575 million for job training. In all, the annual TAA spending for the \nstimulus expansion totaled approximately $2 billion.\n  Three weeks ago, the Congress passed an agreement to reauthorize the \nTAA through 2014. This paved the way for these free-trade agreements to \nbe considered today. The agreement pares back some of the expansions \nfrom the 2009 stimulus and funds the program somewhere between the \nprestimulus and poststimulus levels. This ``compromise,'' which, by the \nway, was negotiated by Republicans in the House of Representatives, \nwill increase the annual TAA spending by at least $460 million above \nthe prestimulus levels before 2012 and 2013. Therefore, the total cost \nto taxpayers for the deal to allow these trade agreements to be \nconsidered by the Senate will be $1.3 billion through 2014.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, the TAA spending legislation \npassed by this body 3 weeks ago does the following: No. 1, it keeps the \n2009 stimulus expansion for service sector workers. The stimulus, by \nthe way, was supposed to be temporary. TAA was originally intended to \nprovide income maintenance and job training to workers from the \nmanufacturing sector. The stimulus bill expanded eligibility to include \nworkers from the service and public sectors. This expansion expired in \nFebruary, but the agreement restored TAA eligibility for service sector \nworkers.\n  No. 2, it restored the stimulus expansion of benefits for job losses \nthat are unrelated to free-trade agreements. The agreement retained the \nstimulus expansion of providing TAA benefits to any workers who lost \ntheir jobs to overseas production, not just TAA-certified jobs that \nwere lost to free-trade agreements.\n  No. 3, it reinstated the stimulus's 160 percent increase in trade \nadjustment assistance for workers' job training spending. The proposal \ncemented the stimulus spending expansion of TAA for workers' job \ntraining at $575 million a year from $220 million, an increase of $355 \nmillion a year.\n  No. 4, it continued the stimulus's creation of a new and duplicative \njob-training program. The agreement kept the TAA Community College and \nCareer Training Program, which will dole out $2 billion over the years \n2011 through 2014.\n  So this program cries out for significant reform. The previous \nadministration's agency leader called for FAA deficiencies to be \naddressed for the displaced workers who need the TAA benefits. In \ntestimony before the House Ways and Means Committee on June 14, 2007, \nthe Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor called on Congress to take the \n``opportunity to improve the current TAA program to help workers gain \nthe skills needed to successfully compete in the global economy.'' The \nadministration didn't listen and neither did Congress.\n  Let's look at an example of excess created in the temporary stimulus \nexpansion of the TAA program that taxpayers are still on the hook for. \nAccording to a February 2011 study by Senator Coburn entitled, ``Help \nWanted: How Federal Job Training Programs are Failing Workers,'' \nquoting from the study that Senator Coburn brought to this body:\n\n       Taxpayers may have a case of indigestion when they learn, \n     nearly 2 years after the stimulus was enacted, their money is \n     paying lobstermen, shrimpers and blueberry farmers $12,000 \n     each to attend job training sessions on jobs that they are \n     already trained to do. The stimulus reauthorized the Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance for the Farmers program administered by \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a program that provides \n     subsidies to producers of raw agricultural commodities and \n     fishermen so they can adjust to import competition. Under the \n     stimulus, TAA benefits were enhanced to focus more on \n     employment retraining.\n  Recently, the Department of Labor issued a report on the TAA program \nwhich indicated that only approximately 50 percent of the TAA training \nparticipants were actually placed in new jobs. While we can be happy \nfor the 50 percent that used the training for new employment, a 50-\npercent success level is, of course, dismally low. Our obligation \nshould have been to reform and fix the flaws in the program. Instead, \nwe expanded it.\n  I am a big supporter of America's community colleges. One of the best \ncommunity college networks happens to be in my home State of Arizona. \nIt has been suggested that the TAA for Community Colleges Program, \nwhich was vastly expanded in the stimulus bill, has become nothing but \na vehicle to funnel scarce tax dollars to community colleges around the \ncountry whether they need the money or not, with no performance \nreviews, no standards for graduation, and no oversight.\n  In March 2010, the Senate and House leadership, together with the \nadministration, funded the TAA for Community Colleges Program $2 \nbillion over 4 years. Just last month--conveniently, right before the \nend of the fiscal year--the Department of Labor rolled out the money to \nindividual community colleges and consortiums of community colleges. \nThe money started flowing without regard to how well the community \ncolleges did at graduating their students or whether there was \nsufficient TAA need.\n  Several of the community colleges have received grants of over $2\\1/\n2\\ million of taxpayer funds while having extremely low graduation \nrates. Shouldn't we ensure that an institution can actually graduate \nits students before funneling money to it?\n  For example, Oklahoma City Community College received $2.7 million. \nThis institution had a graduation rate of 11 percent. If there was any \ndoubt that the administration was using this program to funnel money to \ncommunity colleges without regard to need or their ability to help \ndislocated workers receive training, let me just read from the \nDepartment of Labor grant announcement issued last week.\n\n       The following is a list of the entities in each State that \n     will be receiving funding. The Department of Labor's \n     Employment and Training Administration is continuing to work \n     with these institutions to develop final performance \n     operating and spending plans.\n\n  Earlier this year, the GAO released a study entitled ``Multiple \nTraining and Employment Programs: Providing Information on Collocating \nServices and Consolidating Administrative Structures Could Promote \nEfficiencies.'' Here is what the GAO reported on Federal employment and \nretraining programs, including trade adjustment assistance.\n\n       Based on our survey of agency officials, we determined that \n     only 5 of the 47 programs have had impact studies that assess \n     whether the program is responsible for improved employment \n     outcomes. The five impact studies generally found that the \n     effects of participation were not consistent across programs, \n     with only some demonstrating positive impacts that tended to \n     be small, inclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts.\n\n  So what are we doing? We are going to spend at least $1.3 billion, \npart of it on programs that clearly the Government Accountability \nOffice says have not been productive in any way and are small, \ninclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts.\n  There are a lot of questions about the TAA Program. Does the TAA \nProgram provide overly generous benefits to a narrow population? \nAccording to an analysis from the Heritage Foundation, based on \nstatistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the third quarter of \nfiscal year 2009 only 1 percent of mass layoffs were the result of \nimport competition or overseas relocation.\n  Is there evidence that TAA benefits and training help participants' \nearnings? An analysis by Professor Kara M. Reynolds of American \nUniversity found ``little evidence that it [TAA] helps displaced \nworkers find new, well-paying employment opportunities.'' In fact, TAA \nparticipants experienced a wage loss of 10 percent. The same study \nfound that, in fiscal 2007, the Federal Government appropriated $885.1 \nmillion to TAA programs. Of this amount, funding for training programs \naccounted for only 25 percent.\n\n  In 2007, the Office of Management and Budget rated the TAA programs \nas ``ineffective.'' The OMB found that the TAA Program fails to use tax \ndollars effectively because, among other reasons, the program has \nfailed to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of achieving its goals.\n  Let me close by reminding my colleagues how we got to our current \npredicament. It is mid-October of 2011, 2\\1/2\\ years since President \nObama took office, and we are just now considering\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\nthese important trade agreements that were finalized half a decade ago, \nall because of the White House's insistence on making a temporary \nstimulus program--the dubious extension of TAA--into a permanent \ndomestic spending program.\n  This is how George Will summed it up, writing in the Washington Post, \non June 8, 2011:\n\n       President Obama is sacrificing economic growth and job \n     creation in order to placate organized labor. And as the \n     crisis of the welfare state deepens, he is trying to enlarge \n     the entitlement system and exacerbate the entitlement \n     mentality.\n       On May 4, the administration announced that, at last, it \n     was ready to proceed with congressional ratification of the \n     agreements. On May 16, however, it announced it would not \n     send them until Congress expands an entitlement program \n     favored by unions.\n       Since 1974, Trade Adjustment Assistance has provided 104, \n     and then 156, weeks of myriad financial aid, partly \n     concurrent with the 99 weeks of unemployment compensation, to \n     people, including farmers and government workers and firms, \n     even whole communities, that can more or less plausibly claim \n     to have lost their jobs or been otherwise injured because of \n     foreign competition. Even if the injury is just the loss of \n     unfair advantages conferred, at the expense of other \n     Americans, by government protectionism.\n\n  This process should be appalling to the average American who is \nlooking for an improving economy, not special favors to certain special \ninterest groups.\n  Our national debt has reached unsustainable levels. Congress and the \nAmerican people face some truly painful choices about how to cut our \nFederal budget. At a time when some are even considering enormous and \ndangerous cuts to our defense spending as a way to get our fiscal house \nin order, we shouldn't be throwing more and more scarce money at a \nFederal program that, as the GAO points out, is duplicative and \npossibly ineffective.\n  There is guilt on both sides of the aisle for the extension of this \nprogram. It has not had proper scrutiny, it has not had proper \noversight. The studies that have been done have shown that it is \npractically useless--or certainly not useful--and ineffective; and now, \nas a price for these free-trade agreements, which I strongly support, \nwe will be laying another $2 billion on the taxpayers of America, \nunfortunately.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain my position \non the free trade agreements/trade adjustment assistance package.\n  I support the free trade agreements, FTAs, with Panama, Colombia, and \nSouth Korea, and only wish these agreements had been taken up sooner. \nThe FTAs represent true, bipartisan jobs legislation, and I am pleased \nthey will soon become law. Free trade agreements have proven to be one \nof the best ways to open up foreign markets to American exporters. \nThese agreements will create tens of thousands of new jobs by boosting \nAmerican exports to three nations. The FTAs will also strengthen \nAmerica's interests in two strategically important regions.\n  I do not, however, support the trade adjustment assistance, TAA, deal \nthat was negotiated as part of the compromise to pass the FTAs. Nor do \nI think it should have been included in the FTA negotiations.\n  I have several key objections. First is the enormous costs. Over the \nnext 3 years, the TAA deal adds over $1.15 billion in new costs to the \nbaseline TAA costs. Together, baseline TAA and these provisions will \ncost almost $6 billion for the 2011-2013 fiscal years.\n  Second, the TAA deal does not represent a true compromise. The \nproposal was made only by three of the strongest TAA supporters. No \ncritic of TAA was included in the negotiations.\n  Third, the umbrella of TAA programs deserved greater scrutiny than \nthe process allowed. Instead of a moving a reauthorization with some \nrudimentary changes, fundamental reform should have been completed. \nThere is little evidence that the TAA programs are actually effective, \nand, under this deal, we are going to spend billions of dollars on \nthese programs without knowing whether they actually help Americans. \nMoreover, no work was done to reform the TAA training funding to \nreflect the fact that there are already over 40 programs dedicated to \nworker training.\n  Fourth, the TAA deal represents false reform. Proponents try to take \ncredit for eliminating two grant programs within TAA for communities--\nprograms which were already repealed. Proponents also cite the \nelimination of the mandatory nature of TAA for farmers/fisheries, which \nwere already defunded for other purposes. Only in Washington would \nsomeone try to take credit for ``ending'' programs that no longer exist \nor that have no funding.\n  Proponents also claim that the size of the TAA for firms program was \nreduced. But that program represents a status quo authorization and is \none already targeted by President Obama for elimination. How does level \nfunding and rejecting a repeal recommendation constitute reform?\n  For these reasons, and others, I voted against the trade adjustment \nassistance legislation when it was considered a few weeks ago. The FTAs \nare sufficiently meritorious on their own accord without tying in a \npoorly designed and operated social welfare program such as TAA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I would like to speak in opposition \nto these three pending free-trade agreements.\n  The bills look like they are about this size. These are the actual \nimplementing of the three free-trade agreements. But one of the bills, \nand not the largest one--the one, in fact, of the three countries we \nare probably today passing trade agreements with, Colombia, South \nKorea, and Panama--the smallest by far in terms of its economy is \nPanama, and this is the trade agreement with Panama.\n  I remember all these conservative talk radio people saying: Have you \nread the bill? Have you read the bill? Have you read the bill? Every \ntime it is a bill they don't agree with, they ask: Have you read the \nbill? This isn't just to eliminate the tariffs we have with the \nRepublic of Panama. If these agreements were about eliminating tariffs \nwith labor standards--and I know the Presiding Officer from Oregon \nshares that view about labor standards. If these agreements were about \neliminating tariffs and labor standards, they would be about this big. \nThey wouldn't be anything like this. But these are chock-full of \nspecial interest deals. It is what this body always does: the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico; the PNTR with \nChina, a different kind of situation but leading to even more problems; \nthe Central American Free Trade Agreement with six countries in Central \nAmerica and the Dominican Republic. Rules that help the drug companies, \nrules that help the insurance companies, special interest provisions \nthat help the banks, special interest provisions that undermine public \nhealth and undermine safely, that is what these free-trade agreements \nare about.\n  I get it. I get it that this is greased. I get it that this will pass \nwith overwhelming numbers. I get it that this White House is only this \nmuch better than the last White House in pushing for these trade \nagreements. These are Bush trade agreements, Korea, Colombia, and \nPanama. President Obama inherited them, but he doesn't get off the hook \nbecause he has improved these slightly. We have a little bit of an \nimprovement with Korea so a few more American cars can be sold into \nKorea, nothing like the number of Korean cars that can be sold in the \nUnited States because we didn't want to be that tough when we \nnegotiated, so we just make slight changes. This President made slight \nchanges, and I have seen this. I was in the House for 14 years, and in \nmy first term in the Senate I have seen this kind of game played by \nadministration after administration. This is technically my fourth \nadministration I have worked with, third at some length, and I have \nseen this over and over and over again.\n  When I hear of these trade agreements coming forward, every President \nsays this is going to create tens of thousands of jobs. NAFTA was going \nto create 200,000 jobs, almost immediately, the first Bush \nadministration said. The Clinton administration said: Yes; that is \nright. It is going to create more or less 200,000 jobs immediately. Do \nyou know what it has created? It has created a loss of 600,000 jobs \nunder the North American Free Trade Agreement. We gain some jobs; we \nlose some jobs, but the net is always lost jobs.\n  How many times is an administration going to come forward and how\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\nmany times are we going to believe them? Fool me once, shame on you. \nFool me twice, shame on me. This body continues, as the House of \nRepresentatives does--they are a little smarter in the House; they \ndon't pass these with quite the same numbers in the overwhelming \nmargins, but they continue to do the same thing over and over and over.\n  The American public doesn't like these trade agreements. The American \npublic, in large numbers, under poll after poll after poll--the \nAmerican people don't like NAFTA, don't like CAFTA, don't like PNTR \nwith China. Why do you think last night, finally, this body stood--63 \nMembers of the Senate, almost 20 of them Republicans, voted to finally \nstand up on currency and try to create a level playing field in our \ntrade with China? But we don't do it on these other trade agreements. \nWith the lobbying efforts on NAFTA, on CAFTA, on PNTR with China, on \nthe Panama Trade Agreement, on the Colombia Trade Agreement, on the \nKorea Trade Agreement, the lobbying is overwhelming. Special interest \ngroups line up because they are so excited about passing these free-\ntrade agreements. In the end, we lose jobs every single time.\n  When I came to the Congress 20 years ago, we had a trade surplus with \nMexico and, if I recall, a small trade deficit with Canada. That means \nwe sold more to Mexico than we bought from them. We bought more from \nCanada than we sold to them. Today, it is tens of billions of dollars' \ntrade deficit we have trilaterally with those two countries.\n  The China trade deficit 10 years ago, when China got into the World \nTrade Organization because we passed PNTR in part--that is part of the \nreason they got in--our trade deficit with China was something like $80 \nbillion; today, it is almost $300 billion, more than three times the \ntrade deficit with China. So our answer is, let's do more of it.\n  So China undercuts our manufacturing. NAFTA takes away American jobs. \nCAFTA costs us jobs. Yet the geniuses around here, the people--and the \nmajority leader has been wonderful in this, opposing trade agreement \nafter trade agreement because he gets it--the geniuses around this \nplace, in the White House, in the House leadership, in some of the \nSenate leadership, Senate Republican leadership, and far too many of my \ncolleagues on my side of the aisle, the geniuses around here are \nsaying: Let's pass more trade agreements because it is working.\n  Give me one other issue where people in this body en masse, in huge \nnumbers, say: This trade policy isn't working so let's try more of it. \nThat is exactly what we have done. We continue to pass trade agreements \nthat look a lot like NAFTA. We continue to pass trade agreements that \nget us in this situation that cost us jobs.\n  I am for more trade. Like most Americans, I want to see us trade more \nwith other countries. But like most Americans, I have a problem with \nmany of the rules that govern our trade policy because these aren't \nsimple--eliminate tariffs. This is a trade policy that time after time \nfavors corporate or investors' interests, and, in some cases, actually \nundermines our national security and undermines our national interests.\n  When we see the kind of job loss that NAFTA caused and CAFTA caused \nand PNTR caused, and these trade agreements with Panama and Korea and \nColombia cause, we know this is not good for our national interests.\n  That is why I object to these trade agreements: They are more of the \nsame broken promises, the same promises about: Oh, yes, it is going to \ncreate jobs. The same promise about: Oh, yes, it is going to expand our \nmarkets.\n  It may expand our markets a little bit, but it costs. We may sell \nsome more, but we are buying a lot more from these other countries \nbecause the trade agreements simply aren't working.\n  Trade agreements are permanent. They often handcuff Congress and \nState legislatures from setting new priorities. North American Free \nTrade Agreement. I have heard Presidential candidates in campaigns say: \nYes, they would work to renegotiate or even repeal NAFTA. Then they \nraise their right hand, get sworn in to be President of the United \nStates, and they kind of forget they promised that.\n  These trade agreements undermine ``Buy American'' policy. How does \nthat work? Because when we pass free-trade agreements, our FTAs, \nbilaterally or trilaterally with other countries, it doesn't give the \nsame standing to our ``Buy American'' provisions. Do you think \ncountries around the world don't have buy whatever their country is? \nYou don't think the Chinese give special preference to ``Buy China''? \nYou don't think other countries ever give special preference? But we \ncouldn't do that here because that would mean we aren't practicing free \ntrade.\n  Every country in the world practices trade according to their \nnational interests. But what do we do in the United States of America? \nWhat do we do in the Senate? What do they do in the House? What do they \ndo in the White House? They practice trade according to some economic \ntextbook that was printed before these pages sitting in front of me \nwere even born.\n  These trade agreements lack any meaningful way to withdraw if the \npromised benefits don't materialize. We passed these trade agreements \nin Ohio communities from Springfield to Chillicothe to Portsmouth to \nAshtabula to Toledo. These Ohio communities can't understand why they \nare so buffeted by these trade winds that so often undermine their \nability to make a living.\n\n  These trade agreements were originally negotiated by the Bush \nadministration. I don't blame President Obama for that. But to the rest \nof the country, hearing the Obama administration talk about these trade \nagreements sounds like a continuation of the incoherent approach to \nAmerica's engagement in the global economy that we saw with the Bush \ntrade agenda.\n  Many of us on this floor have criticized the Bush trade policy. The \nObama trade policy--I am a Democrat, he is a Democrat. The Obama trade \npolicy is better than it was under the Bush trade agreement. The Obama \nadministration has made these three trade bills a little better--at \nleast Korea a little better than it was--a little better. The Obama \nadministration has actually enforced trade laws when the Chinese cheat \non tires, when they cheat on oil country tubular steel, when they cheat \non glass, when they cheat on aluminum, when they cheat--not on glass; \nwhen they cheat on paper. We have made some progress.\n  There is a new steel mill in the Mahoning Valley in Youngstown, in \nlarge part, because President Obama enforced trade rules, trade laws \nwith the Commission Department of the International Trade Commission. \nIt is interesting, though. When the President went to Youngstown to \ntalk about the opening of the steel mill, he talked about the Recovery \nAct, and the Recovery Act put some dollars and infrastructure around \nthe steel mill, but he neglected to talk about trade policy, which he \nhad enforced for these agreements. That is all behind us.\n  But these trade policies ignore the elephant in the room, which is \nour trade relationship with China. Last night, as I said, the Senate \ndid the right thing on a strong bipartisan vote on Chinese currency. \nBut, unfortunately, some of the opponents of cracking down--\nunfortunately, I guess. Opponents of cracking down on China's currency \nmanipulation are the same supporters of these trade agreements and, on \nboth issues, respectfully, they miss the point. People have heard the \nsame promises from NAFTA and CAFTA and China PNTR: Businesses promise \nmore jobs from increased exports. Yet no one talks about the increased \nimports that pale in comparison.\n  So when I used to hear President Bush, Jr.'s predecessor, Bill \nClinton, always talk about look how NAFTA and these agreements are \nincreasing exports, well, they do increase exports, but they increase \nimports so much faster. It was President Bush, first, who said some \nyears ago that for every billion dollars of trade, either surplus or \ndeficit, it translated into 13,000 jobs. I don't know if that number is \nexactly correct--it probably is a little less than that now with \ninflation what a job is worth in dollars. But if $1 billion in trade \nsurplus creates 13,000 jobs, that means $1 billion in trade deficits \ncosts us 13,000 jobs.\n  So when I hear people say: Oh, these trade agreements, they are \nincreasing exports, we have to tell the whole story.\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\n  It is akin to a sports reporter on the 11 o'clock news reading the \nbaseball scores and saying: The Yankees scored seven runs tonight. That \nmeans maybe they won? Well, it turns out the Indians scored nine so the \nYankees lost, which is a good outcome. But the fact is, when we are \ntalking about trade, we don't just brag about exports. We have to look \nat what the value of the imports was too. We are not talking about \nthat. No one likes to talk about the communities that are left cleaning \nup after a plant is abandoned, moved to somewhere else. No one likes to \ntalk about the families who are devastated when the plant closes and \nthey lose their jobs. Nobody wants to talk about what happens to our \nnational security when a steel mill closes and the jobs go elsewhere.\n\n  To keep up, each month the economy must add 150,000 new jobs, just to \nkeep up with population growth. There are 14 million who are unemployed \nand another 15 million who are underemployed or who have stopped \nsearching for work. What do Korea, Colombia, and Panama trade \nagreements have to do with that? We did a great thing last night by \nstanding up to China on currency, but then we are giving it away with \ntrade agreements such as these that cost us jobs rather than increase \njobs. I do not get it. A good week? It was not such a good week for \ninternational trade and for us creating jobs in this country.\n  Most people, when they think about trade, think about goods and \ntariffs, but these agreements are not just about tariffs. If they were \njust about tariffs, as I said, these agreements would be relatively \nshort, a simple declaration of tariff rates. Instead, as I said, these \nagreements are hundreds of pages on procurement rules and financial \nservices and investor-state dispute resolution. What does that mean? \nWhat it means is a whole lot of corporate lobbyists lobbied the \nadministration--the Finance Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, \nthe Senate and House committees that work on these things--and struck \ngold. It means these corporate lobbyists had their way in Washington \nagain, that these corporate lobbyists never lose on these trade \nagreements. In the end, they almost always get their way, but it so \nmuch and in so many ways undermines our public interest and certainly \nundermines jobs.\n  These are complex agreements. They do not have to be that complex. \nBut then some of my colleagues say we are falling behind when Brazil \nand Korea and the European Union sign trade deals. What they do not say \nis that these are not the same kinds of agreements. If they were just \nabout lowering tariffs in a reciprocal way--but they are not--if they \nwere not the United States giving away the store for a little access, \nif they were just about tariffs, as I said earlier, and strong labor \nstandards, we probably would have had a voice vote and passed them \nalready. But these are not the same deals Brazil or the European Union \nsigns with Korea. Let me explain that for a moment.\n  The European Union-Korea agreement does not have investor-state \ndispute resolution. Most countries have strong legal systems, and the \nEU and Korean negotiators decided they did not need to create a new \nprivileged process under the trade deal to resolve disputes. In other \nwords, if Korea has a food safety rule and the European Union has a \nfood safety rule, they do not have to come into conflict because they \ndo not have this dispute resolution that we do in our agreements. Then \nwhat happens when it is food safety or product safety? Do you know what \nhappens? The country with the weaker rules wins.\n  What these trade agreements with the investor-state provisions--\nsomething the Europeans and Brazilians didn't do with Korea--with these \nprovisions, it means we are weakening food safety laws, weakening \nconsumer protection laws, weakening the kind of sovereignty that I \nthought people--particularly conservatives in this body--cared about.\n  When an investor can challenge a law in Korea or the United States \nunder the special privilege process, outside the normal legal system, \nit can have the effect of chilling nondiscriminatory safety rules. But \nhaving a special privilege system outside the normal legal process is \nexactly what some companies want in these trade deals. In other words, \nif a company in the United States cannot find a way--if they are \nunsuccessful at lobbying the Senate, the House of Representatives, and \nthe President, unsuccessful in weakening consumer protection measures \nor undermining a food safety rule, if they have been unsuccessful doing \nthat directly here, through these trade agreements they are able to do \nthat.\n  If Panama has weaker rules on investor protections, has weaker rules \non financial consumer protection, weaker rules on food safety laws, \nthen, through these trade agreements, it gives these corporate \ninterests a back door to weaken our safety rules.\n  We fight like crazy around here to have strong consumer protections, \nto have safe pharmaceutical rules, to have good, strong pharmaceutical \nsafety rules. We fight for those things, but then we are going to allow \nthese trade agreements to undermine that.\n  These agreements affect investment dynamics and corporate \ndecisionmaking. They affect how a company makes decisions in 2 years, 5 \nyears, 10 years, so these are important long term for these companies. \nYet Congress has a few hours to debate these and vote up or down, with \nno amendments. These agreements are permanent. They affect the flow of \ngoods and services on a permanent basis across the world for decades to \ncome. These agreements are hundreds of pages, and here we are fitting \nthem into the workweek, voting them up or down. The vote tonight is at \n6:30.\n  I don't hear Rush Limbaugh, I don't hear the Washington Post, I don't \nhear others--conservatives on the other side of the aisle say: I can't \nbelieve you are jamming this through so fast, which is what they said \non health care, which took months and months. They jammed this through \nin 48 hours, but that is OK because it is a trade agreement, even \nthough it is this long and nobody has read it. I am almost sure that \nthere is not one Senator out of 100 and maybe none in the 435 in the \nHouse of Representatives who actually read this bill. And this is the \nleast consequential. This is the Panama trade agreement. This is not \nKorea, which is much bigger. This is not Colombia, which is \nsignificantly bigger. Yet we decided it is OK to fit this because fast \ntrack--the way we do trade agreements--has a whole special set of \nrules.\n  In my mind, nothing I know of in this body has this special set of \nrules that trade agreements get. They have to be debated quickly. There \nis a time limit once they are sent up by the President. There is no \nhold allowed on a trade agreement. There is no filibuster allowed on a \ntrade agreement. There is no 60-vote threshold. There is a 60-vote \nthreshold on confirming a Federal judge out of Toledo, OH. There is a \n60-vote threshold on an Under Secretary of Interior. There is no 60-\nvote threshold on an agreement of hundreds of pages that will last \nforever with the Republic of Panama or Colombia or Korea, no 60-\nvote requirement, no hold, none of the rules of the Senate that might \nslow this down. Do you know why? Because these are chock-full of \nspecial interest provisions that every insurance company and drug \ncompany and bank can get their way and get this in permanent law. No \nscandal there, not with that. We will do it on every other bill but not \ntrade agreements.\n\n  Two things, and then I want to close with a story.\n  Think about what fast-track authority does. I want to pursue that \nwith a little more detail, about how we have these special rules in the \nSenate only for trade agreements, for nothing else.\n  First of all, with fast-track authority, in addition to having rules \nin the Senate that are very different from other rules in order that \nthese pass quickly, we also delegate authority to the executive \nbranch--something we normally don't do. We allow the executive branch \nto set the substance of the negotiations. The executive branch is only \nrequired to notify Congress 90 days before signing the agreement. The \nexecutive branch writes the implementing legislation for each trade \npact without the committees of jurisdiction having actual markups. In \nother words, it circumvents the normal committee process. Once the \nexecutive branch has submitted the bill, we have to vote for the \nimplementing bill within 90 days. The votes in both Chambers are highly\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\nprivileged. Normal congressional floor procedures are waived, including \nunanimous consent. Debates are limited, and no amendments are allowed. \nThe result is that Congress is given little time. In the present case, \nthe Senate has 4 hours to debate each agreement.\n  I am amazed. I mean, where are the conservatives in this country who \nsaid: Don't give Barack Obama so much power. You just did when you \npassed this. Why? Because it is a trade agreement. The rules are always \ndifferent. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, said his No. 1 goal \nin 2011 and 2012 is to make sure Barack Obama is a one-term President. \nWe don't want to give him any power, we want to criticize him on \neverything--except, Mr. President, we would like to give you this, and \nyou do whatever you want on these special trade agreements. Just the \nhypocrisy here on trade is beyond belief.\n  Let me close with what I think may tell the story of the importance \nof how we practice trade around the world. Some years ago, I flew into \nSouth Texas at my own expense, rented a car, and with two friends \ncrossed the Texas-Mexican border just to follow up on what had happened \nwith NAFTA. This was the mid- to late 1990s. I wanted to see how NAFTA \nwas working out for the United States and Mexico along the border where \nthere were so many manufacturing plants.\n  Right near the border, there was an auto plant, a GM plant. This GM \nplant looked just like a General Motors plant, not much different from \nLordstown near Youngstown, not much different from the GM plant in my \nhometown of Mansfield, which unfortunately is now closed, not much \ndifferent from any other auto plant. It was modern, the floors were \nclean, great technology. But there was one difference between the two \nplants, one major difference: The GM plant in Mexico didn't have a \nparking lot because the workers were not paid enough to buy the cars \nthey made. That may tell you something.\n  I didn't do this, but go around the world, and in Malaysia, in the \nMotorola plant, the workers didn't get paid enough to buy a lot of the \nMotorola electronics they made. Then go back to Central America and go \nto Costa Rica, and the workers in the Costa Rica Disney plant were not \nmaking enough to buy the toys for their children that they made. Go to \nChina, go almost anywhere in the world in these developing countries \nwhere we either have trade agreements or where our trade policy has \nsuch impact, where companies in the United States shut down--never in \nworld history have companies in one country, to the degree they do \nhere--they shut down in the United States and move to China, move to \nMexico, move to Malaysia, move to Indonesia, and then they sell their \nproducts back to the United States.\n  How do you build a country's wealth when you do that? And the reason \nthey do is because these workers in Mexico who are building cars, in \nMalaysia making electronic equipment, in Costa Rica making Disney \ntoys--these workers don't share in the wealth they create. They are not \nmaking enough from the jobs they do to buy the things they make.\n  The beauty of our system and what has made the United States a \nprosperous country with a strong middle class is--partly because of \nunions, partly because of democracy--is our workers typically earn \nenough that they can buy the products they make. In other words, if the \nworkers are creating wealth for the company, for their bosses, they get \npaid enough, they can extract enough of that wealth that they can have \na decent standard of living. Not in Mexico, China, Malaysia, or many of \nthese countries that are part of this free-trade regimen.\n  Let me take you to one more place on this little tour around the \nworld. Let me take you to a midwestern meatpacking plant. Most of these \nmeatpacking plants were union plants. They had very little turnover. \nWorkers were making very good wages, and they were safe, by and large, \nbecause the workers had demanded safety and the U.S. Government had \nenforced it.\n  Well, what has happened in the last 10 or 15 years in these \nmeatpacking plants is the union has been busted. Many of the workers \nare immigrants. They are immigrants who--probably some of them are not \nlegal, but certainly these immigrants who are there are not about to \nform a union. They do not speak English, sometimes, very well. They are \nnot so certain they are going to be able to stay in this country. They \nare just not going to speak out. They are hardly ever going to talk \nback to their boss and will never form a union.\n  Here is what happened. It used to be in those plants--pardon me if my \nnumbers are not precise here because it has been a while since I \nthought about this--it used to be in these meatpacking plants that the \nworkers would stand there, they would have the vinyl aprons and a sharp \nknife because they were processing beef, and the carcasses would be \nhung on the big hooks, and the carcasses would slowly go by, about 150 \nan hour, something like that. So these workers would be standing there \nand they would make their cut as the carcasses went by slowly, 150 an \nhour. After they busted the union, they sped up the line. When it is \n150 an hour, that is about the right speed for them to do this work. \nThey almost doubled the speed of the carcasses as they went by, and two \nthings happened: Workers had to hurry, so they were more likely to hurt \nthemselves because they would aim the knife, and because it was moving \nfast, they might end up glancing off the bone and cutting their leg. \nThe other thing that would happen is workers were much more likely to \ndrop their knives, quickly pick them up, wipe them on their apron, and \ngo back to work. Here is the interesting thing. The line had sped up to \n300, more or less, an hour. On Thursdays they slowed the line back. Do \nmy colleagues know why? Because Thursday was the day these meatpacking \ncompanies were shipping those carcasses, that processed meat, to \nEurope, and Europe has higher food safety standards than the United \nStates does. So if these workers could work fast, and if they dropped \nthe knife and wiped it off, the meat might get a little contaminated. \nThat is OK for U.S. food safety standards, but the Europeans, who had \nhigher food safety standards, said, We are not buying your beef unless \nyou slow the line down and make it safer.\n\n  That is what globalization would be. It is not just workers in Mexico \nwho can't buy the cars; it is not just Motorola workers in Malaysia or \nDisney workers in Costa Rica who can't buy the products they make; it \nalso undermines our food safety and drug safety and consumer \nprotection.\n  These agreements are not trade agreements. They are special interest \nlaws that never see the light of day because of the peculiar rules of \nthe Senate.\n  We should be ashamed of ourselves for passing these agreements, \nperiod, and especially passing them under these provisions. I hope the \nadministration learns something from this. I hope the administration \ndecides, on these trade agreements, instead of being on the side of the \nlargest corporations in the country and in the world, which don't \nalways look out for American interests--I hope the administration and \nthe Members of the House and Senate will decide they want to be on the \nside of American families, of American communities, of American \nworkers, of American small companies that make goods and want to sell \nall over the world.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, international trade has always been \ncontroversial. That has been true since the days of the Smoot-Hawley \neffort--Hawley, by the way, was an Oregon Congressman--and it continues \nto be true today. It is important to our country and important to my \nhome State that I made a special priority, when I was given the honor \nof serving on the Senate Finance Committee, to queue up to be able to \nchair the Subcommittee on International Trade and Global \nCompetitiveness, because I think it important that we continue our work \nhere in the Senate to keep pushing to keep our trade policy on the \nright track.\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\n  I wish to describe today three aspects of this debate that are \nindisputable. In other words, we have lots of differences of opinion \nwith respect to past agreements--did they create jobs, did they not \ncreate jobs, and how did they affect various parts of the country--and \nsuffice it to say reasonable people can differ with respect to these \nanalyses. But I have been able, as the chair of this subcommittee of \nthe Senate Finance Committee--the Subcommittee on International Trade \nand Global Competitiveness--to dig deeply into this issue.\n  I believe there are three indisputable positions with respect to the \nagreements we will be voting on tonight that the Senate ought to take \ninto consideration that are at the core of why I will be voting later \nthis evening in favor of the agreements.\n  The first position is there is a huge appetite all around the world \nfor American goods and services. We are the gold standard. People \naround the world want to buy Brand USA. They want to display it. They \nwant to feature it. There is no question that we have an opportunity to \nfeed this huge demand for American goods and services. I think we ought \nto go forward and tap this opportunity. The bottom line is if we don't \ntake this opportunity to burnish this Brand America and get our goods \nand services around the world, we can be very sure that somebody else \nwill be right there, and it is most likely to be China. That is point \nNo. 1. I think it is indisputable.\n  Point No. 2 is the challenge today in global markets is to capture \nthe entire supply chain. That means everything from raw materials to \ncomponent parts to the finished good. When I talk about this \nopportunity to capture the global supply chain, what it means to me in \nOregon, and I think it means the same thing in North Carolina or South \nDakota--I see my friend and colleague, who is the ranking member on the \ntrade subcommittee, and it has been a pleasure for me to work with \nhim--and I think all over the United States, capturing this supply \nchain in the global economy means the same thing, and that is what we \nought to do--what I say at home in Oregon and I am sure my friend in \nSouth Dakota says exactly the same thing, let us grow it in Oregon, let \nus make it in Oregon, let us add value to it in Oregon, and then let us \nship it somewhere. It is a huge opportunity we have in front of us to \ntap this global supply chain where, once again, if we walk away from \nthis kind of opportunity, we can be very certain that China will be \nright there to fill the void.\n  The third issue involves the question of tariffs. I have heard people \nsay, well, these agreements have lots of other things in them, lots of \nother provisions that are unrelated to tariffs. There is no question \nthat is accurate. But at the end of the day, if American import tariffs \nare in low and American goods are faced with very high tariffs when \nthey arrive into foreign markets, that is a very substantial advantage \nfor our trading partners. As I highlighted yesterday in the Senate \nFinance Committee, when we want to send our beef, Oregon beef, to \nKorea, we sometimes face a 40-percent tariff. When Korea sends their \nbeef to us here in the United States, it can be as low as 4 percent. \nThat is a tenfold difference.\n  I could go through a whole host of other products.\n  Oregon wine faces a tariff in Korea that is fifteen times higher than \nwine that is imported into the U.S.\n  Value-added wood products. I know the Presiding Officer, the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, cares an awful lot about wood products. Well, the \nfact of the matter is, if we want to send finished wood into Korea--not \nthe raw materials. We all know what we want to do, again, is add value \nto wood products, a key component of the Pacific northwest's economy, \nof the southern economy. We want to add value to it. Well, the fact is, \nthe tariffs are four times as high for finished wood products in Korea \nas they are here in the United States.\n  These are indisputable facts: the question of the tariffs, the \nquestion of the global supply chain, and the Brand USA opportunity I \nhave described as this huge appetite for American goods and services \nthat exists around the world that I think we will be making a grave \nmistake to pass up an opportunity to level the playing field by \ndismantling foreign trade barriers to U.S. goods and services, whether \nthey are tariffs or otherwise. The free trade agreements with Korea, \nColombia, and Panama provide us an opportunity to level the playing \nfield for U.S. producers who would like to feed the appetite for \nAmerican goods and services in Korea, Colombia, and Panama.\n  There are a lot of other issues associated with the votes we are \ngoing to have to cast. I feel very strongly about the trade adjustment \nassistance program because I want to make sure, in an economy that is \nconstantly changing, our workers have a trampoline, in effect, to get \nthe training and the skills they need to succeed, which may mean moving \ninto new careers. People think the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nis just about workers. This is a crucial program for employers, and \nthat is why it has so much support among employers. Employers need \nworkers with the types of skills that enable them to be competitive in \nglobal markets, and trade adjustment assistance helps in this regard.\n  By the way, one of the concerns business is continually citing, and \nincreasingly so, is the mismatch they often face where they need \nworkers who have one sort of skill but the workers in their community \ndo not have what they need. So, with the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram, we can close that skills gap, we can do more to ensure \nbusinesses can get the type of workers they can rely on to be efficient \nand competitive. So, the idea that trade adjustment assistance is just \nfor workers is a mistake. It is a major plus to our employers. \nOversight over trade adjustment assistance is going to be one of the \nthings that the subcommittee on trade, which I chair, is going to zero \nin on.\n  Worker issues: Another one we will be looking at on the subcommittee \ninvolves issues relating to workers rights under the U.S.-Colombia Free \nTrade Agreement. There, our concern is violence--demonstrable, serious \nviolence against Colombian union members and the impunity the \nperpetrators of such violence have enjoyed.\n  This situation does seem to be getting a bit better. The Santos \nadministration understands the concern. There is an agreement with \nColombia on an action plan on labor that sets in motion a series of \nsteps the Colombian Government is taking to provide workers with more \nadequate labor rights and protection from violence. But there is a lot \nmore to do, and I intend to conduct meaningful oversight over the labor \nsituation in Colombia and Colombia's adherence to its commitments to \nthe Obama administration. As far as I am concerned, that is going to \nstart as soon as these agreements have been voted on. Senator Stabenow, \nSenator Cardin, and Senator Menendez will be joining me, and we are all \ngoing to be doing more to make sure the Obama administration provides \nthe Congress with annual reports on the labor situation in Colombia and \nthe impact of the labor action plan that was reached by the Obama \nadministration and the Santos administration.\n  I have mentioned trade adjustment assistance. I have mentioned labor \nrights. I want to close in terms of future work that is related to this \ntopic by talking about China because certainly these trade agreements \nand the ability to tap the opportunity, particularly in our country, \nfor family wage employment through more exports is going to require \ntougher enforcement of our trade laws and, particularly, the Obama \nadministration getting serious about enforcing the laws on the books.\n  We have had a series of investigations looking at cheating--cheating, \nMadam President. I use that word specifically. I guess you could call \nit merchandise laundering because some foreign producers, when they are \nfaced with U.S. trade remedy laws, like anti dumping and countervailing \nduties, instead of doing the right thing and coming into compliance, \ndecide to ship their U.S.-bound merchandise through another country in \norder to falsify the country of origin import documents. This is going \nto be an even more important challenge when the trade agreement with \nKorea goes into force. Fortunately, we have bipartisan legislation in \norder to stop this type cheating, to strengthen the enforcement of our \ntrade laws. It is going to be even more important to pass that effort \nto eliminate this kind of cheating because\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\nwith respect to the agreement and Korea, Chinese suppliers have a long \nhistory of laundering their goods through Korea in order to avoid U.S. \ntrade laws by suggesting the Chinese merchandise is from Korea.\n  On the question of cheating, we have documented the problem in our \nhearings of the Finance Subcommittee on International Trade. And we \nhave a bipartisan bill with, I believe, four Democratic Senators and \nfour Republican Senators. It's called the Enforce Act and we are ready \nto move it forward. I was very pleased, in the discussion in the \nFinance Committee, Chairman Baucus and Senator Hatch, the ranking \nminority member, said this effort to fight these practices, this kind \nof cheating--which potentially could get worse unless you strengthen \nenforcement--Chairman Baucus and Senator Hatch said it was going to be \na priority for them, and they wanted to make our anticheating \nlegislation a must-pass effort before the end of this year, that they \nwould attach it to a must-pass piece of legislation.\n  I could go on.\n  Even today, the administration is going forward with the anti-\ncounterfeiting trade agreement, or ACTA, without doing it with the \napproval of the Congress. I think that is a mistake. I think that may \nbe misreading of the law that the executive branch can do it of its own \naccord, and many legal scholars agree. We are going to tackle that in \nthe days ahead because those issues are important now. They will be \neven more important, given the expansions of trade and commerce when \nthese agreements are approved.\n  So there is a lot to do to keep the country's trade agenda on track. \nLevel the playing field for U.S. producers. Ensure we have a \ncompetitive workforce. Advance labor rights, and enforce the trade laws \nto combat unfair trade. At the end of the day, if we miss one \nopportunity to do more to market our brand around the world in order to \nenable Americans to make things here and grow things here and \ncontinually add value to them, dominate that supply chain--which I \nthink is going to be the overriding issue for global competitiveness in \nthe days ahead--if we walk away from those issues, and enabling U.S. \nproducers to export--to feed the foreign appetite for our goods and \nservices--we are walking away from the opportunity for American workers \nto get the good-paying jobs in the private sector that they need.\n  In my home State, international trade is a very significant barometer \nof our economy, with estimates even being that one out of six jobs in \nOregon depends on international trade, and the trade jobs pay better \nthan do the nontrade jobs. I want America to be the leader in seizing \nthe opportunities that exist to sell goods and services in foreign \nmarkets. I want Oregon producers of high-value goods and services to \nbenefit from our efforts here in the Senate to level the playing field \nin global markets. These trade related jobs that we can help create--I \ncall them red, white, and blue jobs--these are the kinds of jobs I want \nfor this country that I know the Presiding Officer wants, where we do \nallow American productivity and American ingenuity to continually \ninnovate and compete.\n  There are other issues. I know the Presiding Officer cares a great \ndeal about tax policy, global tax policy. Senator Coats and I have a \nbipartisan tax reform proposal. We look forward to working with the \nPresiding Officer on that issue.\n  But today is a chance to expand our opportunity to get the American \nbrand, the USA brand for goods and services, in markets that are \ngrowing, in markets that you can bet China wants.\n\n  I know this is controversial. Trade policy always is. But I think, \nfor our workers to get the chance to get our goods and services into \ngrowing markets--growing markets that China wants--that my colleagues \nsupport the trade agreements that are before us today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I, too, rise in strong support of the \npending trade agreements with America's allies, Colombia, South Korea, \nand Panama.\n  These agreements hold great promise for American farmers, \nmanufacturers, service providers, and American consumers. I would echo \nmy colleague from Oregon, who chairs the Subcommittee on Trade on the \nFinance Committee; that is, these trade agreements position American \nbusinesses to capture more of that supply chain to enable us to create \njobs here at home and to grow the economy, to generate economic \nactivity out there that otherwise we would not see happening. At a time \nwhen we need to focus our efforts on measures that will promote \neconomic growth and job creation, these agreements are exactly the type \nof legislation we ought to be considering.\n  There is broad consensus these agreements are going to benefit our \neconomy. The Obama White House estimates that enactment of these three \ntrade agreements will boost exports by at least $12 billion, supporting \nover 70,000 American jobs.\n  The Business Roundtable estimates that passage of these trade \nagreements will support as many as 250,000 American jobs. These are not \nonly jobs at large businesses but increasingly at smaller companies \nthat are accessing international markets.\n  As an example of that, more than 35,000 small and mid-sized American \nbusinesses export to Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, and these firms \nnow account for more than one-third of U.S. exports to these countries. \nPassing these three trade agreements will provide export opportunities \nto American businesses of all sizes, creating good-paying jobs here at \nhome.\n  The benefits to U.S. agriculture from passing these agreements are \nespecially compelling. These three agreements are estimated to \nrepresent $3 billion in new agricultural exports that will support \n22,500 U.S. agricultural-related jobs.\n  My State of South Dakota is a good example if you look at the export \npotential for U.S. agriculture represented by these agreements. \nAccording to the American Farm Bureau Federation, these agreements will \nadd $52 million each year to South Dakota's farm economy. South Dakota \nis projected to gain $22 million from increased beef exports, $25 \nmillion from increased exports of wheat, soybeans, and corn, and $5 \nmillion from increased pork shipments each year.\n  America's market is already largely open to imports from many of our \ntrading partners. In fact, almost 99 percent of agricultural products \nfrom Colombia and Panama, for example, already enters the United States \nduty free. Without trade agreements to ensure similar treatment for our \nexporters, American businesses will continue to face high tariff and \nnontariff barriers abroad.\n  Consider just one example, the market for agricultural products in \nKorea, which is the world's 13th largest economy. Korea's tariffs on \nimported agricultural goods average 54 percent compared to an average \nof 9 percent tariff on their imports into the United States. So passage \nof the Korea Free Trade Agreement will level this playing field. Think \nabout that. Fifty-four percent for our exporters to get into the Korean \nmarket, 9 percent tariff for their exports coming here. That is a huge \ndiscrepancy that will be rectified by passage of this agreement.\n  Korea's market for pork products in particular underscores how \nremoving barriers to trade can benefit U.S. farmers and ranchers. U.S. \npork exports to South Korea have increased 130 percent from January to \nJuly of this year because Korea temporarily lifted its 25 percent duty \non pork imports due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Korea.\n  During this period, the Korean market surpassed Canada to become the \nthird largest export destination for U.S. pork producers after Japan \nand Mexico. Korea's tariff on pork imports is expected to return but \nwould be permanently eliminated by 2016 under the terms of the United \nStates and South Korea Free Trade Agreement.\n  We know when we eliminate barriers to U.S. exports, American \nproducers will compete and win in the global marketplace. However, if \nwe fail to act and continue to delay implementation of these \nagreements, the cost to our\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\neconomy will also be substantial. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce study \nwarns that failure to enact the three pending free-trade agreements \ncould threaten as many as 380,000 American jobs and the loss of $40 \nbillion in sales. The cost of inaction on trade is high because today \nwe live in a global economy where American producers rely on access to \nforeign markets.\n  Consider that in 1960, exports accounted for only 3.6 percent of our \nentire GDP. Today exports account for 12.5 percent of our entire GDP. \nExports of U.S. goods and services support over 10 million American \njobs. When America stands still on trade, the rest of the world does \nnot. Today there are more than 100 new free-trade agreements that are \ncurrently under negotiation around the world. Yet the United States is \nonly party to one of those negotiations; that is, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership.\n  If we do not aggressively pursue new market-opening agreements on \nbehalf of American workers, we will see new export opportunities go to \nforeign businesses and foreign workers. Unfortunately, that is exactly \nwhat we have experienced under the current administration. The three \ntrade agreements we are considering today were signed over 4 years ago, \nand this administration had more than 2\\1/2\\ years to submit them to \nCongress for consideration but failed to do so.\n  Instead, the President chose to sit on these agreements and not send \nthem to Congress for nearly now 1,000 days. We cannot quantify \nprecisely the cost of this unfortunate delay, but we know it put \nAmerican exporters at a competitive disadvantage in the Colombian, \nKorean, and Panamanian markets. For example, on July 1 the European \nUnion-Korea trade agreement went into effect. In just the first month \nafter this agreement took effect, EU exports to Korea jumped nearly 37 \npercent, while U.S. exports to Korea rose by only 3 percent.\n  Let's be clear about what this means. Korean consumers are choosing \nto buy German, French, and British cars, electronics, and agricultural \nproducts rather than American-made products because those European \nproducts now have a price advantage. This would have been entirely \npreventable if we had acted on the U.S-Korea trade agreement sooner. \nLikewise, the Canada-Colombia agreement went into effect on August 15 \nof this year. This is resulting in an advantage for Canadian goods such \nas construction equipment, aircraft, and a range of other industrial \nand agricultural products. Colombia is now reporting that since the \nCanada-Colombia trade agreement took effect, there has been an 18.3-\npercent increase in Colombian imports of Canadian wheat.\n  Much as with Korea, U.S. businesses are finding themselves \ndisadvantaged because the President waited so long before sending these \nagreements to Congress. Unfortunately, the negative impact of the \nCanada-Colombia agreement on U.S. exporters is just a continuation of \nthe lost export opportunities we have seen over the past few years as \nthese trade agreements have lingered.\n  Just a few years ago, American wheat producers dominated the market \nin Colombia with a 73-percent market share, as of 2008. Today we are \nfacing a situation where U.S. wheat producers are likely to be \ncompletely shut out of the Colombian market if we do not act. \nHopefully, by passing this agreement today and by swiftly implementing \nthe U.S.-Colombia trade promotion agreement, our wheat producers will \nbe able to recover much of their lost market share. But they should \nnever have been placed in this position to begin with.\n  In 2010, for the first time in the history of U.S.-Colombia trade, \nthe U.S. lost to Argentina its position as Colombia's No. 1 \nagricultural supplier. Now, consider the story of three of the major \ncrops that we grow in South Dakota: soybeans, corn, and wheat. The \ncombined market share in Colombia for these three U.S. agricultural \nexports has decreased from 78 percent in 2008 to 28 percent as of 2010, \na staggering decline of 50 percentage points in our market share.\n  U.S. corn sales to Colombia fell from 3 million metric tons in 2007 \nto 700,000 metric tons in 2010. This is the high cost of delay while \nour trading partners pursue new regional and bilateral trade \nagreements. There has also been the cost of duties that have been paid \non U.S. exports while these agreements are waiting. U.S. companies have \npaid more than $5 billion in tariffs to Colombia and Panama since the \ntrade agreements with these nations were signed more than 4 years ago.\n  Let's consider the cost of delay to just one American company, \nCaterpillar. We all know Caterpillar is a leading producer of large \nconstruction and mining equipment and a major U.S. exporter. \nCaterpillar exports 92 percent of its American-made large mining \ntrucks. Caterpillar's large truck exports to Colombia face a 15-percent \nduty which adds about $300,000 to the cost of each of these trucks \nexported to Colombia.\n  I mean, how does that work? Think about that. Every truck that \nCaterpillar sends into the Colombian market, it is an additional \n$300,000 on top of the cost of that piece of equipment for the tariff \nthat has to be paid. Just imagine the advantage that Caterpillar could \nhave had for the last several years over its Japanese and Chinese \ncompetitors if the House of Representatives--at the time was controlled \nby the Democrats back in 2008--had not refused to consider the Colombia \nagreement when President Bush submitted it or if the current \nadministration had acted sooner, and that is just one example of \ncountless others out there with American businesses.\n  So I am glad we are here today. I expect all three trade agreements \nto pass with what I hope is broad bipartisan support. I hope we also \nhave learned an important lesson. We cannot afford to delay when it \ncomes to international competition in trade. I hope the White House has \nlearned an important lesson as well rather than submitting to Congress \ndivisive measures where there are fundamental disagreements, such as \nnew tax increases. This administration should identify measures such as \nthese trade bills that will spur our economy and where there is broad \nbipartisan agreement.\n  The President sent his American Jobs Act to Congress exactly 1 month \nago today. Yet we only, just last night, voted on whether we should \nconsider this bill--a vote that did not get a single Republican vote, \nand it did not get every Democratic vote either. Contrast that approach \nwith these free-trade agreements which were submitted to Congress by \nthe President on October 3, just 9 days ago. Within about a week and a \nhalf, these trade agreements will have passed the relevant committees \nin the House and the Senate with large bipartisan votes and will be on \nthe President's desk awaiting his signature.\n  Clearly, reaching across the aisle on measures where both parties can \nfind agreement is a much more effective approach. So I would urge my \ncolleagues to support these job-creating trade bills based upon their \nmerit. I would also urge my colleagues to support these bills to send a \nmessage that when this administration is willing to send us \ncommonsense, progrowth legislation, we are ready and willing to pass \nit.\n  We can only hope our votes on these trade agreements will set that \nprecedent. I look forward to voting for these long overdue agreements \non behalf of American businesses and consumers. I look forward, \nhopefully, to being able to act on what are truly progrowth job \nmeasures in the coming weeks and months.\n  We have an economy that continues to struggle with over 9 percent \nunemployment. Month after month we continue to see a lot of Americans \nwho are without jobs, and this is one example of something we can do to \naddress that concern. But there are lots of other things out there we \ncan be doing as well if we are willing to identify those things on \nwhich there is agreement and those types of policies that actually do \ncreate jobs that are about getting Americans back to work and not about \nmaking some sort of a political statement.\n  I hope this will set a pattern and a trend that will be replicated in \nthe future and that we can do some things that are good for our \nAmerican economy and for American jobs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to speak on final passage of \nthe implementing language for the South Korea, Colombia and Panama free \ntrade agreements. I support passing these three agreements. I supported \nthem as they made the long and arduous journey from the negotiating \ntable,\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\nthrough the Senate Finance Committee and now to the Senate floor. As \nhas been stated by my colleagues, these agreements are far overdue. Our \ngovernment and industries have long shared with Congress the positive \njob impact these trade deals would have on the American economy. In the \ncase of both Korea and Colombia, other nations have not hesitated to \nadopt similar agreements and I just hope that inaction by the White \nHouse has not resulted in U.S. manufacturers and agricultural producers \nlosing market share that can be difficult, if not impossible, to \nregain.\n  I can say that Wyoming will benefit directly from these agreements. \nDisodium carbonate, also known as soda ash, is Wyoming's largest export \nto South Korea. This agreement would immediately remove, upon \nratification, the 4 percent tariff on U.S. soda ash exports to that \ncountry. This will not only increase U.S. exports of soda ash to Korea \nby millions of dollars annually but will also increase job \nopportunities in and around Green River, WY where natural soda ash is \nfound.\n  Wyoming's agricultural producers also stand to gain with the passage \nof these agreements. In the case of Korea, we know that a strong market \nfor beef will be opened which will help Wyoming ranchers increase the \nvalue of their cattle heading to the sale barn. The standards in the \nKorea agreement will also set the stage for future negotiations in \ngaining market share for U.S. beef in other Asian markets. Consumer \ntastes are changing all over the world and our trading partners in Asia \noffer the largest potential market for American produced meat products. \nColombia will do the same for Wyoming's wheat growers by reducing trade \nbarriers and helping that country meet its growing demand for grain \nproducts.\n  I stand today in support of these important free trade agreements \nwith South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. Not only are these nations our \neconomic allies but strategic allies as well. These agreements solidify \nour relations with these countries and help promote U.S. job growth \nthrough our export markets. It is finally time Congress pass these \nagreements and fulfill the commitments we have made to our trading \npartners.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I join with my good friend from South \nDakota and the comments he made about the disadvantage we have created \nfor ourselves in the last 3 years by not moving forward with these \ntrade agreements long ago. But we are going to move forward today.\n  Jump-starting America's economy is going to require bipartisanship. \nIf we are going to compete in a global economy, it means we are all \ngoing to have to work together to help create economic opportunities \nfor Americans who are looking for work, help to create those private \nsector jobs that are the difference in a prosperous economy and an \neconomy that is struggling.\n  Last night the motion to open debate on the President's so-called \njobs bill was amended by his own party and was defeated then by a \nbipartisan vote in the Senate. That is not the kind of bipartisanship \nwe need. We need bipartisanship moving forward not bipartisanship \nwalking away.\n  The bill was defeated because it does not make economic sense--as the \nPresident said in August of 2009--to raise taxes on job creators. In \nfact, the administration, by its own accounting, said roughly 80 \npercent of the people who would be impacted by the surtax imposed by \nthe bill that was set aside last night would be defined as businesses, \nthe very businesses that need to create jobs in an economy where that \nshould be the No. 1 priority.\n  The President's first $800 billion stimulus plan failed to stimulate. \nIt did not create the private sector jobs we needed and, simply, my \nview of the $450 billion we were talking about yesterday was that it \nwas more of the same. But today is not more of the same. Today is a \nbipartisan opportunity to move forward with a bipartisan bill to help \njump-start our economy.\n  If there is low-hanging fruit in job creation, it is exporting \nproducts to markets that want to buy them. This is not about labor \nconditions in Colombia or whatever might happen in Korea or Panama. \nThis is about products that American workers make and whether they can \nget into those markets.\n  I would also say that for well over a decade now Colombian products \nhave come into our country without a tariff under something called the \nAndean Free Trade Agreement. Well, so this can't be about Colombian \nlabor. It must be about American labor and what we can do for American \nworkers. We can open markets for American products, and that is what we \nare going to do today, I hope, as we move to agree to these trade \nbills.\n  These trade agreements would mean an additional $2.5 billion per year \nin agricultural exports. Every billion dollars' worth of agricultural \nexports means an estimated 8,000 new jobs in Missouri. In Missouri, the \ntrade-related jobs grew more than three times faster than other \nemployment from 2004 to 2008.\n  I recently asked Missourians on Facebook and Twitter to share some of \ntheir personal stories about how they thought these trade agreements \nwould impact their lives. Glen Cope, a young full-time farmer from \nAurora, MO, noted:\n\n       Agriculture is not drawing young people to stay on the \n     farm. . . . because it is difficult to make land payments \n     based on what little we get for the products we produce--\n     Versus the inputs--\n\n     and this has been the case now for generations.\n\n  Glen called on Congress to help farmers by creating ``more demand for \nour products if we are going to get young people to stay and take over \nthe farm.''\n  Their parents and grandparents have produced food for our country and \nfor much of the world for a long time. Glen Cope's generation can \ncontinue to do the same.\n  Chris Chinn, who runs a family farm in Clarence, MO, in northeast \nMissouri, told me if these trade deals pass, her family ``could receive \nalmost $11 more for every hog they sell.'' Now, she noted, while $11 \nmay not sound like a lot, it sure seemed like a lot when they were \nlosing $20 for every hog they sold from 2007 through 2010. That makes \nthe difference in whether that family stays on the farm.\n  Chris urged Congress to pass these agreements because ``this \nincreased revenue will help us meet expenses and help us ensure our \nfamily farm will be there to pass on to my kids, who will be the sixth \ngeneration of farmers in our family.''\n  Barbara Wilson noted that ``agriculture fuels the economy in our \nsmall town of Mexico, Missouri.'' She told me that the passage of these \nfree-trade agreements would lead to an ``increased demand for our corn \nand our soybeans,'' and she stressed that ``when the agricultural \neconomy is good, the economy in our small town benefits.'' That means \nincreased jobs in all sectors of that small-town economy.\n  Brian Hammons, president of Hammons Products Company in Stockton, MO, \ntold me that ``significant government-mandated trade barriers are \nhurting'' his attempts to compete and develop markets for American \nblack walnuts, which are harvested by hand in Missouri and other \nMidwestern States. Brian noted, if these trade deals passed, ``our \ncompany can buy more black walnuts from thousands of people in Missouri \nand 11 other States, providing cash to those rural areas. And even more \nimportantly, the increased production activity from processing those \nnuts would allow us to provide more employment for people in our rural \nMissouri community.''\n  These are just a few of the farmers and job creators in Missouri who \nare calling on Congress to pass these free-trade agreements.\n  I look forward to voting for these agreements tonight. I hope a huge \nmajority of my colleagues will join me in voting for the South Korea \nagreement, the Panama agreement, and the Colombia agreement. We will \nsend a message to the world that we intend to compete in a world \neconomy. If we are given the chance to compete, American workers can \ncompete with anybody. These trade agreements provide an opportunity to \ndo that.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the three \npending trade agreements with Korea, Colombia, and Panama.\n  Let me say at the outset that I am in favor of free trade, if that \nterm is allowed its true meaning. I have great confidence in the \nAmerican worker and American businesses to compete and succeed in the \nglobal marketplace if given a free and level playing field. For \ngenerations, our country has shown\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\nthat hard work and ingenuity are the engines of progress and economic \nprosperity. The innovations that have shaped our 21st century economy \nwere, in great measure, conceived and produced here in the United \nStates. And in return for allowing other countries to benefit from our \nhard work and innovation, America was rewarded with a strong middle \nclass.\n  Unfortunately, however, in a post-NAFTA world, being the best is no \nlonger good enough. Instead, we have engaged in a race to the bottom, \nwhere to succeed you have to be the cheapest. And so, through our trade \npolicy, we have too often put our workers at a real disadvantage.\n  Indeed, since 1994, when NAFTA went into effect, manufacturing sector \nemployment across the country has fallen by over 5 million jobs, \nincluding over 42,000 in my State of Rhode Island. Contributing to \nthese staggering losses are our trade agreements with Mexico, Central \nAmerican and Caribbean countries, as well as the entry of China into \nthe WTO.\n  That is why I cannot support the three trade agreements that are \nbefore the Senate today.\n  The Korea Free Trade Agreement is especially troubling for Rhode \nIsland, particularly with respect to its treatment of textiles. \nAccording to the U.S. International Trade Commission's report, the \ntextile industry is expected to lose jobs because of the favorable \ntariff reductions Korean manufacturers would receive under the \nagreement.\n  Rhode Island has a long history in textiles. In fact, the modern \ntextile industry in this country can be traced back to Slater Mill in \nPawtucket, RI, in 1793. Textiles were an important part of the State's \neconomy throughout the Industrial Revolution and into the 20th century. \nBut many of the business owners I have been talking to have told me how \nhard it has been for them, shrinking, laying off workers, and watching \nas factory after factory closed their doors around them.\n  I am working with what's left of the textile industry in Rhode \nIsland--a small group of companies that are making really great \nproducts. Darlington Fabrics in Westerly, for example, makes \nperformance athletic-wear, including products for our military. Coated \nTechnical Solutions, based in Newport, works with coated fabrics for \nthings like inflatable boats and tarpaulins. Northeast Knitting makes \nspecialized medical fabrics, and Hope Global exports shoelaces.\n  I have heard from some textile companies that their sole competition \ncomes from manufacturers in South Korea. These foreign competitors will \ndisproportionately benefit from the tariff reductions in the Korea FTA. \nThis is just another in a long line of examples of how our trade policy \nhas failed American manufacturers.\n  With respect to the Colombia agreement, Colombia has a history of \nviolence toward trade unionists, with 51 labor members murdered last \nyear alone. Although the Obama administration negotiated a labor action \nplan with the Colombian government, there are no guarantees that its \nprovisions will be enforced, and in fact, indications are that the \nviolence has continued.\n  In short, I see no reason why we should put American jobs at risk to \nbenefit a country that cannot provide its citizens the most basic \nrights that we offer to ours. The Colombia free trade agreement is a \nbad deal for Americans, and it may be a worse deal for Colombians.\n  Panama has its own labor abuses, but its status as a tax haven is \nperhaps most troubling. Approximately 400,000 multinational \ncorporations are registered in Panama, many of which have license to \nconduct business without reporting or paying taxes. While the Obama \nadministration stepped in and negotiated a tax information exchange \nagreement, this agreement lacks the transparency required to assure \ncompliance.\n  The benefits of a trade agreement with Panama barely register by any \neconomic measure. I believe it would be a mistake to encourage trade \nwith a country that offers little to the United States but that so \nbrazenly facilitates the breaking of our tax laws.\n  I will object to these agreements until we make a wholesale revision \nof our trade policy and put enforcement at the forefront. Representing \na State that may have suffered the most from unfair Chinese \ncompetition, I can't support more of these agreements until I see \nserious and sincere enforcement. We should refrain from passing further \nfree trade agreements until we can ensure that American workers and \nbusinesses are protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I always enjoy the Senator's remarks. \nHowever, I cannot quite agree with the thrust of his statement.\n  In my view, the current trade policies in this country are a \ndisaster. The evidence is very clear that they have cost us many \nmillions of jobs and to continue that same unfettered free-trade \nphilosophy, in terms of trade agreements with Korea, Panama and \nColombia, makes absolutely no sense at all. When we have a policy that \nis failing, we change it; we don't continue it.\n  Let us be very clear. I think most Americans understand that our \neconomy today is in disastrous shape. Our middle class is disappearing. \nRecent statistics have told us poverty levels are at an alltime high, \nand the gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing wider.\n  In my view, one of the reasons--not the only reason--for the collapse \nof the middle class has to do with the loss of millions of good \nmanufacturing jobs, attributable to these disastrous trade policies. If \nwe are serious as a nation in wanting to rebuild the middle class, \nlower our poverty rate, what we have to do is move forward in a new \ndirection in trade, based on fair trade principles, and end this \nunfettered free trade, which has been such a disaster for American \nworkers.\n  Over the last decade, we as a nation have lost 50,000 manufacturing \nplants in our country. I will repeat that because that is such a \nstaggering number that it needs to be said over and over. Fifty \nthousand manufacturing plants in this country have shut down over the \nlast 10 years alone. We have lost, during that same period, 5.5 million \nfactory jobs. Many of those jobs were good-paying jobs. They were jobs \nthat provided people with good wages and good benefits. Those jobs are \ngone and, in many cases, have been replaced by Walmart and McDonald's-\ntype jobs, with low wages and minimal benefits.\n  To give us a sense about how significant the decline of manufacturing \nin this country is, the reality is, in 1970, 25 percent of all jobs in \nthe United States were manufacturing jobs. Today, that number is just 9 \npercent. In July of 2000, there were 17.3 million manufacturing workers \nin this country. Today, there are only 11 million manufacturing \nworkers. In my small State of Vermont--which is not as big as Ohio or \nMichigan and has never been one of the great manufacturing centers in \nthe country, but even in a small State such as Vermont, what we have \nseen is a huge decline in good-paying manufacturing jobs, which have \ncertainly impacted our middle class.\n  Mr. President, 10 years ago, we had approximately 45,000 \nmanufacturing jobs in Vermont. Last year, we had 31,000 manufacturing \njobs in Vermont. We have lost about one-third of our manufacturing \njobs. I should tell everyone that 7,800 of those jobs were lost as a \nresult of the trade agreement with China and another 1,300 were lost as \na result of NAFTA.\n  The key issue is whether we continue our disastrous trade policy, \nwhich includes NAFTA, permanent normal trade relations with China, and \nCAFTA. Do we add on to trade policies that have failed? For the love of \nme, I cannot understand why anybody would want to do that.\n  The facts are very clear: Our current trade policies have failed, \nhave been a disaster for working families. According to a recent study \nconducted by well-respected economists at the Economic Policy \nInstitute, permanent normal trade relations with China led to the loss \nof 2.8 million American jobs--2.8 million American jobs. I remember \nbecause I was in the House when that debate took place. I heard the \nsame thing then as I hear now--Members of Congress getting up and \ntalking about all the new jobs that were going to be created. It wasn't \ntrue then and it is not true now.\n  How could we defend a trade policy based on the same principles as \nPNTR\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\nwith China when that policy cost us 2.8 million jobs in the last year \nalone?\n  Then we have NAFTA. Many of us remember the rhetoric around NAFTA. My \ngoodness, we were going to open the entire Mexican economy for products \nmade in the United States of America. We were going to be selling it in \nMexico. Does anybody in America believe that policy has worked--that \nNAFTA has worked? The facts are very clear. Again, according to the \nEPI, they found that NAFTA has led to the loss of 680,000 jobs. So the \nsimple reality is--and one doesn't have to be a Ph.D. in economics to \nfigure this out--that if a company has the option of hiring somebody in \na low-wage country at 50 cents or 70 cents an hour and they don't have \nto deal with unions or with environmental standards, why would they not \ngo to those countries? The answer is they would go. The answer is they \nhave gone.\n  That is what these trade policies are about--not selling American-\nproduced products abroad but creating a situation where companies can \nshut down in America, move factories abroad, and bring those products \nback into this country tariff free.\n\n  We have quote after quote after quote from Members of Congress who \ngot up on the floor during the NAFTA debate, during the China debate, \nand told us about all the jobs that would be created. I keep hearing \nthat rhetoric, when, in fact, nothing said in the past has proven to be \ntrue.\n  Let me quote my good friends--and they are not good friends--from the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce. They tell us this, and this is the discussion \nabout Korea, Panama, and Colombia:\n\n       This is foremost a debate about jobs. At a time when \n     millions of Americans are out of work, these agreements will \n     create real business opportunities that can generate hundreds \n     of thousands of new jobs.\n\n  But wait a second. Is this the same Chamber of Commerce that, on July \n1, 2004, according to the Associated Press, said this--this is the \nheadline: ``Chamber of Commerce leader advocates offshoring of jobs.''\n  Here is what the article stated about the Chamber of Commerce, a \nstrong advocate for these trade policies:\n\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas Donahue \n     urged American companies to send jobs overseas as a way to \n     boost American competitiveness. . . . Donahue said that \n     exporting high-paid tech jobs to low-cost countries such as \n     India, China and Russia saves companies money. . . .\n\n  Let's see, the Chamber of Commerce is leading the effort for these \ntrade agreements, but they tell us the outsourcing of jobs is a good \nthing. Maybe we want to think twice before we accept the advice of the \nChamber of Commerce.\n  The U.S. Department of Commerce has reported--and this is very \ninteresting, not only as information unto itself but about the politics \nof this whole trade agreement. We have the Chamber of Commerce and we \nhave every major multinational corporation in the country telling us \nhow good this unfettered free trade policy is. But now we have the U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce reporting that over the last decade, U.S. \nmultinational corporations slashed 2.9 million American jobs.\n  Let's digest that. Large corporations and multinationals come in here \nand say the trade agreements are great and will create American jobs. \nAt the same time, over the last decade, they have slashed 2.9 million \nAmerican jobs.\n  Here is the other side of the story. The truth is, these same \nmultinational corporations that are telling Members of Congress to vote \nfor these trade agreements--the truth is, they are creating jobs. The \nonly problem is, the jobs they are creating are not in the United \nStates of America; they are in China and other low-wage countries.\n  Over this last same period, the last decade, while they laid off 2.9 \nmillion American workers, these same multinational corporations created \n2.4 million new jobs abroad. So they laid off 2.9 million American \nworkers and created 2.4 million jobs in China and other low-wage \ncountries.\n  That, in a nutshell, is what these trade agreements are about--\nenabling corporations to shut down in America, move to low-wage \ncountries, and bring their products back into our country. The results \nare very clear. We don't need a great study done by the Department of \nCommerce or the Economic Policy Institute; all we have to do is walk \ninto any department store in America. When we buy a product, we know \nwhere that product is manufactured. It is not manufactured in Vermont, \nit is not manufactured in California, and it is often manufactured in \nChina, Mexico or other developing countries.\n  That has been the whole goal of these trade agreements--shut down \nplants in America, move them abroad, hire low-wage workers there, and \nbring the products back into this country. The idea that we would be \nextending this concept to Korea, Panama, and Colombia makes no sense to \nme at all.\n  Since the year 2000, 2.8 million American jobs have been eliminated \nor displaced as a result of the increased trade deficit with China. \nAfter all the talk on the floor of the Senate and the floor of the \nHouse, at the editorial boards of major newspapers and by leading \npoliticians about how the China Free Trade Agreement would create jobs \nin America, it is very interesting to hear what these corporations had \nto say a few years after the trade agreement was passed. In other \nwords, before it is passed, they will tell us about how we are going to \ncreate all these jobs in America. The day after it is passed, their \nline changes. The China Free Trade Agreement was passed in the year \n2000. A couple years later, Jeffrey Immelt, the CEO of General \nElectric, was quoted on this subject at an investor meeting, just one \nyear after China was admitted to the World Trade Organization. This is \nafter the Chinese-American free-trade agreement. This is what Mr. \nImmelt said:\n\n       When I am talking to GE managers, I talk China, China, \n     China, China, China.\n\n  That is him, not me--five Chinas.\n\n       You need to be there. You need to change the way people \n     talk about it and how they get there. I am a nut on China. \n     Outsourcing from China is going to grow to $5 billion. We are \n     building a tech center in China. Every discussion today has \n     to center on China. The cost basis is extremely attractive. \n     You can take an 18 cubic foot refrigerator, make it in China, \n     land it in the United States, and land it for less than we \n     can make an 18 cubic foot refrigerator today, ourselves.\n\n  This is the head of General Electric, who, by the way, I guess is \nPresident Obama's great adviser on creating jobs in America. So that \nwas 2 years after the China agreement was signed.\n  And on and on it goes. It is not just Mr. Immelt, it is major \ncorporation after major corporation. Before the agreement, it is jobs \nwere doing great in America. After the agreement, it is all of the \nadvantages of outsourcing.\n  Let me tell you how bad the situation is. By the way, I think most \nAmericans know that not only is it a disaster for our economy that we \nare not producing the products we consume, but it is really an \nembarrassment. I will cite an example. Last year, during the holiday \nseason, I walked into the Smithsonian's very beautiful American History \nMuseum. It is a great museum, and I urge everybody who comes to \nWashington to visit. I walked into the gift shop of the Smithsonian \nmuseum, owned by the people of America, paid for by the people of \nAmerica, and do you know what their gift shop had? Most of the products \nin the gift shop were not made in America. It turns out they were made \nin China or made in other low-wage countries around the world. I went \nto a section where they had little busts of Presidents of the United \nStates--George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Barack Obama--and when you \nturned them over, do you know where these busts of Presidents of the \nUnited States were made? Yes, you guessed it--in China.\n  We have since been having some discussions with the Smithsonian. They \nare in the process of changing their policies. And we are working with \nother people as well. But that is how bad the situation is, that busts \nof American Presidents, sold in a museum owned by the people of the \nUnited States of America, talking about the history and culture of \nAmerica, are made in China. That is just one example of how pathetic \nthis whole situation is. And on and on it goes.\n  By the way, when we talk about trade, we often focus on blue-collar \njobs and manufacturing jobs, but it is also increasingly information \ntechnology jobs and white-collar jobs. Just think for a moment that \nduring the past 4 years the cumulative trade deficit with China in \nadvanced technology--not talking about sneakers but advanced technology \nproducts--totaled more than $300 billion. Last year,\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\nour trade deficit with China on advanced technology products was a \nstaggering $92 billion--in 1 year alone.\n  I just bought one of these very nice iPhones. It is very nice. Do you \nknow where that product is made? It is made in China. And the iPad is \nmade in China, and the iPod and the Blackberry and IBM computers and \nDell computers and the Microsoft X-Box and big-screen TVs. None of \nthese American inventions we pride ourselves on inventing, none of the \ntechnologies we pride ourselves on developing--and Steve Jobs recently \npassed away, a great businessperson--none of these are made here. Where \nare they made? More often than not, they are made in China.\n  Let me quote from a December 15, 2010, article in the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       One widely touted solution for current U.S. economic woes \n     is for America to come up with more of the high-tech gadgets \n     the rest of the world craves. Yet two academic researchers \n     estimate that Apple's iPhone--one of the best selling U.S. \n     technology products--actually added $1.9 billion to the U.S. \n     trade deficit with China last year.\n\n  So we develop these products, but we can't manufacture them here \nbecause these companies prefer the low wages in China. And on and on it \ngoes--not just blue-collar jobs but white collar jobs as well.\n  Today, we are not talking about China and we are not talking about \nMexico. We are talking about Korea and Panama, and we are talking about \nColombia, but it is the same old story. The chamber of commerce is back \nagain suggesting the creation of all of these jobs, until the day after \nthe agreement is signed, and then they will be talking about how they \ncan throw American workers out on the street.\n  It is interesting that poll after poll shows that, to say the least, \nthe American people do not have an enormous amount of respect for the \nU.S. Congress and they see Congress as living in a very different world \nthan working-class people are living in.\n  I don't know of any example where that schizophrenia is greater than \nin terms of trade. I don't know what it is like in Rhode Island, but I \nwill tell you what it is like in Vermont when you ask people what they \nthink about these trade agreements with China. When you ask \nconstituents if they think they are creating jobs in America, they \nreply: What, are you nuts? Of course they are not. And the polls tell \nus that. In a September 2010 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 69 \npercent of Americans said they believe ``free trade between the United \nStates and other countries cost the U.S. jobs.'' I think every group in \nAmerica except the Congress seems to get that point. But then again, \nthe Congress is surrounded by lobbyists and campaign contributors who \ncome from big-money interests, and they like these unfettered free-\ntrade agreements.\n  Let me say a word or two about Korea. The Economic Policy Institute \nhas estimated that the Korea free-trade agreement will lead to the loss \nof 159,000 American jobs and will increase the trade deficit by nearly \n$14 billion over a 7-year period. Why would we want to go forward in a \ntrade agreement that will cost us jobs?\n  President Obama has estimated that the Korea Free Trade Agreement \nwill ``support at least 70,000 American jobs.'' But the headline of a \nDecember 7, 2010, article in the New York Times says it all: ``Few New \nJobs Expected Soon From Free-Trade Agreement with South Korea.'' \nAccording to this article, the Korea Free Trade Agreement ``is likely \nto result in little if any net job creation in the short run, according \nto the government's own analysis''--our government's own analysis. That \nanalysis was done by the U.S. International Trade Commission, which \nprojects our overall trade deficit will increase, not decrease, if the \nKorea Free Trade Agreement is implemented. This is our own \nInternational Trade Commission. So what are we doing? What are we \ndoing?\n  Let me touch on one aspect of the Korea Free Trade Agreement that \ndeserves a lot of focus, and I fear very much it is not getting it; \nthat is, the Korea Free Trade Agreement will force American workers not \njust to compete against low-wage workers in South Korea but also to \ncompete against the virtual slave labor conditions that exist in North \nKorea, a country which is certainly one of the most undemocratic \ncountries in the world. To add insult to injury, not only are our \nworkers going to be competing against slave labor in North Korea, some \nof the proceeds from this free-trade agreement are going to the \ndictatorship of Kim Jong Il, certainly one of the more vicious \ndictators in the entire world.\n  What that is about is that a number of companies in South Korea, \nincluding Hyundai and many others, own companies that are doing \nbusiness in a large industrial area in North Korea. This agreement will \nallow products made in North Korea to go to South Korea and then come \nback into the United States.\n  I know there has been a little confusion on this, but there shouldn't \nbe. Let me quote from a January 2011 report from the Congressional \nResearch Service, and I hope everybody who plans on voting for this \nfree-trade agreement with Korea hears this:\n\n       There is nothing to prevent South Korean firms from \n     performing intermediate manufacturing operations in North \n     Korea, and then performing final manufacturing processes in \n     South Korea.\n\n  For example, as much as 65 percent of the value of a South Korean car \ncoming into the United States could actually be made in North Korea if \nthis trade agreement goes into effect.\n  Today, we have almost 47,000 North Korean workers currently employed \nby more than 120 South Korean firms, including Hyundai, at the Kaesong \nIndustrial Complex in North Korea. What an agreement. What an \nagreement. Slave labor in North Korea manufacturing products that go to \nSouth Korea and then come into the United States of America. Meanwhile, \nthe dictatorship of North Korea gets a significant piece of the action \non top of the pennies an hour the North Korean workers get.\n  In 2007, Han Duck-soo, who was then the Prime Minister of South Korea \nand is now the current South Korean Ambassador to the United States, \nsaid:\n\n       The planned ratification of the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade \n     Agreement will pave the way for the export of products built \n     in Kaesong [North Korea] to the U.S. market.\n\n  Isn't that wonderful. Isn't that wonderful. Bad enough for workers in \nour country to have to compete against people in China and in Vietnam--\npeople making 20 cents, 30 cents, or 40 cents an hour--but now we are \nasked to compete against slave labor in Korea. And that is the treaty \npeople will be voting for today.\n  Mr. President, I think a lot of folks have mentioned, in terms of \nColombia, the assault on trade unionists there. Since 1986, some 2,800 \ntrade unionists have been assassinated. Less than 6 percent of these \nmurders have been prosecuted by the Colombian Government. Last year \nalone--last year alone, in a small country--more than 50 trade \nunionists were assassinated in Colombia. That is up 9 percent from \n2009. I ask, if in Colombia 50 CEOs of companies were killed last year, \nwere murdered last year, do you think people here would be voting for a \nfree-trade agreement with Colombia or would they say: Why would we want \nan agreement with a country that is so unlawful, that is so brutal, \nwhere so many CEOs are being killed? But it is not CEOs, it is just \ntrade union leaders, so I guess it is OK to have an agreement there.\n  I would also say that President Obama had a different view on \nColombia when he was a candidate for President in 2008. In October of \n2008, candidate Barack Obama said:\n\n       The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders \n     have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent \n     basis and there have not been prosecutions.\n\n  Candidate Obama in 2008 was right in opposing this trade agreement. \nUnfortunately, as President, he is wrong to support it right now.\n  Let me say a word about the Panama Free Trade Agreement.\n  Panama is a very small country. Its entire annual economic output is \nonly $26.7 billion a year or about two-tenths of 1 percent of the \nAmerican economy. So I think no one is going to legitimately stand here \nand say that trading with such a small country is going to \nsignificantly increase American jobs. Then why would we be considering \na trade agreement with Panama? What is going on there? Well, it turns \nout Panama is a world leader when it comes to allowing wealthy \nAmericans and large corporations to evade U.S. taxes by stashing their \ncash in offshore tax havens. And the Panama Free Trade Agreement would \nmake this bad situation much worse.\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\n  I am a member of the Budget Committee, as is the Presiding Officer, \nand we have heard testimony time and time again that our country is \nlosing up to $100 billion every year as corporations stash their money \nin postal addresses in the Cayman Islands, in Bermuda, and in Panama. \nThis trade agreement makes that situation even worse.\n  According to Citizens for Tax Justice:\n\n       A tax haven . . . has one of three characteristics: It has \n     no income tax or a very low-rate income tax; it has bank \n     secrecy laws; and it has a history of noncooperation with \n     other countries on exchanging information about tax matters. \n     Panama has all three of those. . . . They're probably the \n     worst.\n\n  That is according to Citizens for Tax Justice.\n  The trade agreement with Panama would effectively bar the United \nStates from cracking down on illegal and abusive offshore tax havens in \nPanama. In fact, combating tax haven abuse in Panama would be a \nviolation of this free-trade agreement, exposing the United States to \nfines from international authorities.\n  At a time when we have a 14-trillion-plus national debt and at a time \nwhen we are frantically figuring out ways to try to lower our deficit, \nsome of us believe it is a good idea to do away with all of these tax \nhavens by which the wealthy and large corporations stash their money \nabroad and avoid paying U.S. taxes. The Panama trade agreement would \nmake that goal even more difficult.\n  I want to say another word on an issue that I think is important as \nwe look into the future. The proposed Korea Free Trade Agreement \nthreatens both the 340B drug program, which requires drug companies to \nprovide discounts on covered outpatient drugs purchased by federally \nfunded health providers, such as community health centers and other \nsafety net providers, and the ability of Medicare Part B to hold down \nthe prices of outpatient drugs. The Korea Free Trade Agreement would \npotentially allow Korean drug manufacturers to challenge the pricing \nunder these programs on the grounds that the prices are not market \ndriven--in other words, forcing prices up in this country. That is \nsomething that was pushed, by the way, by our trade representative, not \ntheirs. In essence, the pharmaceutical industry's lobbyists, with \ncomplete indifference to the plight of millions of the most frail and \nvulnerable Americans, have succeeded in inserting provisions into the \nKorea Trade Agreement that would allow Korean companies to maximize \ntheir profits by challenging the cost control measures under the 340B \nand Medicare Part B programs.\n  But, unfortunately, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Right now, \nthe pharmaceutical lobby--and they are a very powerful lobby--and the \nU.S. Trade Representative are negotiating a new trade agreement, the \nso-called Trans-Pacific Partnership, that I fear very much will make a \nbad situation in terms of drug access for the developing world, for \npoor people all over the world, much worse than it already is. Their \naim, yet again, is to maximize drug company profits at the expense of \nthe most vulnerable populations by tying the hands of health \nauthorities here and in other developed and developing countries abroad \nwho seek to provide access to low-cost generic pharmaceutical drugs for \ntheir citizens.\n  In negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, our government is \nactively pushing intellectual profit laws for medicines that are more \nrestrictive than we impose even here in the United States, with the \neffect of making it far more difficult to get generic drugs on the \nmarket in those countries. One of them, Vietnam, is a good example. \nVietnam obviously is a very poor country. Vietnam has received more \nthan $320 million from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, \nPEPFAR, created under President George W. Bush and continued under \nPresident Obama since 2004. The function of this program is to make \nsure the poorest people in the world who have diseases such as AIDS are \nable to get the drugs they need at a price they can afford to pay, and \nthat means making generic treatments available.\n  The PEPFAR program has actually had significant success. As somebody \nwho is not a great fan of President George W. Bush, this is an area \nwhere he actually did something quite positive, and that program is \ncredited with saving millions of lives in 15 developing nations over \nthe last 7 years. In the face of one of the most severe humanitarian \ncrises in modern history, the United States put billions of dollars \ninto doing something about it, and we are doing that today.\n  So why, in the face of this success by one arm of our government, \nwould another arm work to pull the rug out from underneath it? Yet that \nis what the U.S. Trade Representative's Office is doing now.\n  In other words, on the one hand what we are trying to do is the right \nthing, the humanitarian thing, to make sure that poor and sick people \naround the world are able to get the medicines they desperately need to \nstay alive at a price they can afford to pay; and, on the other hand, \nanother part of the U.S. Government is saying, wait a second. We have \ngot to protect the interests of the drug companies and make sure they \ncan make as much money as possible so they can charge and force poor \ncountries to pay outrageously high prices for drugs even if that means \nmany people die because they can't afford those drugs. So this is a \ncontradiction. This is what our new trade policies are about.\n  I will be back on the floor at some point in the not too distant \nfuture to be talking about this very important issue, but let me \nconclude by saying this country is in the midst of the worst economic \ncrisis since the 1930s; the middle class is disappearing; poverty is \nincreasing; millions of Americans have seen a decline in their standard \nof living; the gap between the very rich and everybody else is growing \nwider. That is the reality of the American economy today.\n  One of the reasons for the collapse of the middle class is the loss \nof millions and millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs, and one of \nthe key reasons--not the only reason but one of the key reasons--we are \nlosing millions of manufacturing jobs is disastrous trade policies \ndesigned to allow American corporations to shut down here, move to low-\nwage countries, hire people there for pennies an hour, and bring their \nproducts back. That is a policy I suppose you could say has worked if \nyou are the CEO of a large corporation. You make a lot more money \npaying people 50 cents an hour than $20 an hour. You make a lot more \nmoney working in a country where there are no environmental standards \nrather than in a country where you have to have some standards \nprotecting air and water.\n  That is what our trade policy has been, and it seems to me to be \nenormously foolish for us to continue this failed policy of NAFTA, of \nCAFTA, of permanent normal trade relations with China, and extend them \nto Korea, Panama, and Colombia. I urge my colleagues to stand up to the \nbig money interests which want us to pass these trade agreements, stand \nup for American workers, and say: No. Trade is a good thing, but it has \nto be based on principles that protect ordinary Americans, working \npeople, not just the CEOs of large corporations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in the wake of another very \nsobering jobs report. Unemployment remains stalled at 9.1 percent; 14 \nmillion Americans are out of work; another 9 million have been forced \ninto part-time jobs because they simply cannot find full-time \nemployment. These challenging economic times demand that Congress and \nthe administration put aside partisanship and work together in earnest \nto address the prolonged jobs crisis.\n  Many of the decisions that will come before Congress in the next few \nmonths will be difficult ones, including those that must be made to \nrestore fiscal order to our Nation's books. But there are bipartisan \nmeasures that we know will create and preserve jobs now. We must work \ntogether to advance them.\n  One such measure before us today is the free-trade agreement with \nSouth Korea. As President Obama stated last week, this agreement ``will \nmake it easier for American companies to sell their products in South \nKorea and provide a major boost to our exports.''\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\n  South Korea is our country's seventh largest trading partner. The \nU.S. International Trade Commission estimates that implementation of \nthis agreement would increase our gross domestic product by $10 billion \nto $12 billion, and annual merchandise exports by $10 billion. The ITC \nfurther estimates that the agreement will reduce the U.S. trade deficit \nwith Korea by between $3 billion and $4 billion.\n  An analysis of the Korean agreement conducted by the staff of the ITC \nat the request of the Senate Finance Committee concludes that the \nagreement could create up to 280,000 American jobs, including more than \n650 jobs in my home State of Maine. Just this week there were \nannouncements of 130 jobs lost at a paper mill in Maine and 65 jobs \neliminated at a call center. So these new jobs, potentially 650 new \njobs, would be welcome indeed.\n  South Korea is the fifth largest international market for Maine's \nproducts. Last year, the value of Maine exports to South Korea reached \nnearly $100 million, including $31 million in chemical products, $29 \nmillion in wood pulp, $15 million in civilian aircraft and engine \nparts, $7 million in electrical machinery, and $5 million in coated \npaper and paperboard.\n  Upon implementation of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, more than \n95 percent of Maine's exports to South Korea would be duty free. Let me \nrepeat that. More than 95 percent of our exports from Maine to South \nKorea would be duty free. That means the elimination of these barriers \nto Maine's exports would expand markets for Maine's manufacturers and \nagricultural producers, and that translates into saving jobs and \ncreating jobs.\n  Korea is the fourth largest and fastest growing market for American \nfrozen potatoes, a major industry in my State. In 2009, the U.S. share \nof the Korean market was 81 percent, compared to 2 percent market share \nfor the European Union. But with the implementation of the European \nUnion-Korea Trade Agreement this past July, the European Union frozen \npotatoes now enter the Korean market duty free. That obviously gives \nEuropean Union growers a significant competitive advantage over \nAmerican exporters, who face an 18-percent tariff for shipping their \nproducts into Korea. The U.S.-Korea agreement would eliminate this \ntariff immediately, leveling the playing field for our producers.\n  According to the Maine Potato Board, which has endorsed this \nagreement, passage of this free-trade agreement is expected to \ntranslate into a $35 million annual increase in U.S. frozen potatoes \nexports to Korea. More important, in the long term it will allow \nAmerican potatoes to be the product of choice in the Korean market \nbecause, as the Presiding Officer well knows, Maine potatoes taste \nbetter than those grown by the European Union countries.\n  In all seriousness, we do need to eliminate these discrepancies in \ntariffs that give our competitors an advantage over our American \nproducers. Exports are essential to a strong industrial manufacturing \nbase throughout our country and in the State of Maine.\n  I want to read an excerpt from a letter I recently received from the \nplant manager of the General Electric Energy Plant in Bangor, ME. The \nplant manager had this to say about the potential impact if this free-\ntrade agreement were approved:\n  He wrote as follows:\n\n       GE's continuing ability to pursue expanding international \n     opportunities for our aviation, energy and financial services \n     exports is critical to our more than 700 workers in the State \n     of Maine. In fact, 100 percent of the new steam turbine units \n     coming out of our Bangor facility this year and next will be \n     exported.\n\n  That just shows how critical that export market is to maintaining \nthose 700 jobs in Maine.\n\n       The Bangor plant has, in addition, recently started \n     producing components for gas turbines. To this end, we have \n     invested roughly $30 million in Bangor, to expand capacity. \n     These gas turbines [under current law] face tariffs of 8 \n     percent in Korea. . . .\n\n  If the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement is passed, the GE plant \nmanager in Bangor told me the tariff on the gas turbines produced at \nthe Bangor plant would drop from 8 percent to 0, and that obviously \nwould make those GE products and GE's employees in Maine all that much \nmore competitive.\n  For Maine's wood pulp producers, Korea is already the second largest \ninternational market they have. Exports to Korea account for nearly 17 \npercent of the total production coming out of the pulp mill in \nWoodland, ME. In an e-mail to my office, Burt Martin, a director of the \npulp mill in Washington County, had this to say about the importance of \nthe Korean market to his business operation in Maine. He wrote:\n\n       Free trade with Asian countries means that we have an \n     operating pulp facility in Woodland, ME. . . . Koreans are \n     good paying customers--high revenue--and they are an \n     important part of our markets.\n\n  Maine's blueberry growers also will benefit from the phaseout of \ntariffs on wild blueberry products. While I would have preferred to see \nthe tariffs on blueberries eliminated immediately, the way they are on \nmany other products I mentioned, the tariff reductions that would come \nabout as a result of this agreement will help our blueberry growers \ncompete in an increasingly important market.\n  An agreement will also unlock new market opportunities for Maine's \niconic lobster industry. Live lobster exports to Korea currently face a \n20-percent tariff. Under the agreement, this tariff would be phased out \nover 5 years, making it far easier for Maine to compete in the \nmarketplace in Korea.\n  Fairchild Semiconductor in Portland, ME, is another strong supporter \nof this agreement. The manager of Fairchild cites the benefits of \n``tariff elimination, regulatory improvement, stronger intellectual \nproperty protection and simplified trade clearance procedures, measures \nthat help streamline customs procedures and help U.S. companies cut \ndown on the costs of doing business'' as advantages that would be \nbrought about by this agreement.\n  The bottom line is, exports to Korea support Maine jobs. Passage of \nthis agreement is critical to ensuring not only that we can expand \nexport opportunities, but also that we do not lose market share in one \nof the world's largest economies because our foreign competitors are \nmore aggressive in their pursuit of trade liberalization agreements.\n  On balance, I believe the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement is good for \nAmerica and good for the State of Maine, and I will vote for it. I am \nconvinced the elimination of tariffs will create jobs and help us save \njobs at this critical time in our economy.\n  I also plan to vote for the agreement with Panama, a country with \nwhich the United States had a $5.7 billion trade surplus last year. But \nI cannot support the free-trade agreement with Colombia. This was a \ndifficult decision for me to reach, and I have given it considerable \nstudy and thought. But, unfortunately, the violence against labor \nunions continues at an unacceptably high rate in that country.\n  I do appreciate and recognize that the Colombian Government has taken \nsteps to improve in this area, but I think it is simply too soon to \ndeclare the Labor Action Plan a success. I think more time is needed to \nassess progress in this area, and I wish the President had brought \nforth the two agreements I can support--those with South Korea and \nPanama--and held back on the Colombian agreement until we have a better \nsense of the direction of the country and where we are going in making \nprogress with the Labor Action Plan.\n  The benefits of free trade are not spread evenly over all sectors. \nWith any trade agreement there is a potential that some U.S. workers \nand industries may be harmed. That is why I have looked at each \nagreement individually over the years. I have supported some, and I \nhave opposed others. Frankly, the criteria I apply is whether the \nagreements benefit the people of my State and the workers of this \ncountry. It is also why I have been such a strong supporter of a robust \ntrade adjustment assistance program, and I have also strongly supported \ntough enforcement of trade laws to protect U.S. workers against unfair \ntrade practices. I have testified before the ITC in cases involving the \npaper industry where there has been illegal dumping. I have also been a \ncosponsor of the bill we just passed yesterday to crack down on \ncurrency manipulation by the Chinese Government.\n  But if the United States does not adopt policies to expand trade \nopportunities in a fair way, we will lose out on market opportunities, \nand that means\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\nwe will lose out on the creation of jobs. The jobs that would be \ncreated or sustained at home will, instead, be created and sustained in \nother countries that are aggressively pursuing trade agreements.\n  With nearly 95 percent of the world's customers living outside of our \nborders, we simply must seize opportunities to expand our exports, to \nlook for new markets for our products. Our competitors in Europe, \nCanada, and other nations are actively working to tear down barriers to \ntrade and promote their exports. We must do the same for our industries \nand for our workers.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about one of the \ngreatest job-creation measures this body has considered in a long time.\n  The three long-awaited trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and \nColombia that the Senate will soon receive will create more real, long-\nterm jobs than any stimulus approach advocated by the President.\n  While many of us are concerned about the role of government in job \ncreation--an issue that will continue to be debated by this body--we \ncan all agree that it is imperative to create a fair and efficient \nplatform on which businesses can grow. The trade agreements before us \nwill do just that.\n  Some economists believe that we are doing perpetual harm to our \nmanufacturing, agricultural and export sectors by not passing these \nagreements. For instance, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has previously \ncalculated that delaying the passage of the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement alone may have resulted in the direct loss of more than \n20,000 jobs in the United States.\n  Our trading partners have looked elsewhere for goods and services to \npower their growing economies. When Canada and Colombia completed their \ntrade agreement in August, within 15 days there was an 18-percent \nincrease in wheat exports from Canada to Colombia.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative completed negotiations in 2006 with \nColombia for the agreement we will soon have before us. Nearly 5 years \nof delays on this agreement alone have caused us irreparable damage.\n  While America was once the envy of the world for our trade \nagreements, we are now losing ground.\n  According to some estimates, the South Korean Free Trade Agreement \nhas the potential to create 280,000 jobs in America alone. South Korea \nonce called the United States its largest trading partner. We have \nsince lost that distinction to China.\n  We are not simply creating jobs by passing these agreements, we are \ninvigorating America's economy.\n  The Panama agreement will pack a significant economic punch for the \nUnited States. While it is a smaller country than South Korea or \nColombia, the International Trade Commission estimates that U.S. grain \nand meat exports to Panama will increase 60 percent.\n  In the past several years, my State of Georgia has experienced a 327-\npercent increase in exports to Panama. While these exports have \nincreased despite the tariffs exporters are burdened with, a fair and \nfree trade agreement will allow these firms to export duty-free, \nincreasing the capital available to them and giving them more \nopportunity to grow.\n  This agreement will have major implications for Georgia's \nagricultural producers. In fact, all three of these trade agreements \nwill give major benefits to Georgia's agriculture sector.\n  With the South Korea agreement, we will see gains in poultry, eggs, \nbeef, cotton, and pecan exports as tariffs on these items are phased \nout. We will see the same benefits with the Columbia pact, and that \nagreement will also eliminate peanut tariffs over the next 15 years.\n  I am proud to say that agriculture is not the only sector where \nGeorgia will see gains. I would like to highlight a couple of local \ncompanies that stand to benefit from these agreements.\n  Sasco is a third-generation family-owned business based in Albany, \nGA. Sasco produces and distributes worldwide more than 1,200 chemical \nproducts, but it faces a 5-percent tariff in Colombia.\n  For Sasco to remain competitive in South America, it must be able to \nexport duty free. While the company's president, Mark Skalla, continues \nto seek partnerships and contracts in the region, the delays he has \nexperienced are hindering Sasco's expansion.\n  Payne Hughes, CEO of Thrush Aircraft, a manufacturer of agricultural \naircraft in Georgia, says he has already seen big gains in Panama and \nColombia, where these markets continue to grow. As these countries' \neconomies expand, American business will be able to take advantage of \nthe increased needs for our quality products.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has calculated that for every $1 billion \nin agriculture exports, some 8,000 U.S. jobs are created and supported. \nEvery $1 billion in manufacturing exports supports nearly 7,000 U.S. \njobs.\n  The large-scale manufacturers in Georgia, including General Electric \nand IBM, will also see major benefits that translate to growth and job \ncreation.\n  As we continue to look for areas where we can enhance American \ncompetitiveness, increase job creation, and boost economic development, \nfree-trade agreements are a sure-fire way to make big gains. They are, \nquite simply, good for American business.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I support the approval of free trade \nagreements for one simple reason: they create jobs across America. And \nthey especially create jobs in my home State of Texas.\n  Last year, Texas companies exported lots of products to South Korea, \nColombia, and Panama, including chemical and energy products, heavy \nmachinery and electronics, cotton and grain crops, and many others. \nUnfortunately, all of these products faced trade barriers in these \ncountries through foreign tariffs amounting to hundreds of millions of \ndollars. These free trade agreements will level the playing field in \nAmerica's favor by eliminating foreign tariffs. Each of these trade \nagreements also strengthens a key strategic relationship for our \ncountry. And so I would like to say a word or two about each one.\n  The Korea Free Trade Agreement is of strategic importance because it \nreminds the world that America is a Pacific nation, and that America \nwill continue to deepen our relationships with our allies and not \nabandon East Asia to China or anybody else. The Korea Free Trade \nAgreement is the most significant on the table in terms of U.S. \nexports. South Korea is the most prosperous nation to sign a free trade \nagreement with the United States since Canada and Mexico in the 1994 \nNAFTA. Currently, Korean tariffs on U.S. products can be as high as 13 \npercent. The White House estimates that the Korean Free Trade Agreement \nwill generate up to $11 billion in new U.S. exports and 70,000 U.S. \njobs.\n  And a lot of that economic activity will be in Texas. Texas exported \n$6.4 billion in products to South Korea last year--second only to \nCalifornia. Our State's leading category of exports to Korea is \ncomputers and electronics, which include integrated circuits, magnetic \ntape, and navigational equipment. Texans also export a variety of \nchemicals and machinery to Korea.\n  The Colombia Free Trade Agreement will solidify our relationship with \na crucial ally in a volatile region of our own hemisphere. Colombia has \nbeen a leader in the fight against drug trafficking and narcoterrorism. \nColombia has also resisted the regional ambitions of Venezuela's Hugo \nChavez. The White House estimates that the Colombian Free Trade \nAgreement will generate $1 billion in new U.S. exports and thousands of \nU.S. jobs.\n  In Texas, my state exported $4.4 billion in products to Colombia last \nyear more than any other state. Those products include petroleum \nproducts, coal, chemicals, electronics, and agricultural products. \nTexas ranchers will especially welcome this agreement as beef currently \nfaces the single highest tariff in Colombia at 80 percent and this \ntrade agreement will reduce that tariff to zero. Also cotton, wheat, \nand almost all fruits and vegetables will become duty free immediately.\n  The Panama Free Trade Agreement is important because Panama is \nconducting one of the largest public works projects in history: \nexpanding the Panama Canal. This project will cost $5.25 billion and \nprovide many opportunities for construction firms and heavy equipment \nmanufacturers in the U.S. Construction equipment and infrastructure\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\nmachinery used in such projects accounted for $280 million in U.S. \nexports to Panama in 2010. The agreement will end tariffs on these \nexports, providing U.S. firms an almost immediate 5 percent price \nadvantage on procurement contracts.\n  Texas exported $1.8 billion in products to Panama last year--more \nthan any other State. Texas top exports to Panama are petroleum, coal, \nchemicals, and computers and other electronics.\n  It is clear why Congress should approve these trade agreements. What \nis not clear is why it has taken us so long to act. The Colombia Free \nTrade Agreement was signed in November 2006. The Korea and Panama \nagreements were signed in June 2007. Why has it taken more than 4 years \nto act on them?\n  The answer is that the leadership of Congress changed in 2007, and \nthat leadership has been listening too much to union bosses and other \nspecial interests. Every time we seem to be close to approving these \nagreements, these liberal special interests have come up with a new set \nof demands. On May 10, 2007, the Bush White House and Congress agreed \non new and more stringent labor and environment provisions. This action \nwas supposed to allow approval for four trade agreements; however, only \na pact with Peru was approved at that time. The Obama administration \ncould have submitted the three remaining trade agreements at any time \nsince January 2009. But new conditions kept coming.\n  In November 2010, we learned of new conditions regarding taxation \npolicy in Panama. In February 2011, we learned about new conditions \nplaced on the Korea deal regarding auto emissions standards. In April \n2011, we learned about new and strikingly detailed conditions bordering \non micromanagement--on the Colombian judiciary and law enforcement \nagencies.\n  And in May 2011, we learned about new demands for a little-known \nprogram called trade adjustment assistance, including the demand to \ndramatically expand trade adjustment assistance to cover nations the \nU.S. has not signed agreements with.\n  The time is up for demands from Washington special interests. The \ntime is now to make U.S. jobs and U.S. exports our priority. Let's send \na message of friendship to the people of South Korea, Colombia, and \nPanama. And let's send a message to U.S. exporters that real jobs \nlegislation is on its way.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama.\n  These agreements will eliminate tariffs and nontariff barriers to \nU.S. exports and protect intellectual property and investment with \nthree key trading partners.\n  At a time when the national unemployment rate stands at almost 10 \npercent--and tops 12 percent in my home State of California--I believe \nit is vital that we promote job growth by securing new opportunities \nfor U.S. manufacturers, farmers and service providers in expanding \nforeign export markets.\n  These three agreements are a good place to start.\n  They are critical to the President's goal of doubling exports over 5 \nyears, which could create 2 million new jobs. This is from a L.A. Times \neditorial of August 12, 2010.\n  It is simple: export growth as a result of these trade agreements \nwill mean more jobs.\n  And we have no time to lose. Other trading partners have signed or \nare in the process of negotiating free trade agreements with South \nKorea, Colombia and Panama.\n  The European Union has already signed free trade agreements with \nSouth Korea, Colombia, and Panama. The EU-South Korea agreement came \ninto effect in July.\n  Korea now has or is negotiating 13 free trade agreements involving 50 \nnations.\n  Canada concluded a trade agreement with Panama in 2010 and will gain \npreferential access to Colombia's market in August 2012.\n  Argentina and Brazil already have preferential access to the \nColombian market.\n  We cannot afford to let our exporters lose market share to our \ncompetitors.\n  If we are left out, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that we \ncould lose up to 380,000 jobs and $40 billion in exports.\n  The best estimate is that these agreements will, in fact, create \njobs.\n  According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, these \nagreements will create at least 70,000 U.S. jobs.\n  U.S. exports to South Korea will increase by $11 billion and raise \nU.S. GDP by $12 billion.\n  The Colombia trade agreement will increase U.S. exports by more than \n$1.1 billion and increase U.S. GDP by $2.5 billion.\n  U.S. exports to Panama grew by 41 percent in 2010 to $6.1 billion and \nwill continue to rise with passage of the free trade agreement.\n  The Business Roundtable puts the number even higher at 250,000 jobs \ncreated with passage of the three agreements.\n  Let me speak to the effects these agreements would have on my home \nState of California.\n  As one of the 10 largest economic engines in the world with a $1.9 \ntrillion economy, California is a leader in U.S. and global markets \nwith products ranging from agriculture to high-tech products and \nmanufacturing.\n  In 2008, approximately 60,000 California companies exported products \nabroad, with manufactured good exports supporting 738,000 California \njobs.\n  South Korea, Colombia and Panama already represent growing markets \nfor California exporters. In 2010, South Korea was California's fifth \nlargest export market with exports totaling more than $8.1 billion, up \nfrom $5.9 billion in 2009. In 2010, Colombia was California's 34th \nlargest export market with exports totaling $408.7 million--a 24-\npercent increase over the previous year.\n  In 2010, Panama, with a growth rate of 7.5 percent, was California's \n42nd largest export market with exports totaling $252 million.\n  Passage of these agreements will provide important openings for \nCalifornia exports which will help create jobs.\n  According to Business Roundtable, more than 66 percent of California \nexports to Colombia will be duty-free after passage of this agreement, \nsaving $27.2 million for California businesses and farmers, and more \nthan 80 percent of California exports to South Korea will be duty free \nfollowing implementation of the agreement, saving exporters $66 \nmillion.\n  In Panama, California high-quality beef, other meat and poultry \nproducts, soybeans, wines and most fresh fruit and tree nuts will \nbecome duty free upon enactment.\n  According to the California Chambers of Commerce Council for \nInternational Trade, California manufacturers will also gain \nsignificant access to the $5.25 billion Panama Canal expansion project \nas the agreement eliminates the 5 percent duty on construction \nequipment and infrastructure machinery. The project will ultimately \nreduce transportation costs for California exports.\n  Make no mistake, South Korea, Colombia and Panama represent \nsignificant opportunities for all U.S. exporters.\n  South Korea is our 7th largest trading partner, our 8th biggest \nexport market and the 15th largest economy in the world.\n  The agreement represents the largest free trade agreement since the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA.\n  While Colombia and Panama have smaller economies, they are both \nemerging trading partners. In 2010, U.S. exports to Colombia grew by 34 \npercent to $12 billion, while exports to Panama grew by 41 percent to \n$6.1 billion.\n  Again, export growth will lead to job growth.\n  Some critics of these agreements argue that benefits gained by \nlowering tariffs and nontariff barriers to U.S. exports will be offset \nby benefits gained by our trading partners.\n  The fact is, our trading partners already have substantial access to \nthe U.S. market while our exports continue to face significant \nbarriers.\n  Currently, the average Korean applied tariff on U.S. non-agricultural \nproducts is 7 percent. In contrast, the average U.S. tariff on Korean \nnonagricultural imports is 3.7 percent.\n  The average Korean applied tariff on U.S. agricultural products is 52 \npercent. The average U.S. tariff on Korean agricultural products is 12 \npercent.\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\n  Approximately 90 percent of Colombian exports and 98 percent of \nPanamanian exports enter the United States duty free under existing \ntrade preference programs.\n  In contrast, over 90 percent of U.S. exports to Colombia face tariffs \naveraging 12.5 percent, and less than 40 percent of U.S. exports to \nPanama enter duty free with industrial exports facing an average tariff \nof 7 percent and agricultural exports facing an average tariff of 15 \npercent.\n  So, these agreements will only serve to enhance U.S. competiveness by \nleveling the playing field for our exporters and give them \nopportunities our trading partners already enjoy here in the United \nStates.\n  And I know our manufacturers, farmers and service providers can \ncompete and succeed against anyone.\n  Let me briefly discuss the key benefits of these agreements.\n  Upon enactment of the agreement with South Korea, approximately 95 \npercent of bilateral trade in industrial and consumer products will \nbecome duty-free within 5 years of the enactment of the agreement, \nincluding industrial and consumer electronic machinery, most chemicals, \nmotorcycles and certain wood products. Most remaining tariffs will be \neliminated within 10 years.\n  More than half of current U.S. agricultural exports to Korea will \nbecome duty free immediately, including wheat, feed corn, soybeans for \ncrushing, hides and skins, cotton, almonds, pistachios, bourbon \nwhiskey, wine, raisins, grape juice, orange juice, cherries, frozen \nFrench fries and pet food.\n  Approximately 80 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial \nproducts to Colombia will be duty-free upon the enactment of the \nagreement. Most remaining tariffs will be removed after 10 years.\n  Both parties will grant certain farm products duty-free treatment \nimmediately upon enactment of the agreement including high-quality \nbeef, cotton, wheat, soybean meal, apples, pears, peaches, cherries and \nprocessed food products.\n  Colombia will phase out quotas and over-quota tariffs on standard \nbeef, chicken leg quarters, dairy products, corn, sorghum, animal \nfeeds, soybean oil and rice within the next three to 19 years.\n  Over 87 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial products \nto Panama will become duty free upon enactment of the agreement, with \nthe remaining tariffs phased out within 10 years.\n  Panama will provide immediate duty-free access for more than half of \nU.S. agricultural exports including high-quality beef, poultry \nproducts, soybeans, cotton, wheat, fruits and vegetables, corn oil and \nmany processed foods.\n  I understand the concern some of my colleagues have about the effects \nfree trade agreements may have on domestic jobs.\n  While I firmly believe that past free trade agreements have an \noverall positive impact on the economy and job growth, there is no \ndoubt that some Americans have lost jobs due to increased trade.\n  That is why I remain a strong supporter of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance, TAA, Program, which has helped these American workers \ntransition to new opportunities in emerging job markets.\n  TAA has proven to be a wise investment by ensuring that workers who \nlose their jobs remain productive and tax-paying members of our \nsociety, free of government assistance.\n  I am pleased that we voted to renew this critical program before the \nvote on the three trade agreements.\n  Now, I would like to address specific concerns raised about the \nagreements with Colombia and Korea.\n  Critics have argued that, given Colombia's weak labor laws and \nviolence against labor leaders and union organizers, it should not be \nrewarded with a free trade agreement.\n  First, under the terms of the free trade agreement, Colombia has \nagreed to: reaffirm its obligations as a member of the International \nLabor Organization, ILO, and adopt and maintain in its laws and \npractice core labor rights and ILO labor standards; refrain from \nwaiving or otherwise weakening the laws that implement this obligation \nin a manner affecting trade or investment; effectively enforce labor \nlaws related to the fundamental rights, plus acceptable conditions of \nwork with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational \nsafety and health; and ensure that workers and employers will have \nfair, equitable and transparent access to labor tribunals or courts.\n  All labor obligations are subject to the agreement's dispute \nsettlement procedures.\n  Colombia in April also agreed to an action plan related to labor \nrights to prevent violence against labor leaders, prosecute antilabor \nviolence and protect internationally recognized worker rights.\n  Among other things, this plan requires Colombia to: create a \nspecialized Labor Ministry to improve the enforcement of labor rights; \ncriminalize actions or threats that could affect fundamental workers' \nrights including the right to organize; eliminate the backlog of \nrequests from union members for protection; expand the scope of a \nprotection program for union leaders to additional labor activists and \nunion organizers; assign 95 police investigators to support the \nprosecution of crimes against union members; double the number of labor \ninspectors by hiring 480 inspectors over the next 4 years including 100 \nnew inspectors in 2011; and seek the assistance of the International \nLabor Organization to implement and enforce these pledges.\n  Colombia has met the first two deadlines for implementation of the \naction plan and I look forward to the successful completion of the \nremaining commitments.\n  There was also great concern about the auto provisions in the \noriginal 2007 U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement.\n  Currently, South Korea maintains an 8-percent tariff on U.S. autos. \nThe United States maintains a 2.5-percent tariff on Korean autos and a \n25-percent tariff on Korean trucks.\n  Under the 2007 agreement, South Korea and the United States agreed to \neliminate their respective duties on priority passenger vehicles \nimmediately, to phase out their duties on other cars over 3 years and \nto phase out their duties on trucks over 10 years. In addition, South \nKorea agreed to eliminate the discriminatory aspects of its special \nconsumption and annual vehicle taxes; not impose any new engine \ndisplacement taxes and to maintain non-discriminatory application of \nits existing taxes; and address several other non-tariff barriers to \nensure that they do not impede the market access of U.S. autos.\n  The U.S. auto industry and labor unions argued that the United States \nshould not expand Korean access to the U.S. market until U.S. \nmanufacturers are able to significantly increase their market share in \nSouth Korea and South Korea makes more concrete assurances that it will \ndismantle nontariff barriers.\n  President Obama responded to their concerns and secured additional \nconcessions from Korea that will expand U.S. access to the Korean auto \nmarket.\n  Under the terms of the December, 2010 agreement the U.S. will keep \nits 2.5-percent tariff on Korean imports until the 5th year following \nenactment of the agreement while Korea will immediately cut its tariff \non U.S. autos in half--from 8 percent to 4 percent--and fully eliminate \nthe tariff in the fifth year; and the U.S. will keep its 25-percent \ntariff on trucks until the 8th year and eliminate it by year 10 while \nKorea will keep its original commitment to eliminate its 10 percent \ntariff on U.S. trucks immediately.\n  The agreement also contains new provisions to eliminate nontariff \nbarriers to U.S. auto exports to Korea and increase protection against \nsurges of Korean auto imports in the U.S.\n  I applaud the administration for listening to the concerns of U.S. \nautomakers.\n  These additional provisions strengthen the overall agreement and will \nprovide new benefits for U.S. autos in an expanding foreign market and \ncreate more jobs. Due to President Obama's efforts, the United Auto \nWorkers union and U.S. automakers now support the Korea agreement.\n  In these difficult economic times, our constituents are sending us a \nclear message: they want Congress to focus on jobs.\n  In this effort, we should leave no stone unturned.\n  Expanding access for U.S. exports to the growing markets of Korea, \nColombia and Panama will help create new jobs and increase economic \ngrowth.\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support these agreements.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I support all three pending free trade \nagreements, FTAs. They will be good for our country and good for \nVirginia. They will create jobs by opening markets for high quality \nAmerican products.\n  Trade with Korea was worth $379 million to Virginia in 2010. Colombia \nwas worth $80 million and Panama was worth $30 million. The \nCommonwealth stands to benefit from expanded opportunities for \nagriculture, chemicals, information technology, services, and other key \nsectors.\n  The success of FTAs for Virginia can be seen in the 13 other \nagreements entered into over the past decade. The 2004 U.S.-Singapore \nFTA enabled Singapore to become the fastest-growing market among the \nmajor buyers of Virginia's goods, rising from $300 million to over $1 \nbillion last year, mainly in computers and electronics.\n  All told, Virginia did $17.1 billion in exports last year, including \n$14 billion in manufactured goods, $1.2 billion in agriculture, and a \nhost of other products.\n  Nonetheless, it is very important to me that we do more as a country \nto make sure the benefits of trade agreements and international \ncommerce are more evenly distributed across this country.\n  In the past, some States have done really well under trade deals. \nOthers have not. Most of Virginia has been lucky to be on the winning \nend of trade. But there are areas, like southside Virginia, that have \nnot seen the same benefits from earlier trade deals.\n  That is why I am a strong advocate for onshoring initiatives and \ngreater economic engagement between foreign-owned companies and rural \nAmerica. I have joined my Virginia colleague, Representative Frank \nWolf, in sponsoring bipartisan legislation called America recruits, \nwhich would support new inbound investment into the United States.\n  The United States is one of the few countries without a national \npolicy of supporting the recruitment of new companies. As a former \nGovernor, I can tell you that this hamstrings the States when they \ncompete head-to-head with foreign countries that can match or exceed \nsupport for individual State recruitment efforts.\n  Looking forward, I hope the President and the Administration will be \nambitious in working to complete the nine-country Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, TPP, as soon as possible.\n  I commend our Trade Representative for the ongoing work on TPP. It is \nan innovative new type of trade deal, which aims for a high-standard, \nbroad-based regional free trade agreement with Australia, Brunei \nDarussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam.\n  It is critically important that we not lose sight of the fact that \nmany of our competitors, ranging from Canada and the European Union to \nChina, India, and Brazil are signing market access agreements and trade \ndeals as quickly as possible. They understand the value of securing \nfavorable terms for their goods and services in an increasingly \nglobalized world. We cannot sit back and do nothing when 95 percent of \nthe world's consumers live outside the United States.\n  Therefore, while new trade agreements and efforts to remove market \nbarriers are crucial, I conclude by urging Congress to reauthorize \nTrade Promotion Authority, TPA, which expired 4 years ago.\n  TPA is often just referred to as ``fast track'' authority to pass \ntrade agreements. But it is much more than that. TPA sets the direction \nof U.S. trade policy and guides the work of our trade negotiators.\n  We need to have clear national objectives for trade and economic \nengagement. We need a greater focus on development and maintenance of \nglobal supply chains. We need strategies to address intellectual \nproperty issues and emerging concerns about the effects of state-owned \nenterprises as we focus on expanding market opportunities for U.S. \ngoods and services.\n  Trade is a key aspect of U.S. competitiveness. It is difficult to get \ncompletely right, but it is important to acknowledge our progress. The \nU.S. House of Representatives has just passed the three free trade \nagreements this evening. I hope the Senate will do the same in the next \nfew hours so that we can continue to work together in support of an \ninternational economic agenda that benefits the United States to the \ngreatest extent possible.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome the imminent \narrival of free trade agreements that are long-overdue in this Chamber. \nOur Nation grew to be the leader of the free world through trade and \ncommerce, and we must not lose sight of the fact that safeguarding our \naccess to world markets is essential to maintaining our economic \npreeminence.\n  These free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama \nwhich I look forward to supporting this evening, represent real \nmeasures that will produce jobs and provide better opportunities for \nour manufacturers to sell their goods abroad. Given our faltering \neconomy and the continuing high rate of unemployment, it is significant \nthat today we can vote to implement policy that will put Americans to \nwork and let our businesses compete on a level playing field with \nforeign competitors. Gaining access to hundreds of millions of \nconsumers across the globe will have a monumental effect on our local \neconomies.\n  For years, most goods from Colombia and Panama have entered the U.S. \nduty-free, and it is about time that the President submitted these \nagreements to Congress so that American businesses can enjoy equal \ntreatment. Despite having successfully negotiated treaties on his desk, \nthe President stood by as other countries signed free trade pacts with \nthese nations, forcing American exporters to watch as international \ncompetitors benefited. As the global economy continues to evolve, the \nsubmission of these agreements for congressional consideration is an \nimportant step to spur further trade and contribute to the growth of \nour economy at a time when it is so badly needed.\n  During these challenging economic times, American businesses should \nnot have to face trade barriers, such as high tariffs, which put them \nat a competitive disadvantage. Since 1997, New Hampshire's exports to \nColombia have increased by nearly 1,300 percent, nearly 200 percent to \nPanama, and by 324 percent to South Korea. However, U.S. exporters pay \nbillions of dollars a year through tariffs on industrial goods. After \nthese free trade agreements go into effect, 95 percent of those tariffs \nwill be eliminated, meaning that American businesses will benefit by \nexpanding payroll and consumers will benefit by lowered costs for goods \nand services.\n  With the highest growth rate in the Northeast and the fourth highest \ngrowth rate in the country, New Hampshire in particular stands to \nbenefit from these agreements. New Hampshire exported $4.4 billion \nworth of merchandise in 2010, a major component of our State's \napproximately $60 billion total GDP. We have 15,000 New Hampshire jobs \nsupported by exports, which represents a quarter of our manufacturing \nsector. The improved access to foreign markets brought about by these \nagreements will allow our industries to continue to grow and contribute \nto the economic environment that has made New Hampshire an attractive \nplace for entrepreneurs to come to build their businesses.\n  We need these free trade agreements because we need to commit to \neconomic policies that will create jobs and grow our economy.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the three \npending agreements that the Senate will be considering later today.\n  But before I address these agreements, I first want to express my \nstrong support for the reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program.\n  Three weeks ago I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in passing \nan expansion of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program to support \nworkers in Minnesota and across this Nation who have lost their jobs or \nseen their hours reduced as a result of global exchange.\n  I made clear then that I believed it was essential that we act on \ntrade adjustment assistance before turning to the pending agreements \nand--with the House passing this legislation today--that is exactly \nwhat we have done.\n  As chair of the Senate subcommittee on export promotion, I have long \nbeen\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\na proponent of increasing U.S. exports and helping U.S. producers reach \nnew markets overseas.\n  Ninety-five percent of the world's customers live outside our \nborders. So it is without exaggeration that I say our future prosperity \nhinges on our ability to reach those customers.\n  As we continue to work to move our country out of this current \neconomic downturn, we must take every available step we can to increase \nthe competitive edge of American producers, farmers, and workers in the \nglobal economy.\n  I will therefore be voting for both the South Korea and Panama \nagreements. While these agreements are not perfect, after hearing from \nMinnesota farmers and businesses, I believe they can help open new \noverseas markets for Minnesota producers and increase U.S. exports.\n  The South Korea agreement is projected to increase U.S. exports to \nSouth Korea by an estimated $10 billion and increase U.S. GDP by $11 \nbillion.\n  The agreement will have key benefits for my home State of Minnesota. \nOf Minnesota's top 10 exports to South Korea--such as machinery and \nelectronics, medical equipment, and animal feed and meats--9 are \nexpected to gain under the agreement.\n  Many of those gains are expected to be in our State's agriculture \nindustry, where South Korea is the fifth largest trading partner for \nMinnesota farmers. This agreement will reduce tariffs on dairy, corn, \nsoybeans, pork, and other food products, allowing our Minnesota \nproducers increased access to Korean markets.\n  The Korea agreement will also eliminate tariffs on processed food, \nhelping to increase exports and promote job growth for Minnesota's \nprocessed food producers like General Mills, Schwan's, and Hormel.\n  The Korea agreement will also benefit the workers in our state's \nstrong medical device industry. South Korea is currently the fifth \nlargest market for U.S. medical equipment exports.\n  Under the pending agreement, South Korea will immediately eliminate \ntariffs on 43 percent of medical equipment exports and eliminate \ntariffs on 90 Percent of the remaining medical equipment products in 3 \nyears.\n  Finally, I support the Korea agreement because it includes \nunprecedented provisions to defend intellectual property rights, \npromote transparency in Korea's trading and regulatory systems, and \nensure full and equitable protection and security for American \ninvestors in Korea.\n  Unfortunately, too many foreign nations engage in illegal trade \npractices, and too often they get away with it.\n  I have long said that in order to ensure a level playing field for \nU.S. businesses and workers in an increasingly competitive global \nenvironment, we need enforceable standards in our agreements and we \nneed to hold other nations accountable to those standards.\n  Over the years, I have consistently fought to expose these illegal \nbehaviors and worked hard to support several Minnesota industries such \nas our coated paper producers, steel producers, honey producers, and \nalternative energy producers. And just this week the Senate came \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to crack down on China's currency \nmanipulation that is undermining our businesses and workers.\n  As we move forward, I will continue to do everything I can to ensure \nthat the standards included in the Korea agreement--and all other \nagreements--are strongly and fairly enforced.\n  I would also like to briefly discuss the Panama Free Trade Agreement.\n  Like the Korea agreement, I believe the Panama agreement will promote \nU.S. exports and strengthen market access for Minnesotan and U.S. \ncompanies.\n  The United States already runs a trade surplus with Panama. Through \nthe immediate elimination of tariffs on 88 percent of U.S. exports to \nPanama, and the elimination of remaining tariffs within 10 years, that \nsurplus will only increase.\n  The Panama agreement presents new opportunities for Minnesota \nmanufacturers and their workers and, like the Korea agreement, also \npromotes greater transparency and enforcement in Panama.\n  Finally I will oppose the Colombia agreement which does not do enough \nto address the country's endemic corruption and violence directed \ntoward labor.\n  Increasing U.S. exports will bring many opportunities to our \nbusinesses and workers, and implementation of the Korea and Panama Free \nTrade Agreements, as well as the Trade Adjustment Assistant Program, \nwill help our Nation stay competitive in the global economy.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the trade agreements \npending before the Senate.\n  I first want to note how pleased I am that a full extension of trade \nadjustment assistance will be sent to President Obama for his \nsignature. This important program provides much-needed job training, \nhealth care, and income support to workers whose jobs are affected by \ntrade.\n  As we seek to grow our economy and increase exports we must take \nsteps to train American workers and provide them with continued job \nopportunities.\n  I am supporting the free trade agreement with South Korea because of \nits impact on California's economy. This agreement is not perfect, but \non balance I believe it will benefit California.\n  South Korea is California's 5th largest trading partner. California \ncompanies export more than $7 billion in goods there every year. This \nagreement will reduce tariffs and other trade barriers for California \nbusinesses that export goods to South Korea, resulting in greater \nproductivity in my State. In addition, the South Korean economy is \nadvanced, with per capita GDP equal to $30,000 year and a well-\ndeveloped middle class, which will provide a substantial market for all \ntypes of U.S. exports.\n  The South Korea Free Trade Agreement also includes strong \nintellectual property rights that protect U.S. patents and trademarks \nand copyrights for films and other recorded works. These provisions are \nvery important for California's entertainment sector. The agreement \nalso reduces tariffs on U.S.-made machinery and high-tech products, \nincreasing export potential for California industries.\n  The agreement also includes carefully negotiated rules for \nautomobiles, to protect our auto industry from unfair treatment. I am \npleased that the United Auto Workers were able to support the final \nversion.\n  The free trade agreement opens the Korean market to the large number \nof agricultural products we produce in California. In February 2011, I \nwrote to the administration to urge better market access for two \nimportant California products: rice and fresh oranges. While I am \ndisappointed that California rice is not part of the FTA, I was pleased \nthat the Obama administration will continue working to expand market \naccess for California rice and for California citrus. As the agreement \nis implemented I will continue to press for fair treatment for all \nCalifornia agricultural commodities.\n  I am also supporting this agreement because South Korea is a close \nfriend and strategically-important ally for the United States in East \nAsia. Strengthening our trade relationship will bring economic and \nnational security benefits to both nations, and will help to ensure \nthat the U.S.-Korea relationship remains strong in the future.\n  The South Korea FTA is supported by the California Chamber of \nCommerce, the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, the Motion Picture \nAssociation of America, the California Association of Port Authorities, \nthe California Manufacturing and Technology Association, the Pacific \nMerchant Shipping Association, the California Farm Bureau Federation, \nthe Wine Institute, the Coachella Valley Economic Partnership, the \nCalifornia Table Grape Commission, the California Walnut Commission, \nthe California Strawberry Commission, the California Fig Advisory \nBoard, the California Dried Plum Board, and the Western Growers \nAssociation, among many other groups.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee \nresponsible for human rights, I cannot support a free trade agreement \nwith Colombia. In short, Colombia's human rights record is appalling.\n  More than 2,800 union members have been murdered in Colombia in the \nlast 25 years, including 51 last year, and many more so far in 2011. \nThe conviction rate for union murders and other\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\nviolence is shockingly low, and the Colombian government continues to \nsupport policies that deny workers the right to join unions and bargain \ncollectively.\n  I am pleased that under a labor rights action plan negotiated between \nthe Obama administration and the Colombia government that steps are \nbeing taken to provide more protection for union members and to \ninvestigate crimes, but I have major concerns that these reforms do not \ngo far enough to provide real changes for workers in Colombia.\n  This summer trade unionists from Colombia came to the United States \nto discuss the environment for working people in their country. Their \nstories are chilling.\n  A Colombian port worker described how he is one of the few union \nmembers at the ports because so many trade unionists have been fired \nfor joining unions. He talked about how the unsafe working conditions \nhave caused dozens of deaths at ports, how those who are injured on the \njob receive no compensation from their employer, and how older workers \nare routinely fired.\n  A math and science teacher discussed how teachers who participate in \norganizing efforts have their salaries withheld, and that the threat of \nviolence against teachers with union ties forces many to flee their \nhomes and their jobs to protect their families.\n  Human Rights Watch recently released a report that concluded that \nColombia has made ``virtually no progress'' in securing convictions for \nkillings that have occurred in the last 4 years. Until Colombia's labor \nand human rights record shows significant long-term improvement, I \ncannot support a Free Trade Agreement, especially when U.S. producers \nstand to gain little from market access.\n  When the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, was approved, we \nwere told that the U.S. would run a trade surplus with Mexico and gain \nhundreds of thousands of jobs. But instead, our trade deficit with \nMexico increased to almost $100 billion, displacing an estimated \n682,900 U.S. jobs.\n  The economic situation in Mexico when NAFTA was passed is similar to \nthe current climate in Colombia--a very low per capita GDP and a large \npercentage of the population living in poverty. A free trade agreement \nwith Colombia under these conditions will result in the displacement of \nU.S. manufacturing jobs and few consumers for U.S. exports, just like \nwhat happened with Mexico after implementation of NAFTA.\n  I also oppose the free trade agreement with Panama.\n  For many years, Panama has failed to implement international tax \nstandards. It has been a haven for those who seek to avoid their tax \nobligations. More than 400,000 multinational corporations register \nbusinesses in Panama, a nation with a population of 3.4 million people. \nThat is one corporation for every seven persons. Although the recent \nTax Information Exchange Agreements entered into by Panama are a step \nin the right direction, I will continue to have significant concerns \nabout Panama's tax policies until they have fully implemented an \naccountable system.\n  I hope that Panama will eventually develop a well-functioning tax \nsystem and cooperate with the international community, but I cannot \nsupport a Free Trade Agreement until a higher standard is reached.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, since World War II the United States has \ntraded away American jobs in the name of foreign policy by entering \ninto bilateral and multilateral trade agreements.\n  With a 9.1 percent national unemployment rate, 14 million Americans \nlooking for work, and 10.6 percent unemployment in Rhode Island, there \nare no more jobs to give. As such, I cannot support these trade \nagreements with Korea, Colombia, and Panama that the Senate is \nconsidering today.\n  I am not convinced these trade deals will result in net job growth \nfor the United States. The International Trade Commission's analysis of \nthe agreements finds negligible changes to aggregate employment and \noutput. Analysis from The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the \nKorea FTA would lead to a loss of 159,000 jobs--much of this in the \nmanufacturing sector. It must be stressed that, according to these \nanalyses, any potential job gains associated with increases in American \nexports will be offset by job losses resulting from increased imports \nto the United States.\n  Moreover, as a recent economic study has shown, my State is one of \nthe most susceptible to labor-intensive imports. And as the \nInternational Trade Commission's sector analysis of these free trade \nagreements found, industries that are based in Rhode Island align with \nthose foreign industries that will have the most access to U.S. \nmarkets. I am very concerned that Rhode Island businesses will feel the \nbrunt of this import pressure while realizing little of the potential \ngains from exports.\n  It is likely that U.S. job losses associated with the Korea FTA will \nbe disproportionately felt in Rhode Island, particularly in the textile \nsector. The nature of the agreement and the change in tariff schedules \npick clear winners and losers. U.S. agriculture and passenger vehicles \nwill be winners, while manufacturing industries central to my State \nlike textiles will be losers. I have heard from Rhode Island businesses \nopposed to the Korea agreement for this very reason.\n  I, also, have serious reservations about the Colombian and Panama \nagreements. These agreements will have a relatively small impact on the \nU.S. economy, but present basic questions of accountability. Colombia \nhas one of the highest rates of anti-union violence in the world. \nPanama has its own duty free zone and there are concerns about whether \nthere are enough resources being dedicated to deter illegal \ntransshipment of goods, which could lead to other nations taking \nadvantage of our trade agreement with Panama by skirting customs and \nviolating ``rules of origin'' requirements. Additionally, despite \nPanama's recent tax information exchange agreement, questions remain \nabout the degree to which transparency and bank secrecy laws will \ncontinue to be obstacles to enforcing U.S. tax law.\n  Both Colombia and Panama have made efforts to correct these issues. \nHowever, the results of these efforts are not clear and more work \nremains to be done to ensure that accountability is built into the \nsystem.\n  I do want to stress that my opposition to these agreements is not \nmeant to undercut the good work of our partners and allies in Korea, \nColombia, and Panama. Korea is one of our most vital partners in Asia \nand a democracy that shares our values. Colombia is an important Latin \nAmerican ally that has made enormous progress in strengthening the rule \nof law and combating extremist organizations and drug traffickers. And \nthe United States has a singular relationship with Panama that has \nprogressively strengthened over time.\n  However, at this time, I think we should stop and pause and think \nabout our domestic needs and how to get our economy back on track. The \nUnited States needs to enter into trade agreements that will \nunequivocally benefit Americans workers--these trade deals do not. So, \nI will vote against the Korea, Colombia, and Panama trade agreements, \nand continue working to find a better way to promote bilateral trade \nthat will lead to job growth here at home.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, our country continues to struggle with the \naftereffects of the housing bubble and the economic mistakes of the \nprevious decade. There has been a great human cost to this economic \nslump--families forced out of their homes, shameful increases in child \npoverty, and a shrinking middle class.\n  President Obama has offered a number of steps to help heal our \neconomy and put people back to work. One such plan includes a doubling \nof U.S. exports within five years. Exports are good for America and \ngood for American jobs. They strengthen our manufacturing and \nagriculture sectors and in turn create good paying jobs. Quite simply, \nto help create more jobs here at home, we need to be able to access new \nmarkets and eliminate trade barriers for U.S. exporters.\n  At the same time, we must ensure that we engage not just in free \ntrade, but fair trade--trade that upholds our values on labor, human \nrights, and environmental protections, fair treatment of U.S. products, \nand supports transparent markets.\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\n  That is why in my time in Congress I have always considered each \npotential trade agreement on a case by case basis.\n  This year, it was clear to me that we could not approve further free \ntrade agreements if the trade adjustment assistance programs were not \nextended. We can't expand free trade without helping workers who may be \ndisplaced because of trade agreements. I strongly support and voted to \nextend the benefits under trade adjustment assistance. Since 2009, TAA \nhas provided assistance to 447,235 workers--119,772 in Illinois--\ndisplaced due to trade agreements. It has provided training for workers \nas they transition to a new career, help with income, and health care \ntax credits to ease the transition.\n  Overall I believe in trade. I believe trade creates jobs. Illinois is \nthe country's sixth largest exporter. Exports grew 19.6 percent from \n2009 and totaled over $50 billion in 2010 and supported 540,000 jobs. \nIn 2008 alone, nearly 17,000 companies exported goods from Illinois \nlocations. Iconic Illinois companies like Caterpillar, John Deere, and \nBoeing rely on trade to grow their business and support workers in \nIllinois and across the country. Other industries, including Illinois \nagriculture, have used trade to expand markets and feed more and more \nof the world. Motorola, ADM, Illinois Tool Works, Navistar, Abbott, \nFortune brands and many others rely on trade to help grow business here \nat home.\n  I also believe trade keeps America engaged in the world. It gives us \neconomic and diplomatic leverage around the world. Too often in recent \nyears we have sat on the sidelines while countries with emerging \nmarkets sign bilateral trade agreements with our competitors in the EU \nand elsewhere--too often at America's loss.\n  Last year, U.S. exports supported 9.2 million good paying American \njobs. Every $1 billion in new exports supports 6,000 additional jobs \nhere at home. The free trade agreements now being considered by \nCongress similarly offer the potential to open new markets for \nagricultural, consumer and industrial exporters.\n  The South Korea Free Trade Agreement alone is estimated to support \n70,000 additional jobs by opening up Korea's $560 billion market to \nU.S. companies. South Korea is Illinois' 16th largest export market. We \nexported $788 million in goods and services in 2010. Illinois Pork \nProducers will gain improved access to a market that is constantly \ngrowing. With this trade agreement, 66 percent of tariffs on \nagricultural products will be eliminated immediately, allowing us to \nbetter compete with imports from Europe. Chemical manufacturers \naccounted for an average of $97 million per year of Illinois' \nmerchandise exports to Korea between 2008 and 2010. This deal will mean \nthat 50 percent of U.S. chemicals exports by value will receive duty-\nfree treatment, immediately creating opportunities for Illinois \nexporters. And many of those exports were moved through the Port of \nChicago, which supports and strengthens our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Profile Products is a company based in Buffalo Grove, IL, with \noffices and plants in five other States. This company makes products \nthat help establish turf and accessories to control erosion on sports \nfields, golf courses, and landscaping. It has been exporting to South \nKorea for over 15 years. The company faces tariffs up to 14 percent. \nPassage of the South Korea FTA would eliminate tariffs on the company's \nexports to South Korea, allowing the company to grow and to hire more \nAmerican employees.\n  The Panama Free Trade Agreement also provides opportunities for \nseveral Illinois companies and industries. As Panama continues with the \n$5.25 billion expansion of the Panama Canal, Illinois companies like \nJohn Deere and Caterpillar will see almost all tariffs eliminated for \nequipment and infrastructure machinery with this trade deal. Ninety-two \npercent of large mining trucks shipped from Caterpillar's Decatur, IL, \nlocation are exported. Eighty-two percent of Large Track Type Tractors \nshipped from the East Peoria, IL, plant are exported. With the \nelimination of tariffs on exports into Panama, Caterpillar's American \njobs are more secure.\n  Passing these two free trade agreements with growing free market \ndemocracies is an important step in meeting the President's goal of \ndoubling exports in five years, creating more American jobs, and \nstaying engaged in the global community.\n  On the third proposed agreement--the one with Colombia--I have \nwrestled with whether this is the time to support such a step. Colombia \nis a strong American ally in an often turbulent region. It will remain \nour strong friend and partner.\n  Last year, as chairman of the Senate Human Rights and the Law \nSubcommittee, I held a hearing that examined the human rights situation \nin Colombia.\n  Colombia has made progress on protecting human rights, activists and \nindigenous populations and providing reparations and returning land to \nthose who have been displaced during the decade long civil war. \nColombia has worked with the U.S. to develop and implement the ``Action \nPlan Related to Labor Rights'' in an attempt to address issues that \nhave allowed more than 2800 union members to be murdered since 1986.\n  But the action plan is not included in this trade agreement and, \ngiven the history of violence and human rights abuses, I worry that its \nomission leaves us without an enforcement capability to ensure it is \nfollowed to completion.\n  While Colombia's steps to mitigate human rights abuses should be \nnoted, the trend remains troubling. In 2010, 51 unionists were murdered \nand many cases have not been brought to justice. Too often perpetrators \nof violence do so with impunity. So far this year, 22 unionists have \nbeen killed in Colombia--10 since the action plan on labor rights was \nagreed to. Too often workers who try to unionize are fired and \nblacklisted. Some continue to receive death threats.\n  There are other examples, including the baseless prosecutions of \nhuman rights defenders, and the ``false positives'' cases, where \ninnocent civilians were executed by the military and passed off as \nrebel fighters killed in combat.\n  Simply put, these problems remain unacceptable. More needs to be \ndone. The Colombian government needs to utilize every available \nresource to ensure that unionists, indigenous populations, and their \nallies are protected. Colombia also needs to ensure that victims are \ntreated fairly, human rights violators are brought to justice, and that \nlaws are enforced.\n  I support trade with Colombia and hope such an agreement is in our \nnear future, but I cannot in good conscience ignore the fact that my \nvote for this Colombia Free Trade Agreement would indicate my approval \nthat enough has been done to stem human rights abuses in Colombia. It \nhasn't.\n  Mr. President, seeing no one seeking recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Iran Sanctions\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I know we will soon be voting on these \ntrade agreements, but I have an issue that I think has immediacy in \nnature and needs to be brought up now. It is something I have been \npursuing for some time.\n  We have heard FBI evidence of an alleged plot by Iran and its elite \nQuds Force to assassinate a foreign diplomat on U.S. soil--an \nextraordinary act of international terrorism that demands, at a \nminimum, immediate enactment of the most robust sanctions against Iran \npossible. Were it not for the vigilance of the American intelligence \ncommunity, the FBI, and all our law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies working together, this plot could have not only taken the life \nof Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the United States but potentially \nhundreds of innocent Americans here in Washington.\n  Think of the Machiavellianism of taking out the Saudi Ambassador at a \ndowntown Washington restaurant and what that would mean in terms of \nlives lost and the inevitable response it would provoke from the Saudis \nand from the United States.\n  In the coming weeks, we will hear the exact details of this \nincredible plot\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\nand the extent of the involvement of members of the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard. We know the Revolutionary Guard in Iran is at the \nhighest levels of the Iranian Government. That is why I specifically \ntargeted the Revolutionary Guard in the Iran sanctions legislation that \nis now law. The new legislation I call on my colleagues to support and \nwhich now has 76 bipartisan cosponsors will consolidate our original \nsanctions law.\n  Iran's actions demand that we move this legislation in the Congress \nas we simultaneously go to the United Nations, to the international \ncommunity, and bring to bear whatever pressure we can to convince the \nChinese and the Russians to agree to tighter sanctions against Iran.\n  The fact is--clearly--we must do all we can to end Iran's exportation \nof terrorism, which has already taken lives around the globe from \nLebanon to Argentina, is responsible for attacks on coalition forces in \nIraq, our own soldiers in Iraq, and now threatens innocent Americans in \nour Nation's Capital. I, for one, am not shocked at the revelations we \nhave heard in the last 24 hours. I have known what this regime is \ncapable of, what it intends, and what it will do to achieve its goals. \nThe time has come for this Congress to take the first step in \nresponding to this egregious plot to conduct an assassination in a \ndowntown Washington restaurant.\n  Since I took Federal office in 1993, then in the House of \nRepresentatives, I have raised, for some time, this issue of Iran and \nits ambitions. I have vociferously and passionately advocated my \nconcern on behalf of the Jewish people in the State of Israel to \nprotect them from the threat of a radical Iranian regime. Now that \nthreat has been directed here, toward American soil, where even \nAmerican citizens could have died in a plot that defies the imagination \nin its brashness, boldness, and irrationality.\n  What specifically do we do? Our first act must be to immediately \nrespond with tougher sanctions that isolate Iran politically and \neconomically--sanctions that will freeze the assets of the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard Corps members and allies and shut down the IRGC's \nsources of revenue, expedite the imposition of sanctions, force \ncompanies to decide whether they want to do business with the United \nStates or Iran, and ensure that the United States is an Iranian oil-\nfree zone by banning imports of refined petroleum made with Iranian \ncrude.\n  To that end, along with Senators Lieberman, Kyl, Gillibrand, Casey, \nKirk, and Collins, we have introduced in the Senate the Iran, North \nKorea, and Syria Sanctions Consolidation Act of 2011. It is a bill \nwhich recognizes that if Iran's principal goal is to acquire weapons of \nmass destruction and apparently conduct brazen attacks on American soil \nagainst international officials, then it must be the policy of the \nUnited States to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring \nthe capability to threaten its neighbors and to threaten nations around \nthe world.\n  The time has come to take that first step and move this legislation.\n  This legislation closes the remaining loopholes in our sanctions \npolicy. In essence, it is perfecting the sanctions policy we helped \npass in the Senate. It insists on a comprehensive diplomatic initiative \nwithin the United Nations to qualitatively expand the U.N. Security \nCouncil sanctions regime against Iran so Iran cannot find a financial \nsafe harbor or a willing partner anywhere in the world. It imposes \nimmigration restrictions on senior officials from Iran, North Korea and \nSyria and their associates who seek to enter our country, and it \ncomplements those sanctions by reaching out to the Iranian people--\nfacilitating democracy assistance and developing a comprehensive \nstrategy to promote Internet freedom and access to information inside \nIran. These sanctions will help deter the threat Iran poses to U.S. \nnational security because of its suspected nuclear weapons program and \nwill have an impact on Iran's ability, through the Revolutionary Guard \nand its intelligence arm, to carry out another plot such as the one we \nhave uncovered.\n  What have we learned in the last 24 hours? We have learned that the \nIranian regime is a growing threat not only to its neighbors, not only \nto the region, but to the world, and potentially to our own homeland. \nWe have learned it is in the interest of the world to apply maximum \npressure to the Iranian regime. We have learned we must tighten the \nscrews on the Iranian regime to genuinely advance the cause of \nstability and peace in the Middle East and, clearly, around the world.\n  These sanctions are an essential means to that end. We need the ban \non trade with Iran to be strong, significant and, as humanly possible, \nairtight--a ban that does not have Americans subsidizing the very \nregime that seeks to harm us by purchasing gasoline and diesel that are \nmade of Iranian crude.\n  Iran's actions have made it a rogue nation that must be dealt with in \nthe strongest terms. We cannot wait for another plot such as this to be \nuncovered. We cannot take the chance that the next one will not be \nuncovered. Passing the new sanctions I have proposed with, as I said, \n76 of our colleagues here is a start, and we cannot, as a nation, \nfalter. The time to act is now.\n  I applaud the White House for its quick action this week in imposing \nnew sanctions against the people responsible for the planned attack on \nthe Saudi Ambassador and other targets in Washington. I appreciate the \nadministration's effort to implement and multilateralize sanctions on \nIran. This administration has done more to isolate Iran than any prior \nadministration, Republican or Democratic, including their quick \nresponse this week designating individuals involved in the plot as well \nas today's sanction of Iran's Mahan Air.\n  The news this week, however, has confirmed our worst fears that Iran \nwill not hesitate to advance its interests regardless of the political \ncost. Iran, given its history of exporting terrorism against coalition \nforces in Iraq, in places such as Argentina, in Lebanon--and its \ncontinued drive to advance its nuclear weapons program, despite being \nslowed by U.S. and international sanctions--clearly, with the alleged \nplot uncovered this week, remains undeterred.\n  It is time to take the next steps--to isolate Iran politically and \nfinancially. We must enact sanctions now, to exert the unyielding \npressure of the U.S. Government against the Iranian regime, and bring \nto bear the condemnation of the international community so that the \nregime fully understands the world will not tolerate such actions if \ncarried out.\n  These sanctions will prevent us from having to face that situation in \nthe future. They are in our national security interest. They are in the \ninterest of Iran's neighbors, in the interest of the region, and they \nare in the interest of the security of every nation that wishes to be \nsecure in its borders, safe from the terrorist acts of a rogue state. \nThat is what is at stake. That is why I look forward to a hearing we \nwill be having tomorrow in the Banking Committee on the effect of the \nsanctions legislation we already have. I believe that hearing will \ndeduce testimony that clearly shows that because of the sanctions \nlegislation we already passed in the Congress, signed by the President \nthat, in fact, we have made a significant dent in Iran's commercial \nactivities. But it has not ceased or desisted from its march to nuclear \nweaponry. And, obviously, by this latest plot, it has not ceased or \ndesisted from its willingness, even on U.S. soil, to carry out such an \nassassination. Therefore, the time to act is now.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Manchin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the three free-trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea that will be before \nus shortly here in the Senate. Few States need these agreements more \nthan the State of Illinois.\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\n  This week, I released a report on the State of Illinois's debt. We \nnow have the worst credit rating in America. Our State has fallen to \n47th for a healthy business climate, with only half of the State's \npension and health care promises actually funded.\n  Instead of continuing our State's debt spiral, these agreements will \nhelp the bottom line of Illinois exporting employers who hopefully will \ncreate thousands of new jobs without adding to the borrowing of our \nState or any new taxes.\n  Since 1997, Illinois exports to Colombia have increased by 164 \npercent, and exports to Panama have increased by 196 percent. \nCollectively, the three nations represented more than $1 billion worth \nof Illinois export sales in 2010.\n  We will see the benefits of these agreements across a wide spectrum \nof jobs--from high-tech companies to manufacturers to farmers.\n  Illinois-based Caterpillar, in Peoria, which in 2010 exported $13 \nbillion worth of products to other countries, will see tariffs reduced \nby hundreds of thousands of dollars on goods through these free-trade \nagreements. The Panama Canal expansion project alone represents a $300 \nmillion opportunity for Caterpillar. The trade deals are particularly \nimportant for Illinois-based Navistar, which has one of the best named \ntruck brands in Colombia and Panama.\n  Illinois agriculture also reaps a windfall from the pending free-\ntrade agreements. Trade deals are expected to create about $2.5 billion \nin new agricultural exports and over 22,000 jobs nationwide. Expanding \nexport markets for Illinois farmers and the increased demand for \nagricultural products and equipment manufactured in Illinois will allow \nemployers such as ADM in Decatur, John Deere in Moline, and, as I \nmentioned, Caterpillar in Peoria to reinvest in their companies and to \nhire more citizens of our State. Illinois farmers and ranchers are \nexpected to see about $90 million in increased direct exports as a \nresult of the Senate's approval of these trade deals.\n  These deals represent the direction the Senate should take overall on \njob creation--no tax increase, no borrowing, but opening new markets \nfor American-made products.\n  I think next the Congress should build on this bipartisan job-\ncreating vote and move to reduce regulatory burdens on small businesses \nand reform the Tax Code so U.S. businesses can better compete globally.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the past several weeks, the Senate has \nfocused closely on international trade. We have debated trade \nadjustment assistance, a bill to penalize China's currency policies, \nand our pending free-trade agreements. These have been robust debates. \nIt is an appropriate capstone that we will soon be approving our trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.\n  The reality is, these agreements should have passed long ago. \nAlthough completed over 4 years ago, they were first blocked in the \n111th Congress by a Democratic majority in the House of \nRepresentatives. They were then delayed by our own President, who \ndevised excuse after excuse for not acting to implement them.\n  This spring, after the excuses related to the agreements themselves \nwere addressed by our trading partners, the President made a new \ndemand. This time it was trade adjustment assistance spending. The \nPresident made it clear that if this domestic spending program was not \nexpanded and approved, he would abandon our allies in Colombia, Panama, \nand South Korea and cede these growing markets to our foreign \ncompetitors.\n  It took Congress months to untie this substantive and procedural \nGordian knot that President Obama and his administration created.\n  Throughout this long period of delay, U.S. workers and exporters were \ndenied the benefits of these agreements. At the same time, these allies \nbegan to doubt the commitment of the United States to our friendship, \nas well as our ability to deliver on our promises.\n  I am concerned that going forward the President will put even more \nnew conditions on his support for trade and trade agreements. I \ncertainly hope not. As a nation, we cannot afford to hold our \ninternational economic competitiveness hostage to unrelated demands for \nmore spending or to a liberal social agenda. If our economy is going to \ngrow and our workers prosper, then we need to do better.\n  Trade is good for the United States. Today, the United States is the \nworld's largest economy. Contrary to the views of many Americans, the \nUnited States exports more in goods and services than any other \ncountry. It is imperative that the United States continues to open \nforeign markets. After all, 95 percent of the world's population lives \noutside of the United States. Economists estimate that almost 83 \npercent of growth over the next 5 years will take place outside of the \nUnited States. Simply put, most of our future customers are located in \nforeign countries.\n  U.S. exporters face foreign barriers that limit our ability to sell \nU.S. goods and services in foreign markets. Often, tariffs on our \nexports tend to be much higher than our own tariffs. U.S. trade \nagreements level the playing field. They reduce or eliminate tariffs \nand other barriers to U.S. exports.\n  The math is pretty simple. Lower tariffs and fewer barriers mean more \nexports, and more exports mean more jobs. But we cannot reduce these \ntariffs or eliminate barriers without the right tools. In my mind, \nrenewing trade negotiating authority is the key to our future success. \nI was, frankly, dismayed when our colleagues across the aisle, just a \nfew weeks ago, rejected an amendment to provide their own President \nwith the authority to negotiate new trade agreements. We call that \ntrade promotion authority. We all know the authority to negotiate trade \nagreements expired years ago. Since then the United States has been \nsitting on the sidelines while other nations negotiate agreements all \naround the world.\n  There is no doubt about it, even with the approval of these three \nfree-trade agreements, the United States is already far behind. It is \nmy understanding that there are 209 free-trade agreements around the \nworld. The United States is a party to just 12 such agreements, with 17 \ncountries. We should be expanding the number of our free-trade \nagreements and the number of our free-trade partner countries.\n  Everyone knows if you are not in the game, you cannot win. Right now, \nthe United States is not in the game. While it is true the President is \nin the process of negotiating an agreement to create a Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, we all know the chances of it actually succeeding are \nalmost nonexistent without trade negotiating authority.\n  Let's keep in mind that trade negotiating authority has been the norm \nrather than the exception for much of this past century. Congress first \nauthorized reciprocal negotiating authority in 1934 to help pull the \nU.S. economy out of the Great Depression. That authority was renewed 11 \ntimes between 1934 and 1962. In 1974, the Congress first authorized the \nPresident to negotiate tariff and nontariff barriers and bring them \nback for congressional consideration on an expedited basis, without \namendments. Every President since 1974 has sought that authority from \nCongress.\n  President Ford argued that the legislation ``enables the United \nStates to play a leading role in . . . multilateral negotiations.''\n  President Carter said the legislation ``solidifies America's position \nin the international community.''\n  President Ronald Reagan extolled the virtues of TPA, noting that when \nproperly used, it ``manifestly serves our national economic \ninterests.''\n  President George H.W. Bush noted that extension of TPA was ``in the \nvital national interest of the United States and absolutely fundamental \nto our major foreign policy objectives.''\n  President Clinton argued strenuously for TPA, making the case that \n``the legislation will give us the authority to increase access to \nforeign markets . . . if we don't seize these opportunities, our \ncompetitors surely will. An `America last' strategy is unacceptable.''\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\n  President George W. Bush successfully made the case that TPA was \ncritical to opening markets around the world. Once he achieved its \nrenewal, he made opening foreign markets a key priority of his \nadministration. To give credit where it is due, if it wasn't for \nPresident Bush's leadership in seeking TPA and negotiating agreements \nwith Colombia, Panama, and South Korea, we would not have any \nagreements to consider today.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama, while touting the importance of \nexports, has been virtually silent on the need for TPA. Instead of \nleading on TPA, this President has consistently ducked the issue, \navoided the debate, and let America continue to fall further behind.\n\n  This America-last--or, as some put it, leading-from-behind--strategy \nis unacceptable. We need a strong vision of leadership in the global \neconomy. We can start by approving these three free-trade agreements. \nThe fact is, tariffs on our exports to Colombia, Panama, and South \nKorea are much too high. These agreements will eliminate these tariffs. \nBut the benefits of each agreement go far beyond tariff elimination. \nThe agreements also guarantee fair access for U.S. service providers, \nreduce unfair barriers to our agricultural exports, provide high levels \nof protection for our intellectual property rights, and ensure high \nlevels of investment protection. In short, each of these agreements \nhelps U.S. workers compete and win in these growing markets.\n  Make no mistake, if we don't take advantage of these new markets, \nother countries will, and it is the U.S. worker who will lose. We \ncannot afford to allow nations to race ahead while our workers stay \nbehind.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Baucus and me in supporting \neach one of these trade agreements. Their approval can be the first \ngood step toward reigniting a vigorous international trade agenda that \nputs America first and enables the United States to once again lead the \nworld in opening markets and expanding economic growth.\n  In that regard, I pay tribute to my colleague on the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus. He has done a great job in working on this \nissue. He has been a wonderful partner to me and a wonderful leader on \nour committee. When it comes to trade, he certainly deserves a lot of \ncredit for helping to push this through. I am grateful to be able to \nwork with a quality person like him.\n  I also would like to acknowledge a few of the many people who made \nthese agreements happen. First, I would like to thank the talented \nmembers of the Bush administration who were instrumental in negotiating \nthese agreements. Of course, first there is our colleague, Senator Rob \nPortman, U.S. Trade Representative for President George W. Bush; \nAmbassador Susan C. Schwab, U.S. Trade Representative; Warren Maruyama, \nGeneral Counsel; Ambassador John Veroneau, Deputy U.S. Trade \nRepresentative; Rob Lehman and Tim Keeler, Chiefs of Staff to the U.S. \nTrade Representative; Karan Bhatia, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative; \nJustin McCarthy, Special Assistant to President Bush for Legislative \nAffairs; and Andy Olson, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for \nLegislative Affairs. I would also like to recognize the hard work and \ncommitment of USTR's professional staff, especially Wendy Cutler, \nBennett Harman, Michelle Carrillo, Maria Pagan, and Leigh Bacon--\nwithout their efforts we would not have achieved conclusion of these \nhistoric agreements.\n  Next, I would like to thank my staff--they have been relentless in \npressuring the administration to send these long-completed FTAs to \nCongress so we can pass them in order to create American jobs and grow \nthe American economy. This is a huge success and I am happy to share it \nwith them. In particular, I would like to thank the Staff Director of \nmy Finance Committee staff, Chris Campbell; my Chief International \nTrade Counsel, Everett Eissenstat, both for serving as a chief \nnegotiator for the Colombia and Panama agreements while at USTR and for \nhis efforts in implementing the agreements here on Capitol Hill; \nInternational Trade Counsels Paul DeLaney, Greg Kalbaugh, David \nJohanson, Maureen McLaughlin, and Ryika Hooshangi; Staff Assistant \nRebecca Nasca; and Legislative Counsel Polly Craighill. I would like to \nalso thank prior Finance Committee trade staff including former Chief \nCounsel Stephen Schaefer, International Trade Counsel David Ross, and \nClaudia Poteet. The multi-year effort to pass these FTAs succeeded \nbecause of their hard work, expertise, and tenacious pursuit of the \npublic interest.\n  Senator Baucus had a good staff helping him as well. I would like to \nthank them for their hard work and long nights that went into making \nthis happen. I would like to thank Russ Sullivan, majority Staff \nDirector of the Finance Committee; Chief Trade Counsel Amber Cottle; \nInternational Trade Counsels Ayesha Khanna, Michael Smart, and Gabriel \nAdler; and professional staff member Chelsea Thomas. Their work is to \nbe commended.\n  We can all be proud of these accomplishments and I look forward to \nthe President signing these agreements into law.\n  Mr. President, I am ready to vote. I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining \ntime be yielded back, with the exception of 15 minutes, to be equally \ndivided between Senator Baucus and the Republican leader, with Senator \nBaucus controlling the first 7\\1/2\\ minutes; that upon completion of \ntheir remarks, the Senate proceed to votes on passage of H.R. 3080, \nH.R. 3079, and H.R. 3078 as provided under the previous order; that \nthere be 2 minutes, equally divided, in the usual form between the \nvotes; and that all after the first vote be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, my remarks will be brief because we are at \na point, finally, where we are passing these three trade agreements.\n  The Colombia, Panama, and South Korea Free Trade Agreements will \nincrease U.S. exports by $13 billion, boost gross domestic product by \nmore than $15 billion, and support or create tens of thousands of \nAmerican jobs.\n  These agreements will provide an economic boost at a time when our \ncountry sorely needs it. But the value of these agreements goes well \nbeyond dollars and cents. In recent years, critics of the United States \nhave argued we have surrendered our leadership role on international \ntrade. They claim our government, with its divided powers and narrow \nand changing partisan majorities, is incapable of forming a consensus \nfor expanding trade, let alone a consensus on other political matters, \nincluding reducing our national debt.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to prove our critics wrong. These \nagreements were negotiated by a Republican President, improved by a \nDemocratic President, and will be supported by strong bipartisan \nmajorities in the House and in the Senate. They demonstrate the best of \nAmerican values--open markets, transparent regulation, and respect for \nlabor rights and the environment. They set the standard by which all \ntrade agreements will be judged, and they put to rest any doubt the \nUnited States will engage its global partners to establish trade rules \nthat are both free and fair.\n  By approving these agreements, we will also bind ourselves even more \nclosely to three of our most important allies, and we will demonstrate \nto countries around the world that the United States is a good and \ndependable partner.\n  One decade ago, Colombia was on the brink of collapse. Armed conflict \nraged, drug traffickers flourished, violence against workers flared, \nand the economy stagnated. The United States pledged its support for \nPlan Colombia. With that plan, we provided more than $7 billion to \nColombia to fight drug trafficking, spur development, and protect human \nrights.\n\n[[Page S6450]]\n\n  With our assistance, Colombia has achieved amazing progress. It is \nhealing from the wounds of conflict. It has demobilized 50,000 former \ncombatants, stemmed the flow of illegal drugs and the violence \nassociated with it, and it is reducing labor violence and strengthening \nworker rights. If we approve our free-trade agreement with Colombia, we \nwill help Colombia solidify and build on these gains, and we will reap \nfor ourselves the benefits of our significant investments in this \nimportant country.\n  Panama has been a friend and ally since its early days as a nation. \nIn the early 20th century, the United States built the Panama Canal, \nwhich remains the world's greatest commercial hub. We helped the \nPanamanian people restore democracy in 1989 after 20 years of military \nrule.\n  Today, Panama is among the fastest growing countries in the Western \nHemisphere. It is both the crossroads of international trade and a \nglobal financial center. It is also a close partner in the fight \nagainst the illegal drug trade. With the Panama Free Trade Agreement, \nwe will further strengthen our relationship for decades to come.\n  South Korea is a strategic ally in a region clearly vital to U.S. \nnational interests. Despite living under the constant threat of a \ndangerous and erratic neighbor, South Korea has become the 15th largest \neconomy in the world. Last year, it served as President of the G20 \ngroup of countries.\n  This trade agreement we have concluded with South Korea is our \nlargest bilateral agreement in nearly two decades. It will ensure our \ncommercial relationship is as strong as our 60-year security \npartnership.\n  These free-trade agreements will deliver significant economic \nbenefits to the American people. Let us renew a bipartisan consensus on \ntrade, reaffirm U.S. leadership in the global economy, and cement our \nties with three important partners. Let us approve our free-trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.\n  I might add, before I yield to the Republican leader, that the order \nof the agreements is, first, on Panama, then South Korea, and then \nColombia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are on the verge of doing something \nvery important for our country tonight, and we are going to do it on a \nbipartisan basis. I wish to congratulate the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, for the role he played and for the \nconstructive efforts by Senator Portman and Senator Blunt to help us \nget to this evening. But I wish to single out for special praise our \nleader on this issue, Senator Hatch, the ranking member of our Finance \nCommittee, who has been a stalwart on behalf of free trade over the \nyears.\n  I think it is appropriate to take a moment before the vote to note \nthe importance of what we are doing. The first point to make about \nthese agreements is that they will help American businesses create new \njobs in the United States. The second point to make is there is strong \nbipartisan support for all three of these agreements. In other words, \nanyone who says that two parties can't agree on anything isn't telling \nthe whole story.\n  Consider this: On the very day Democrats and Republicans were \nplanning to come together to vote in favor of these trade agreements, \nDemocrats spent the entire morning talking about what a shame it is \nthat it never happens--that we never get together. Clearly, this vote \nis getting in the way of their political message, and that message is \nkind of absurd to watch.\n  Frankly, I think it would be a lot less confusing for anybody \nwatching at home--not to mention a lot better for job creation--if our \nfriends on the other side would agree to work with us more often on a \nbipartisan basis, as we have done on the bills before us. Our friends \non the other side may think it helps them politically for Americans to \nthink we don't cooperate, but what I am seeing is that the vote we are \nabout to take shows that is simply not true.\n  We could get a lot more done up here if the President and our friends \nwho control the Senate would move away from the left fringe and stop \ninsisting on partisan bills that are designed to fail. If they agreed \nto that, then this Democratically led Senate would be a lot more \nproductive.\n  Here is why these trade agreements are so important. First, they \nlower the barriers to selling American-made goods to consumers in other \ncountries. On a variety of agricultural and manufactured goods, those \ntariff barriers are completely and totally eliminated, and increasing \nexports is crucial to growing the economy in States such as Kentucky, \nwhere nearly one-fifth of manufacturing workers depend on exports for \ntheir jobs.\n  It isn't just manufacturing that will benefit. America's service and \ntechnological sectors--where we are global leaders--will gain greater \naccess to these foreign markets and strong assurances that the legal \nenvironment will not change to disadvantage U.S. firms. So passing \nthese trade agreements will mean more U.S. exports and more U.S. jobs.\n  The total value of exports just from my own State of Kentucky \ncurrently totals more than $19 billion. With these trade agreements, \nthat number will only grow, increasing demand for Kentucky-made goods \neven more. What is more, the vast majority of Kentucky companies that \nexport goods overseas--80 percent of them--are small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses.\n  So the question is, Do we want small businesses in Kentucky and other \nStates finding new customers for their goods in these growing economies \nor do we want to cede those customers to other countries that are only \ntoo happy to exploit the advantages they had before today?\n  These agreements are good news for American businesses looking to \nexpand the market for their goods, and they are good news for all the \nAmerican workers who benefit when those businesses are able to compete \non a level playing field with workers in other countries.\n  While we have waited to pass these agreements, America's competitors \noverseas have increased their share of the markets in Panama, in \nColombia and in South Korea and operated without the barriers American \njob creators have faced prior to tonight. Today, we are leveling the \nplaying field, and when the playing field is level, we know American \nworkers and American businesses and farmers will come out on top. They \njust needed us to clear the way.\n  Personally, I have never voted against a free-trade agreement, and I \nhope we will consider others in the near future.\n  Now that we have finally finished the business of the last \nadministration's trade efforts, President Obama needs to think about \nwhat the trade agenda of his administration is going to be moving \nforward. Will he let America fall behind our competitors or will he \nembrace a proactive free-trade agenda that he knows will help create \njobs here at home and project American influence around the world? For \nour part, Senate Republicans are ready to work with him on an even more \nrobust trade agenda, one which involves reauthorizing a stronger TPA \nand which helps him help the economy in a bipartisan way, just as we \nare doing tonight.\n  This is a very important vote. It shows that the two parties can, in \nfact, work together to help American businesses create jobs, and I hope \nit leads to a lot more of the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. H.R. 3080, H.R. 3079, H.R. 3078, having been \nreceived from the House, are each considered to have been read three \ntimes.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are now voting on the Panama TPA to provide \nlucrative new opportunities for American farmers. It will level the \nplaying field for American exporters and do a lot of stuff.\n  Let me say this. Basically, we accept virtually all Panama's products \nduty free--virtually. Panama has significant duties on products going \ninto Panama. This is a free-trade agreement. It is a freebie. I urge \nMembers to vote for it so now we can export more products to Panama. \nVote for this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I rise to speak against this agreement. This, my \nfriends, is the Panama trade agreement. There are 1,600 pages. If we \nwant to get rid of tariffs and level the playing field, we would pass \nabout three pages of tariff schedules and build in labor rights so that \nall of us would pass this by a voice vote.\n  This is 1,600 pages of rules to help insurance companies, to help \ndrug companies, to undercut America's sovereignty. It is based on the \nsame NAFTA trade model that doesn't work with investor-state relations. \nThe same promises we hear in every trade agreement--the Clinton \nadministration and the first Bush administration promised 200,000-plus \njobs for NAFTA. We lost 600,000 jobs.\n  Vote no on Panama. It is more of the same. It doesn't work for \nAmerica and small businesses, and it doesn't work for our workers.\n  I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Ohio showing \nus the big, long stack. Those are all the tariffs Panama is going to \nget rid of and reduce so we can sell more products to Panama. I \nappreciate the Senator pointing that out to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are now on the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement. I am not going to take a lot of time. I think most Senators \nknow how they are going to vote.\n  Let me say I have visited Colombia. I am extremely impressed with the \nprogress Colombia has made. Colombia was a failed state, a failed \ncountry about 10 years ago. With America's Plan Colombia and the \nassistance we have given, the narcotraffic is dramatically down, the \nlabor killings are dramatically down. Clearly, we don't want one labor \nmember killed or anyone killed in Colombia. But the fact is there is \ntremendous progress in Colombia. Colombia is so important to America's \ngeopolitical future and to South America. If we cut and run, Colombia \nis going to run away from the United States. We will not be trusted. \nThey will go to other countries, including Venezuela, China, and so \nforth.\n  I urge my colleagues who are on the fence--who are on the fence--to \nvote for this because that is a vote for the future. The glass is half \nfull.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, this is the same story. This is \nPanama's agreement, but Colombia's is even longer--hundreds and \nhundreds of pages of rules.\n  I admire the Colombian people. They are our allies, but the Colombian \nGovernment not so much. Colombia remains the most dangerous place in \nthe world to be a trade unionist. There were 23 trade unionists killed \nin 2011, and 51 were killed in 2010. What is happening to them is \nworking. Over the past 20 years, unionization rates in Colombia have \nbeen cut in half.\n  When you threaten trade unionists, when you actually murder them, of \ncourse, unionization rates are going to go down. The Labor Action Plan \ncommits the Colombian Government to get better, but what we are doing \nby a ``yes'' vote is rewarding promises, as we always do in trade \nagreements. But we are doing nothing to establish and enforce concrete \nresults.\n  If you care about human rights, if you care about workers having the \nability to freely organize and collectively bargain, you will vote no \non the Colombian trade agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to Sgt Daniel \nDavid Gurr of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Sergeant Gurr was assigned to the 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion, 3rd \nMarine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force. He was killed by small \narms fire while on patrol in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. Sergeant \nGurr was only 21 years of age, but as a testament to his character and \nreputation, hundreds attended his memorial service and hundreds more \nlined the procession route to where he was laid to rest.\n  Sergeant Gurr always wanted to be a marine. In fact, his friends and \nfamily from Vernal, UT, remember a young man who could hardly wait \nuntil his senior year at Uintah High School before enlisting in the \nMarine Corps. But even during his school years, his personality and \ncharacter exemplified what it means to be a marine. Sergeant Gurr was \nthe captain of his high school soccer team and was always there for his \nteammates. By all accounts, whether in high school or as a \nnoncommissioned officer, he was a leader and loved by many.\n  Sergeant Gurr had a profound sense of duty and deep commitment to \nfreedom and liberty. All he asked for was the opportunity to dedicate \nhis life to the service and safety of others. His dedication and \nleadership were clearly apparent to the marines who advanced him to the \nrank of sergeant, a truly impressive accomplishment for a 21-year-old.\n  As we grieve the loss of one of this country's finest, let us \ncelebrate Sergeant Gurr's life. His selfless and noble actions will \nnever be forgotten.\n  I know I am joined by the entire Senate in extending heartfelt \ncondolences to Sergeant Gurr's family. Elaine and I will certainly keep \nthem in our prayers.\n\n\n                       Corporal Raphael R. Arruda\n\n  Mr. President, today I also wish to honor CPL Raphael R. Arruda of \nOgden, UT.\n  Corporal Arruda was an Army reservist assigned to the 744th Engineer \nCompany, 416th Theater Engineer Command. As a combat engineer tasked \nwith finding improvised explosive devices, Corporal Arruda never shied \naway from driving the lead vehicle on operations. Out in front \nprotecting his fellow soldiers was where he was when an explosion took \nhis life. Adding to this tragedy, Corporal Arruda's mother had died 10 \ndays before, and the corporal was but days away from his 22nd birthday.\n  Corporal Arruda was raised in Brazil until the age of 12. His family \nimmigrated to the United States and settled in South Ogden, UT, where \nCorporal Arruda graduated from Bonneville High School in 2008. While in \nhigh school, he joined the Army Reserves and left for basic training \nonly days after graduating from high school. After basic training, he \nattended Weber State University for a semester and planned to continue \nhis education upon his return.\n  Upon learning about Corporal Arruda's life, I was struck by what his \nfamily and friends had to say about him. Andrey, his brother and also \nan Army reservist, said Corporal Arruda was the ``life of the party.'' \nHis fellow soldiers said the corporal was ``the guy who pushed everyone \nand made everyone laugh.'' It is a special leader who has the unique \nability to motivate others while simultaneously making them feel at \nease.\n  Corporal Arruda was a brave and selfless soldier. His family now \nbears a heavy burden. However, I hope they will take comfort in knowing \nthat I am joined by the entire Senate in extending our condolences over \nthe loss of Corporal Arruda and his mother. My wife Elaine and I will \nhave them in our prayers.\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING MIKE PUSKAR\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, only a few people in your lifetime stand \nout as people of the highest caliber, people who truly care about \nmaking the world a better place not only for the present generation but \nalso for the next generation and many generations to come.\n  My dear friend Mike Puskar was one of those rare people. My wife \nGayle and I consider ourselves extremely lucky to have even known a man \nof his caliber, let alone be dear friends with him for many years.\n  Mike passed away on Friday after a long battle against cancer.\n  I first met Mike in the early 1980s before the start of a football \ngame in the then-gravel parking lot at the WVU stadium, a place we both \ntruly loved. The generator in his motor home was not working, and, \nluckily, the generator in my brother's RV that I was using did work. So \nMike plugged into our RV that day, and we were plugged in thereafter.\n  Mike was a man whose friendship was unconditional. It was not about \nwhether you lined up exactly with his beliefs. He supported you as a \nperson.\n  Mike dedicated his life to helping others and to making a real \nlasting impact in West Virginia. He had a tremendous heart and a strong \nsense of giving. Mike truly epitomized the word ``friend'' at every \nlevel.\n  We can see Mike's handprint everywhere--at West Virginia University, \nat Mylan Park, and in charitable organizations throughout West Virginia \nthat serve those in need.\n  Mike loved to build things--whether it was his company or the \nwaterfront in Morgantown. He gave the largest gift in the history of \nWest Virginia University because he truly believed in making our State, \nour schools, and our hospitals the best in the country. In fact, that \ngravel parking lot where we\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\nfirst met at the WVU stadium is now the site of the Mylan Tailgate \nTent. But the thing Mike was most proud of was when he helped people \nbuild their own lives--and those people who knew Mike know exactly what \nI am talking about.\n  Mike was a pioneer who started Mylan Pharmaceuticals to give people \naccess to affordable quality medicine. Mylan is a homegrown West \nVirginia company that he started with his Army buddy Don Panoz in 1961. \nHe led Mylan until 2002, and Mylan has continued to grow and has now \nbecome the third largest generic and specialty pharmaceutical \nmanufacturer in the world.\n  There are so few people like Mike, whose legacy will echo for \ngenerations to come. On Thursday, his friends and family will gather to \npay tribute to his legacy when he is laid to rest in Morgantown, WV--a \ntown he loved and gave so much to improve.\n  Tomorrow and every day our thoughts and prayers will go out to the \nentire Puskar family, Mike's friends and colleagues, and everyone whose \nlife he touched, as all of them mourn the loss of this great man.\n  While every one of us is truly going to miss Mike, he truly will \nnever leave us. We all have beautiful memories of Mike that will last a \nlifetime, and his legacy to West Virginia and its people will remain in \nour hearts forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6453-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BURMA CHALLENGES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today, as I do on many \noccasions, to bring attention to the numerous challenges that face the \npeople of Burma. Of great concern to those advocating for democracy in \nBurma is promoting reconciliation among the diverse groups in the \ncountry. Like many ethnic groups in the country, the Kachin people of \nnorthern Burma have a distinct and longstanding heritage. Yet, they \ncontinue to be targeted by the ruling junta. Not only is their struggle \nagainst the oppressive junta of concern to those of us focused on \nreforms in Burma, but they also have an important historical connection \nto the United States, a connection that I would like to highlight \ntoday.\n  On September 13, 1945, Japanese soldiers surrendered to Allied forces \nin Burma. As many in this Chamber are no doubt aware, many Americans \nbravely fought in the China-Burma-India theater during World War II. \nThe late Senator Ted Stevens, for example, flew the treacherous \n``hump'' over the Himalayas, and many other Americans helped build the \nimportant Ledo supply road, linking China, Burma and India. In the \nAllied effort in this theater, the Kachin people deserve particular \nmention for the commitment, sacrifice and invaluable support they \nprovided Allied forces to reclaim that country.\n  The situation in this region was bleak for Allied forces in 1942. The \nBurmese terrain, a combination of dense rain forest and high altitude, \nproved a formidable obstacle in itself. Of particular importance was \nbuilding and maintaining the Allied supply lines into Kunming, China. \nThis task was assigned to GEN Joseph Stilwell and was later described \nby George Marshall as ``one of the most difficult assignments'' given \nto any theater commander. As part of this endeavor, CPT Carl Eifler \ndirected U.S. efforts against Japanese forces in Burma. Captain Eifler \nassembled an accomplished group of officers with a diverse set of \nskills, ranging from linguistics and medicine to piloting and \nexplosives. Detachment 101 officially began on April 14, 1942, a mere 3 \nweeks before the Japanese Imperial Army would take Rangoon and, with \nit, effective control of the country.\n  As part of its mission, GEN Stillwell wanted Detachment 101 to learn \nto adapt to and thrive in Burma's thick rain forests. He would use his \ntroops' familiarity with fighting in such terrain to harass the enemy \nwith unconventional tactics, weakening its grip on strategic locations \nsuch as the Myitkyina Airbase in the Kachin State. The historian for \nU.S. Army Special Operations Command, Dr. C. H. Briscoe, credits part \nof Detachment 101's operational success to support from a group of \nBurmese in the ``Kachin Rangers'' unit and, in particular, their \nefforts in intelligence collection, as well as pilot rescue and \nsabotage missions. In the spring of 1945, due to its success, \nDetachment 101 expanded its Kachin forces to more than 10,000 troops.\n  The Kachin Rangers are credited with many effective and \nunconventional warfare tactics, some of which have subsequently been \nincorporated by the Army Special Forces Green Berets. In just a few \nyears of combat, according to James R. Ward--a member of Detachment \n101--the Kachin Rangers reportedly provided the U.S. 10th Air Force \nwith 75 percent of its targets and the 164 Kachin radio teams in Burma \nprovided some 85 percent of the intelligence received by General \nStilwell's Northern Combat Area Command. In addition, these Kachin \nsoldiers are credited with destroying an estimated 15,000 tons of \nJapanese supplies and killing or capturing more than 15,000 enemy \ntroops. According to reports, the group also helped save the lives of \nas many as 425 downed Allied airmen during the war.\n  Ultimately, following the Japanese surrender of Burma, Detachment 101 \nwas awarded the Presidential Distinguished Unit Citation by the Army \nChief of Staff at the time, future President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n  Efforts by the Kachin people helped secure an Allied victory in Burma \n66 years ago. Currently, the Kachin--like other ethnic minorities in \nBurma--deserve our recognition as allies in another noble cause: to \nsecure freedom and reconciliation in a democratic Burma. We honor their \nbravery and commitment to freedom six decades ago as well as today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6453-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6453-S6454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO CARL WEAVER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments and achievements of lifetime educator Carl Weaver. For \nalmost 40 years, Carl devoted himself to teaching young Kentuckians \nhistory, civics, and psychology while also coaching little league \nbaseball in the afternoons and the South Laurel High School boys' \nbaseball team.\n  Carl began teaching as an undergraduate student while at the \nUniversity of the Cumberlands in 1963, at the age of 19. After \ngraduation, Carl spent 6 years teaching in Ohio before returning to \nLaurel County, KY, where he earned his master's degree from Union \nCollege while simultaneously teaching full-time and raising his three \nchildren, Wayne, Karen (Davenport), and Whitney.\n  Carl witnessed many changes during his 33-year career teaching in \nLaurel County, but he cherishes most the time he spent teaching his own \nkids--Carl had each of his three children in at least one class in high \nschool and also had the opportunity to teach Karen psychology her \nfreshman year at Sue Bennett College. Carl never had a problem with any \nof his children in the classroom, recalling, ``I was probably harder on \nthem than on other students.''\n  For Carl, it was always about the kids. Carl has an amazing passion \nfor teaching and he truly enjoyed and appreciated the students. \n``That's what it's really all about. You're teaching the student, not \nthe subject,'' Carl says. Carl still misses teaching, but he was forced \nto retire at the 27-year mark due to ongoing complications with his \nlegs as a result of his diagnosis with polio as a child.\n  These obstacles don't hinder Carl's spirit however, as he continues \nto stay busy by helping out in his son's produce stand on East Ky. 80. \nCarl admits he's enjoyed a good life. As he looks back now on his \nteaching career however, he says he doesn't regret a thing.\n  Mr. President, Carl Weaver is a humble, selfless Kentuckian who \ndedicated his life to educating the youth of Kentucky. I thank him for \nhis passion and the wisdom he has shared with the people of our great \nCommonwealth. The Laurel County Sentinel Echo published an article in \nthe spring of 2011 to honor Carl's career and accomplishments. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, Spring 2011]\n\nBusier since retirement: Carl Weaver works concessions, mans a produce \n stand and spends time with grandchildren. And like teaching, he loves \n                          every minute of it.\n\n                           (By Nita Johnson)\n\n       He walks with two canes due to rheumatoid arthritis, \n     another storyline to the\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\n     limp he's had all his life since suffering from polio at age \n     3.\n       But the canes and the limp don't deter long-time educator \n     Carl Weaver. In fact, since his retirement from the Laurel \n     County school system in 2002, Weaver has been busier than \n     ever.\n       In fact, Weaver depicts the word ``busy.'' With nearly 40 \n     years of teaching experience under his belt, Weaver has \n     always been active in the school, in his personal life, and \n     in his community.\n       Even while raising his three children, his life has \n     revolved around academics and athletics. During school hours, \n     the classroom setting found him instructing students about \n     history, civics, and psychology. During summer breaks, he \n     taught psychology at Sue Bennett College.\n       After-school hours found Weaver on the baseball field where \n     he coached the South Laurel High School baseball team for six \n     years. When not on the baseball field, Weaver was the \n     academic team coach for Laurel County High School, and when \n     the county school split into two high schools, he remained on \n     at South Laurel High School as academic team coach, garnering \n     over 20 years in that position. During this time he was an \n     unyielding advocate for the establishment of elementary \n     school academic teams--a goal he not only saw accomplished \n     but saw its success and contributions to the educational \n     programs of the school system where he taught for 33 years.\n       As if that weren't enough, Weaver also coached baseball for \n     the local Little League teams, coached basketball for the \n     Laurel-London Optimist Club, and served as a 4-H leader. His \n     ties to the baseball field didn't end when he retired in \n     2002.\n       ``I help with the concession stands at South Laurel now,'' \n     Weaver said. ``My son, Whitney, is assistant baseball coach \n     there.''\n       Weaver's teaching career began in 1963 after graduation \n     from Cumberland College (now University of the Cumberlands). \n     He attended Sue Bennett College for two years prior to \n     transferring to Cumberland College to pursue his bachelor's \n     degree. After college graduation, he moved to Zanesville, \n     Ohio, and taught seventh- and eighth-grade students for six \n     years before returning to Laurel County.\n       ``I was an undergraduate student and I was only 19 when I \n     started teaching,'' he said.\n       He earned his master's degree from Union College while \n     still teaching full-time and raising his own children.\n       Weaver saw many changes over the span of his career, but \n     his focus always remained on the students who came through \n     his classes. Three of those students were his own children--\n     Wayne, Karen (Davenport), and Whitney.\n       ``I had all three in at least one class during high \n     school,'' he said, ``and I had Karen in her first year at Sue \n     Bennett for psychology class. I never had any problems out of \n     my children in class. I was probably harder on them than on \n     other students.''\n       Many of his former students approach him even now, some of \n     which he said he had in class as many as 30 years ago.\n       ``I always enjoyed teaching. I enjoyed the students,'' \n     Weaver said. ``You meet so many different students and see \n     the uniqueness of each one, their personality. That's really \n     what it's all about is the kids. You're teaching the student, \n     not the subject matter.''\n       He related that he still misses being in the classroom but \n     ongoing problems with his legs prompted him to retire after \n     reaching the 27-year mark.\n       ``I taught for 33 years but the six years in Ohio didn't \n     count toward my retirement time,'' he explained.\n       But retirement didn't provide time off from being busy. In \n     fact, between his own activities and those with his \n     grandchildren, Weaver says he has more to do now than in the \n     past.\n       Currently Weaver and his wife of 48 years, Pearl, are \n     helping out in their son's produce stand, located on East Ky. \n     80 beside Arnold's Place, while they continue to raise \n     strawberries and raspberries on their farm in the Laurel \n     River community. That farm produces the fruits and vegetables \n     that the Weavers display in their produce market--homemade \n     strawberry preserves made by their son Wayne and wife \n     Michelle. Jars of bread-and-butter pickles also adorn the \n     counter of the market, another example of the Weaver's \n     farming products.\n       ``Good to see you,'' Carl Weaver greets the customers \n     coming in to the produce market during the day, and their \n     parting is accentuated with, ``Thanks for stopping by. Come \n     back and see us.''\n       A friendly and informal manner from a man who holds his \n     honorary doctorate in humanities, but the nature of his \n     greeting is reason for the doctorate degree presented by his \n     brother Neal, then president of Louisiana Baptist University \n     in Shreveport.\n       ``He gave me an honorary doctorate in humanities because of \n     my long years of work with young people, in the classroom and \n     in the community,'' Weaver said.\n       ``It's been a good life,'' he added. ``When I started \n     college I planned to pursue a law degree. But somewhere along \n     the lines I decided I wanted to be a teacher. I guess some \n     people look back and see visions of better things but I \n     enjoyed teaching and I never regretted it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6454-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NOMINATION OF WINSLOW LORENZO SARGEANT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

His confirmation will \ncomplete the SBA's exceptional leadership team.\n  As Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Dr. Winslow Sargeant brings a unique \nbackground to this very important position. With a Ph.D. from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison in electrical engineering and a \nbackground as a very successful small business owner, he is not only \nwell-educated but well-educated about the challenges facing small \nbusinesses today.\n  He is the former managing director of Venture Investors, a Midwest \nventure capital company with a concentration on starting up healthcare \nand technology companies.

Mr. President, tomorrow, the U.S. Navy celebrates its \n236th birthday.\n  On Friday, October 13, 1775, the Continental Congress, representing \nthe citizens of 13 American colonies, passed a resolution to acquire \nthe first two warships for the Continental Navy. It stated ``that a \nswift sailing vessel, to carry ten carriage guns, and a proportional \nnumber of swivels, with eighty men, be fitted with all possible \ndispatch, for a cruise of three months, and that the commander be \ninstructed to cruise eastward, for intercepting such transports as may \nbe laden with war-like stores and other supplies for our enemies, and \nfor such other purposes as the Congress shall direct.''\n  The Founders recognized the essential nature of a Navy to the \nstrength and longevity of the Nation by authorizing Congress ``to \nprovide and maintain a Navy'' in article I of the Constitution. A Naval \nCommittee was established to build a fitting Navy for our fledgling \ncountry, acquire and fit out vessels for sea, and draw up regulations. \nThe Continental Navy began a proud tradition, carried out for 236 years \nby our U.S. Navy, to protect our Nation and pursue the causes of \nfreedom we hold so dear.\n  For the past 236 years, the central mission of the Navy has been to \nprotect the interests of our Nation around the world on the high seas, \nto fight and win the wars of our Nation, and to maintain control of the \nsea lines of communication enabling this Nation and other free nations \nto grow and prosper. Whether in peace or at war, U.S. citizens around \nthe world can rest assured that the U.S. Navy is on watch, ever \nvigilant, and ready to respond.\n  U.S. sailors, as both ambassadors and warriors, have won \nextraordinary distinction and respect for the Nation and its Navy. The \ncore values of ``Honor, Courage, and Commitment'' are the guides by \nwhich the U.S. sailors live and serve. Today, the U.S. Navy is the most \ncapable, most respected, and most effective sea service in the world.\n  Seventy-five percent of land in the world is bound by water and 75 \npercent of the population of the world lives within 100 miles of the \nsea, assuring that our naval forces will continue to be called upon to \nrespond to emerging crises, to maintain freedom of the sea, to deter \nwould-be aggressors, and to provide our allies with a visible \nreassurance of support of the United States of America.\n  As we celebrate our Navy's 236th birthday, America's sons and \ndaughters continue to stand the watch on the frontlines of the war on \nterror at sea and on foreign shores. While we look at\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\nthe current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as predominantly ground \nengagements, our Navy is there too. Twelve hundred Navy personnel are \non the ground in Iraq (200 of these are Reservists), with a total of \n21,800 deployed to the region aboard ships at sea, on bases, and air \nstations in the region supporting Iraq operations. Forty-six hundred \nsailors and officers are on the ground in Afghanistan and a total of \n7,700 are deployed aboard ships at sea, on bases, and air stations in \nthe region supporting Afghanistan operations (Operation Enduring \nFreedom). One thousand four hundred and thirteen Navy personnel have \nbeen killed in action in these conflicts, 576 in Operation Enduring \nFreedom, 820 in Operation Iraqi Freedom and 17 in Operation New Dawn as \nthe Pentagon now refers to the Iraq war.\n  This year marks not only the 236th Navy birthday, but also the 100th \nanniversary of naval aviation. On May 8, 1911, Cpt Washington Irving \nChambers, USN, Officer-in-Charge of Aviation, prepared the requisition \nfor the Navy's first aircraft to be purchased from aviator and inventor \nGlenn H. Curtiss. The Navy is commemorating that historic event \nthroughout the year at its ``Navy Weeks,'' one of which was held in \nIndianapolis in August.\n  The 20 Navy Weeks conducted annually across the Nation exemplify the \nrespect and proud heritage that the U.S. Navy commands. Navy Week gives \nthe Navy a chance to show off its heritage and hardware and allows \nAmericans to learn more about their Navy and its heroes.\n  No matter the cause, location or magnitude of future conflicts, the \nNation can rely on its Navy to produce well-trained, well-led, and \nhighly motivated sailors to carry out the missions entrusted to them.\n  As a Navy veteran myself, I speak with no small measure of pride in \ncalling attention to the significance of the 236th birthday of the U.S. \nNavy and expressing the appreciation of the people of the United States \nto the Navy and its men and women who have dedicated 236 years of \nservice. The honor, courage, commitment, and sacrifice that generations \nof Americans have made throughout the history of the Navy and the \nsacrifices shared by the extended Navy family of civilians, family \nmembers, and loved ones who have served for the past 236 years are \nextensive and greatly appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6455-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. BRIAN SCHMIDT\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I speak today in honor of Brian \nSchmidt, one of three individuals who were awarded the Nobel Prize for \nphysics this week. Dr. Schmidt, of the Australian National University, \nalong with Dr. Adam Reiss, of Johns Hopkins University, and Dr. Saul \nPerlmutter, of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, completed \ngroundbreaking work on the expansion of the universe. The scientific \nachievement of these three men deserves to be recognized. I am pleased \nto acknowledge that the scientific career of Dr. Schmidt was encouraged \nthrough his tenure in high school in Alaska.\n  Dr. Schmidt, originally from Montana, moved to Alaska in 1981, where \nhe attended Bartlett High School in Anchorage, AK, graduating in 1985. \nAt Bartlett, many teachers took note of his academic achievements and \nstrong work ethic, and encouraged him to excel in his studies. Dr. \nSchmidt has remarked on the great experience he had attending school in \nAlaska, crediting his high school teachers for helping him cultivate an \ninterest in science that has brought him to where he is today.\n  After leaving Alaska, Dr. Schmidt attended the University of Arizona, \nreceiving a bachelors of science in both physics and astronomy, before \ncontinuing on to receive his doctorate in astronomy at Harvard \nUniversity. He has since relocated to Australia with his wife Jennie \nand is a researcher at the Research School of Astronomy and \nAstrophysics at the Australian National University.\n  Dr. Schmidt, Dr. Reiss, and Dr. Perlmutter are receiving the Nobel \nPrize for a discovery that has greatly changed the field of \nastrophysics and made great furloughs into the understanding of dark \nmatter, the term for the force that is driving the universe apart. \nConventional understanding was that rate of expansion of the universe \nhas slowed. However, these three scientists turned this theory on its \nhead by proving that, in fact, the rate of expansion is actually \naccelerating. This change in understanding affects predictions \nregarding the conditions of future galaxies, and the discovery has been \nlauded by some as one of the greatest discoveries in science.\n  Those who knew Dr. Schmidt in Alaska were not surprised to learn of \nhis accomplishment. His teachers at Bartlett knew his intellect and \npassion for science would take him far. I, along with many others in my \nState, am proud to recognize this Alaskan who has made valuable \ncontributions to our understanding of the universe.\n  I offer warm congratulations to Dr. Schmidt, Dr. Reiss, and Dr. \nPerlmutter on their Nobel Prize and scientific achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6455-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING THOMAS P. FOY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last Saturday, Thomas P. Foy died at his \nhome in Bayard, NM, a few weeks shy of his 97th birthday. A native of \nGrant County, he lived most of his outstanding life there, except for \nthe years he spent as a prisoner of war in Japan including the Bataan \nDeath March. It was a life largely devoted to public service and \ncompletely devoted to the public good.\n  The word ``survivor'' is used rather freely these days, but he and \nhis comrades, many of them fellow New Mexicans who managed to live \nthrough the horrors of years of internment, deserve the title if anyone \ndoes. But Tommy didn't just survive, he triumphed and prospered in a \nlife well-lived.\n  He had graduated from Notre Dame, and received a law degree from \nthere a year before he joined the New Mexico National Guard in 1940. \nAssigned to the Philippines, the 200th Coast Artillery Battery \nsurrendered after holding out for 5 months against the Japanese and \nbegan their gruesome forced march to prison. In 1945, the war was ended \nand he was rescued.\n  His postwar life was full of accomplishment and service. Practicing \nlaw, marrying, running for--and winning--public office, founding a bank \nand raising five children with his wife Joan, and doing it all with a \nstout, cheerful heart brought him admiration and affection from all \nquarters. He served in the New Mexico State Legislature for 28 years.\n  For many of us from Grant County, this is the loss of a beloved \nfamily member. My parents, now deceased, and my wife Anne and I \ncertainly share that view. A stalwart figure, he was true to his faith, \nhis family, our country and Notre Dame, and deeply loved and respected \nin return. He is already greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6455-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6455-S6456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING MAJOR THOMAS E. CLARK\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Air Force Major \nThomas E. Clark, from Emporium, PA, whose aircraft was shot down during \na combat mission over Laos in 1969.\n  Thomas graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1963. He served \nwith the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 37th Tactical Flight Wing.\n  He was the beloved son of Otto and Josephine Schager Clark. He was \nmarried to his high school sweetheart, Kathleen Mottern of Emporium.\n  On February, 8, 1969, Major Clark was flying an F-100D aircraft from \nPhu Cat Air Base, Republic of Vietnam, in a flight of four on a combat \nmission over Laos. The flight engaged a 23mm anti-aircraft artillery \nbattery and his aircraft was hit, burst into flames and crashed. No \nparachute was observed. Visual and electronic searches detected no sign \nof life. Subsequent to the incident the U.S. Air Force determined Major \nClark to be Killed in Action, Body Not Recovered.\n  In his career, Major Clark was awarded the Distinguished Flying \nCross, Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Air Medal with Two Oakleaf \nClusters, National Defense Service Medal and the Vietnam Service Medal \nwith One Bronze Service Star.\n  On October 14-20, 2009, a joint U.S/Laotian team investigated the \ncrash site for the fourth time and recovered a human tooth which was \nlater identified as the remains of Major Clark.\n  During a ceremony at Emporium, PA, on October 22, 2011, his remains\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\nwill be interred in a plot beside his parents.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Major Clark's family and friends as \nwe honor the life and service of this Pennsylvanian hero.\n  All Americans are deeply indebted to Major Clark for his service and \nsacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6456-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING JOE GARLAND\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, over the course of the past half \ncentury, Joe Garland served as the unofficial historian of Gloucester, \nMA--its fishermen, its boats and its life. But Joe Garland not only \nwrote history in his books and newspaper column--he was part of \nhistory, guiding his beloved hometown through headwinds and troubled \nwaters. Joe Garland passed away August 30, and his family and friends \ngathered October 1 for a memorial service. I would like to share with \nthe Senate the thoughts and memories of Joe that I shared with those \nwho were part of that service honoring this great champion of all \nthings Gloucester.\n  If you visit the Fisherman's Memorial on Gloucester's waterfront on a \nstormy winter day, the statue of the Heroic Mariner seems to be \nsteering the whole town into the wind toward fair weather. And if you \nlook closely at the statue, you can almost see Joe Garland in its \ncarved granite face, full of grit and determination, guiding his \nbeloved Gloucester through headwinds and troubled waters.\n  ``Beating to windward'' is the art of sailing into the wind. \n``Beating to Windward'' is also the name of the column Joe wrote so \nmany years for the Gloucester Times. And it is no surprise to any of us \nwho knew him that Joe used the column to champion all things \nGloucester. Joe didn't just chronicle Gloucester's history--he was a \npart of it. In his column and in his books, he brought to life the era \nof the great schooners--like the 122-foot Adventure, the flagship of \nGloucester, and the larger-than-life Gloucestermen--like the ``Bear of \nthe Sea,'' Giant Jim Patillo, and the ``Lone Voyager,'' Howard \nBlackburn.\n  But he also used the sharpness of his pen to make his case on all \nkinds of civil causes--opposing unbridled economic development, warning \nabout the loss of local control of the hospital and water supply, \ncomplaining about comprises on the environment or demanding the \npreservation of Gloucester's beauty. And trust me--Joe never hesitated \nto offer his advice to a certain U.S. Senator, if he felt like I needed \nit.\n  Joe wrote with passion, conviction and humor, never with ill will or \nwith the intent to wound. He was a gentleman. And always, whether in \nhis column or in his books, he promoted the interests of Gloucester's \nfishing fleet. In my office in Washington, I have a copy of the book he \nwrote in 2006, ``The Fish and the Falcon,'' about Gloucester's role in \nthe American Revolution. His inscription to me expresses his \nappreciation ``for your efforts to relieve the fiscal crisis that has \nlong haunted our beleaguered fishing industry.'' He urged me to keep up \nthe fight, and I have.\n  Joe wrote 21 books, and I always enjoyed his sharing the latest with \nme. In my Boston office, I have a copy of his book about the Adventure, \nwhich he helped to restore. It arrived with an invitation from Joe to \ntour the schooner and, of course, I didn't waste any time accepting his \ninvitation. He welcomed me aboard, and his tour made the Adventure's \nhistory come alive--from its construction in 1926 through its career as \na ``highliner,'' the biggest moneymaker of them all, landing nearly $4 \nmillion worth of cod and halibut during her career.\n  But the book that spoke to me the most was his last, ``Unknown \nSoldiers,'' his memoir of World War II and his journey from a student \nat Harvard to a ``dogface'' with a close-knit infantry in Sicily, \nItaly, France and finally Germany. It is a clear, eloquent and \nunflinching panorama of the mundane and the horrific in war. It is, by \nturns, humorous, poignant and gut-wrenching, with the common soldier \nperspective long associated with journalist Ernie Pyle or cartoonist \nBill Mauldin, a point of view with which soldiers from my war, from any \nwar--a band of brothers stretching through generations of Americans--\ncan identify.\n  I was deeply saddened to learn of Joe's passing. But I am glad that \nhis passing was gentle, his last moments of his life near the window of \nhis beloved house by the sea, surrounded by loved ones and squeezing \nthe hand of the woman he loved--Helen, his wife, his World War II pen \npal. And how fitting that in those final moments, the schooner Landon \nfired a farewell cannon salute to Joe as it headed out to sea. Joe \nloved the tradition of cannon salutes, so much so that he fired one at \nthe wedding of his stepdaughter, Alison, only to have it backfire, \nburning a hole in his jacket and covering his face with gunpowder, just \nin time for the official wedding photos. But that was Joe, and a face \nsmudged with gunpowder underscored what we all know--truly, his was a \nlife well lived.\n  There is an anonymous quote I once read which may well describe how \nwe should think of Joe's passing. It says:\n  I am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white \nsails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean. She is an \nobject of beauty and strength, and I stand and watch her until, at \nlength, she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and \nsky come down to mingle with each other. Then someone at my side says, \n``There! She's gone.''\n  Gone where? Gone from my sight--that is all. She is just as large in \nmast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side, and just as \nable to bear her load of living freight to the place of destination. \nHer diminished size is in me, not in her, and just at the moment when \nsomeone at my side says, ``There, she's gone,''--there are other eyes \nwatching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout, \n``There she comes!'' And that is dying.\n  Because Joe loved the sea so much--and because he enjoyed watching \nseagulls soar--I close with a special poem. It is titled ``Sea Joy'' \nand it was written in 1939 by a little girl named Jaqueline Bouvier. \nAmerica eventually came to know her as Jackie Kennedy. But when she was \n10 years old, she wrote:\n\n     ``When I go down by the sandy shore\n     I can think of nothing I want more\n     Than to live by the booming blue sea\n     As the seagulls flutter round about me\n     I can run about--when the tide is out\n     With the wind and the sand and the sea all about\n     And the seagulls are swirling and diving for fish\n     Oh--to live by the sea is my only wish.''\n\n  To Helen and Joe's family, I extend my deepest sympathy, but with a \nreminder that Joe's work, like the sea he loved, is eternal and \nbooming, and that Joe's life, like the seagulls he enjoyed so much, \nswirled and soared.\n  And to Joe, from one sailor to another, I wish him ``fair winds and \nfollowing seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6456-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6456-S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING MOTHER'S MOUNTAIN\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, across the country one of the most \ntreasured and comforting thoughts of home is our own family's homemade \ncooking. Regardless of whether this delicious homemade cooking is a \nmain dish, a condiment, or a dessert, we will always remember the \nwonderful way it tastes. In my home State of Maine, one small business \nhas taken the fond memories of home cooking and developed a successful \nsmall business. Today, I commend Mother's Mountain, located in the \ncoastal town of Falmouth, which this month will celebrate its 30th \nanniversary.\n  Growing up during the Great Depression, Carol Tanner remembered her \nmother making homemade mustard for her father, and in later years she \ntoo acquired a fondness for this delectable condiment. In 1981, Carol \nTanner and her then business partner now husband, Dennis Proctor, took \nCarol's childhood memories and turned that single mustard recipe into a \nbusiness which now offers over 30 appetizing specialty products. Today, \nthey make dozens of award winning jams, jellies, sauces, marinades and \nhoneys. They also emphasize healthier alternatives by producing \nnatural, gluten free, salt free, and fat free products.\n  As a family-run small business, Mother's Mountain employs three \ngenerations, who are instrumental in maintaining the quality and \ncustomer\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\nservice, which is the key ingredient in their success. In order to \nensure that their customers receive personal attention and the highest \nquality product, Dennis and Carol personally hand-pack and label each \nand every jar.\n  Mother's Mountain creations have received extraordinary reviews from \nMaine Magazine and Eat Around Maine. In addition to selling its \nhomemade goods, Mother's Mountain also provides appetizing recipe ideas \nto its customers using their products. Mother's Mountain also produces \ndelectable items for other Maine-based companies, such as L.L. Bean.\n  Small businesses like Mother's Mountain are the lifeblood of our \neconomy, and indicative of the great entrepreneurial spirit that is \nalive and well in Maine. I congratulate Carol and Dennis, for operating \nsuch a successful business from the ground up out of their home, and \ncommend them for passing down this strong work ethic through three \ngenerations. I am proud to celebrate Mother's Mountain's 30th year \nanniversary, and offer my best wishes for their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6457-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KIRK KLANCKE\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I recognize Kirk \nKlancke, an angler and true Coloradan known for his commitment to \npreserving our environment and making Colorado a better place to live, \nwork and play.\n  Kirk was recently selected as a finalist for Field and Stream \nMagazine's prestigious Heroes of Conservation Award. He was chosen \nbased on his leadership and commitment to an effort he has led to \npreserve the Fraser River. This achievement goes to show how important \nhis water conservation work in the West has been, and I want to take \nthis opportunity to acknowledge his significant contributions to the \nState of Colorado.\n  Both Kirk and I have spent time enjoying the natural beauty of our \nState while appreciating the value of preserving it for future \ngenerations. Kirk's longstanding dedication to these values has not \nonly ensured that we can fully enjoy what Colorado has to offer, but \nthat our kids will too. His work embodies what I have long held to be \ntrue--we don't inherit the Earth from our parents; we borrow it from \nour children and the generations that will follow.\n  Currently serving as president of the Colorado River Headwaters \nChapter of Trout Unlimited, Kirk leads a team improving watersheds, \nrestoring trout populations and keeping our rivers and streams healthy. \nMore specifically, Kirk has been instrumental in efforts to conserve \nwaters of the Fraser River and ensure their use for generations to \ncome. As one example of this work, he has spearheaded the removal of \nhighway traction sand from the water, which impedes flows and the \nability of trout to spawn.\n  Colorado has reaped many benefits from his efforts as a capable \nconservationist that understands this delicate work and how to overcome \nthe challenge of building consensus around water-use solutions. Among \nothers, he sits on the Grand County Water Information Network Board and \nthe Colorado River Basin Roundtable. Formerly serving on the Fraser \nSanitation District Board of Directors, and now as manager of the \nWinter Park Ranch Water and Sanitation District, Kirk's contribution to \none of Colorado's most precious resources--our water--continues to be \nvital to the health of the Fraser Valley community and our State's \nwater supplies.\n  I commend Kirk for his recognition as a Field and Stream Hero of \nConservation, and I wish him well in his continued efforts to keep \nColorado's natural resources healthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6457-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6457-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6457-4", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:47 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that it had passed \nthe following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1025.

A bill to amend the Indian Tribal Energy Development and \nSelf-Determination Act of 2005, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Indian \nTribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments of \n2011. For far too long, bureaucratic red tape has prevented Indian \ntribes from pursuing economic development opportunities on tribal trust \nlands, including energy development. For years, Indian tribes have \nexpressed concerns about how Federal laws and regulations governing the \nmanagement of trust resources, including energy resources, create \nsignificant delays and uncertainty in development proposals.\n  This bill represents an effort to deal with some of those concerns, \nand for the Record I would like to highlight some of its provisions. \nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 included an Indian Energy title--Title \nV--that, in significant part, attempts to deal with these delays and \nuncertainties that are inherent in the Bureau of Indian Affairs' energy \nleasing process, by providing Indian tribes with an alternative way to \ndevelop their energy resources. However, more than 6 years after the \nenactment of that act, it appears that no tribe has yet availed itself \nof the new energy development process authorized in the 2005 Act.\n  This bill includes a number of amendments to the alternative process \nestablished back in 2005, all of which are intended to facilitate the \nuse of that section--to make the process easier for Indian tribes to \nfollow and more predictable--be clearing away some of the red tape and \nother impediments.\n  Another amendment to this process would provide the Indian tribes \nwith some funding to implement the processes authorized under the 2005 \nEnergy Policy Act, in a way that should not increase the cost of the \nprogram. What this amendment would do is require the Secretary to \nprovide funding to the tribe for its energy development activities in \nan amount equal any savings that the United States might realize as a \nresult of the Indian tribe pursing this process, since the Indian tribe \nwould be performing many functions itself rather than the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs. The bill requires the Secretary to identify the savings \nto the United States and make that amount available to the Indian tribe \nin a separate funding agreement.\n  The ultimate goal of these amendments is to facilitate economic \ndevelopment, provide Indian people with an opportunity to make a good \nliving, and give the tribes greater control over the management and \ndevelopment of their own trust resources.\n  There are other energy-related issues addressed in this bill as well. \nThere is an amendment to section 201 of the Federal Power Act that \nwould put Indian tribes on a similar footing with States and \nmunicipalities for preferences when preliminary permits or original \nlicenses, where no preliminary permit has been issued, for \nhydroelectric projects. However, this provision does not affect any \npreliminary permit or original license issued before the bill's \nenactment date or any application for an original license where no \npreliminary permit has been issued that was complete before the date of \nenactment of the bill.\n  The bill would also authorize a ``biomass demonstration project'' for \nbiomass energy production from Indian forest lands, rangelands and \nother Federal lands in accordance with program requirements developed \nby the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture after consultation with \nIndian tribes. This amendment would promote the development of tribal \nbiomass projects by providing them with more reliable and potentially \nlong-term supplies of woody biomass materials.\n  There are many other provisions of the Indian Tribal Energy \nDevelopment and Self-Determination Act of 2011, but the foregoing items \nare among the more important. Before I conclude, I would like to thank \nSenator Akaka, the Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, for his \nleadership on this issue and for agreeing to cosponsor this bill with \nme as well as the other Senators who have agreed to join as cosponsors.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to help us expand economic \nopportunity on tribal trust lands by moving this act expeditiously.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Indian \nTribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act Amendments of \n2011. I am proud to co-sponsor this bill introduced by my friend, \ncolleague, and Vice Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, \nSenator John Barrasso. I applaud his leadership and am proud to call \nhim my full partner in our work on behalf of the Native peoples of the \nUnited States. Introduction of the Indian Tribal Energy Development and \nSelf-Determination Act Amendments of 2011 is an important first step. I \nlook forward to hearings on this measure and working with all of my \ncolleagues to increase the ability of Native communities to develop \nenergy resources on their lands and enhance self-determination.\n  Indian lands hold great potential for traditional and renewable \ndomestic energy production. Responsible development could help decrease \nour Nation's dependence on foreign energy sources and create much \nneeded jobs in some of the most impoverished areas of the Nation. \nToday, Indian reservations make up approximately 5 percent of the \nUnited States land base, and it is estimated that those reservations \ncontain about 10 percent of the country's energy resources. A number of \nIndian tribes are already working in the areas of traditional and \nrenewable energy production, energy transmission, and energy planning. \nYet, successfully tapping into the vast energy reserves in our Nation's \nIndian communities remains a difficult and complex task.\n  It remains challenging for Indian tribes to develop adequate \ninformation about their energy resources, to obtain interconnection to \nthe electric transmission grid, and to partner with private entities to \nengage in energy projects. Congress recognized the potential of tribes \nto develop energy sources on their lands by enacting tribal provisions \nin the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, many of the programs and \npolicies authorized by Title V of the act intended to benefit tribes \nhave not been implemented or have only been partially implemented.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs has held a listening session, and we \nhave solicited comments from stakeholders across the spectrum on the \nissue. Tribes have made it clear they wish to chart their own economic \ndestinies, but that in order to do so modifications are needed to the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005. The legislation introduced today will \naddress tribal concerns as well as private sector concerns and will \nhelp unlock the huge potential of Indian tribal energy development to \ncreate jobs, promote tribal self-determination, and decrease our \ndependence on foreign energy sources.\n  This bill will set clear deadlines for Secretarial approval and \nstreamline administrative processes related to tribal energy \ndevelopment which will help tribes and the United States ``win the \nfuture'' by enabling development of renewable energy sources from \ntribal lands.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to stand with me and Senator \nBarrasso in support of this legislative initiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI:\n  S. 1688.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Save Our Postal \nWorker Jobs Act.\n  Even with advances in technology, America relies on the Postal \nService\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\nfor everything from notes to family back home, birthday cards, \nmedicine, tax returns and absentee voting. The Postal Service binds our \nnation together through communication. But the Postal Service is facing \na financial crisis and it needs Congress to help.\n  The Save Our Postal Worker Jobs Act is simple. It doesn't restructure \nthe Postal Service, lay off workers, or close Post Offices. It simply \ngives the Postal Service the authority it needs to take its own money--\nnot taxpayer money--that it overpaid into its employee pension funds to \nuse to help pay its obligations.\n  This bill is a jobs bill. Many of the plans that have been introduced \nto keep the U.S. Postal Service financially solvent include provisions \nto lay off thousands of workers, cut promised benefits, and undermine \ncollective bargaining rights. The Postal Service has talked about \nreducing its workforce by more than 200,000.\n  Our postal service employees are on the front lines every day, \nworking hard for America. I want them to know that I am on their side, \nand I will not let them be scapegoated for financial problems at the \nPostal Service. Through the dedication and diligence of our postal \nworkers, the mail is delivered across the country through rain or sleet \nor snow. It is their work that conveys messages to family, brings \nmedicine to our veterans and seniors, and helps our constituents who \nare away from home on election day have their voices heard.\n  This bill is about preserving the local Post Office--an important \npart of a neighborhood's identity and a piece of the fabric of our \ncommunities. This bill is about preserving Postal Service delivery--\nwhich is so important for rural areas like Western Maryland and the \nEastern Shore. Each region has unique geography that can complicate or \ndelay mail delivery. And reductions to the Postal Service could \nseriously harm those residents.\n  This bill alone will not solve all of the Postal Service's problems. \nThe process of reforming the Postal Service and bringing it into the \n21st Century may mean that some workers will be let go, some Post \nOffices may close, and some changes may be made to delivery.\n  Ultimately, this bill is about allowing those decisions to be \nthoughtfully considered, with time for the Americans who rely on the \nPostal Service to be heard. It's about avoiding making rash decisions \nwith a crisis hanging over our heads.\n  It is about saving our postal workers' jobs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lee, and Mr. \n        Barrasso):\n  S. 1690. A bill to preserve the multiple use land management policy \nin the State of Arizona, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues, Senator Kyl, Senator Hatch, Senator Lee and Senator \nBarrasso in introducing legislation to prevent the Secretary of the \nInterior from executing his plan to ban mining on 1 million acres of \nFederal land in northern Arizona. A companion bill has been introduced \nby Congressman Trent Franks in the House. The purpose behind this \nlegislation is best outlined in a recent letter that I along with \nseveral members of the Senate and House transmitted to the Secretary of \nthe Interior today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 12, 2011.\n     Hon. Ken Salazar,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Salazar: We are writing to urge you to \n     reconsider moving forward with a proposed 20-year withdrawal \n     of approximately 1 million acres of federal mineral estate in \n     northern Arizona. We predict such a decision, if finalized, \n     would kill hundreds of potential jobs in our states and erode \n     the trust needed for diverse stakeholders to reach agreement \n     on how to protect and manage public lands in the future.\n       Grand Canyon National Park is an Arizona icon and a natural \n     wonder that attracts visitors from around the world. The \n     Colorado River that flows through the park is the lifeblood \n     of the West, providing drinking water for millions in seven \n     states. We share your desire to protect Grand Canyon National \n     Park and the region's water supplies from adverse \n     environmental effects that may be associated with hardrock \n     mineral exploration and development. We disagree that the \n     proposed withdrawal is necessary to achieve that objective. \n     In our view, the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) \n     on the proposed withdrawal actually demonstrates that uranium \n     mineral development would pose little, if any, threat to the \n     park or water quality in the region. Thus, we are concerned \n     that this proposed withdrawal is more about social agendas \n     and political pressure than about the best available science.\n       The aspiration on the part of the environmental community \n     to ban all mining activity in the Grand Canyon region is not \n     new. It existed during the last uranium rebound of the late \n     1970s and early 1980s. The difference is that, back then, the \n     environmental community put their aspirations aside to \n     constructively work with the mining and livestock industries \n     and Congress to reach an historic agreement on wilderness \n     designations and multiple use land policy--an agreement that \n     ultimately became Title III of the Arizona Wilderness Act of \n     1984 (P.L. 98-406). The Act designated over 1.1 million acres \n     of wilderness on the Arizona Strip while, at the same time, \n     releasing another 540,000 acres of federal land for multiple-\n     use development; how that development would be conducted was \n     left to the land management planning process. The Act is \n     rightfully held up as the gold standard of stakeholder \n     collaboration and bipartisan compromise. Until now, it has \n     allowed sustainable uranium mining to co-exist with the \n     protection of some of our most treasured natural resources. \n     If the decision is made to move forward with the proposed \n     withdrawal, you will be casting aside that historic \n     compromise and ignoring the land management plans developed \n     through the land management planning process that identify \n     the bulk of the proposed withdrawal area as open to uranium \n     mineral development.\n\n     The Legislative History of the Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984\n\n       It is important that you review and fully consider the \n     legislative history of the Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984 \n     before making a final decision regarding the proposed \n     withdrawal. At that time, former House Interior Committee \n     chairman, the late Rep. Morris Udall, led the Arizona \n     congressional delegation (including then-Rep. John McCain) in \n     crafting the legislation. The legislative history strongly \n     substantiates that there was a compromise regarding \n     wilderness protection and continued uranium exploration and \n     development on the Arizona Strip. That compromise was \n     originally embodied in a free-standing bill, the Arizona \n     Strip Wilderness Act of 1983 (H.R. 3562). The Arizona Strip \n     Wilderness Act of 1983 was incorporated into the Arizona \n     Wilderness Act of 1984 at Title III. A review of the House \n     committee report (H.Rpt. 98-643, Part 1, pages 34-35) \n     accompanying the bill demonstrates the clear recognition by \n     Congress that the lands not designated as wilderness had \n     significant uranium mineral potential, and that the land-\n     management planning process would govern that future \n     development. It states:\n       There is also a great desire on the part of the Bureau of \n     Land Management and all the interest groups concerned to lay \n     the wilderness issue to rest. This is particularly true for \n     those companies engaged in uranium exploration and mining, as \n     the current wilderness status of large acreages in the \n     Arizona Strip constitutes an impediment to rational and \n     coordinated exploration and development. Likewise, \n     environmental groups feel that uranium activities should be \n     excluded from certain key areas and that immediate wilderness \n     designation for such areas is far preferable to relying on \n     interim wilderness study protection. To this end, a broad \n     coalition of groups and individuals sat down during the early \n     months of 1983 and worked out an agreement that has since \n     received the support from the Administration, the State of \n     Arizona, the local congressman, both senators and virtually \n     every other interest party of which the Committee is aware. \n     Indeed, the Committee's hearings revealed nearly unanimous \n     support for the Arizona Strip proposal. Accordingly, Title \n     III of H.R. 4707 designates the following Arizona Strip lands \n     as wilderness, and releases certain other lands for such non-\n     wilderness uses as are determined appropriate though the land \n     management planning process.\n       [T]he Committee has not included these lands in wilderness \n     in recognition of their significant mineral (especially \n     uranium) potential. In leaving these lands open for mineral \n     exploration and potential development, the Committee \n     emphasizes that this is an environmentally sensitive area \n     that should be managed by the Bureau of Land Management to \n     minimize adverse impacts on the current remote and wild \n     values. The Committee understands that the type of mining \n     that will take place here is of a low impact, underground \n     type.\n       The hearing record on the Arizona Strip Bill is also \n     instructive. It demonstrates that the stakeholders truly \n     believed a ``win win'' had been struck and were willing to \n     testify in support of the compromise. The following excerpts \n     are taken from the testimony offered on October 21, 1983 on \n     the Arizona Strip Wilderness Act of 1983 before the House \n     Subcommittee on Public Lands and National Parks:\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\n     Testimony of Michael D. Scott, Regional Southwest Director, \n         The Wilderness Society.\n       It [H.R. 3562] is supported by, among others, the mining \n     industry, local government, the livestock industry, and \n     conservationists. This unusual combination of support is not \n     an accident. It represents many months of work at forging a \n     compromise acceptable to the entire range of interests on the \n     Arizona Strip.'' (Page 296)\n       At the same time that the Strip emerged as a top \n     conservationist priority, energy companies, most notably \n     Energy Fuels Nuclear (EFN), began to discover significant \n     uranium deposits. As you know, Mr. Chairman, in most cases \n     there are no significant minerals in wilderness or wilderness \n     candidate lands. As unfortunately happens on occasion, some \n     of these significant uranium deposits overlapped with \n     outstanding wildlands in the Strip. Fortunately, EFN, is not \n     a typical hard-rock mining company. Conservationists and EFN \n     decided to discuss those differences. (Page 297)\n     Statement of Representative Bob Stump.\n       For many months, several divergent groups, who would \n     usually be viewed as adversaries, have worked together to \n     form a consensus on wilderness designation and multiple use \n     for the Arizona Strip. The legislation which you have before \n     you today is the result of those efforts and is proof \n     positive that give and take on the part of all participants \n     can result in a compromise which will address all concerns. \n     (Page 271)\n       The key and important factor in this agreement is that it \n     expresses the needs and desires of the ranching, mining, \n     local government, public land managers and environmental \n     communities  . . . an example of business interests and \n     environmental concerns working together. (Page 272)\n       Almost 800,000 acres were included in the Bureau of Land \n     Management Wilderness Study Areas in the Arizona Strip. H.R. \n     3562 designates approximately 165,996 of those acres as well \n     as 122,604 acres in the Paiute Primitive Area, Paria \n     Primitive Area and Vermillion Cliffs Natural Area, as \n     wilderness. The remaining 620,000 acres or 79% of the BLM \n     Wilderness Study Areas will be released to multiple use. \n     (Page 272)\n     Testimony of Gerald Grandey, Vice President, Energy Fuels \n         Corporation.\n       Of what we know today, the Arizona Strip appears to be the \n     only area in the United States that has the potential to \n     produce relatively high grade uranium ore, which even at \n     today's depressed market is capable of competing with foreign \n     sources of the material, such as South Africa, Canada, and \n     Australia. (Page 106)\n       The benefits to be had from the passage of the Arizona \n     Strip Wilderness Act of 1983 are clear. The wilderness in \n     question will be decided once and for all ending many years \n     of potential controversy and debate. In the areas released to \n     multiple use, our Company and others with active programs in \n     the Arizona Strip will be able to conduct exploration in a \n     cost effective and responsible manner. (Page 284)\n     Testimony of Russ Butcher, Southwest Regional Representative, \n         National Parks Conservation Association.\n       It was exactly one year ago that we first met and began \n     talking formally with the top officials of Energy Fuels \n     Nuclear, talking about the company's uranium exploration and \n     mining activities north of the Grand Canyon, and about the \n     relationship of these activities to an array of Federal \n     wilderness study areas. (Page 120)\n       The proposed withdrawal is a ``de facto wilderness'' \n     designation; it will unravel decades of responsible resource \n     development on the Arizona Strip in a misguided effort to \n     ``save'' the Grand Canyon from the same form of uranium \n     mining that environmental groups once agreed to. Moving \n     forward with the proposed withdrawal will call into question \n     the Department's interpretation of wilderness-release \n     language in other legislation and its commitment to multiple-\n     use policy in the years ahead. If the decision is made to \n     finalize the proposed withdrawal, all future wilderness \n     proposals will assuredly face even greater scrutiny as it \n     will be clear that negotiated agreements, such as those \n     contained in the Arizona Wilderness Act, are neither genuine \n     nor enduring.\n       Again, we agree that the Grand Canyon deserves to be \n     protected for the enjoyment of future generations. However, \n     moving forward with the proposed withdrawal flies in the face \n     of the legislative history regarding mineral development and \n     responsible land management planning. We strongly urge you to \n     reconsider the proposed withdrawal.\n           Sincerely,\n         Signed by: Senator John McCain, Senator Orrin Hatch, \n           Senator Jon Kyl, Senator Mike Lee, Senator John \n           Barrasso, Congressman Trent Franks, Congressman Rob \n           Bishop, Congressman Jeff Flake, Congressman David \n           Schweikert, Congressman Paul Gosar, Congressman Ben \n           Quayle, Congressman Jason Chaffetz.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Crapo, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Risch, Mr. Reid, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Tester, \n        Mr. Blunt, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Heller, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Merkley, \n        Mr. Sanders, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Begich, Mrs. \n        McCaskill, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Franken, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1692. A bill to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community \nSelf-Determination Act of 2000, to provide full funding for the \nPayments in Lieu of Taxes program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I introduced, along with Senator \nMurkowski and 22 other Senators S. 1692, the County Payments \nReauthorization Act of 2011. The bill would provide dependable funding \nto support public schools, transportation infrastructure, and other \ncritical county programs in more than 1,900 counties in 49 States. \nSpecifically, it would continue to fund for 5 more years the Payments \nIn Lieu of Taxes Program, and it would reauthorize the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act. The Secure Rural Schools \nAct expired at the end of September.\n  Economists have long said that funding for local governments not only \nprovides one of the most efficient and immediate ways to create and \nsave jobs, it also helps to ensure that essential community services on \nwhich economic growth depends are maintained. These programs have \nproven that point in recent years. They have been lifelines for \nfinancially strapped rural counties and the thousands of Americans they \nemploy and they contract with. They employ a multitude of public school \nteachers, support countless miles of county road projects, fund \nthousands of collaborative forest and watershed restoration projects, \nand pay for hundreds of community wildfire risk reduction programs in \nall parts of the country.\n  I would like to give one example from my home State of New Mexico. \nMany of my colleagues may know that the Wallow fire this summer grew to \nbecome the largest fire in the history of Arizona. My colleagues may \nnot know that its leading edge burned more than 15,000 acres into New \nMexico, and it threatened the community of Luna in Catron County, New \nMexico.\n  When I visited the town of Luna, the community's firefighters told me \nthe wildfire risk reduction projects they had completed using funds \nfrom the Secure Rural Schools Program helped to save their town. The \nfunds from this bill also will fund many projects to help their local \nforests and watersheds and many others around New Mexico to recover \nfrom the severe fires that burned there this summer.\n  Despite the important work these programs support, we recognize that \nfunding these programs is not easy, given the financial circumstance in \nwhich we find ourselves. We worked for months to build this strong \ncoalition in the Senate and among the stakeholders in support of these \nprograms across the country. In the process there have been an array of \ndiffering views about the details of how these programs should be \nstructured going forward.\n  For example, recognizing the difficult financial situation in \ncommunities around the country and the urgent need to create jobs, some \nwould significantly increase funding for these programs. Others, \nrecognizing the challenging fiscal situation that the Federal \nGovernment faces, would sharply reduce funding for these programs. Some \nwould shift the emphasis of the Secure Rural Schools Program to \nforestry projects such as those covered by titles II and III of that \nprogram. Others would shift the emphasis to public schools and to road \nprojects.\n  But most importantly, there has been broad agreement on the most \ncritical issues. First, there is broad agreement that funding for these \ntwo programs is immensely important. Second, there is broad agreement \nthat the only way for us to successfully continue that funding is for \nus to renew the compromise we negotiated in 2008. Congress \noverwhelmingly passed that compromise, it has provided funding for \nthese programs for the last 4 years, and our communities have broadly \nsupported it.\n  The alternative, which seems to have become routine in Congress, is \nto emphasize our differences and destroy the coalition of support that \nwill be essential to continue funding of these programs.\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\n  I greatly appreciate the support and leadership of Senator Murkowski \nand many others. Let me mention all those who have helped with this \nbill and who are cosponsoring this effort: Senator Baucus, Senator \nCrapo, Senator Wyden, Senator Risch, Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator \nCochran, Senator Tester, Senator Blunt, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nHeller, Senator Tom Udall, Senator Boxer, Senator Cantwell, Senator \nMurray, Senator Bennet, Senator Merkley, Senator Sanders, Senator Tim \nJohnson, Senator Begich, Senator McCaskill, Senator Mark Udall, Senator \nFranken, and Senator Levin--all of whom are cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  I hope the rest of the Senate will join us once again to support the \ncontinuation of these important programs and enact this legislation.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Senator Bingaman \nfor leading the effort to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and \nCommunity Self-Determination Act.\n  Over 100 years ago this Congress passed a law which formed a compact \nwith counties, boroughs and parishes in rural America where the \nNational Forests are located. That compact stipulated that the Forest \nService would share 25 percent of its revenues with local governments \nto support roads and schools.\n  This agreement was put into law 60 years before the Payment in Lieu \nof Tax law was written to help compensate counties for the loss of \nrevenue caused by the inability to tax federal property.\n  Over the years, the Forest Service shared billions of dollars with \nthe counties and, until 1990, the amount of those payments increased \nalmost every year. In fact, the Forest Service sold $1.6 billion worth \nof timber in fiscal year 1990. As a result, counties received more than \n$402 million in 25 percent payments to support schools and roads.\n  More importantly, the Forest Service timber sale program in 1990 \ngenerated more than 102,000 direct and indirect jobs in areas that now \nhave the highest unemployment rates in the country. Those timber sales \ngenerated more than $5.3 billion--that is billion with a ``B'' of \neconomic activity and $800 million in Federal income taxes. Further, \nrevenue from the Forest Service's timber sale program supported many of \nthe other Forest Service's multiple-use programs, including recreation, \nwilderness, road building and maintenance, and fire suppression.\n  All that changed in 1990 and 1991, when activists used the Endangered \nSpecies Act to reduce, and in some instances stop, timber harvesting \nacross the West. If I could wave a magic wand and legislate reforms to \nthe many environmental laws that have been twisted and misconstrued in \norder to block any development of our natural resources, rather than \nensuring responsible decision making by our Federal land management \nagencies, as Congress intended, I would.\n  In the long run, I think that is what is needed, and I am convinced \nthat given the economic malaise this country suffers, the American \npublic is beginning to understand the wrongheaded direction our Federal \nland management has taken over the last two and a half decades.\n  But I don't think I can accomplish that in this Congress, and I am \ncompelled to avoid adding any additional pain and suffering to the \nshoulders of the small rural communities that depend on Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act payments. Therefore I am \njoining Senators Bingaman and Wyden and others in cosponsoring \nlegislation to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\nDetermination Act for another 5-year period.\n  Senator Bingaman has fully described the bill, but it reauthorizes \nthe Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act at fiscal \nyear 2011 payment levels for 5 more years. We have reduced the annual \nreduction in payments from the 10 percent level in current law down to \na 5-percent annual reduction. Under this plan, counties, parishes, \ncommunities and schools will receive up to $364 million in temporary \nassistance each year for the next 5 years.\n  I say ``temporary'' because this program was, and is, designed to be \na short-term bridge to allow counties and communities to transition to \nthe new economic reality that our wrongheaded Federal lands policy has \nforced upon them.\n  I want everyone to also understand that while having signed on to \nthis bill I am also considering a number of other alternative solutions \nthat have the promise of generating enough revenue and jobs from \nFederal land activities to make our counties whole. I am willing to go \nas far as turning control of some Federal lands over to counties so \nthat they may get some economic benefit from them. But first I will be \ntaking a careful look at Representative Hastings's bill to generate \nadditional resource management by lifting restrictions and expediting \nthe processes needed to offer additional timber sales.\n  I want everyone to know that if a legitimate, acceptable, offset to \npay for the cost of this program is not identified by the time the bill \nis ready to move to the Senate floor, I will have no alternative but to \nremove my name from the bill and will have to work to defeat the bill.\n  I would tell my fellow Senators that the folks in the House Resources \nCommittee are fundamentally correct. We are going to have to either \nutilize our Federal lands to support our rural communities or we should \ndivest the Federal Government of those lands and let the States, or the \ncounties, manage those lands. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the House to find a path forward for this approach in \nthis and future Congresses.\n  I will close by speaking directly to the counties, parishes, boroughs \nand communities that have now depended on the Secure Rural School \nprogram for more than a decade--and for some counties in Oregon, \nWashington and Northwest California for more than two decades--the \nSecure Rural Schools Payments are coming to an end. It could be this \nyear if enough people do not rally around the bill that Senator \nBingaman, I, and our other cosponsors have proposed. It could be 2 \nyears from now if Representative Hastings and other Representatives \nprevail. Or it could be 5 years from now if we find the acceptable \noffsets needed to pay for our legislative proposal. My fervent hope is \nthat the program will be replaced by a forest management system that \nactually puts people back to work in the forest, but it's coming to an \nend, and the counties and schools need to prepare for that eventuality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Cardin):\n  S. 1696. A bill to improve the Public Safety Officers' Benefits \nProgram; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to improve the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act, PSOB. \nThis law, enacted in 1976, is a vital safety net for our first \nresponders who are permanently disabled in the line of duty, and for \nthe families of those who make the ultimate sacrifice while serving \ntheir fellow citizens.\n  This legislation, along with several technical refinements to the \nprogram, will add certain classes of first responders who, due to gaps \nin the law, have been left without protection. For example, the bill \ncontains legislation I introduced in the 111th Congress in response to \nthe tragic death of Dale Long, a decorated emergency medical responder \nin Vermont. The Dale Long Emergency Medical Service Providers \nProtection Act would protect Mr. Long's survivors and those who may \nfollow and encounter the same limitations under the current law.\n  Under current PSOB law, in order to be eligible for benefits, a \nmember of an ambulance crew must work for an organization that is \ndeemed a unit of State or local government, and thus be deemed a public \nemployee. In Dale Long's case, as with rescue crews across the country, \nhe worked for a private, non-profit entity that nonetheless served his \ncommunity in a way indistinguishable from an organization with status \nas a unit of government. Based upon this distinction, Dale Long's \nsurviving family was ineligible for these benefits. This is unfair, and \nundermines the Federal policy that is in place to support and protect \nthese men and women. The bill I introduce today would end this \ndisparate treatment.\n  The legislation also includes a provision to ensure that a cadet \nofficer killed during a dangerous training exercise would be eligible \nfor such benefits. The current law's weakness in this\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\narea was highlighted in a case in Maryland, during which fire cadet \nRacheal Wilson was killed during a training exercise. Senator Mikulski \nand Senator Cardin have been very concerned about this situation, and I \ncommend them for advocating for its inclusion in this legislation.\n  In the 111th Congress, the Judiciary Committee considered and \nreported the Dale Long Emergency Medical Service Providers Protection \nAct by voice vote. Despite the Committee's work, and the process and \ndebate it was afforded within the Committee, the bill was objected to \nwhen I tried to get Senate consideration. This was very disappointing, \ngiven the importance of this legislation to first responders around the \ncountry, and given the fact that the legislation was fully offset.\n  This year, I once again introduced the Dale Long Emergency Medical \nService Providers Protection Act. During the Senate's debate in \nFebruary on the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety \nImprovement Act, I worked closely with Senator Inhofe to propose an \namendment that included both the Dale Long Emergency Medical Service \nProviders Protection Act and a proposal from Senator Inhofe to support \nthose who volunteer their time and expertise as airplane pilots to help \nthose in need. Our bipartisan amendment was adopted by voice vote.\n  During the course of the subsequent conference negotiations on the \nFAA authorization legislation, I worked closely with Chairman \nRockefeller and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith to \nensure that our bipartisan amendment was retained in the conference \nagreement. During the course of these negotiations, Chairman Smith \nproposed to expand the Dale Long Emergency Medical Service Providers \nProtection Act to include other changes to the current PSOB law.\n  For example, Chairman Smith proposed a refinement of the Hometown \nHeroes law, a law that I authored and which was enacted in 2003. I \nworked with firefighters, police officers, and first responders to make \nsure that what Chairman Smith had proposed would not only retain the \nspirit and intent of the original Hometown Heroes law, but, most \nimportantly, would improve upon it to alleviate some of the \nadministrative delays that the families of first responders had \nencountered in the past. This refined proposal is included in the bill.\n  The bill I introduce today also includes provisions to lessen the \nlength of a currently unwieldy appeals process for claimants, clarify \nthe list of eligible survivor beneficiaries, and make those who have \nbeen catastrophically injured eligible for peer support and counseling \nprograms. It also removes artificial distinctions under the Hometown \nHeroes Act to expand the types of injuries that would make a public \nsafety officer's survivors eligible for benefits.\n  The final version of the legislation to which Chairman Smith and I \nagreed represents a bipartisan compromise on the overall improvement of \nthis important program. I appreciate Chairman Smith's willingness to \nwork with me in support of this program, and the first responders for \nwhom the law is intended to protect. I understand that our agreement \nwas to be incorporated in the FAA conference report.\n  Unfortunately, the future for a conference agreement on the FAA \nlegislation is unclear. Each day that passes is another day that Mr. \nLong's family, and others who would benefit from this legislation, must \nlive without the assistance this benefit provides. The Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefits Act has been in effect for over 30 years, and has \nbrought a measure of security to survivors of fallen first responders. \nIn 1990, Congress continued this tradition and acted again to ensure \nthat those first responders who have been permanently disabled in the \nline of duty are taken care of. This longstanding policy is reflective \nof Congress' recognition of the importance and necessity of the men and \nwomen who commit themselves as firefighters, police officers, and \nmedical responders.\n  It is difficult to imagine what communities across America would be \nlike without these essential services. From the firefighters in Vermont \nwho race to the scene of a rural fire during a cold winter night, to \nthe ambulance crews providing emergency medical services following a \nnatural disaster in Oklahoma, our dedicated first responders are all \nconnected by their sense of duty and their selflessness in the service \nof their neighbors. In Congress, lawmakers have traditionally acted in \nsupport of these men and women irrespective of party and we should \ncontinue that great tradition. I hope the Senate will act quickly to \npass this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 292\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry of good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent, as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of a democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those that have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts \n     Week'', during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 16, 2011, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6469-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Res. 292\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry of good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent, as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of a democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those that have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts \n     Week'', during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 16, 2011, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/12/senate-section/article/S6471-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 2011\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.
