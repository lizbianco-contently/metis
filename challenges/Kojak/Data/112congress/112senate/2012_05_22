I move to proceed to Calendar No. 400, S. 3187.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 400, S. 3187, a bill to \n     amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to revise and \n     extend the user-fee programs for prescription drugs and \n     medical devices, to establish user-fee programs for generic \n     drugs and biosimilars, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are now on the motion to proceed to the \nFDA user fees bill. The majority will control the first half hour \ntoday, Republicans the final half hour. We will recess from 12:30 to \n2:15 today, to allow for our weekly caucus meetings. At 2:15 the motion \nto proceed to the FDA legislation will be adopted and the Harkin-Enzi \nsubstitute will be agreed to.\n  Madam President, there are 12 million people in the United States who \nface a cancer diagnosis today. Many have fought back against this \nterrible disease and won. Others are still fighting. Each one of them \nknows how difficult a cancer diagnosis can be. But imagine coming to \nterms with your diagnosis only to find out the lifesaving drug you need \nto survive is in short supply or is simply not available. I wish this \nwere make-believe but it is not; it is real America. That is the \nsituation faced by many Americans battling cancer and other life-\nthreatening illnesses.\n  Through 20 weeks of chemotherapy, my wife Landra and I lived with the \nfear that the medicine she needed every Monday morning wouldn't be \nthere because there were shortages. But fortunately for us the drug was \nalways accessible. Many Americans have not been so fortunate. One \nNevadan fighting bladder cancer was near the end of treatment when the \nmedicine he was taking suddenly ran short. Only time will tell whether \nthe alternative treatment he received was enough to save his life.\n  Another Nevada woman with bowel cancer was forced to choose a less \neffective chemotherapy treatment because the best drug on the market, \none that cures bowel cancer in 75 percent of the cases, was not \navailable. Only time will tell whether that second-choice medicine was \neffective.\n  Yet another Nevada man was relying on two cancer drugs to keep him \nalive longer and give him a greater quality of life, but one drug was \nin short supply. Since the drugs only work when taken together, doctors \nhave only been able to treat him intermittently. That is not good. So \nonly time will tell how many days or weeks or months or years he lost \nbecause he couldn't get the drug he needed.\n  Every day these stories play out in hospitals across our country. \nEvery day, Americans experience shortages of lifesaving FDA-approved \ndrugs and treatments. These shortages literally put Americans at risk. \nAs the number of shortages increases each year, more patients are \nforced to wait for treatment, and worry. In the last 6 years, drug \nshortages have quadrupled. Last year the FDA reported shortages of 231 \ndrugs, including many chemotherapy medicines. That is 231 drugs. How \nmany tens of thousands of people did that affect? Public pressure has \nprompted some drugmakers to voluntarily notify the FDA of impending\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\nshortages. But Congress must step in to improve communication among \ndrugmakers, the FDA, and doctors--doctors who have to break the \nterrible news that lifesaving medicines are not available.\n  Voluntary cooperation between the drugmakers and the FDA prevented \nalmost 200 drug shortages last year, but establishing effective lines \nof communication could further reduce the number of shortages and save \npatients' lives.\n  I am pleased that the spirit of bipartisanship begun by my colleagues \nSenator Harkin and Senator Enzi continued yesterday. I look forward to \nan orderly amendment process and I am optimistic the Senate will move \nthis legislation without unnecessary delays. I hope I am not \ndisappointed.\n  Each year more than 1.5 million Americans are diagnosed with some \nform of cancer. It is up to us to ensure that not one of them waits or \nwonders if the medicine he or she needs to stay alive will be there \nwhen the need arises.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                          Economic Challenges\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I want to call attention to a couple \nof stories from the last 2 days. I think they say a lot about the \ndifficulties of addressing the economic challenges we face.\n  The first is a story from Politico. It says the Budget Committee \nchairman can't remember the last time he talked to the President. The \nBudget Committee chairman can't remember the last time he talked to the \nPresident. Another chairman, dealing with student loans, says he has \nnot talked to the President in months--in months. The Democratic point \nman on energy doesn't seem to talk to the President much at all.\n  If you want to know why we can't solve these economic problems, this \nis it. We have a President who is more interested in running around to \ncollege campuses, spreading some poll-tested message, than he is in \nactually accomplishing anything. That is the problem.\n  The second story, also interesting, is about HHS signing a $20 \nmillion contract to promote ObamaCare; $20 million of taxpayer money to \npromote a bill most Americans want to see repealed. That is $20 million \nof our tax money spent on commercials to promote ObamaCare. Let me \nsuggest the President spend a little more time trying to do something \nabout spending, debt, and gas prices, and a little less time trying to \nspin the unpopular things he has already done. It might require a \nlittle more work but it is what we need. It is time to lead.\n  I ask unanimous consent those two articles to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, May 22, 2012]\n\n                      Dems Wait by Phone for Obama\n\n                             (By Manu Raju)\n\n       He doesn't call. He doesn't write. He doesn't drop by for a \n     visit.\n       That's what some of the most senior Democrats in Congress \n     are experiencing from President Barack Obama these days.\n       Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad (D N.D.) is \n     trying to cut a deal on the nation's fiscal crisis, but he \n     can't recall the last time he talked to the president. Sen. \n     Tom Harkin (D Iowa) is in charge of one of Obama's top \n     priorities--preventing a rate increase on student loans--but \n     he hasn't talked to the president in months. And Sen. Jeff \n     Bingaman (D N.M.) is the go-to guy on high gas prices, but \n     the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \n     hasn't spoken to the president much since the previous \n     Congress.\n       ``I think the reality is the current Congress is not \n     constituted in a way that makes it likely that we can do very \n     much,'' Bingaman said, ``and that's reflected in what we wind \n     up doing on the floor and understandably the president is not \n     as engaged--at least with me.''\n       Obama is certainly in regular touch with the top Democratic \n     leaders on the Hill--Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid--but when it \n     comes to some key policymakers and chairmen in Democratic \n     congressional politics, he's far less engaged than earlier in \n     his presidency. The lack of communication not only reflects a \n     gridlocked Congress in an election year, but it speaks to the \n     president's personal style--he's never been much of a \n     schmoozing, back-slapping type in the spirit of Bill Clinton \n     or Lyndon B. Johnson. And even though he came from the \n     Senate, Obama wasn't there long enough to develop deep, \n     bonding friendships with some of the old bulls in Congress.\n       Obama's disengagement is also a sharp reflection of \n     political reality: Congress is punting on virtually every \n     major issue until after the election. So even some of those \n     GOP deal makers whom Obama may need to court--whether that's \n     Sens. Olympia Snowe of Maine or Lindsey Graham of South \n     Carolina--aren't getting as much presidential attention as \n     they have in the past.\n       ``I don't think governing is a high priority right now,'' \n     said Graham, who said he hasn't spoken to the president ``in \n     forever'' after speaking with him frequently in the first \n     couple years of his administration on issues like immigration \n     and energy policy.\n       White House officials scoff at those criticisms, saying \n     they work ``tirelessly'' on the economy.\n       Jamie Smith, a White House spokeswoman, said the president \n     and his administration ``have regular and repeated \n     interactions with members of Congress from both parties in \n     the House and Senate, and we welcome Republican willingness \n     to pass the congressional `to-do' list,'' referring to the \n     president's economic agenda.\n       But both policy meetings and social gatherings with \n     committee chairmen, ranking members, back bench freshmen and \n     GOP swing voters--all hallmarks of the early part of Obama's \n     term--have been few and far between with the president these \n     days, lawmakers say.\n       ``There was a while for various reasons where groups of us \n     were coming to the White House for meetings for one kind or \n     another, but . . . he's busy,'' said Sen. Joe Lieberman (I \n     Conn.), chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs Committee, saying the two last spoke in February when \n     the president offered support for his cybersecurity bill.\n       ``I'm afraid that may be related to the feeling that not \n     much is actually going to get done here.''\n       Cutting out committee chairmen is also another sign of the \n     ongoing decline in influence of the gavel-holders on Capitol \n     Hill, who in a previous era ran their panels like fiefdoms, \n     but now have taken a back seat to congressional leaders who \n     spearhead the legislative deal making. And it's also sign of \n     the non-stop campaign that dominates politics and has made it \n     harder to legislate.\n       Obama has often been criticized for being aloof from \n     Capitol Hill, but White House officials argue that there's \n     been regular outreach to lawmakers throughout his entire \n     term, including by senior aides, legislative liaisons, \n     Cabinet secretaries and Vice President Joe Biden. Just last \n     week, congressional leaders from both parties met with Obama, \n     the first such meeting in months, and there's been an uptick \n     in coordination between the White House and Senate Democratic \n     leaders over legislative strategy and political messaging.\n       Moreover, Democrats argue that when Obama has taken a more \n     hands-on role in the legislative process, Republicans have \n     been quick to criticize his involvement and less willing to \n     embrace his ideas. In this Congress, Obama inserted himself \n     in the messy deals to avert a government shutdown last spring \n     and a debt default last summer. But those were reached \n     between a handful of leaders and the president--meaning most \n     lawmakers have been cut out of the process.\n       When Obama has gotten involved at times this year, he's \n     done so quietly. He made a series of calls to Democratic \n     senators in March to kill a measure calling for the \n     construction of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline. \n     And when Harkin threatened in February to filibuster an \n     extension of the Social Security payroll tax break, the \n     president made assurances to the Iowa Democrat that persuaded \n     him to back down, Harkin told Politico.\n       ``If you put two and two together, you can see what \n     happened,'' Harkin said last week. ``As you know, we're not \n     taking any money out of the [health care] prevention fund.''\n       With Congress's approval ratings at all-time lows, there's \n     far more incentive for the president to divorce himself from \n     the sausage-making on Capitol Hill--particularly with little \n     chance of replicating the legislative successes from his \n     first two years, like on health care and financial services, \n     which came at a heavy political price.\n       Rep. Barney Frank (D Mass.), whose name is affixed to the \n     Dodd-Frank financial services law, spoke with Obama at least \n     twice a month when negotiations over that bill were taking \n     shape in 2010.\n       ``The last time I talked to him was a couple months ago,'' \n     he says of his interactions with the president now.\n       It's not as though Congress doesn't have major issues to \n     resolve. Unless Congress acts, come Jan. 1, $1.2 trillion in \n     automatic spending cuts will take effect, with half coming \n     from defense and national security programs; the Bush-era tax \n     rates for all income groups will expire; and the payroll tax \n     break affecting 160 million Americans will end. And it's only \n     a matter of time before Congress has to deal with a host of \n     expired business tax breaks, as well as whether to renew \n     jobless benefits and how to craft a budget deal to again \n     raise the national debt ceiling.\n       Some say the president--along with congressional leaders--\n     needs to begin laying the groundwork now to avoid a \n     catastrophic logjam that could ensue after the November \n     elections.\n       ``We could get some more done if he was meeting with a \n     broad group of people to address key issues certainly, \n     including the leadership, on a continuous basis,'' said \n     Snowe, who was a periodic Oval Office guest in the first \n     year-and-a-half of the administration but said she hasn't met \n     with the\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\n     president since spring 2010 over energy policy.\n       Arizona Sen. John McCain, Obama's old rival, said he was \n     last in for a White House visit soon after the January 2011 \n     Tucson shootings, at which the two discussed acting on \n     immigration reform and the line-item veto.\n       ``He said they'd be getting back to me very shortly, and I \n     haven't heard from him since,'' McCain said last week.\n       But Democrats are quick to argue that Republicans--\n     particularly in the House--have shown little willingness to \n     work with the president. And several senior Democrats who \n     haven't spoken with Obama in a while don't hold it against \n     him, with the president facing a full slate of competing \n     interests and a challenging reelection.\n       Conrad said he still speaks with Biden, senior White House \n     budget officials and chief of staff Jack Lew.\n       ``We can communicate without the two of us speaking \n     directly,'' Conrad said of the president.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From The Hill, May 21, 2012]\n\n          HHS Signs $20M PR Contract To Promote Healthcare Law\n\n                             (By Sam Baker)\n\n       The Health and Human Services Department has signed a $20 \n     million contract with a public-relations firm to highlight \n     part of the Affordable Care Act.\n       The new, multimedia ad campaign is designed to educate the \n     public about how to stay healthy and prevent illnesses, an \n     HHS official said.\n       The campaign was mandated by the Affordable Care Act and \n     must describe the importance of prevention while also \n     explaining preventive benefits provided by the healthcare \n     law. The law makes many preventive services available without \n     a co-pay or deductible, and provides new preventive benefits \n     to Medicare patients.\n       The PR firm Porter Novelli won the contract after a \n     competitive bidding process. The $20 million contract was \n     first reported by PR Week. Porter Novelli did not immediately \n     respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n                           Jaczko Resignation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, yesterday, we learned about the \nresignation of the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Dr. \nGregory Jaczko. As I said yesterday, I am not surprised by Jaczko's \nresignation. Even Democrats on the Commission testified before Congress \nthat his inappropriate conduct as chairman resulted in a hostile work \nenvironment for women and threatened to undermine the mission of the \nNRC itself. But what should surprise us all, is how this administration \ncould remain silent for more than a year after the allegations of \nJaczko's offensive behavior first surfaced.\n  Jaczko's alleged behavior is unacceptable in any workplace. The fact \nthat it was allowed to persist at a critical agency that oversees the \nsafety of our Nation's nuclear power plants is astonishing. The White \nHouse must now move swiftly with a replacement for Jaczko and I urge \nthe Senate to move quickly to reconfirm the nomination of Kristine \nSvinicki as NRC commissioner before her term expires on June 30th. The \nonly reason her nomination was held up by the White House and the \nDemocrat-led Senate in the first place was because she had the courage \nto stand up to a hostile work environment, and to the bully who was \nresponsible for it. Now that Jaczko has submitted his resignation, it's \ntime for the Senate to move forward on Kristine Svinicki.\n  Commissioner Svinicki's credentials are unmatched. She is one of the \nworld's leading experts on nuclear safety. She was confirmed by the \nSenate to her current term without a single dissenting vote.\n  It's time we act. Svinicki has served as commissioner with \ndistinction, is enormously qualified, has bipartisan support and \ndeserves a speedy reconfirmation. The American people are best-served \nby a commission that is fully functional.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nfollowing hour will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first \nhalf and Republicans controlling the final half.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      National Small Business Week\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues that we are celebrating National Small \nBusiness Week, which is a very important occasion because, as the \nSenator from New Hampshire understands, the growth engine for America \nis our small businesses. When we are looking at job growth, which we \nall know we need in order to get our economy moving again, we know \nthere will be more jobs created from small companies than from large \ncompanies. About two out of every three jobs created in America will \ncome from small companies.\n  We also know when we are looking at innovation, it is the small \nbusinesses that file the patents and come up with the creative new \nideas for America to become as competitive as we need to be. There are \nan incredibly larger number of patents per employee from small \ncompanies than from large companies. So the growth engine for America's \neconomy rests with our small businesses.\n  I am proud to serve on the Small Business Committee under the \nleadership of Chairman Landrieu. We have brought forward many \ninitiatives that help small businesses, and I think it has made a huge \ndifference as our economy is starting to recover. We are now looking at \n25 consecutive months of continuous private sector job growth where we \nhave turned around the economy and we are now growing. In large measure \nI think it is because of the attention we have paid to the small \nbusiness community. We are proud of what it has meant for our entire \ncountry.\n  Let me speak a little bit about my State of Maryland. We have over \n500,000 small businesses in Maryland that employ over 1 million people. \nSo it is by far a huge part of the Maryland economy. Our strategy over \nthe last several years during the Obama administration has been to \nconcentrate on small businesses and, in particular, to help them \nrecover from this economic recession.\n  The first effort was to increase the capacity of the Small Business \nAdministration. I was proud of the Obama budget that put more money \nback into the Small Business Administration. I was proud of the \ninitiative we had in the Senate to add funds to the Small Business \nAdministration so that the SBA could indeed be the advocate for the \nsmall business community; so that small businesses have an agency in \nthe government that is fighting for their issues. It has made a huge \ndifference. When I speak with the small businesses in Maryland, they \ntell me they now have a much greater capacity for help through \ncounselors and advocates at the Small Business Administration.\n  We then dealt with the No. 1 issue that was brought to our \nattention--and I am sure the Presiding Officer has heard the same \nstories in New Hampshire I have heard in Maryland--that small \nbusinesses have had a hard time getting access to capital; that we need \nto do a better job of providing capital, particularly during a tough \neconomic period where small businesses don't have the same deep pockets \nas the larger companies.\n  So we increased the SBA loan limits, increased the amount of the \nFederal loan guarantee in order to make it more attractive for banks to \nlend money to small businesses, knowing full well the government was \nstanding behind those loans. That made some monies available. We looked \nfor creative new programs to help our small businesses, including one \nin the Treasury Department. We also looked at helping our States by \ninitiating partnerships with our States.\n  The additional funds we made available in Washington to help build \nthe State programs has made many more loans available to small \ncompanies in Maryland. All of that has helped in providing \nopportunities for our small businesses.\n  The reauthorization of the SBIR Program and the STTR Program has made\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\na huge difference. Since 1983, in my State of Maryland, $1.5 billion of \nfunding has come from the SBIR Program. For those who are listening who \nmay not know what this program is about, it is about innovation. It is \nsmall companies that are involved in biotech and cybertech areas where \nthey use innovation to create jobs. In my State and in the Presiding \nOfficer's State, they are using these funds to create opportunities for \nAmerica to be competitive internationally.\n  We can state chapter and verse for our national defense research or \nfor clean energy technology where small businesses are taking advantage \nof these innovative research grants and have been able to build jobs in \nour communities and make America more competitive for the future. The \nreauthorization and thus predictability of funding under the SBIR \nProgram and the increased amounts that are available will create, and \nhas already created, more job opportunities. We got that done, and that \nwas certainly a major step forward.\n  We passed bills providing tax breaks to small businesses, including \nthe expensing of their equipment, so they can go out and buy equipment \nand keep things moving.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Arizona for his \ncourtesy. I will try not to use the entire 5 minutes.\n  There are other areas where we have also moved forward to help our \nsmall businesses, including credits for their health insurance so they \ncan cover their employees. In my own State of Maryland, we have set up \nan African Trade Office which has provided opportunities in \ninternational trade--an area where we think we can still make progress.\n  I could talk about many of the success stories of Maryland small \nbusinesses that have used the SBIR Program, including one to develop \nnew treatment for smallpox vaccines to make them more efficient. We \nhave had examples of where we are now developing a vaccine to deal with \nthe common cold.\n  I was at an SBA event where we honored the leading entrepreneurs in \nour State, and I can cite an example of a small businessperson, Janet \nAmirault, who was the small businessperson of the year--the CEO of a \nsoftware development company. She has had some personal issues with her \nhealth, but despite that, for the last 3 years she has had 90 percent \ngrowth in her revenues. This is the innovation we have in Maryland that \ncomes out of the small business community.\n  Taylor Made Transportation Services, which first qualified under the \n8(a) program, has now graduated from that. They started with a small \ntransportation company that provided transportation for people with \nspecial needs and is now providing for diverse transportation needs in \nour communities. All of that has developed through small business \nprograms that we helped develop.\n\n  So I come to the floor today to announce a new initiative that I will \nbe filing today, the Small Business Goaling Act, to deal with another \nproblem we have with small businesses that I hope we will be able to \ntake up on the floor of the Senate in the very near future. It would \nincrease the prime goals for small businesses in government procurement \nfrom 23 percent to 25 percent and increase the subcontracting goals to \n40 percent, adding transparency to how government provides procurement \nopportunities for government contracts to small businesses.\n  We have also taken some action in dealing with bundling and trying to \nprevent the bundling of small contracts into large contracts that makes \nit more difficult for small businesses to get prime contracts. I \nbelieve this legislation will improve transparency and visibility so we \ncan, in fact, provide more opportunities; so the government leads by \nexample, by using small companies more to help them grow. It will help \na variety of small businesses, including disabled veteran companies, \nwomen-owned companies, and minority-owned companies so that all will \nbenefit from these opportunities.\n  I wish to thank the chairperson of the Small Business Committee, \nSenator Landrieu, for her extraordinary help in getting this bill \ntogether. It will help small businesses by allowing them to grow and \ncreate jobs, thereby helping our country in recovery.\n  Once again, I thank my friend from Arizona for giving me these extra \nfew minutes. The best way to help celebrate National Small Business \nWeek is for us to pay more attention to helping small businesses grow.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, today I would like to add a little context \nto the discussion of the fiscal cliff our Nation approaches, a \nreference to the combination of the largest tax increase in history, \nnew taxes under ObamaCare, sequestration, and the expiration of the \npayroll tax holiday, all of which take effect in January of 2013 unless \nthe President and the Congress act.\n  This is a key discussion to have because how we view this so-called \nfiscal cliff defines our perspective on how an economy grows and \nprospers. Edward Lazear, who is a former Chairman of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, recently wrote an op-ep that outlines the \nvarious perspectives. I will focus on the two most prominent: the \nKeynesian view and the view of supply-side economics.\n  The Keynesian theory holds that spending is the key to growth--\ngovernment spending. Keynesians believe that in recessionary times, \nincreased government spending can take the place of private sector \nactivity. That is why they present a false choice between government \nspending cuts--in other words, austerity--and growth. Their perspective \nholds that growth is contingent on government spending.\n  This was the thinking behind the President's 2009 stimulus spending \npackage, the so-called Cash for Clunkers, and a litany of other recent \ngovernment spending programs, transfer payments, and temporary tax \ncredits. I believe the administration's insistence on enacting these \ntemporary Keynesian spending policies to stimulate consumption is \nmisguided and the evidence reveals has failed. Remember, the stimulus \nwas sold as a measure to keep unemployment from topping 8 percent. But, \nin fact, unemployment has not dipped below 8 percent for 39 months, and \ngrowth is very anemic. We are experiencing a recovery in name only. So \nthere is not much evidence that spending can revitalize a sagging \neconomy; that is to say, government spending, and even if government \nspending could be a boost, as Lazear points out, the costs would be \nmassive. Here is what he writes:\n\n       Even if a fiscal stimulus has some benefit, the cost of \n     fiscal policy is likely to be very large. In order to \n     stimulate the economy, growth in--not high levels of--\n     government spending is required. To provide a stimulus \n     comparable to the 2009 legislation, we would need to increase \n     government spending by $250 billion.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       The Keynesian view implies that keeping spending constant \n     at the higher level in 2014 would generate no simulative \n     growth for 2014 . . . because there is no increase in \n     spending over the 2013 level. . . . If we want to delay our \n     day of reckoning, we must keep spending at a higher level for \n     each year that we want to postpone the negative consequences \n     for growth.\n\n  Supply-side economics, on the other hand, holds a different \nperspective on growth: that government spending does not increase \nprosperity, that tax hikes hurt the economy and stifle growth.\n  We believe that economic growth stems from combining three inputs: \nlabor, capital, and technology. These three factors of production \nresult in output that we can then consume. Without labor, capital, and \ntechnology, there can be no consumption. Focusing on policies that \nstimulate consumption targets the wrong side of the equation. In order \nto get the economy going, we need to focus on the inputs--labor, \ncapital, and technology. We also believe government spending cuts are \nbeneficial because they free up private capital and help align revenues \nwith government spending.\n  Lazear argues that supply-siders stand on the firmest ground when it \ncomes to fiscal policy's effect on economic growth. Here is what he \nwrites:\n\n       On the tax side, there is strong evidence that supports the \n     supply-siders.\n\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\n\n  And he cites, for example, research from Christina Romer. By the way, \nChristina Romer was President Obama's first Chair of his Council of \nEconomic Advisers. Her research shows that raising taxes by 1 percent \nof GDP--raising taxes, which is what the administration proposes--\nlowers our gross domestic product by nearly 3 percent. So increase \ntaxes by 1 percent, you lose 3 percent of gross domestic product.\n  I recently joined 40 of my Republican colleagues in sending a letter \nto Leader Reid to make this point, that tax increases will have a \ndeleterious effect on economic growth. The letter asks that he join us \nin working to take the tax threat off the table before the election in \norder to create more economic certainty. We know that so-called \n``taxmageddon'' is coming. There is no good reason not to act. The \nelection is not an acceptable excuse. In fact, I would posit that \npoliticians could be rewarded for acting to avert the catastrophic \neffect of this huge tax increase.\n  In addition to acting to prevent tax hikes, Congress should also \npursue spending cuts to help unleash private capital, boost growth, and \nreduce our nearly $16 trillion national debt in the process. To be \nclear, cutting government spending does not mean the government should \ntake a sledge hammer approach and cut indiscriminately. We should be \ncareful where we cut. We should prioritize. For example, I oppose the \ndefense cuts on national security grounds, not Keynesian grounds. In \nother words, while it is true that cuts in defense spending will result \nin job losses, big job losses under sequestration, our national \nsecurity is even more important. The automatic spending cuts under \nsequestration mean that across-the-board spending to the Department of \nDefense will, in the words of the Secretary of Defense, devastate our \nnational security.\n  Allowing the sequester to begin as planned would cut 10 percent from \ndefense in fiscal year 2013 alone and dramatically shrink the size and \ncapabilities of our military. To avoid this, the Senate should follow \nthe lead of the House of Representatives, which recently passed \nlegislation to replace the sequester with other spending reductions. \nThe legislation will cut $315 billion in spending and will reduce the \ndeficit by over $242 billion. It is not a perfect bill, but I do \nbelieve it is a good place to start.\n  My overarching point is this: We should not shy away from prudent \nspending cuts for fear that they will hurt growth. It should not be \ndifficult to find cuts in our $3.7 trillion budget. These cuts \ncertainly will not derail economic growth if they are done the right \nway.\n  The choice, in other words, between spending cuts and growth is a \nfalse choice. If the President is not truly concerned about boosting \ngrowth and reversing the trends of the last 3\\1/2\\ years, he should \nstop presenting this false choice, as he did, for example, at the G8 \nsummit last weekend, where he actually encouraged German Chancellor \nAngela Merkel and other leaders to embrace what he called a ``growth \npackage'' modeled in part after his own budget-busting stimulus \nspending. I hope Chancellor Merkel and other leaders around the world \ntake a very close look at whether the Obama growth package is something \nthey wish to bring home after observing the American economy for the \nlast 4 years.\n  Preventing tax increases and reducing out-of-control spending is a \nbetter approach to long-term prosperity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, the op-\ned I referred to by Edward Lazear in the Wall Street Journal of May 21 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 21, 2012]\n\n                   Three Views of the `Fiscal Cliff'\n\n                         (By Edward P. Lazear)\n\n       Discussion of the so-called fiscal cliff--the combination \n     of tax increases and spending cuts that will come in 2013 if \n     Congress and the president don't act--confuses a number of \n     different issues. The evidence suggests that we should fear \n     the tax hikes, but not necessarily the spending cuts.\n       Anyone who uses the term ``fiscal cliff'' accepts a \n     Keynesian view of the economy, knowingly or not. Both tax \n     increases and constrained spending are assumed to be bad for \n     the economy.\n       But there are two other views: that of the budget balancer \n     and that of the supply-sider. Rather than term the impending \n     changes that will occur in 2013 a ``fiscal cliff,'' the \n     budget balancer thinks of this as ``fiscal consolidation.'' \n     Tax increases reduce the deficit, as do cuts in government \n     spending. Both are austerity measures that make the \n     government more responsible and, therefore, both are \n     conducive to long-run economic growth.\n       Those who support the Simpson-Bowles plan subscribe, at \n     least in part, to this view. Various proponents of the plan \n     may place different weights on the tax-increase side or the \n     spending-decrease side because they believe the economic \n     consequence of one or the other is more adverse. But \n     fundamentally, the target is to decrease the deficit. The \n     budget balancer regards both tax increases and spending cuts \n     as moves in the right direction.\n       The supply-sider has a different view from both the \n     Keynesian and the budget balancer. Fundamentally, supply-side \n     advocates focus on the harmful effects of tax increases. \n     Raising tax rates hurts the economy directly because tax \n     hikes reduce incentives to invest and because they punish \n     hard work. As such, tax increases slow growth. But budget \n     cuts work in the right direction by making lower tax revenues \n     sustainable. If spending exceeds revenues, then the \n     government must borrow and this commits future governments to \n     raising taxes in order to service the debt.\n       Consequently, the supply-sider thinks of 2013 primarily as \n     a tax increase and fears what that will do to the economy. \n     The spending cuts are a positive. Unlike the Keynesians who \n     view the fiscal cliff as being bad on two counts, or the \n     budget balancer who views it as being good on two counts, the \n     supply-sider scores it one-and-one. The tax increases have \n     negative effects on the economy; the controls on spending are \n     a positive side effect of the 2013 sunsets.\n       Which of the three views is correct? Until recently, most \n     economists believed that fiscal policy was inappropriate for \n     business-cycle management, and that if stimulus was needed at \n     all, monetary policy was the best way. Spending ``stimulus'' \n     does not have a strong track record in recent decades. There \n     is more ambiguity now about the choice between monetary and \n     fiscal policy, in large part because with interest rates near \n     zero, the effectiveness of monetary policy is thought to be \n     more limited.\n       But even if a fiscal stimulus has some benefit, the cost of \n     fiscal policy is likely to be very large. In order to \n     stimulate the economy, growth in--not high levels of--\n     government spending is required. To provide a stimulus in \n     2013 comparable to the 2009 legislated stimulus, we would \n     need to increase government spending by about $250 billion.\n       But the Keynesian view implies that keeping spending \n     constant at the higher level in 2014 would generate no \n     stimulative growth effect for 2014. Despite the higher level \n     of spending in 2014, we would get no additional growth \n     because there is no increase in spending over the 2013 level. \n     Were we to retreat to current levels of spending, there would \n     be a contractionary effect on the economy as government \n     spending decreases. If we want to delay our day of reckoning, \n     we must keep spending at a higher level for each year that we \n     want to postpone the negative consequences for growth. Given \n     the state of the labor market, this could mean a few years. \n     If we waited four years, we would spend $1 trillion to get \n     $250 billion in stimulus.\n       On the tax side, there is strong evidence that supports the \n     supply-siders. Christina Romer, President Obama's first \n     chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, \n     and David Romer document the strong unfavorable effect of \n     increasing tax rates on economic growth (American Economic \n     Review, 2010). They report that an increase in taxes of 1% of \n     gross domestic product lowers GDP by almost 3%. The evidence \n     on government spending also suggests that high spending means \n     lower growth.\n       For example, Swedish economists Andreas Bergh and Magnus \n     Henrekson (Journal of Economic Surveys 2011) survey a large \n     literature and conclude that an increase in government size \n     by 10 percentage points of GDP is associated with a half to \n     one percentage point lower annual growth rate.\n       The evidence suggests that we should move away from worry \n     over the impending ``fiscal cliff'' and focus more heavily on \n     concern about raising taxes. And although some Keynesians may \n     view this as not the best time to control spending growth, \n     promising to change our ways in the future is as credible as \n     Wimpy's promise to pay on Tuesday for the hamburger that he \n     eats today.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                          LightSquared Danger\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am pleased to see that Jessica \nRosenworcel and Ajit Pai have been confirmed to the Federal \nCommunications Commission. They are both highly qualified, and it is \nunfortunate that the FCC's stubborn refusal to respond to my very \nsimple request for information forced me to place a hold on their \nnominations for the past 4 months in order to get the FCC to move on \ngiving me the information to which any Member of Congress ought to be \nentitled.\n  The FCC needs to learn a simple lesson from this episode: The \npublic's business ought to be public, and transparency brings \naccountability. Eventually, the truth will be known, so you\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nmight as well get it out there when the questions first come up.\n  I initially placed my hold on the FCC Commissioner nominees because \nthe FCC had stonewalled a document request that I submitted on April 27 \nlast year regarding their actions related to a company called \nLightSquared and the hedge fund, Harbinger Capital, that owns \nLightSquared.\n  Before I wrote my letter on LightSquared, many concerns had already \nbeen raised regarding the company's plans for a terrestrial network and \nits potential to interfere with the global positioning system, or \nsometimes that is referred to as GPS. In my first letter, I raised \nthose concerns as well. Unfortunately, the FCC does not appear to have \ntaken those concerns seriously, but months later, independent testing \nverified the danger LightSquared posed to industries, from commercial \naviation to even our own Armed Forces.\n  It seems strange that a project that was so obviously flawed was \nallowed to go so far. But LightSquared had help. In total, LightSquared \nhas paid 53 different lobbyists, some registered, some unregistered. \nThey paid one former Governor, three former Senators, nine former \nMembers of Congress, including a former Speaker and former minority \nleader, and a former White House Counsel to advocate for them. These \nlobbyists provided entry into the FCC and the White House. But they \ncould not change the fact that LightSquared's network simply could not \ncoexist with GPS.\n  LightSquared has now declared bankruptcy, and it appears its plan to \nbuild a terrestrial network is over, but many questions still remain. \nSome of those questions: Why did the FCC give LightSquared this unusual \nwaiver in the first place? Why did LightSquared's lawyers mention \ncampaign contributions when they sought meetings at the White House? \nWhy did a four-star general claim he had been pressured by the Obama \nadministration not to criticize LightSquared?\n  When I first asked the FCC for documents, I was told they would take \nabout 2 years to respond to my request through the Freedom of \nInformation Act. Then they told me they do not voluntarily turn over \ndocuments to the 99.6 percent of the Members of Congress who do not \nchair a committee with direct jurisdiction over FCC. After a lot of \nback and forth with the FCC, they told me the reason they do not \nrespond to 99.6 percent of Congress is because of just a one-line \nstatement in the Congressional Research Service report. The line reads, \n``Oversight is most effective if it is conducted by Congressional \ncommittees of jurisdiction.'' Now, the FCC somehow took this quote and \nconveniently came up with the idea that they do not have to give this \nSenator any documents. Of course, to anybody in the Congress, this \nmakes no sense whatsoever, but that is what the FCC hid behind. And, of \ncourse--you know me--I did not give up. The FCC's response to me is \njust another variation on what the Justice Department told me when I \nstarted asking questions about Operation Fast and Furious.\n  Fortunately, we have Members of the House of Representatives who are \nnot afraid to ask this administration some tough questions. In Fast and \nFurious, it was Chairman Issa who held the Justice Department's feet to \nthe fire to make sure they responded fully and responded completely. \nWith LightSquared, it was another committee in the House of \nRepresentatives, the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Chairmen \nWalden, Upton, and Stearns and their staff have done an excellent job \nin making sure the FCC is open, transparent, and provides documents to \nCongress, even when they do not want to give those documents to a \nSenator who asked for them, meaning this Senator.\n  I would also like to thank Commerce Committee Chairman Rockefeller \nhere in the Senate for pressing the FCC personally to release \ndocuments. With all of this help, we are making sure the FCC is open \nwith the American people about the way they operate because \ntransparency brings accountability.\n  In over 30 years of conducting oversight, I can say that when it \ncomes to providing documents to the Congress, the FCC is one of the \nworst Federal agencies I have ever had to deal with. Even after \nreceiving a document request from the Energy and Commerce Committee in \nthe House of Representatives, the FCC still tried to play the tired old \ngames agencies play when they are not acting in good faith.\n  When they finally turned over their first batch of documents--would \nyou believe it?--those documents were already publicly available on the \nInternet through the Freedom of Information Act. So they weren't giving \nus anything we didn't already have access to.\n  When they didn't convince us they were acting in good faith--because, \nquite frankly, they weren't--they gave us a second production. But in \nthat production, of the first 1,968 pages they produced, all but 3--in \nother words, 1,965 pages--were newspaper clippings. Again, the FCC was \nplaying games. And, of course, that is not acceptable.\n  Fortunately, we have continued to press the FCC, and we now, with the \nhelp of the House of Representatives, have approximately 8,000 \nnonpublic internal documents. Still, we have not received all \nresponsive documents from the FCC yet. We just received another 4,000 \npages of documents, and I have been told that approximately 7,000 more \ndocuments are on their way to Congress. We now at least have a path \nforward. That is why I lifted my holds a couple weeks ago, so these \nnominations could move forward.\n  I trust the House committee will ensure that the FCC provides those \n7,000 or so additional documents. I have always said if you are hiding \nsomething, it is best to get it out in the open, because the longer you \nstonewall--in this case the FCC--the worse you are going to look when \nthose facts finally come out.\n  The FCC has attempted to stonewall my request for documents for \nalmost a year, and they have failed. But they failed only thanks to the \nhelp provided by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and because \nof that help we are finally able to review internal documents from the \nFCC--the very same documents we should have gotten when we first asked \nin our request on April 27 of last year.\n  As I said when I initially filed my intent to object, I strongly \nbelieve it is critical for Congress to have access to documents in \norder to conduct vigorous and independent oversight. Whether it takes 1 \nday, 1 week, 1 month, or even 1 year--as it did in this case--I will \ncontinue to pursue transparency across the Federal Government because \ntransparency brings accountability. That is essential so that Congress \ncan practice its constitutional role of oversight over the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The role of oversight is this simple: Congress passes laws and \nappropriates money. That is not the end of it. Our government is a \ngovernment of checks and balances. We have a responsibility, after \npassing laws and appropriating money, to make sure the laws are \nfaithfully executed and the money spent according to the intent of \nCongress. That is oversight.\n  Even now as we review these documents we have already gotten and \nbegin conducting interviews with key FCC staff, the investigation, \nobviously, continues. Step one was getting access to the FCC e-mails. \nWe took this step so we could make sure we had the facts before we \njumped to conclusions.\n  Now it is time for step two--asking hard questions of the key FCC \npersonnel who approved the LightSquared waiver. This process may \ncontinue to take more time, but however long the process takes, I will \ncontinue to press for transparency at the FCC because, again, with \ntransparency comes accountability.\n  This agency must operate in an open and transparent manner, and we \nmust have answers regarding the LightSquared waiver. The people at the \nFCC work for the American people, they don't work for themselves.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now on the motion to proceed, as \nyou know, to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act \nof\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\n2012, which is basically the reauthorization of FDA for the \nprescription drug user fees and the medical device user fees. There are \na couple of new provisions in this bill dealing with the generic drug \nuser fees and the biosimilar drug user fees as well. So this bill is \nextremely important.\n  We have been working in our committee for over a year on it, working \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle. As both Senator Enzi, my \nranking member, and I pointed out yesterday, this has been a true \nbipartisan effort. We did not divide up in terms of party--Democrat or \nRepublican--we divided up in terms of interest areas, and we had \nworking groups within our committee so that Senators who had a \nparticular interest in one area or another were on that working group. \nWe also had Senators who were not on the committee but who had interest \nareas in it involved in our working groups. So they and their staffs \nhad full working knowledge of what was going on all the time and it was \na true collegial effort. Those working groups completed their work \nearlier this year.\n  We also called in all the stakeholders--the prescription drug \nmanufacturers, the pharmacists, the drugstores, consumer groups, and \npractitioners. So we had all the stakeholders involved in this too. And \nnow we have come up with a bill that has very broad support. I put in \nthe Record yesterday a list of over 100 different organizations, \neverything from the drug manufacturers to consumer protection groups \nand consumer groups that are supporting this bill. It has very broad-\nbased support. And, again, I believe that is due to the fact we \nproceeded on the reauthorization of this bill in the time-honored \ntradition of the Senate, which is for the committee to take the \nreauthorization prospect, to do its due diligence--and we did that for \nover a year, as I mentioned--and to make sure people were involved at \nevery step of the process on both sides of the aisle. We brought in the \nstakeholders and continued this effort, as I said, for over a year to \nthe point where we now have a bill that is broadly supported.\n  As I said, everyone has a common interest in ensuring our products \ndon't hurt patients. I have said in our hearings, and I continue to \nbelieve, safety is the paramount consideration. We cannot sacrifice \npatient safety on the altar of other considerations. Patient safety is \nstill the highest standard, the highest mark at which we aim our \nsights. But getting the products to patients quickly is also important.\n  I have heard heartwrenching stories of patients desperately waiting \nfor treatments, and of inspiring accounts of small startup companies \nseeking to fill the needs of these patients with innovative medical \nproducts. Patient groups and industry alike have stressed the need for \nefficient FDA processes to get products to patients quickly.\n  Again--and I will be pointing out later also--FDA does a very good \njob of getting products, both drugs and devices, to market quickly. In \nfact, of the 154 drugs approved in both the United States and Canada, \nin a study done by the New England Journal of Medicine, 132 were \napproved here first. So we have not been dragging our heels and FDA \nhasn't been dragging its heels in terms of getting the job done.\n  Some say, well, sometimes products get approved more rapidly in \nEurope than they do here. That is true, but it is important to note \nthat foreign approval standards are different. So it is kind of an \napples-and-oranges kind of comparison. The FDA here approves drugs and \ndevices based on their safety and effectiveness--safety and \neffectiveness. Are they safe and do they actually do what they say they \nare supposed to do?\n  Other countries--basically in Europe--only consider safety and not \nwhether the device is effective. So as long as it is safe, they approve \nit. So, yes, they have a shorter approval time, but they don't take \ninto consideration effectiveness.\n  I strongly believe the United States should keep this high standard \nof both safety and effectiveness. It is important to know if a device \nis effective because that affects a patient's decision whether to \naccept the device's risks and whether to forego maybe alternative \ntreatments.\n  FDA officials testified before our committee this year. They \nsubmitted documentation showing that 95 percent of medical device \napplications were reviewed within the deadlines set in the past user \nfee agreement. Now, despite all this good work FDA is doing, patients \nwere sick or dying. Promising therapies can't be approved quickly \nenough. So the bill we have before us will continue to support the \nagency and its good work, but it will allow for some very big \nimprovements.\n  The medical device industry has agreed to double its user fees, to \npay twice as much, and in return the FDA has agreed to speed review \ntimes, increase transparency, enhance communications--all of which will \nget devices to patients more quickly but still keep safety in mind. So \nanything we can do to both streamline the process, get drugs and \ndevices to patients sooner, and make sure we keep our high standard of \nsafety and effectiveness is not only good for business but critical for \nthe patients who need them.\n  I expect the FDA Safety and Innovation Act will have significant \nimpact on FDA's ability to approve medical products in an efficient and \ntransparent way. As I said, that benefits everyone. Investors will feel \nbetter about putting their money into medical technologies, companies \nwill translate their research and development work into sales more \nquickly, support for innovation will allow the United States to \nmaintain its leadership position in the biotech industry, and this will \npreserve and create jobs all over America.\n  In this sector, as long as we preserve safety standards--which is, \nwhat is good for business is good for patients--then, again, if \ncompanies and their investors believe the climate is right to commit \nresources to new medical therapies, this means patients who did not \npreviously have options will have treatments to turn to. So I say this \nbill is a win-win for everyone.\n  Inspiring innovation and improving patient access to medical \ntherapies are two of the many ways this bill modernizes our regulatory \nand oversight system to benefit both patients and the biomedical \nindustry. The FDA Safety and Innovation Act is a truly bipartisan \nconsensus bill that reflects the input and shared goals of a wide range \nof stakeholders. I hope we will be on the bill shortly after our noon \ncaucuses and conferences for the two parties this afternoon. I trust \nthat we will have only relevant amendments to the bill. I hope that has \nbeen accepted on both sides, and that we can discuss the bill and have \nthe relevant amendments and have them disposed of sometime this week.\n  So I am hopeful we can get this bill done before we go home for the \nMemorial Day recess. But we will be back on the bill this afternoon. I \nurge all my colleagues to give this bill their support. We will have \nsome amendments, I am sure, that will be relevant to the bill. They \nwill be debated and voted upon. But, nonetheless, I hope we can \nexpeditiously move this bill and get it done.\n  The clock is ticking. The FDA authorization runs out at the end of \nthis summer. You might say, well, we have until then to get it done. We \nare out of here the month of August. We are out of here for the Fourth \nof July break. We have a Memorial Day break. We have appropriations \nbills to do. We have all kinds of things we have to do this summer. \nPlus, it is not waiting until the last minute.\n  FDA needs to know very soon whether they are going to have these \nresources. The drug companies need to know whether FDA will have the \nresources to continue to do its work. So sometime midsummer FDA will \nprobably have to start sending out pink slips to people they will not \nbe able to keep past the end of the summer because they will not have \nthe funds. It has been estimated that up to 2,000 people could lose \ntheir jobs at the end of this summer if we don't do our work and get \nthis bill reauthorized.\n  So time is of the essence. We need to get it done so we can go to \nconference with the House, work out whatever little disagreements we \nmay have, and get the final bill to the President, hopefully sometime \nin June so the FDA then will not have to go through any processes of \nseeing who they are going to lay off and how they are going to close \nthings down at the end of the summer.\n  So, again, time is of the essence. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this well-thought-out bill that has taken over a year to put \ntogether. All of the\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\nstakeholders support it with broad support across America. So I hope we \ncan get on the bill this afternoon and bring it to a close as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to follow \nSenator Harkin, one of the chief authors of the FDA bill, and to thank \nhim and Senator Enzi for this truly bipartisan, monumental work on a \nmeasure that is essential to the future of the health of our Nation as \nwell as our economic security.\n  This bill is a big one. It is a big bill with complex provisions and \nan essential purpose: to safeguard the public, to protect patients, and \nencourage innovation and invention, which are so important to treating \nand curing diseases in this country as well as other problems. This \nmeasure is revolutionary in many ways. It contains complex new \nprovisions with bipartisan support. Truly, the bipartisanship in \nsupport of this bill makes it noteworthy as well.\n  I am pleased to say it includes the GAIN Act, which I helped to \nauthor and champion with my colleague, Senator Corker, and 15 other \nSenators who have joined in this effort to incentivize the development \nof new antibiotics, to treat, stop, and conquer the superbugs, as they \nare known, germs that are resistant to antibiotics that now exist. To \nprovide more drug security, the supply chain needs greater safeguards. \nI have worked with Senators Burr, Bennet, Harkin, Grassley, and \nWhitehouse on this measure. I am proud to say it is in here. The bill \nincludes provisions on treatment and research on pediatric diseases and \nconditions that is the work of Senators Reed, Alexander, and Murray. I \nhave been very proud to add to their efforts. Of course, it includes \nthe work on medical device innovation and safety, which I have done \nwith Senator Grassley and Senator Kohl.\n\n  This measure, in a way, epitomizes the approach we should take to FDA \nregulation, which is to enable devices to reach the market more \nquickly, to make sure they are safe but available more promptly, to \nguarantee surveillance and oversight after they reach the market, and \nreporting by industry so we enlist industry as a partner and make the \nFDA an ally, not an adversary, with industry in innovation and patient \ncare.\n  Nowhere is this approach more necessary than in addressing the drug \nshortage problem in this country. It is a problem, it is a crisis, it \nis an outrage. The United States should be embarrassed and outraged \nthat the greatest country in the history of the world, the strongest on \nthe planet, having developed lifesaving medicines and devoted \nextraordinary research and development to make those medicines \navailable to the people of this country, still has shortages, crisis \nshortages in those very pharmaceutical drugs.\n  That crisis is inexcusable and unacceptable. The bill takes a step in \nthe direction of addressing and solving this crisis. It is a first \nstep. I leave no doubt, as I stand here, that I will continue to work \non this problem, to advocate other steps--some that I will suggest \ntoday and others that will be forthcoming in measures I will propose \nlater.\n  I first became aware of the drug shortage problem through contacts \nwith people from Connecticut, patients who suffer as a result of these \ndrug shortages and doctors who are hugely concerned about the choices \nthey have to make and the dilemmas they face every day in their \npractices, and hospitals that engage in what they call triage, trying \nto find drugs to substitute for the ones that are in shortage so they \ncan care for patients who are literally dealing with life-and-death \nsituations.\n  We are not talking about just one or a couple of drugs. Methotrexate \nwas recently the subject of a New York Times front-page article. It \nprovides cancer treatment, but there are other cancer-treating drugs \nthat are also in short supply, essential for both prolonging life and \ngiving life to patients who otherwise would lose it more quickly. We \nare talking about Mitomycin, about Doxil, about Cytaraline. In other \nareas of treatment we are talking about epinephrine, which is important \nfor allergy treatment, zinc injections, which are necessary for \nnutrition deficiencies, Propoful, a workhorse medicine commonly used in \nemergency rooms across the country when people arrive in need of \nanesthesia. For these drugs and hundreds of others, literally hundreds \nof others, to be in shortage is unacceptable and inexcusable.\n  What illustrates this problem perhaps most dramatically are the faces \nand voices of the people in Connecticut and in every State around the \ncountry who suffer because of these drug shortages. They are your \nneighbors, your friends--my colleagues' constituents. They are coping \nwith pain, anxiety, sadness, grief, anger--and there are drugs \navailable to them that would provide relief and remedies. Their docs \ncannot get them because they are in shortage.\n  We are talking about people of great courage and fortitude, such as \nSusan Block. She is just illustrative. I have her picture here. My \noffice helped her to get a drug called Doxil to treat her cancer \nbecause halfway through her chemotherapy treatments for ovarian cancer \nshe arrived at the hospital one day to learn from her doctor that Doxil \nwould no longer be available. She called my office in a panic upon \nlearning that information. Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any \nother cancer of the female reproductive system and Susan was unwilling \nto settle for half a treatment. She was right, and her doctor supported \nher and my office supported her in securing an emergency delivery of \nDoxil for Susan, allowing her to complete treatment.\n  She has allowed me, graciously, to share this photo with you today.\n  I am pleased we have been able to help constituents in Connecticut \nagain and again to secure these medicines when they have been in \nshortage, working with manufacturers as well as hospitals in that \neffort. But it should not have happened at all.\n  Not everyone has been this lucky. Stephen Hine of Bethel wrote to my \noffice after he lost his wife Ann. She died of terminal ovarian cancer. \nAnn was also on Doxil. While the drug was not going to save her life--\nthese drugs do not always save lives--it could have prolonged her life \nexpectancy. But she could not get Doxil in time and she lost her battle \nwith cancer. Stephen, her husband, understood that the drug would not \nhave cured her but it would have helped her live longer to spend more \ntime with her family, her daughter, who was going to graduate that \nspring. It would have meant so much for Ann to see her daughter \ngraduate. We have a right to ask what kind of nation allows patients to \ngo without these drugs and forces doctors to make decisions about who \nneeds them the most.\n  I thank Senators Klobuchar and Casey particularly for championing \nthis effort even before I arrived in the Senate and later, personally, \nthe Chair of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and \nthe Ranking Member, Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi, for their support.\n  There are proven measures that will help solve these issues. More \nneeds to be done, but the drug shortage provisions contained in the \nbill before this chamber, which provides for a requirement of \nnotification in the event of a discontinuance or interruption of the \nproduction of life-supporting, life-sustaining drugs or drugs intended \nfor use in the prevention of a debilitating disease or condition or a \nsterile injectable or a drug used in an emergency are critical. The \nreasons these drugs are in short supply was illustrated and documented \nby a GAO study. It showed that drugs are in short supply--not just \nonce, but they are chronically in short supply, some of them many \ntimes--it showed definitively that these drugs are old, sterile, often \ninjectable, and generic. The market simply is not working for these \ndrugs. The profit margins are not sufficient to sustain the supply. The \nmarket for these drugs is broken.\n\n  If these drugs--to draw the analogy to a utility--were electricity, \nthe lights would go out. We would not accept that situation. The lights \nare going out for patients in Connecticut\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\nand across the country because the markets are not working and the \ngovernment, the FDA, is failing in its responsibilities--under great \npressure, perhaps with good intentions, but still not working \neffectively enough. The President of the United States recognized it \nwhen he issued an Executive order that required the FDA to use its \ncurrent powers of notification more effectively and to refer price-\ngouging cases to the Department of Justice when there is evidence of \nthem. The markets are not working so there is now a gray market that \ninvolves markups of 200, 300, 500, 800 percent, sometimes even higher, \nin the prices of these drugs as they are resold in secondary markets.\n  Beyond this requirement of notification that is contained in the \nbill, there are other measures that are important or necessary so that \nwe do more to address these problems. I have refiled my amendment from \nthe HELP Committee markup, along with Senators Franken, Schumer, \nCardin, and Klobuchar, to impose penalties, tough penalties for \nmanufacturers who fail to notify. Notification is fine but it will be \nless effective if there are no penalties for failure to notify. We may \ntry to walk a balance between enforcement and incentives, but \nenforcement in this area is critical, and this measure imposing \npenalties for failure to notify is critical as well.\n  The amendment is a fair one. It provides for penalties of up to \n$10,000 per day--up to $1.8 million per violation--for failure to \nnotify the FDA within a reasonable time frame of known discontinuance \nof a lifesaving drug.\n  I am proposing as well an amendment that would require critical \nmanufacturing reinvestment. I have worked with the manufacturing \nindustry to create a public/private partnership to incentivize the \ndevelopment of additional manufacturing capacity. The root of the drug \nshortage problem is that these products are old and generic and \ndifficult to make so that we need more capacity, we need more plants \nmaking more of these drugs. Over the long term, this kind of \npartnership will strengthen the markets and strengthen our capacity. It \nsays the Secretary of Health and Human Services has authority to \nimplement an analysis of the root causes of the drug shortage and to \nproactively seek these kinds of partnerships with manufacturers to \nproduce more of the drugs that may be in shortage right now, but to \npredict, to forecast, what will be in short supply in the future.\n  Market manipulation must be addressed more effectively and I have \nproposed an amendment that will stop the gray market so far as it is \npossible to do, to prohibit market manipulation of drugs that are in \nshortage and prohibit the distribution of false information. It gives \nthe FTC authority to assess penalties for these actions. I thank my \ncolleagues on the Commerce Committee, Chairman Rockefeller, and also \nthank Senator Schumer for his leadership, because he has shown a \nsimilar commitment to addressing these issues.\n  Our doctors and our health care providers deserve some recourse from \nmarket manipulation. The gray market must be stopped and the FTC must \nimmediately establish a reporting mechanism for price gougers and gray-\nmarket profiteers.\n  These measures are a beginning. The notification provision now in the \nbill is a start. I thank, again, Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member \nEnzi for their leadership and the FDA for its cooperation. The work \ncannot stop with this bill. Drug shortages are unacceptable and \ninexcusable, and the people of America, if they are aware of it, will \ndemand that we heighten the fight toward a comprehensive solution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                            Child Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, Senator Sessions and I come to the Senate \nfloor today to discuss the Child Tax Credit Integrity Preservation Act, \nthe bill I introduced last year, to address a real problem with IRS \nenforcement allowing illegal aliens to access the additional child tax \ncredit.\n  The reality is, because of this enforcement problem and this loophole \nin terms of how the child tax credit is enforced, illegal aliens who \npay no taxes and are not entitled to this check from the government \nreceived $4.2 billion in 2010 alone. These are checks from the \ngovernment through the Child Tax Credit Act.\n  There have been several studies under the President Obama \nadministration that say this is ridiculous, this is unintended, we need \nto stop this. I am proposing we do and that we move forward in a \nsimple, bipartisan, commonsense way to stop it. Let me briefly note \nsome of those studies.\n  In March of 2009, the Treasury Department said:\n\n       As it now stands, the payment of Federal funds through this \n     tax benefit appears to provide an additional incentive for \n     aliens to enter, reside, and work in the United States \n     without authorization, which contradicts Federal law and \n     policy to remove such incentives.\n\n  In July 2011, the Treasury Department, through its inspector general, \nissued a report that was actually entitled ``Individuals Who Are Not \nAuthorized to Work in the United States Were Paid $4.2 Billion in \nRefundable Credits.''\n  So, again, under this administration the Treasury Department and the \nIRS underscore that this is a huge problem to the tune of $4.2 billion \nevery year.\n  I urge all of us to come together in a straightforward, commonsense, \nbipartisan way to fix this problem. The IRS and the Treasury Department \nhave told us that the fix is simple, and it is clear. We simply need to \nmandate that folks applying for the credit use valid Social Security \nnumbers. That will cut off the fraud, and that will cut off $4.2 \nbillion going improperly to illegal alien families. It will not cut off \nthe benefit going to anyone who deserves it under the law.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 577\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Finance be discharged from further consideration of S. 577, the \nChild Tax Credit Integrity Preservation Act, and the Senate proceed to \nits immediate consideration; that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of all, \nI want to express my appreciation to the Senator from Louisiana and the \nSenator from Alabama for their courtesy. They are going to talk a lot \nlonger on this matter. They recognized there was a good chance I would \nobject to their request. They have agreed to allow me to say a few \nwords before they finish what they have to say on the Senate floor. I \nappreciate their courtesy very much because I do have some other things \nI need to work on.\n  Mr. President, the Vitter-Sessions legislation literally takes a \nsledgehammer to a problem that deserves some very fine tuning and a \nscalpel. There are news reports that have suggested that some have \nclaimed the child tax credit for children who actually live outside the \nUnited States.\n  The Tax Code is very clear that the child tax credit is not available \nfor children living outside the United States. It is very clear. If, in \nfact, someone is doing that, then those filers and tax preparers are \ncommitting a fraud on the people of this country. If they are doing \nthat and there is a loophole that is existing, we need to close that \nloophole.\n  Chairman Baucus has already had his staff work with the IRS to \ndetermine if its procedures are strong enough to stop such fraud. We \nbelieve they are, but if they are not then it is up to Congress to plug \nany loopholes that may exist. However, the Vitter-Sessions legislation \neliminates the child tax credit for filers who are fully complying with \nthe law. That is not a good result. In fact, the legislation that is \nproposed fails to address the issue of the child tax credit being \nclaimed for children not living in the United States, so the problem is \nnot solved by this legislation. The legislation goes well beyond what \nis necessary to stop fraud in the Child Tax Credit Program, and \ntherefore I object to the consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, before the distinguished majority leader \nhas to leave, I would just ask, through the\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\nChair, if we can get some clarification and hopefully come to some \nconsensus, is he suggesting that illegal aliens in the country should \ncontinue to receive the credit? Is he suggesting that citizens who \nqualify for the credit but happen to live outside the country should \nnot get it?\n  It seems to me the problem is illegal aliens receiving the credit, \nwherever they are physically, not the people outside the country who \nare receiving the credit, some of whom qualify for the credit.\n  If I could bring that point up through the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, without fully debating the subject--and \nothers know more about it than I do, but what I do know is that we want \nto make sure any children who are here and who are American citizens \nand entitled to this get the benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I would say, through the Chair, thank you for that \nclarification. We have exactly the same goal in mind, and I believe \nthis approach of the Vitter bill--the House has already passed this \napproach recently, and its budget outline actually accomplishes that. \nBy requiring a valid Social Security number, we allow everyone who \ntruly qualifies for the credit to get it, and we stop it from going to \nillegal alien families who do not deserve the credit under the law.\n  I invite my distinguished colleague from Alabama to add to the \ndiscussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I appreciate the \ninsight the majority leader provided. We will look at that and see \nwhere we stand on it, but I would urge that we do not need to wait a \ngreat deal of time for this to be fixed.\n  The inspector general for Tax Administration of the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment started raising this formally in 2009. The issue actually \ncame up in 2007 when individuals in the Treasury Department thought \nthere was something wrong occurring. So the inspector general did a \nreport, and he has called on us to fix it.\n  In fact, he said in his report:\n\n       We continue to believe the legislation is needed to ensure \n     compliance with both laws.\n\n  I would say that is what we need to do. The House has acted and we \nshould act. Four billion dollars a year is a great deal of money. It is \nabout $10 million a day that is going out of the country to individuals \nwho should not be receiving it.\n  According to the inspector general's report, the amount of the child \ntax credit--and as Senator Vitter said, this is not a tax deduction. \nThis is a $1,000-per-child tax credit that we have for people in the \nUnited States who work, who have worked lawfully, and who have children \nand they get a check. If they owe no income tax at all, and a \nsubstantial percentage of the people who work in America end up not \npaying income tax, but they still get a check from Uncle Sam for $1,000 \nper child.\n  It was a policy I supported because over the years families had not \ngained the kind of deductible advantage that had been done 30 years ago \nwhen people had children, and it leveled the playing field and helped \nworking families raise children in a decent environment. It is a policy \nI like, but it is not for somebody here illegally and has children in \nsome foreign country. That is not what it is about. It is for $4 \nbillion. It has surged.\n  In 2005 the inspector general noted that the IRS paid out to these \nITIN filers $924 million in 2005. In 2006, it was $1.3 billion. In 2007 \nit was $1.7 billion. In 2008 it was $2.1 billion. In 2009 it was $2.9 \nbillion. From 2009 to 2010 it went from $2.9 billion to $4.2 billion. \nIt has been surging every year.\n  As a matter of protecting the Treasury of the United States from \nabuse, the IG says we need legislation. The Senator from Louisiana has \ndrafted legislation that will do the job precisely as it should. Would \nthe Senator agree that Congress should not wait around another year? It \nis something that the House already passed, and if we passed it, it \nwould become law in perhaps a matter of days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I could respond through the Chair.\n  I absolutely agree with the Senator from Alabama. Too often folks in \nWashington want to make things overly complicated. Some issues debated \nin the Congress are complicated. Other issues are not complicated, but \nthey are made a whole lot more complicated than they need to be made, \nand this is one of those.\n  All we are saying is folks who qualify for this benefit under the law \nshould get it, but folks who don't qualify, including illegal alien \nfamilies, should absolutely not get it. The law is clear on that. What \nwe have is an enforcement problem. We also have the Obama \nadministration, through the Treasury Department, absolutely agreeing \nthat this is an enforcement problem and that this bill is the \nlegitimate and proper solution.\n  Again, in March 2009 the Treasury said:\n\n       As it now stands, the payment of Federal funds through this \n     tax benefit appears to provide an additional incentive for \n     aliens to enter, reside, and work in the United States \n     without authorization. . . .\n\n  That means it is a magnet to draw more illegal crossings into the \ncountry.\n  Again, in July 2007, the Treasury inspector general had a whole \nreport, and the title was ``Individuals Who Are Not Authorized to Work \nin the United States Were Paid $4.2 Billion in Refundable Credits.'' \nThat inspector general said what we need is fixed legislation just like \nthis.\n  In fact, this is what we do with regard to the earned-income tax \ncredit. We require a valid Social Security number for that separate tax \ncredit. We are simply applying that valid fix to this different tax \ncredit.\n  Again, let's not make a pretty straightforward situation difficult. \nLet's fix a glaring problem. As the Senator from Alabama said, it is a \n$4.2 billion-a-year problem. We come to the floor every day to talk \nabout soaring deficits and debt, to talk about impending cuts in \ndefense and other areas, and yet we have this glaring $4.2 billion \nsavings that we are not taking advantage of.\n  The House has acted. The House recently acted and passed exactly this \nprovision. Let's act in a bipartisan, commonsense way in the Senate and \ntell the American people we are going to stop wasting $4.2 billion a \nyear for this completely unauthorized purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would point out to my colleagues how \nmuch $4 billion is. It is a matter that we deal with on a regular basis \naround here. It is a number that has come up several times recently.\n  For example, we had a shortfall in our plans to fund the Federal \nhighway program--a deeply disappointing event that we couldn't get that \nbill passed. It started out as a $4 billion shortfall. They worked that \nnumber down, but it is still not fully paid for. We would like just a \nfew billion dollars to pay for the bill, and it hasn't been passed.\n  The student loan fixed rate where the interest rates would be \ndropped--if I am not mistaken, that was $4 billion. We need it to \nreduce interest rates on student loans. That is $4 billion, according \nto the IG, going out of our country wrongfully every year that we could \nsave.\n  The President spent a lot of time traveling around the country saying \nwe should raise taxes on the rich and we should pass the Buffett tax. \nHe had a proposal for the Buffett tax. How much would the Buffett tax \nraise? It would raise $4 billion. That is how much closing this \nloophole would raise. Frankly, I am a little disappointed that the \nTreasury Department officials and the administration itself haven't \nimmediately seized upon this loophole that is costing the taxpayers \nlarge amounts of money and responded themselves by sending legislation \nover and asking us to pass it. Why aren't they asking us to pass it to \nbegin with? Well, the inspector general, who is an independent--who \ngets a little independence within the Department of Treasury but, in \nfact, is an employee of the Secretary of the Treasury--he says we need \nthis legislation. Quoting his report:\n\n       Clarification to the law is needed to address whether or \n     not refundable tax credits such as ACTC may be paid to those \n     who are not authorized to work in the United States.\n\n  Well, of course they ought not to be getting a check from the U.S. \ntaxpayers if they are not authorized to be working here.\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\n  So as the ranking member on the Budget Committee, knowing how tight \nour budget is, I salute Senator Vitter for doing it this year as well \nas last year when he saw this problem and attempted to get it passed. I \nam pleased the House has passed it. I think if we keep working at it, I \nsay to Senator Vitter, maybe we can get it done in the Senate, \nremembering that $10 million a day is going out of the country for \nevery day we fail to act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to thank very much my colleague \nfrom Alabama for his leadership on the Budget Committee and his \nleadership on issues such as this. I want to encourage the \ndistinguished majority leader to look at the actual details of the \nproblem and this legislation. When he does, he will see that this \nlegislation is very finely tuned to the actual problem, and it is an \noutrageous problem.\n  There has been quite a bit of media attention on this abuse over the \nlast several months. A lot of it came out of Indiana. A tax preparer \nthere brought cases in Indiana and said he got no response from the IRS \nwhen he tried to report completely fraudulent returns using fake income \nand documents. He pointed to a number of actual tax forms in which \nillegal aliens were exploiting this. He said: ``I can bring out stacks \nand stacks. It is just so easy, it is ridiculous.''\n  An illegal alien who was actually interviewed admitted in another \ncase that his address was used by four other illegal aliens who didn't \neven live there. All told, they claimed 20 children were living in one \ntrailer, and they received checks from the government through this \nprogram totaling over $29,000. Only one child was ever observed at that \nmobile home. Twenty other children who live in Mexico have never even \nvisited the United States.\n  Again, let's not make a simple fix overly complicated because it is \nnot. This is an outrageous abuse. The Obama administration Treasury \nDepartment has said so. They have endorsed this fix. The House has \npassed this fix. Let us in the Senate pass this fix on a bipartisan \nbasis and save the American taxpayer $4.2 billion each and every year.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, to conclude, I think the American people \nare unhappy with their leaders. They feel as though the money they have \nsent here is not being well spent, is not being watched closely enough. \nWe have a big judicial conference for the second year--since 2010, the \nsecond time--to go spend $1 million on a resort conference in Maui. We \nhave the Solyndra loans going out to cronies that are not being paid \nback in any way. We have the General Services Administration having a \nbig party out in Las Vegas with hot tubs and magicians and so forth. We \nhave no budget for three consecutive years in the U.S. Senate. And what \nare we hearing from many of our leaders here in Washington? Well, we \nhave a problem, American people. We have too big a debt. Send us more \nmoney. Send more money. We don't have enough. We are borrowing 40 cents \nof every dollar we spend. Send more money.\n  I think the American people are tired of hearing that. I think they \nhave a right to be tired of hearing that. Until this country is willing \nto face up to saving $10 million a day on this kind of manipulation \nthat has been going on since 2007, at least, and has been raised by the \ninspector general since 2009, until those kinds of things are stopped, \nI don't think they should send any more money to Washington. We need to \nhonor the money they are sending.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                        tribute to thomas hudner\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a \nhistoric ceremony that took place in Boston Harbor--the birthplace of \nthe American Revolution--this very morning.\n  This morning, the United States Navy named an Arleigh Burke class \nguided-missile destroyer for retired United States Navy Captain Thomas \nJerome Hudner, Jr., of Concord, MA. The ceremony took place aboard the \noldest commissioned warship in our United States Navy, the USS \nConstitution.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, it is a distinct honor for any \nservice member to have a Navy vessel commissioned in his or her name. \nWhat made the event today extremely rare is that Captain Hudner is the \nNavy's last living Medal of Honor recipient from the Korean War.\n  As the story my colleagues are about to hear shows, no one could be \nmore worthy of this distinction than Tom Hudner.\n  Tom is a native of Fall River, MA. He was a student at Phillips \nExeter Academy when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. As a leader on \nhis school's athletic fields and in its student government, naturally \nhe responded to the call to arms. And although World War II ended \nbefore his commissioning at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Hudner \nbegan a storied Navy career that would earn him our Nation's highest \nmilitary honor.\n  During his first few years in the Navy, Hudner served as a \ncommunications officer aboard various warships before being accepted to \nthe Navy's flight school in Corpus Christi, TX. After earning his wings \nof gold, Hudner became one of the ``Fighting Swordsmen'' of Strike \nFighter Squadron 32 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Leyte.\n  Just a few years after the racial integration of the U.S. military, \nHudner began flying alongside a young ensign named Jesse LeRoy Brown, \nthe Navy's first black pilot. Brown was born and raised in the \nsegregated, deep south town of Hattiesburg, MS, a world away from \nHudner's home in Fall River, MA.\n  In the summer of 1950, less than a year after Hudner finished flight \nschool, North Korean Communist forces invaded the Republic of Korea. \nWithin months, President Truman ordered the Leyte into action off the \ncoast of Korea where Hudner and his wingman, Jesse Brown, immediately \nbegan flying reconnaissance and attack sorties against Communist \npositions. Not long after their squadron joined the fight, Chinese \nforces invaded the Korean peninsula and threatened to overrun U.S. \npositions.\n  There are no routine missions in wartime, especially when flying \nclose air support over enemy positions. On the afternoon of December 4, \n1950, Hudner and Brown were on a mission to destroy enemy targets near \nthe Chosin Reservoir. About an hour into the mission, Brown's Corsair \nwas hit by enemy fire, began to lose fuel and he was forced to crash \nland his aircraft into a snowy mountainside.\n  The events that transpired over the next few hours became enshrined \nin the history of American Naval aviation.\n  Despite exposure to hostile ground fire, Hudner continued to make low \npasses over Brown, who was trapped in the wreckage of his destroyed \naircraft. When Hudner saw that his wingman's plane was burning, he \ndeliberately crash-landed his own aircraft, risking his life. And \nthough injured in the violent landing, Hudner ran to try to rescue \nBrown.\n  For Tom Hudner, never leaving your wingman was more than just a \nphrase he learned in flight training, it was a covenant. A short time \nlater a rescue helicopter pilot arrived, and both he and Hudner tried \nin vain to free Brown from the wreckage. With night falling and Ensign \nBrown lapsing in and out of consciousness, Hudner was finally forced to \nevacuate the bitter cold crash site. Brown's final words to Hudner were \nto tell his wife Daisy that he loved her. He would do that in person.\n  On April 13, 1951, Daisy Pearl Brown was in the audience when \nPresident Harry S. Truman presented Thomas Hudner with the Medal of \nHonor for his heroic attempt to save Ensign Brown.\n  Over the next two decades, Hudner continued to serve with distinction \nin the United States Navy. In addition to flying many of the Navy's \nnewest jet fighters, Hudner's career would take him from various ships \nand air bases where he served in positions of increasing \nresponsibility, including as executive officer of the USS Kitty Hawk \nduring the Vietnam War.\n  Hudner and Brown's wife Daisy remained friends, their lives \nintertwined by the events decades earlier on a snowy mountainside on \nthe other side of the globe. In fact, the two friends would stand \ntogether at another ceremony some 22 years later when the\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\nU.S. Navy commissioned the first American warship in honor of an \nAfrican American, the USS Jesse L. Brown.\n  Hudner retired from the U.S. Navy at the rank of captain in 1973, and \nwhile his day-to-day service in the military would end, he continued to \nserve his fellow veterans through the USO and a variety of veterans' \norganizations. In fact, for most of the 1990s, Hudner served as \ncommissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Today, the newly commissioned USS Thomas Hudner will serve as a \nliving legacy to heroism and service. Think about it for a moment. When \na sailor or Marine is assigned to this ship, they will proudly tell \ntheir family and friends about Hudner and Brown. When the Hudner makes \na port call, those in the communities it visits will see the ship in \nport and meet scores of crew members with ``USS Thomas Hudner'' \nstitched on their shoulder.\n  And when citizens around the world learn about Captain Hudner's \nspecific act that the Navy has described as ``conspicuous gallantry and \nintrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of \nduty,'' they will begin to understand what uncommon valor truly is. Tom \nHudner's story will serve as an inspiration to a future generation of \nAmericans.\n  Please allow me to thank Captain Hudner for his lifetime of \nexceptional service to our Nation and his dedication to his fellow \nveterans. I ask my colleagues and our Nation to join me in wishing him \nand his wife Georgia all the very best in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/22/senate-section/article/S3400-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nremain on the motion to proceed to S. 3187 until 4 p.m. today and that \nall other provisions under the previous order remain in effect at that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for \nbringing up this bill. He and the Republican leader have put on the \nfloor a piece of legislation that affects nearly every American family. \nThis will not have the fireworks some things we do have, because we \nhave a lot of agreement on it, which is one reason it is on the floor. \nIt has gone through the committee. Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi have \nworked carefully with all of the Republicans, all of the Democrats on \nthe committee, and many other people on a complex piece of legislation \nfor a year, to bring to the floor the Food and Drug Administration \nSafety and Innovation Act--a bill that is likely to succeed.\n  We take our medicines for granted. During the Civil War, the Capitol \nwas used as a hospital--this Capitol. Two thousand cots were set up in \nthe House and Senate Chambers and the Rotunda. The first group of \nwounded arrived from the Second Battle of Bull Run and later from \nAntietam in September of 1862. Those soldiers did not have the benefit \nof antibiotics or other modern medicines that we take for granted \ntoday, and that contributed to a horrible number of deaths in the Civil \nWar.\n  Still, as the 20th century dawned, disease cast a long shadow over \nthe United States of America. A child born in 1900 could expect to live \nan average of 47 years. Infectious diseases took many children before \nthey reached their teens. In 1900 pneumonia and influenza were the \nleading causes of death, followed by tuberculosis and diarrhea.\n  Physicians had few weapons to fight diseases. The medicines at the \ntime included such things as mercury for syphilis and ringworm; \ndigitalis and amyl nitrate for the heart; quinine for malaria; and \nplant-based purgatives. For most of human history, diabetes meant \ndeath, but insulin was introduced in 1923 commercially, and within a \nfew years enough insulin was being produced to meet the needs of \ndiabetes patients around the world.\n  It is hard to remember this, but vaccines began to be commercially \nproduced only during the time of World War I. It was not until the time \nof World War II that we saw the introduction of widespread and \neffective antimicrobial therapies with the development and mass \nproduction of penicillin. Since then, the sky has seemed to be the \nlimit.\n  Half of Americans take at least one prescription drug every day. One \nin six takes three or more. Many take over-the-counter medicines. It is \na real miracle what has happened in terms of our lives with the \nintroduction of medicines, and we rely upon the Food and Drug \nAdministration to keep those medicines safe and effective, which is \nwhat this legislation is about.\n  I would like to renew my compliments to Senator Harkin and Senator \nEnzi for bringing this bill to the floor in a condition where they have \nalready worked out most of the issues. This bill is complex. It is \nlong. It has 11 titles. It will help safe and effective drugs, medical \ndevices, and biosimilar products get to the market and, more \nimportantly, get them to the market more quickly so people who need \nhelp can use these medicines and devices.\n  We are reauthorizing two user fees. These things have absurd names. \nThe Prescription Drug User Fee Act is called PDUFA, and the Medical \nDevice User Fee Modernization Act is called MDUFMA. There are two new \nones, which are GDUFA and BSUFA. It is really absurd. I promise to \nnever again use those phrases for these user fee programs. But they are \ncritically important programs that give the Food and Drug \nAdministration needed resources to review new medically necessary \nproducts.\n  For example, there is the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. It \nis a part of what we are doing this week. I cosponsored it with \nSenators Reed of Rhode Island, Murray, and Roberts. I thank them for \nthe ability to work with them.\n  This makes permanent the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and \nthe Pediatric Research Equity Act. One is an incentive, and one \nrequires pharmaceutical companies under certain circumstances, when \nthey develop new drugs for adults, to figure out the effect that those \ndrugs will have on children. Too often, we do not know the answer to \nthat, and the drugs are either ineffective or can have bad results. It \nalso reauthorizes the Pediatric Medical Device and Safety and \nImprovements Act to promote pediatric medical device development.\n  Another critical part of the bill has to do with the medical device \napproval process. The United States is a world leader in medical \ndevices. In Tennessee we have lots of them, especially in Memphis. We \nneed to improve the regulatory process. There are many who believe the \nFDA is over-regulating medical devices. That has a negative effect on \nthe industry's ability to raise capital and create jobs. It does not \nmake those devices any safer in the United States than they are in \nEurope. This will help address those problems. For example, it will \nallow customization of medical devices for small populations--that \nmeans five people or fewer--without going through a very burdensome \napproval process, and it changes the humanitarian device exemption to \nencourage and incent the development of devices to treat patients with \nrare diseases--that would be groups of patients of fewer than 4,000 \npeople.\n  There is another problem that is addressed in this legislation. It is \nthe generation of antibiotics dealing with antibiotic resistance. We \nknow there is a growing problem with antibiotic resistance as bacteria \ncontinuously mutate and evolve in their resistance to the drugs and the \nmedicines we develop. While efforts have been made to preserve existing \nantibiotics, drug development has not kept up with the pace. These \nchanges will provide meaningful market incentives and reduce regulatory \nburdens.\n  In addition, I am very pleased with the results of our work in \ndealing with drug shortages. That is a part of this bill. It will give \nthe FDA additional tools to help prevent drug shortages and require FDA \nto look internally at\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\nregulations to see if the FDA is making the problem worse.\n  Senator Casey and I worked together on a review of Federal \ninitiatives to combat prescription drug abuse and to issue a report on \nthose. Tennessee, my State, ranks second in the Nation for prescription \ndrug use. Our Governor, Bill Haslam, and our legislature took action \nthis year to deal with that. We intend to help them.\n  In closing, I would like to commend Senators Harkin and Enzi. I see \nthe Senator from Washington on the floor. I do not want to take much \nmore time because I know she is about to speak. She has been integrally \ninvolved in the development of this legislation over the last year, \nespecially the Better Pharmaceuticals and Devices for Children Act. I \nmentioned that a little earlier. It incentivizes drug manufacturers to \nstudy their products and how they affect children, and in return, they \nget to keep the exclusive use of those products for a little \nwhile longer. That means they do not go to generic quite as quickly. \nThat has been tried in this legislation since it was first authorized \nand reauthorized and reauthorized. It has worked. It has been a very \ngood example of an innovation in legislation that has achieved the \ndesired result.\n\n  The Pediatric Research Equity Act gives the FDA authority to require \npediatric studies in some cases and the Pediatric Medical Device Safety \nand Improvement Act promotes the development of pediatric medical \ndevices.\n  So the importance of the legislation is it takes a big step forward \nin making it clear what drugs that are created for adults will do when \noffered or provided to children. Currently, just under half of the \ndrugs prescribed to children have been studied and labeled for \nchildren, but that is a significant improvement over where we were when \nthese programs started fifteen years ago. Children's bodies react very \ndifferently to medicines. Children are not just small adults. Sometimes \nside effects are different. Physicians have to guess what dosages are \nappropriate, whether a therapy that might be effective for an adult is \nalso effective for a child. Sometimes there are examples of overdosing \nor previously unknown side effects. In one case in Tennessee in 1999, \nseven babies were prescribed an antibiotic to treat whooping cough. \nThey became so seriously ill, they needed stomach surgery. The CDC--\nCenters for Disease Control--later linked their illness to the \nantibiotic, which had never been tested in young children. Children \ndiffer widely in sizes and growth rates, so for medical devices doctors \nmust either `jerry-rig' devices or be forced to use a more invasive \ntreatment.\n  Prior to the passage of these laws that we are working on today, and \nreauthorizing, 80 percent of drugs used for children were used off-\nlabel; that is, we did not really know how they affected children. Now \nwe can use those drugs--half of our drugs today--safely and effectively \nbecause we do know that. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act is \nthe carrot that FDA uses to encourage pediatric studies, while the \nPediatric Research Equity Act is the stick to mandate studies. Together \nthese two laws have been a success. According to the Institute of \nMedicine, as of October 2010, the FDA has approved 425 labeling changes \nas a result of studies or analyses done under these laws. In 1975, only \nabout 20 percent of drugs prescribed to children had been studied and \nlabeled for children, in 2007 that number had risen to about one-third, \nand today it is roughly half.\n  The Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act was enacted \nin 2007 to encourage manufacturers to bring more pediatric devices to \nthe market and strengthen FDA post-market surveillance of devices used \nin children. This law allows manufacturers to profit under the \nhumanitarian device exemption for devices specifically designed to meet \na pediatric need affecting fewer than 4,000 children per year. In \naddition to three humanitarian device exemption pediatric products, GAO \nreports that 15 new devices have been approved for children since 2007.\n  I am happy to come here today to join with Senator Murray, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Enzi, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, and Senator Roberts \nto offer what I believe is a piece of legislation that affects nearly \nevery American family. It takes one more step in the dramatic story of \nhow we have gone from a country with almost no medicines to a country \nin which almost everyone takes some medicine and a situation where the \nlifetime of the average American has increased from 47 years of age to \n78 years--its present level today.\n  I see the Senator from Washington on the floor. I wish to recognize \nand thank her for her leadership on the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I too wish to thank the Senator from \nTennessee, as he referred to how we are working together on a \nbipartisan basis on the Better Pharmaceuticals and Devices for Children \nAct--a very critical piece of this legislation that I will talk about \nin just a few minutes as well. But I would like to thank him for \nworking with us, and really I want to thank all of the Senators who \nworked very hard on this piece of legislation, working with \nstakeholders and advocates for over a year on the bill that will be on \nthe floor later this afternoon. I commend Chairman Harkin as well as \nRanking Member Enzi for working together in a bipartisan fashion to get \nthis to the floor today.\n  I hope all of our colleagues really understand the critical \nimportance of moving forward with this bill as efficiently as possible \nbecause, as many people know, if we do not make this legislation a \npriority, by the end of September over 2,000 employees at the Food and \nDrug Administration are going to be sent packing with pink slips. But \nwhat is just as important, if not more important, is that failure to \npass this legislation will put drug and medical device approval at a \nstandstill. That will not only halt innovation but it will put the \nlives of many Americans at risk while they wait for potentially \nlifesaving medicine.\n  No one knows the importance of that more than Seattle Genetics, a \ncompany in my home State of Washington. In August of last year, Seattle \nGenetics received FDA accelerated approval of a drug intended to treat \nHodgkin's lymphoma, the first of its kind approved by the FDA in more \nthan 30 years.\n  As a biotech company, Seattle Genetics' relationship with the FDA was \nreally vital to the work they were doing to bring this drug to patients \nwho were in need. Ultimately, Seattle Genetics received FDA approval 11 \ndays earlier than expected, and that meant they were able to anticipate \nthe timing of its approval, organize their sales teams, and ship the \nfirst business day following approval for a patient already waiting for \nthat critical drug. That kind of collaboration would not have been \npossible had the FDA lacked the resources necessary to make it a \nreality.\n  I believe that Clay Siegall, who is the president and CEO of Seattle \nGenetics, was truly able to underscore the issue of what we are \ndiscussing here today. I want to tell you what he said.\n\n       It is only through working with an FDA--that has the \n     resources and dedication to achieve thorough and timely \n     reviews--that we are able to fulfill our promise to improve \n     the lives of people through innovation. Passage of this bill \n     helps to provide both the resources and incentives for FDA to \n     rapidly review and approve important therapeutic \n     breakthroughs for patients in need.\n\n  That highlights the importance of this legislation.\n  I also wish to highlight another part of this bill that I have been \nvery focused on, as the Senator from Tennessee just talked about, and \nthat is the need to make sure drugs and medical devices are \nspecifically tested and labeled and proven to be safe and effective for \nour children. This is so important for families and doctors across \nAmerica.\n  I really want to thank Chairman Harkin as well as Ranking Member Enzi \nfor including my bill, the Better Pharmaceuticals and Devices for \nChildren Act, in the broader legislation we are considering here today.\n  I was very proud to work with Senator Alexander, along with Senators \nReed and Roberts, to put together this commonsense legislation. This \nbipartisan language will make sure our children are prioritized in the \ndrug development process and that drug labels provide clear, detailed \ninformation about the proper use and dosage of medications for \nchildren. It will give parents and doctors more information, and it \nwill make sure the key programs\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\nwe count on to protect our children do not expire. It will push to make \nsure children are never just an afterthought when it comes to the \nsafety and effectiveness of our Nation's drugs and medical devices.\n  Mr. President, as you have heard today, this is a bill that has \nreceived bipartisan support. I commend all of the Senators who have \nworked on it in a bipartisan way. We don't get credit for that enough \nin this country. But this is certainly one where everybody came \ntogether and worked together in committee. This bill holds the \nlivelihood of so many Americans in its balance.\n  I urge the Senate to move forward quickly and support the legislation \nand get it passed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             the dream act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 11 years ago, I introduced the DREAM Act, \nwhich is legislation that would allow a select group of immigrant \nstudents with great potential to contribute more fully to America.\n  The DREAM Act is not an amnesty bill. It would give students a chance \nto earn legal status in America, and there are standards they would \nhave to live up to: No. 1, they came to the United States as children; \nNo. 2, they have been long-term U.S. residents; No. 3, they have good \nmoral character; No. 4, they have graduated from high school; No. 5, \nthey either serve in America's military or complete 2 years of college.\n  The DREAM Act also includes important restrictions to prevent abuse. \nUnder the DREAM Act, no one would be eligible for Pell grants or any \nother Federal grants when they go to school. Individuals who commit \nfraud under the DREAM Act, who lie, misrepresent their status, would be \nsubject to tough fines and criminal penalties, including a prison \nsentence of up to 2 years. It is serious. No one would be eligible for \nthe DREAM Act unless they arrived in the United States at least 5 years \nbefore the bill becomes a law. There is no exception and no waiver for \nthis requirement.\n  My colleague from Florida, Senator Marco Rubio, on the Republican \nside of the aisle, said in a recent speech that the DREAM Act is not an \nimmigration issue, it is a humanitarian issue. I might add that I think \nit is an issue of justice.\n  Thousands of immigrant students in the United States were brought \nhere as children. They didn't make a decision at the age of 2 to come \nto America. It was not their decision to come here, but they grew up \nhere, went to school here, and they stood in classrooms across America \npledging allegiance to the only flag they ever knew. They sang ``The \nStar-Spangled Banner'' before baseball and football games, believing \nthey were part of America.\n  The fundamental premise of the DREAM Act is that we should not punish \nchildren for their parents' actions. It is not the American way. \nInstead, the DREAM Act says to these students that we are going to give \nthem a chance. These Dreamers, as I have come to know them, don't want \na free pass. They just want a chance to earn their place in America. \nThat is what the DREAM Act would give them.\n  The DREAM Act isn't just the right thing to do, it would make America \na stronger country by giving these talented young people the chance to \nserve in our military and contribute to our future. Tens of thousands \nof highly qualified, well-educated young people would enlist in the \nArmed Forces. That is why we end up with the support of people such as \nGeneral Colin Powell, who has given his life to the military and the \nsecurity of America. He says the DREAM Act is the right thing to do for \nthe future of America.\n  Studies have found that DREAM Act participants would contribute \nliterally trillions of dollars to the U.S. economy during their working \nlives.\n  One might wonder how an idea like that ends up becoming a bill and \nbeing debated not only on the floor of the Senate and the House but \nbecoming a subject of debate in the Presidential contest now going on. \nIt started with a phone call to my office about 11 years ago from a \nwoman named Duffy Adelson. Duffy is the director of the Merit music \nprogram in Chicago. The Merit music program is an amazing program which \noffers to children in the public schools of Chicago an opportunity to \nlearn to play a musical instrument. That program goes to the poorest \nschools and asks children if they are interested, if they would like to \nhave an instrument and a chance to learn. Children sign up and amazing \nthings happen. These kids--100 percent of them--end up in college. That \nis what that one life experience of learning to play music can do.\n  She called me about a young girl. She was a Korean who had been \nbrought to America at the age of 2. Her mother and father became \ncitizens. Her two siblings, a brother and a sister, were born here and \nwere automatically citizens, but she was not. She joined the Merit \nmusic program and turned out to be an accomplished pianist, to the \npoint where, when she was graduating high school, she was being offered \nscholarships to the best music academies in the United States.\n\n  When her mom sat down with her to fill out the application, there was \na little box that said ``citizenship.'' She turned to her mom and said: \nSo what do I put there? Her mom said: I brought you here at the age of \n2 on a visitor's visa, and since you were a little baby, I didn't file \nany more papers. I don't know what you should put there. The girl said, \nWhat are we going to do? Her mom said: We are going to call Durbin.\n  So they called me and my office checked the law and the law turned \nout to be pretty harsh. The law said this 18-year-old girl--who had \nnever lived, to her knowledge, in any other place but America--had to \nleave America for 10 years and then apply to come back. That didn't \nseem right. She came here at the age of 2. She had done nothing wrong. \nSo I introduced the DREAM Act.\n  Well, here is the rest of the story about this young lady, whose name \nis Teresa Lee. Teresa Lee did go to the Manhattan School of Music, and \nwhen she went there she turned out to be as good as the Merit music \nprogram thought she would be. She progressed to the point where she \nliterally played in Carnegie Hall. She found a young man, fell in love, \ngot married, and she became a citizen by virtue of that marriage. She \nis now working toward her PhD in music. She is a brilliant young woman.\n  There was a talent that would have been lost to us and lost to the \nfuture if we had followed the strict standards of the law at that \nmoment. But we didn't. We gave her a chance and she proved herself. She \nproved she is a quality individual.\n  When I introduced the DREAM Act, it was a bipartisan bill. There were \nRepublican Senators who actually debated as to who was going to be the \nlead sponsor of the bill because they thought it was such a good idea. \nThe DREAM Act has had a history of broad bipartisan support. When I \nintroduced it with Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, he was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and was the lead Republican sponsor. When the \nRepublicans controlled the Senate, the DREAM Act was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee on a 16-to-3 bipartisan vote. And on May 25, 2006, \n6 years ago this week, the DREAM Act passed the Republican-controlled \nSenate on a 62-to-36 vote as part of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  That bill, unfortunately, did not pass, and, unfortunately, the \nRepublican support for the DREAM Act has diminished over the years. The \nlast time the DREAM Act was considered on the floor of the Senate in \n2010, the bill had already passed the House and received a strong \nmajority vote there, but only eight Republicans supported it in the \nHouse and only three Republicans in the Senate. A bill which had been \nso bipartisan and so popular was now becoming, each time we called it \nup for a vote, more partisan. The bill hasn't changed, but politics had \nchanged.\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\n  The vast majority of Democrats in the House and Senate continue to \nsupport the DREAM Act. But the reality is we cannot pass the bill \nwithout substantial support from my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. That is why I have always said I am open to working with \nanyone--Republican or Democrat--who is interested in working in good \nfaith to solve this problem. I will never close the door on the \npossibility of providing assistance to these DREAM Act students.\n  I have come to the floor almost every week for the last several years \nto tell the story of another young person who would qualify under the \nDREAM Act. Today I want to tell you the story of Sahid Limon. Sahid was \nbrought to the United States from Bangladesh in 1991 at the age of 9. \nHe grew up in Durham, NC. His dream was to become a doctor. He attended \nSouthern High School--a prestigious magnet school for young people \ninterested in health care. He was a member of the National Honor \nSociety and won his high school's Diamond in the Rough Scholarship \naward. One of Sahid's teachers said:\n\n       In the classroom, he was kind, very respectful, and \n     responsible. He showed great interest in a career in \n     medicine. In the medical community, through shadowing \n     experiences, he was professional, highly motivated, and \n     caring with patients.\n\n  Sahid didn't learn about his immigration status until his senior year \nin high school. He went on to graduate from East Carolina University \nwith a bachelor's of science in biology, with a concentration in \nmicrobiology. And understand, he didn't qualify for any Federal loans \nor any Federal grants. It wasn't easy to get through college under \nthose circumstances.\n  During college, Sahid volunteered at underserved rural areas in North \nCarolina and it made a big impression on him. In his application for \nmedical school, he wrote:\n\n       I was surprised to see that so many people would line up \n     during a cold winter morning, just to know if they were \n     healthy or not. Seeing their dedication and patience \n     influences me every day to work my hardest in order to meet \n     my personal goal of becoming an exceptional physician.\n\n  That was 7 years ago--2005. Today, Sahid is 30 years old. He has been \nunable to attend medical school because of his immigration status. \nSince he graduated from college, he has volunteered with a health \nclinic in Raleigh that serves low-income patients, he has tutored \nelementary school students to help develop their interests in science, \nbut his personal dream of becoming a doctor has not become a reality.\n  Some of my colleagues have criticized the DREAM Act because people \nunder the age of 35 are eligible. They say only children should be \neligible for the DREAM Act. But this ignores the obvious. Every year we \nwait, those children grow a year older. In order to qualify for the \nDREAM Act, an individual must have come to the United States as a \nchild, as Sahid did. Today he is 30. That doesn't change the fact he \nwas brought here when he was 9 years old. It doesn't change the fact he \nhas lived in the United States virtually all his life. And it doesn't \nchange the fact he should not be punished for the choices his parents \nmade. Sahid was 19 years old when the DREAM Act was first introduced. \nWhy should he be penalized because I can't pass the bill? I keep \ntrying, but Congress doesn't get it done. Does that mean his life \nshould be wasted?\n  Last year, Sahid was arrested by immigration agents and placed in \ndeportation proceedings, despite the fact he has lived in the United \nStates for 21 years, since he was 9 years old. He was held in a county \njail with violent criminals. Sahid has never committed a crime in his \nlife. Sahid sent me a letter, and here is what he said about the \nexperience of being in jail and facing deportation:\n\n       I lived my life by the law, did everything by the books, \n     never committed any crime, and somehow ended up in jail for \n     something I had no control over as a child. What would I do \n     if I was sent back [to Bangladesh]? I barely speak the \n     language, and I don't know how to read or write. How am I \n     supposed to start my life from scratch in such a place \n     without the knowledge of the language or the culture?\n\n  Well, my office learned about Sahid's case. We contacted Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement and asked them to consider his request that his \ndeportation be placed on hold. The Obama administration placed a stay \non his deportation proceedings. However, it is only temporary. \nIt doesn't give him permanent legal status, and he is still at risk of \nbeing deported sometime in the future. The only way for Sahid to be \npermitted to stay in the United States permanently is for us to do \nsomething to pass the DREAM Act--to change the law.\n\n  In his letter to me, Sahid explained what the DREAM Act meant to him:\n\n       The DREAM Act means being able to be home. Regardless of \n     where we go . . . we all yearn to come back to our home. To \n     me, North Carolina is that home . . . I watched live on C \n     SPAN [in 2010] as the bill passed the House, but failed to \n     pass the Senate. To most of the Senators, it's just another \n     bill that was rejected. However, to someone like me, whose \n     life not only depends on something so crucial, but my future \n     literally hangs in line, it's absolutely devastating to \n     witness such a rejection. I hope this is the year that \n     politics is set aside, and all of the representatives can \n     work together for a solution.\n\n  Sahid is right. Those of us who are fortunate enough to serve in \nCongress have an obligation to set politics and party aside and do the \nright thing. This isn't a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. We \nare going to be a stronger and better country if we give Sahid a chance \nto earn his way to American citizenship.\n  This is not just one example, one person. There are literally \nthousands like him waiting for their chance. The DREAM Act would give \nSahid and other bright, accomplished, and ambitious young people like \nhim the opportunity to become tomorrow's doctors and engineers, \nteachers and soldiers. Today I ask my colleagues again, as I have so \nmany times before, to support the DREAM Act. Let's give Sahid and so \nmany other young people like him the chance to contribute more fully to \nthe country they call home. It is the right thing to do, and it will \nmake America a stronger Nation.\n\n\n                    Financial Regulation and Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, we were given a cautionary \nlesson about the need to ensure that our Nation's banks are carefully \nregulated. We are still learning the details about the $2 billion bad \nbet made by banking giant JP Morgan Chase. But what we have learned is \ndisturbing. Apparently, the London office of this Wall Street giant \ncrafted a credit derivative trading strategy that spun out of control \nover the course of 6 weeks. At the center of the strategy was one \nsingle trader who was nicknamed ``the London whale.'' One trader, 6 \nweeks, $2 billion gone.\n  It is not clear how widely the repercussions of this trading loss \nwill extend, but this incident clearly is an important reminder to all \nof us that we cannot afford to take a hands-off regulatory approach to \nthe giant financial institutions on Wall Street. These institutions \ndrove this Nation to the brink of economic disaster just a few years \nago. If they are simply left to their own devices, it could easily \nhappen again.\n  We need reasonable financial regulation that will ensure \ntransparency, competition, and choice. We need to prevent Wall Street \nbanks from fixing the rules and setting up rigged schemes that line \ntheir own pockets and hang Main Street America out to dry.\n  Two years ago, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This legislation \ntook on the challenge of placing a reasonable regulatory framework on \nWall Street. It is a tough challenge. Wall Street and the banking \nindustry have enormous resources and enormous power, and they are not \nafraid to use it--not only on Wall Street but on Capitol Hill.\n  In the days to come, we are going to see important regulatory efforts \nproceed on issues such as the Volcker rule, which deals with the big \nbanks' ability to make bets with their customers' money. It is \nimportant we pursue this regulatory effort diligently. We cannot let \nthe big banks use their threats and scare tactics to water down reform \nand to preserve business as usual. There is too much at stake.\n  I want to talk today about another part of the Wall Street reform \nthat passed 2 years ago, a provision that the big banks hate as much as \nany other. I am talking about the provision I wrote dealing with \ninterchange fees, or swipe fees. The swipe fee is a fee that a bank \nreceives from a merchant, like a restaurant or a retailer, when the \nmerchant accepts a credit or debit card\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\nissued by the bank. That fee is taken out of the transaction amount. If \nyour bill is $50 at the restaurant, that includes the fee the \nrestaurant is paying to the bank and credit card company called the \nswipe fee--the interchange fee.\n  The vast majority of bank fees are very transparent and competitive. \nChase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and the rest set their own fee \nrates and compete for business based on the fees they charge. But that \nis not the case with these swipe fees--the interchange fees--that \naffect credit and debit cards. The big banks know competition and \ntransparency help keep fees at a reasonable level, and make it harder \nto make big money off of fees. That is why they set up the swipe \nsystem--the interchange system--to avoid competition and transparency.\n  The big banks decided, rather than each of them setting their own \nswipe fees, they would designate two giant card companies--Visa and \nMasterCard--to set the fees for all of them. That way, each bank could \nget the same high fee on a card transaction. No competition. Then the \nbanks buried this swipe fee under layers of complexity within debit and \ncredit transactions. Most consumers, and even most merchants, still \nhave no idea how much they are being charged on a swipe fee.\n  This system helped the card-issuing banks do very well over the last \n20 years. U.S. swipe fee rates became the highest in the world, and \nthey kept going up even as the cost of processing transactions went \ndown. Debit swipe fees alone--just debit cards--brought the banks over \n$16 billion in the year 2009. That is the interchange fee paid by the \nmerchants--and ultimately by the consumer--to the banks and credit card \ncompanies when people use a debit card.\n  Of course, banks don't need all this debit swipe fee money to conduct \ndebit transactions. The actual cost of a transaction is very low, a few \ncents. But the banks, looking for more revenue, exploited the swipe fee \nsystem to charge far more than they could ever justify. It doesn't have \nto be this way. Many other countries--Canada, European countries, and \nothers--have vibrant debit card systems with swipe fees strictly \nregulated or prohibited altogether. In the United States, debit swipe \nfees used to be tiny, until Visa took over the debit card market in the \nmid 1990s using tactics that I think bordered on violations of \nantitrust.\n  By 2010, the U.S. swipe fee system was growing out of control, with \nno end in sight. There were no market forces serving to keep fees at a \nreasonable level. Merchants and their customers were being forced to \nsubsidize billions in windfalls to the big banks. That is when I \nintroduced an amendment to the Wall Street reform bill that, for the \nfirst time, placed reasonable regulation on swipe fees on debit cards.\n  The reason I picked debit cards is--some of us are old enough to \nremember something called a checking account. Those checking accounts \nare still around, but checks are becoming rare. Most people do their \nchecking transactions with a piece of plastic called a debit card. The \nmoney comes directly out of their bank accounts just as the check \nremoved money directly from their bank accounts. That is why the debit \ncard is a different transaction than the credit card.\n  My amendment said if the Nation's biggest banks are going to let Visa \nand MasterCard fix swipe fees for them, then the rates must be \nreasonable and proportional to the cost of processing the transaction. \nThere would be no more unreasonably high debit swipe fees for big \nbanks.\n  My amendment also included a nonexclusivity provision which aimed to \nstop Visa from taking over the debit card market entirely. This \nprovision says there needs to be a real choice of card networks--real \ncompetition.\n  The regulatory steps my amendment proposed were modest. Most other \ncountries have gone a lot further in regulating their credit and debit \nsystems. But if you have listened to the banking industry and card \ncompanies, you would have thought my amendment would be the end of the \nworld as we know it. They made outrageous claims, that regulation and \nswipe fees could kill the debit card system, devastate small and \ncommunity banks, and particularly be an end to credit unions and cause \nbanks to raise their fees on customers.\n  My amendment passed the Senate with 64 votes and was signed into law, \nand it has been 8 months since the swipe fee reform took effect. It \nturns out all the scary scenarios threatened by the banks have not come \nto pass.\n  First, the banks claimed it was impossible for Visa and MasterCard to \nestablish a new tier of regulated swipe fee rates. As it turned out, \ncreating this two-tier system was easy. There were already hundreds of \nrate tiers, so adding another one wasn't difficult.\n  The banks then claimed that small banks and credit unions would be \nhurt by reform--even though all institutions with assets of less than \n$10 billion were exempt. As it turned out, small banks, community \nbanks, and credit unions have actually thrived since this reform took \neffect. Why? Because under my amendment, small banks and credit unions \ncan continue to receive high interchange fees from Visa and \nMasterCard--higher than the big banks that control about 60 percent of \nthe issuer market. And, those big banks have been so heavy-handed in \ntheir response to swipe reform that they have driven their customers--\nmany of them--straight into the arms of the community banks and credit \nunions.\n  Credit unions in particular are flourishing after the passage of \nswipe fee reform--a reform which they actively opposed. Last year, 1.3 \nmillion Americans opened new credit union accounts. That was up from \n600,000 the year before. More than twice as many people as before \nopened credit union accounts, and credit unions now have a record \nnumber of members across the Nation--almost 92 million overall. So much \nfor the prophecy by the credit unions that this change in the law would \nbe the end of them. It has turned out to be the best thing that has \never happened to them.\n  I know the Washington lobbyists for the small banks and credit unions \nstill like to complain about this reform. These lobbyists have spent so \nmuch time fighting reform they are just not going to change their \npositions. But the facts are clear--if they will just be honest enough \nto admit it. Small institutions have thrived since this reform took \neffect.\n  How about consumers? The big banks tried last year to recoup their \nreduced swipe fees by charging $5 monthly debit fees on their \ncardholders. Do you remember that? Do you remember when Bank of America \nsaid it was going to go up to $5? Do you remember what they said all \nacross the nation? Bye-bye, Bank of America. We will go somewhere else. \nWithin a matter of a month or two Bank of America backed off of it.\n  Finally, consumers were coming alive. They were awakened to the \nreality that they could shop too. This is a free market--underline the \nword ``free.'' If you don't like the way your bank or any institution \nis treating you, go shopping. That is part of America. The banks had \nnever run into that before. People just waited, unfortunately, for the \nlatest fee increase. People don't wait around anymore. They pick up and \nmove.\n  Unlike swipe fees, the big banks' $5 debit fees were transparent and \ncustomers had a range of competitors to choose from. So they moved. \nTransparency and competition worked.\n  Consumers are also benefitting from savings passed along by \nmerchants. After swipe fee reform took effect in October, we saw a \nmassive level of retailer discounting that extended beyond the usual \nholiday season discounts. According to USA Today--an article from May \n11--a number of individual merchants are offering debit card discounts \nfor items such as gas, furniture, and clothing.\n  USA Today also pointed out that despite the banks' threats, free \nchecking accounts for consumers have not disappeared. USA Today \nreported that in the second half of 2011, 39 percent of banks offered \nchecking accounts with no monthly maintenance fee, up from 35 percent \nfor the first half of the year. Also, of those banks that charge \nchecking maintenance fees, the average fee fell in the second half.\n  This is what is known as competition. What is wrong with that? That \nAmerican families and consumers go shopping for the best bank deal. It \nis happening because swipe fee reform has created new competition. I \nthink competition is a good thing.\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\n  It is important to note that the savings of swipe fee reform to \nmerchants and consumers actually should be even greater than it is. \nWhen the Federal Reserve was writing its rule to implement my \namendment, the banks lobbied them to set a swipe fee cap at a level \nsignificantly higher than the 12 cents that the Fed established in its \ndraft rulemaking. Predictably, Visa, MasterCard, and the big banks took \nadvantage of this watered-down regulation they had lobbied for. Visa \nand MasterCard promptly jacked up their swipe fees to the 24-cent \nceiling set by the Fed.\n  Here is what has happened. Swipe fees have traditionally been charged \nas a percentage of the transaction amount plus a small flat fee. This \nmeant the small dollar transactions used to incur fees of much less \nthan 24 cents. Now, with Visa and MasterCard's rate increases, \nbusinesses that primarily deal with smaller transactions--coffee shops, \nfast-food restaurants--are paying far more in swipe fees than they did \nbefore.\n  This is not a flaw in the law we passed, which wisely required \nreasonable and proportional fees. Rather, it shows the danger of \nwatering down the regulations to implement the law. The banks and card \ncompanies lobbied the Federal Reserve for a loophole which they \nimmediately raced through. This is something we need to fix going \nforward. It can be fixed.\n  I am pleased the modest swipe fee reform we enacted in 2010 is off to \na good solid start: more competition, customers and families moving \nacross America for the best treatment they can receive from their bank \nor their credit union. But already the big banks and card companies are \nplotting to undo all these reforms and get that money back, the \nbillions of dollars which they were taking in under the unregulated \nswipe fee regime. Visa, in particular, has crafted new fee schemes in \nits continuing effort to monopolize the debit card market. In fact, \nVisa recently disclosed that the U.S. Justice Department has opened a \nnew antitrust investigation into anti-competitive aspects of Visa's \nnewest fees.\n  I continue to be concerned that the giant card companies--\nparticularly Visa--are becoming too big and too powerful. These \ncompanies have gained an enormous amount of control over the way \nAmericans can use their money. They set up the fee systems, they \ndictate the security standards, and they make a fortune by taking a cut \nout of every transaction they handle, far beyond the cost of \nprocessing. There is no regulatory agency that directly supervises the \nactions of these card companies, and we can't afford to simply trust \nthese companies to do what is in our Nation's best interest or to watch \nout for consumers.\n  That, again, is why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created \nby the Dodd-Frank law is such a critically important agency. It is \nvirtually the only agency at the highest levels of our government that \nis solely devoted to consumer protection when it comes to financial \nproducts.\n  In the weeks and months to come, I will continue to work to ensure \nthat the debit and credit card systems have competition, transparency, \nand choice, and that there is a framework for reasonable regulation. I \nknow the big banks and card companies are going to continue to fight \nit. They have a lot of money on the table. But I believe reasonable \nregulation is the right way to move forward, and I will continue to \nwork for it. Our economy, our small banks, our credit unions, our \nmerchants, and our consumers are benefitting from this important change \nin the law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am on the floor this afternoon to \ndiscuss a discovery--really, a stunning discovery for me--and that is \nimportant for all of us.\n  As many people know, Congress and the President struck a deal last \nsummer to raise the debt ceiling. That deal set in place discretionary \nspending caps--not nearly enough to balance our budget over 10 years \nbut a step in the right direction. That legislation said we will raise \nthe debt ceiling $2.1 trillion but we will cut spending $2.1 trillion \nover 10 years--a promise to cut spending over 10 years.\n  That legislation also required the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee--of which I am the ranking member--by April 15 of this year \nto file aggregate spending levels--spending limits--based on the \nCongressional Budget Office's March 2012 financial baseline and to \nallocate the funds that could be spent under that Budget Control Act \nlegislation to each of the Senate Appropriations Committees. In other \nwords, these levels as submitted tell the appropriators how much they \ncan spend, and the budget chairman has that responsibility and duty to \ndo that. He takes the level agreement that was agreed to and sends that \nover.\n  These are real dollars that each appropriating committee is therefore \nallowed to spend. Yet we have learned something that is disappointing--\nreally astounding to me. The numbers filed by Chairman Conrad, my good \nfriend who is a fair and able chairman, are not, in fact, the spending \nlevels from the CBO baseline as the statute sets forward. Instead, the \ndiscretionary outlay total submitted by the chairman to the committees \nfor fiscal year 2013 is derived from the President's budget, not from \nthe CBO baseline.\n  The discretionary spending allocation for the Senate is therefore \ninflated by about $14 billion more than what was agreed to just last \nAugust when we told the American people we would raise the debt \nceiling, continue to borrow money, but we were going to reduce \nspending.\n  So let me repeat that. These allocation levels have been inflated by \n$14 billion to match the President's budget--not the CBO base line that \nthe BCA Committee was working from. It raises outlay levels over that \nAugust agreement. That, I submit, was a solemn agreement between the \nMembers of Congress, both the Senate and the House, the American \npeople, and the President himself who signed that agreement.\n  So I have sent a letter to Chairman Conrad urging my chairman to \ncorrect and refile numbers that are proper--numbers that comply with \nthe law.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter that I \nhave written Senator Conrad today.\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2012.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conrad: Section 106 of the Budget Control Act \n     (BCA) requires the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the \n     Budget to file allocations and aggregate spending levels that \n     are consistent with the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO's) \n     March 2012 baseline. On March 20, 2012, you filed such levels \n     in the Senate to be printed in the Congressional Record (at \n     pages S1832 S1833).\n       I was therefore surprised to find that the filed outlay \n     aggregate for fiscal year 2013 is not consistent with CBO's \n     baseline but, instead, appears to reflect the higher outlay \n     level for discretionary spending in the President's budget \n     request (as estimated by CBO). The President's blueprint was \n     voted down unanimously by the Senate.\n       Specifically, the filed outlay aggregate for fiscal year \n     2013 is approximately $14 billion higher than CBO's baseline \n     figure. The aggregate on-budget outlay level filed with the \n     Senate is $2,944,872 million, but the CBO baseline for on-\n     budget outlays is only $2,931,228 million. The filed figure, \n     therefore, does not satisfy section 106 of the BCA.\n       Furthermore, section 106(b)(2)(B) of the BCA requires that \n     the mandatory spending allocations to Senate authorizing \n     committees be consistent with the CBO baseline. The CBO March \n     2012 baseline amount for the Committee on Finance for fiscal \n     year 2013 is $1,328,395 million. But the allocation filed on \n     March 20 ($1,328,474 million) is $79 million higher than the \n     CBO baseline figure.\n       Before the Senate takes up appropriation bills for fiscal \n     year 2013, I request that you review your allocations and re-\n     file the enforceable levels and related committee allocations \n     at amounts that are consistent with CBO's March 2012 \n     baseline, as required by the BCA.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Jeff Sessions,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is unthinkable that we would not only spend more \nthan Congress agreed to but would institute instead the numbers derived \nfrom President Obama's budget--which, in this Chamber, when I brought \nit up a few days ago, was rejected unanimously. This is another \nexample, I am afraid I have to say, of the sleight-of-hand tactics that \nhave been utilized in this Congress for too long that say we have an \nagreement and we are going to do better and we are going\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\nto spend less. But as soon as the ink is dry--before the ink is dry, \nreally, on the agreements, people start manipulating ways around it \ntrying to spend more than the allowed. It seems to me, since I have \nbeen in the Senate for 15, 16 years, we have Members of Congress who \ntake it as a personal challenge to see how they can defeat, get around, \nand spend more money than they are allocated.\n  The American people are being misled in this attempt. We are not \nfollowing the Budget Control Act, and it is not a partisan matter. It \nis about honest accounting. It is about safeguarding the American \ntreasury. It is about restoring faith in the Senate Chamber. The \nAmerican people are right to be angry with us and to not trust us \nbecause we haven't honored their trust. We haven't managed their money \nwell. Political elites remain totally disconnected from the financial \nreality that our country faces.\n  Game the system, spend more. The alarming discovery that the \ndiscretionary allocations filed for the Senate are a total of $14 \nbillion higher than we agreed to and the latest in a long line of \nepisodes, this is the latest in a long line of episodes that \nunderscores the financial chaos that is the American Government.\n  These episodes include the GSA scandal in Las Vegas, with hot tubs \nand skits and magicians; the Solyndra loan, $500 million to cronies for \nan ideological vision that did not work; the IRS checks I talked about \nearlier this morning, with Senator Vitter, given to illegal aliens who \nclaim dependents living abroad. These are people here illegally \nclaiming dependents abroad while the U.S. Government is sending them \nchecks based on children who are not in the country. The inspector \ngeneral from the IRS says this is costing the taxpayers $4 billion a \nyear.\n  It also includes the revelation that the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals will spend $1 million or more of taxpayer money for a decadent \ngetaway to a beachfront resort and spa in the Hawaiian tropics. And, of \ncourse, it includes a 3-year refusal of the Senate majority to produce \na budget plan--3 years without a budget.\n  We are badly in need of strong Executive leadership to put our \nfinances in order. We need a President, Cabinet heads, sub-Cabinet \nheads who understand from the top to the bottom that they are there \nevery day to look for ways to save money. This immigration tax scam \ncosts the American taxpayers $10 million a day. Divide that out, $4 \nbillion over 365 days. The House has passed legislation that would \nclose that gaping loophole. Meanwhile, the Senate is not acting.\n  This chaos cannot continue. Accountability and discipline must be \nachieved, and the first step to right the ship ought to be actually \ncorrecting these allocations. I call on my Senate leadership friends to \ndo that. We need an honest accounting. We need to spend what we agreed \nto, what was passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the \nPresident. These dollars do not belong to us, they belong to the \nAmerican people. They must be protected. Each one of them is precious. \nEach one of them was extracted from some hard-working American and sent \nto Washington on the hope and the prayer that it would be wisely spent. \nAnd we do not have enough of them. We do not have enough money.\n  To stealthily increase discretionary outlays by $14 billion in one \nfell swoop is unacceptable. It must be corrected. I call on my \ncolleagues to do so, else we will continue to lose the confidence of \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    National Flood Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the National Flood \nInsurance Program, which is a program we are now trying to reauthorize \nin the Senate. Senators Johnson and Shelby have shepherded this bill \nthrough the Banking Committee. I have a ton of respect for both of \nthose Senators and the work of the Banking Committee because they \nworked very hard to get it to the floor, to get it ready. In fact, it \nexpires on May 31. If for some reason we cannot work out something here \nin the next couple of days, I sincerely hope we will extend this on at \nleast a short-term basis--for another, say, 30 days--to give us time to \nwork this out. The National Flood Insurance Program is too important to \nmortgages and commercial real estate, et cetera, to let it lapse. If we \ncannot work it out, I hope we can get a 30-day extension. I support \nthat effort.\n  We need to reauthorize this legislation, this program, but we need to \ndo it in the right way. Several Senators over the course of the last \nfew months have stated objections to S. 1940. Here are mine. I have \nlisted some of mine in a letter we sent to the chairman and ranking \nmember last month or so--November 15, 2011. We listed several \nobjections and concerns we had with the bill. There were 13 Senators \nfrom 9 States who signed this letter going to Senators Johnson and \nShelby. Again, we appreciate their efforts, but we have to do this the \nright way.\n  Let me run through three or four or five of my concerns about this \nlegislation and tell my colleagues why I cannot support it in its \ncurrent form and why I do support an extension but why, in the end, if \nthe bill stays the way it is now, I cannot support it. I hope many of \nmy colleagues will join me in the effort of not supporting this \nlegislation as it is currently drafted.\n  Let me start with the bill itself, S. 1940. The primary objection I \nhave is in section 107 of the legislation. It is titled ``Mandatory \nCoverage Areas.'' Basically what it does is it redefines ``special \nflood hazard areas.'' This may not sound very exciting or very fun to \npeople, but this is critically important.\n  I am showing a map here on the floor today. All of these counties in \nthe dark green--there are 881 counties total that have levees in their \ncounties. To my understanding, well over 50 percent of the U.S. \npopulation lives somewhere near a levee. They may not realize it \nbecause the levees work and they don't have floods, but if you see this \nmap, you can see the levees all over the country. If you are a Senator \nrepresenting one of those States, I strongly encourage you and your \nstaff to look at section 107 of the legislation.\n  Here is part of it, 107(b):\n\n       Residual Risk Areas--The regulations required by subsection \n     (a) shall require the expansion of areas of special flood \n     hazards to include areas of residual risk that are located \n     behind levees or near dams or other flood control structures, \n     as determined by the Administrator.\n\n  Subsection (c) says:\n\n       Mandatory Participation in National Flood Insurance \n     Program--\n       (c)(1) In General--Any area described in subsection (b) \n     [the one I just read] shall be subject to the mandatory \n     purchase requirements. . . .\n\n  Then go down to (c)(3):\n\n       In carrying out the mandatory purchase requirement under \n     paragraph (1), the Administrator shall ensure that the price \n     of flood insurance policies in areas of residual risk \n     accurately reflects the level of flood protection provided by \n     any levee, dam, or other flood control structure in such \n     area, regardless of the certification status of the flood \n     control structure.\n\n  So regardless of whether these levees and dams are certified--in many \ncases by the Corps of Engineers, in other cases by private engineering \nfirms--regardless of whether they are certified, the people behind \nthose levees are going to be required to purchase flood insurance.\n  Let me read that one more time:\n\n       The regulations required by subsection (a) shall require \n     [there is no wiggle room there] the expansion of areas of \n     special flood hazards to include [these] areas. . . .\n\n  This is a great expansion of this program. I want to talk about the \nexpansion in just a moment, but let me say that the folks in these \nareas--I know it is certainly true in my State of Arkansas--the people \nin these areas currently pay for flood protection. In most cases, what \nthey do is, through some sort of local levy or local tax--it is \ndifferent in different places, but somehow, someway, they pay to build \nand maintain these levees. They are paying out of their pockets right \nnow to make sure they do not get flooded. What this bill does and what \nFEMA would do under this bill--they would be required to do it, \nwouldn't have any wiggle room--what they would be required to do is \nmake them pay again; not only have to pay for their own levee, they \nhave to pay for flood insurance for floods that will never happen in \ntheir\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\nareas because these levees are certified. Again, this is 881 counties, \n50 percent of the U.S. population.\n\n  Over half the counties in Arkansas have levees. There are over 1,200 \ndams in our State. I don't have the number of dams for everybody all \nover the country, but it is over 1,200 in my State, so you can multiply \nthat over how many dams you might think there are in the United States. \nIt is a huge number, and it will affect over half the people in the \nUnited States.\n  I mentioned that these folks are already paying for their own flood \nprotection through local levies. Now, also, according to this law, they \nare going to have to pay for insurance. In addition to that, to rub \nsalt in the wounds, what they are going to have to do is their local \ncounties are going to have to pass an ordinance that FEMA has written \nand it is going to restrict the land use. In many cases, that ordinance \nwill diminish the property values, diminish the ability for them to do \neconomic development in their communities.\n  If we can just take one example of something that happened last year, \nlast year we had terrible flooding in the midsection of the country. \nMany of you remember that. The Corps of Engineers ended up having to \nblow the levee at Bird's Point. That is part of the Corps of Engineers' \nMississippi River and tributary system.\n  By the way, we have to thank the Corps of Engineers and praise them \nfor the engineering they have done on the river. I know there have been \na few problems over the years. Some obviously happened in Katrina. But \noverall the Corps of Engineers designed things that work. Certainly \nwhen you look at last year, the 2011 flood of last year, in the \nMississippi River, one of the longest rivers in the world, certainly \nthe longest in North America, there was more water that flowed through \nthe gauging stations from Cairo, IL, to Natchez, MS, than in any flood \nin recorded history. The flow at Cairo, IL--the confluence of the \nMississippi and the Ohio--was over 2 million cubic feet per second. \nThat was running through the Mississippi River right there. At Helena, \nAR, it was running at 2.3 million cubic feet per second.\n  In some locations--the Corps of Engineers is in the process of \ndetermining this; they are not ready to say it yet--in some locations \nup and down the Mississippi River system, they are considering whether \nthis actually was not a 100-year flood or 250-year flood, this was \nactually a 500-year flood, the largest flood in history.\n  All of this Mississippi River--MR, we call it, Mississippi River \nand tributary system--all that has cost our taxpayers $32 billion since \nits inception, but just in the flood last year, it saved taxpayers $110 \nbillion in damages. That is a great return on investment. We need to \nhonor that return on investment. We need to not charge people \nadditional flood insurance for areas that do not flood. They maybe had \nthe 500-year flood up and down the Mississippi or maybe in certain \nparts of it, and there was not 1 acre of ground that went underwater. \nIt was a new flood of record. Ten million acres of land were protected, \n1 million structures were protected, and, again, it prevented $110 \nbillion of property damage. There were no lives lost, and not 1 acre \nwas flooded. The system worked exactly according to plan.\n  Now this bill comes in and says: Well, even though we just had the \n250-year or the 500-year flood, still we want to make all these people \nup and down the Mississippi in all these counties--not all the people \nbut in certain parts of these counties, depending on what the flood \nmaps say--we want to require them to pay for flood insurance when it is \nnever going to flood there.\n  I want my colleagues to know that this provision, section 107 in the \nSenate bill, is not in the House bill. I think the reason it is not--I \ncan't speak for the House, of course, but I think the reason it is not \nis for the reasons I am saying right here. We know it is not going to \nflood in these areas. This is the Corps of Engineers. This is the best \nlevee system in the world, and it is keeping these folks safe and dry \nwhen the floods come.\n\n  Also, I wanted to say the House does not have section 107 in their \nbill. It never did. There is a House amendment offered by Congressman \nCardoza who took out a requirement to show these areas are on their \nmaps, and that vote passed 261 to 163. So not only can we get \nconsistent with the House because we can get rid of section 107, but we \ncan also get rid of other specific parts of this legislation that will \nbe more consistent with the House.\n  Here is a map of the Mississippi River, the area I am talking about. \nWe can see the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, \nMissouri, and a little bit of Kentucky and Illinois is in there as \nwell. But this large blue area is what they call the historic \nfloodplain. Before man came, before people started building levees, \nbefore they started draining swamps and trying to manage the land, this \nis the area that would flood.\n  One thing important to know about this is that a lot of this area in \nlight blue has some of the richest farmland in the world. The reason it \nis so rich is that for centuries or eons or however long it was, this \nriver would flood periodically and put this very rich soil out there. \nThat is one reason why in this part of the country they can grow almost \nanything. That soil is great.\n  This is a huge industry for the area, and it is important we keep it \ngoing. It is also critically important for U.S. trade and the U.S. \neconomy. This is the breadbasket, so to speak, of the United States \nright here. We have that area growing food and fiber for everyone. It \nis critical we keep that going.\n  Once the Corps of Engineers gets control of the Mississippi River--\nthis is what it looks like now when it floods. This is now the \nfloodplain. If you go back to last year when it flooded so badly, this \nis what it looked like, with one exception; they blew out this one \nlittle area in Birds Point to give a little bit of relief. Again, that \nwas by design and that worked.\n  The first problem I have with the bill is section 107. Another \nproblem is the general expansion of what this bill does to the National \nFlood Insurance Program. One of the things buried in the bill that a \nlot of people may not see is in section 118. Section 118 talks about \nhow the Administrator needs to establish an ongoing program under which \nthey review and update and maintain National Flood Insurance Program \nrate maps in accordance with this section, et cetera, et cetera. Then \nthey go down their criteria of what they need to look at.\n  It says here ``all populated areas and areas of possible population \ngrowth located not within''--not the 100-year floodplain. The current \nlaw is the 100-year floodplain. What this plan says is the 500-year \nfloodplain. We don't have a map of that because the Corps of Engineers \nhas not finished mapping and FEMA has not accepted all the maps yet. We \ndon't know exactly what that is going to look like, but I am going to \nsay it is going to look something like this here. It is a good bet that \na lot of people in this light blue area are going to have flood \ninsurance.\n  Based on the flood we had last year, they are never going to get \nflooded, not in 100 years, and certainly not in 500 years. They are not \ngoing to get flooded, but this says they must purchase flood insurance. \nThis is a huge expansion of the program. It has a big impact not just \non homeowners, which is obviously very important. They are not going to \nbe able to get a mortgage if they are in a floodplain.\n  What this law says in the committee report is that notice will be \nprovided to property owners in the 500-year floodplain to inform them \nof their flood risks, which may lead to more owners protecting their \nproperty through flood insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would ask to have 5 more minutes to wrap \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, what this says in the committee report is \nthat the 500-year flood notation should be sent out to everyone so \neveryone knows this property is in a 500-year floodplain. The problem \nis folks are not going to be able to get mortgage insurance, they are \nnot going to be able to do real estate development; commercial real \nestate is going to hurt from that. They are not going to be able to \nhave economic development projects in these areas because of the \nfloodplain notation.\n  Also on page 8 of the committee report it talks about how they are \ngoing to spend about $400 million annually in\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\ndoing this mapping. Well, if they are going to map out the 500-year \nfloodplain, that is a lot more map than the 100-year floodplain. They \ncan save quite a bit of money by doing that.\n  The bottom line is these levees are designed correctly, they are \nbuilt correctly, they are maintained correctly, and they are certified \nthat they are safe. What is the point of people having to get flood \ninsurance in that area when it is not required right now?\n  I also think this legislation requires a huge conflict of interest \nfor FEMA. It is not FEMA's fault; they are not asking for this. It is \nwhat the Congress is trying to do. Basically under this law FEMA would \nwrite the regs, they will draw the lines, they will control the timing, \nthey will set the standards, they will update the maps, they will \nmaintain the maps. If there is an appeal, they would have to go to \nFEMA. They also set the rates, they collect the money, and they spend \nthe money. Everything is done by FEMA.\n  Obviously FEMA is going to have an interest to make sure this program \nis adequately solvent and funded, and obviously they should. They have \ncontrol of every aspect of this, with no checks and balances in the \nsystem. There are going to be millions of people who will pay in to \nmake this solvent, I guess, but it will never need flood insurance.\n  With that, I wish to say I hope my colleagues who represent these \nStates, when they look at section 107, will see what I see and we can \nall work together to either take out section 107 completely or get the \n30-day extension so we can have time to take it out in the next few \ndays.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader be recognized at 4 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be \nplaced in the appropriate place in the Record and that I be permitted \nto finish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Fiscal Policy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we find ourselves in the midst of a \nPresidential election. In years past it might be expected that during a \nPresidential election, politics would take precedent over policy. That \nis not right then and it is certainly not right now. Our Nation faces \nserious problems--immediate problems--and we cannot wait to tackle them \nuntil after the election.\n  We are over $15.7 trillion in debt, and before the end of the year it \nwill be over $16 trillion. We have a Tax Code that is unmanageable and \na burden on conscientious taxpayers. If the Congress and the President \nfail to act, we have a tax increase coming next year that will dwarf \nany in our Nation's history. We cannot afford to wait another 7 months \nto get our fiscal house in order, and we need to act now.\n  President Obama at least claims to understand that we cannot wait to \naddress this fiscal crisis. He remarked recently that the fact this is \nan election year is not an excuse for inaction. Unfortunately, other \nthan talk, the President and his liberal allies have done nothing to \naddress either our rising debt or the fiscal cliff we are quickly \napproaching, both of which are significantly hindering our economic \nrecovery and job growth.\n  Last week President Obama's budget received zero votes in the Senate. \nFor the second year in a row every Republican and every Democrat who \nvoted on the President's budget voted against it. Remarkably, not one \nDemocrat voted for the serious Republican budgets offered by my friend \nChairman Paul Ryan, and my friends and colleagues Senators Toomey, \nPaul, and Lee.\n  While he talks a big game, President Obama has shown little interest \nin lighting a meaningful path toward balancing the budget, reforming \nthe Tax Code, and reducing the tax burden on working families and small \nbusinesses.\n  Instead, President Obama seems to have a single-minded focus on his \nreelection. While he attempts to scare up votes in swing States, \nAmericans across the country are suffering due to President Obama's \nfailed economic policies. The people of Utah and the people across the \ncountry are naturally growing restless. They look to Europe and see the \nconsequences of out-of-control spending and taxes. Yet even with the \nexample of Europe, the President and his friends resist meaningful \nspending cuts at every turn, and his liberal allies have done \neverything they can to mislead the public about the responsible \nintentions of Republicans to reduce wasteful government spending.\n  Just as critical for our economy is the President's failure to do \nanything to address the tax relief that will expire at the end of this \nyear. If the President allows current tax relief to expire, the result \nwill be at least a $4 trillion tax increase on the American people. We \ncan call this a fiscal cliff; we can call it ``taxmageddon,'' as others \nhave done. Whatever you call it, it will be a disaster for the middle \nclass. It will be a disaster for small businesses that will be the \nengine of our economic recovery. One thing we hear time and time again \nfrom businesses is that uncertainty holds them back from investing, \nexpanding, and hiring. A robust recovery will require permanent \nprogrowth tax policy.\n  Given the continued jobs recession and weak economic growth, we need \nthose policies now. Economic growth slowed to 2.2 percent last quarter. \nFor 39 consecutive months the unemployment rate has remained above 8 \npercent, but that only tells part of the story. There are 12.5 million \nAmericans unemployed, and of those more than 5.1 million workers have \nbeen looking for work for 27 weeks or more. There are 7.9 million \nAmericans who are working part time for economic reasons, and another \n2.4 million have only a marginal attachment to the labor force. Close \nto 2 million college graduates are unemployed.\n  Growth slowed to a tepid 2.2-percent rate in the first quarter, and \nwe already saw business cut back investment as business investment \nspending declined 2.1 percent in the quarter. Yet the President and his \nDemocratic allies seem content even in this environment to sit on the \nsidelines as ``taxmageddon'' approaches and threatens even greater harm \nto our economy.\n  The coming tax increases will be, without any exaggeration, the \nlargest tax increases in American history, and the possibility of these \ntax increases is creating enormous uncertainty. The so-called business \ntax extenders expired at the end of 2011. Will there be an R tax \ncredit in 2012? Will there be an exception from subpart F for active \nfinancing income after 2011? Families and businesses do not know if the \n2001 and 2003 tax relief will be extended beyond 2012. That creates \ntremendous uncertainty for anyone planning on buying a home, saving for \ncollege, investing in a new business, or hiring a new worker. Will \npassthrough organizations be taxed at 35 percent or 39.6 percent? Will \ndividends be taxed at 15 percent or will dividends be taxed at 39.6 \npercent, as President Obama has proposed? Will there be a death tax \nthat hits family businesses and farms with a maximum rate of 55 \npercent, or of 35 percent, or something else? What will happen to the \nalternative minimum tax? Will it be patched? Will it be reformed? Will \nit be repealed? Will it be replaced with higher taxes somewhere else?\n  The President and the Senate Democratic leadership have shown no \nwillingness to answer these questions and provide the certainty our \neconomy craves. The adverse impact of these tax increases on economic \ngrowth is unquestioned. But don't take my word for it. It has been \nreported that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently discussed \nwith Senate Democrats the significance of ``taxmageddon.''\n  In short, the coming tax increases will be so large that Chairman \nBernanke apparently warned that monetary policy would not be capable of \noffsetting the resulting decline in economic growth.\n  Last month the Fed's policy-setting committee repeatedly warned in \nminutes of their meeting that fiscal uncertainty has negative effects \non consumer and business sentiment, on household spending, durable \ngoods, business capital expenditures, and on hiring.\n  The former Director of President Obama's Office of Management and \nBudget concluded that what he estimates to be a $500 billion tax \nincrease\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\nwould be so large that ``the economy could be thrown back into a \nrecession.''\n  According to Barclay's Capital, this fiscal cliff could reduce our \nGDP by 3 percent.\n  In addition to these looming tax hikes, budget cuts from the \nsequester that followed from the administration's failure to arrive at \na budget are set to hit as well. According to the magazine ``The \nEconomist,'' the Congressional Budget Office has found that the \ncombined effects of the sequester and the expiring tax relief would add \nup to 3.6 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2013. Federal Reserve Governor \nDuke has reportedly indicated that the combined impact of the expiring \nfiscal policies at the end of the year could amount to around 4 percent \nof the Nation's economy.\n  No economy can sustain such a hit without being hurled into \nrecession. Yet instead of addressing this fiscal cliff--tax increases \nthat will harm all of America's families--the President seems content \nto pursue misguided micropolicies that target the so-called rich in the \nname of so-called fairness.\n  I wish to make two points about the President's obsession with \nredistribution of wealth. First, the American people do not care. The \nAmerican people do not want government bureaucrats in Washington \nfiguring out who gets what. They don't want politicians spreading the \nwealth around. They don't want self-anointed arbiters of how much \nincome is fair. What they want is the opportunity that comes with \neconomic growth. They don't want a handout. They don't want their \nindustries vilified for engaging in free enterprise. They want a job. \nAnd nothing is more fair than giving every American the chance to make \nsomething of himself or herself. That requires Washington getting out \nof the way, not getting more involved.\n  Second, the American people seem to understand that the President's \npromise that he will only tax the rich is a sucker's bet. With his \nhealth care law, he already repeatedly broke his campaign promise not \nto raise taxes on families making less than $250,000 a year. The people \nof Utah, my home State, and the rest of the other States know that the \nDemocrats' thirst for more spending will require much more than taxes \non the wealthy. If President Obama and his Democratic allies get their \nway, all taxpayers are going to be looking at bigger tax bills.\n  President Clinton was honest on this point recently. He rejected \nPresident Obama's politically convenient claim that he would only tax \nthe rich, and called for across-the-board tax increases: This is just \nme now; I'm not speaking for the White House. I think you could tax me \nat 100 percent and you wouldn't balance the budget. We are all going to \nhave to contribute to this, and if middle-class people's wages were \ngoing up again, and we had some growth in the economy, I don't think \nthey would object to going back to tax rates from when I was President.\n  There we have it. Tax increases on everybody. President Clinton can \nclaim that he does not speak for the White House, but the American \npeople are not fooled. They see where the President's policies are \nleading. Our debt and deficits are unsustainable, but the President has \nshown no inclination to address them through spending reductions.\n  There is only one other option available to President Obama and it is \none that he and his party have shown to be their preferred policy for \ndecades: higher taxes to pay for more spending. Utahns and Americans \nall over the country know that the failure to address ``taxmageddon'' \nis a very real threat. We cannot put this discussion off any longer. It \nis time for our President to lead.\n  To that end, last week I, along with 40 of my Republican colleagues, \nsent a letter to our colleague and friend from Nevada, the Democratic \nleader, asking for him to address this fiscal cliff in short order. \nToday we received a response. I have to say I am disappointed. While \nthere is a great deal of political posturing about evil millionaires \nand big corporations as well as repeated attacks on the tea party and \nthe citizens who support its goals of smaller constitutional \ngovernment, there is no acknowledgment of the fiscal cliff we are fast \napproaching. This response seems to confirm what we already know: \nPresident Obama and his liberal allies would prefer to put off the \ndiscussion of this fiscal cliff. They do not want to address \n``taxmageddon.'' I am fairly certain their preference would be to get \nto the other side of the election and then have tax hikes set in not \nonly for their caricatured evil corporations and individuals but for \nthe middle class as well.\n  But I am confident that the markets and the American people are not \ngoing to allow this to happen. We cannot afford to delay action that \nwill prevent ``taxmageddon'' and steer us away from the coming fiscal \ncliff.\n  The likelihood of ``taxmageddon'' and the uncertainty it creates is \nan anchor around our economy. Americans young and old, unemployed and \nunderemployed, want this anchor thrown off now. We cannot wait until \nnext year or even a lameduck session. The economy is slowing, job \ngrowth is lagging, and businesses are cutting back investments. The \nuncertainty caused by ``taxmageddon'' is contributing to the lackluster \neconomic recovery. American families and businesses are not going to \ninvest in the future if the future holds a $310 billion tax increase \nnext year alone. The best thing we can do to jumpstart our economy is \nto turn the wheel away from the fiscal cliff sooner rather than later.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I note the majority leader has appeared on the floor and I \nbelieve he has a procedural motion. I yield to him.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend would complete his remarks.\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. Following the remarks of the Senator from Rhode Island, we \nwill go into a quorum call.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the statement of \nmy friend, the Senator from Rhode Island, a quorum call will be \ninitiated, and then I will be recognized for such time as we decide to \ncome out of the quorum call.\n  I see people shaking their heads. Here is the deal. Senator Reed is \ngoing to talk and put us into a quorum call, and when we come out of \nthat, I will be recognized. I ask unanimous consent to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act, which is pending before the \nSenate this week.\n  This legislation will give the FDA, through five agreements made \nbetween the agency and industry, the resources to approve additional \ndrugs and devices every year for their safe and effective use. Without \nthese agreements, the FDA, starting in October, would lack these \nresources which are necessary to approve new drugs and devices, and \nthey would also lack resources to monitor the safety and efficacy of \nthose drugs already on the market. This would result in a reversal of \ndecades of work modernizing our drug and device approval and safety \nprograms.\n  I am particularly pleased that for the first time, the generic \npharmaceutical industry will provide the agency with $1.5 billion over \n5 years for faster product reviews. In fact, the essence of the \nlegislation is that the industry is actually providing resources for \nthe monitoring and for the approval of drugs. Getting generic drugs \nonto the market sooner will help lower costs for individuals and \nfamilies as well as for the Federal and State governments.\n  This measure would also significantly improve FDA's regulatory \nauthority, including its ability to help prevent drug shortages and to \npartner with the private sector to develop new medications to treat \nlife-threatening diseases that have become resistant to antibiotics, \nwhich is a very important measure included within this legislation.\n  I wish to recognize especially Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi for \ntheir very thoughtful, very deliberative, and extremely important work. \nThey have represented through their committee work the model of what we \nshould be doing here collaboratively and on a bipartisan basis to \nadvance important measures for the American people. Both of them \ndeserve great accolades for their work today. I hope we can follow \nthrough and bring their work to conclusion.\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\n  I wish to particularly thank both of them, Chairman Harkin and \nSenator Enzi, for including provisions pertaining to pediatric drugs \nand devices that I authored along with my colleagues Senator Alexander, \nSenator Murray, and Senator Roberts, another bipartisan effort to \nimprove the health of children throughout this country.\n  Until 1997--15 years ago--80 percent of drugs were used off-label to \ntreat children. Doctors were treating children without fully \nunderstanding the appropriate dosage requirements or the potential for \nany dangerous side effects. This frustrated pediatricians and angered \nmany families, but those sentiments were largely ignored by the \nindustry until Congress stepped in.\n  With the passage of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act in 1997 \nand the Pediatric Research Equity Act in 2003, 427 drugs have been \nrelabeled with important pediatric information. Now 46 percent, rather \nthan 80 percent, of drugs are being used off-label in children, but \nthat number is still too high. The legislation before the Senate makes \ncritical improvements to these laws so we can further lower this \npercentage. It would make these two acts--BPCA and PREA--permanent, \nlike the laws that govern the approval of drugs for adults. It would \nalso provide the certainty that the pharmaceutical companies believe is \nnecessary to continue to wisely invest in the appropriate use of drugs \nin children.\n  The legislation will also help ensure pediatric studies are planned \nearlier in the drug development process and completed sooner. \nCurrently, a disappointing 78 percent of studies that were scheduled to \nbe completed by September 2007 are either late or were submitted late. \nWhile Congress, the FDA, advocates, and the industry agree that a \npediatric study should not hold up the approval for a drug for use in \nadults, drug companies should not be allowed to get away with \nsubmitting unrealistic study plans to the FDA for approval or failing \nto complete a required study once they are profiting from these drugs \non the market.\n  The legislation that is before us would also require pharmaceutical \ncompanies to work with the FDA early in the process of developing these \ndrugs to create a reasonable and sensible plan for studying the \nproducts in children. It would also, for the first time, provide FDA \nwith an enforcement tool that will deter companies from neglecting \ntheir obligation to complete these studies on time.\n  Our bill also responds to the need for pediatric medical devices--not \njust pharmaceuticals, but devices--in children, which can lag 5 to 10 \nyears behind those manufactured for adults. The pediatric profit \nallowance for Humanitarian Use Devices has proven to be a very \neffective incentive. Three new devices have been approved for their use \nin children in the last 3 years. This is an incredible increase as a \nresult of this incentive.\n  This policy has shown much promise and I am pleased to see it \ncontinue in this bill, along with the Pediatric Device Consortia Grant \nProgram, which has assisted the development of 135 proposed pediatric \nmedical devices in just over 2 years.\n  The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act would also \nextend this Humanitarian Use Device incentive to manufacturers of \ndevices for use in adults with rare conditions. While it is my hope \nthis policy is equally effective in spurring developmental devices for \nuse in adults as it is for children, I am concerned that it could \nimpact the development and the marketing of devices for use in \nchildren. I plan to monitor this policy closely should it become law, \nbut I have full expectations that both noble objectives can be \nachieved.\n  There are some children, however, who do not receive the full \nbenefits of BPCA and PREA.\n  I am pleased the Senate bill begins to address this problem for \npediatric cancer patients and children with other rare diseases. It \ncalls on the FDA to hold a public meeting to discuss ways to encourage \nthe development of new treatments for this population. Indeed, for some \npediatric cancers, the treatment has not changed in many decades. For \nother rare diseases, an effective treatment has yet to be found. I look \nforward to receiving a recommendation that might stem from this \nimportant meeting, as well as working with my colleagues to respond to \ntheir needs with reasonable and sensible policy.\n  I am truly pleased these pediatric provisions have drawn the support \nof 24 organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, also \nincluding the Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America. \nI think this stakeholder support is very important not only to the \nultimate passage of the legislation, but for its effective \nimplementation.\n  There is another provision I would like to talk about; that is, this \nbill contains provisions which would require the FDA to decide whether \nto update the labeling requirements for tanning beds.\n  Every day 2 million Americans visit a tanning salon. Seventy percent \nof these are women. According to the World Health Organization, the \nrisk of deadly melanoma increases by 75 percent when the use of tanning \ndevices begins before the age of 30.\n  So this is a particular concern with young women beginning to use--\nand younger men--beginning to use these tanning devices. Yet the \nwarning labels on tanning beds have not been updated in over three \ndecades and are often placed far from view.\n  In 2007 my colleague, Senator Isakson of Georgia, joined me in \nrequiring the FDA to study the labeling standards for tanning beds and \nmake recommendations about how these standards could be improved. In \nits report, the FDA found that tanning bed labels could be clarified \nand located in a more prominent location. But the agency has yet to \nact. It is my hope the FDA will heed its own advice and update the \nlabeling requirements for tanning beds.\n  Similar to the outdated labeling requirements for tanning beds, \nsunscreen testing and labeling standards have also been over three \ndecades in the making--three decades. Last year I was pleased when the \nFDA finally took action. However, just last week the agency announced \nit would be extending the implementation of these new standards by 6 \nmonths, until December. Consumers will have to go another summer \nwithout knowing whether they are truly protected from the Sun's harmful \nUVA and UVB rays.\n  I have filed an amendment to make sure there are no future delays. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to see that this amendment \nis accepted as part of the final FDA legislation which I hope is passed \nvery quickly by the Senate.\n  I again want to thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Enzi for their \nextraordinarily effective and collaborative work on the Better \nPharmaceuticals and Devices for Children Act, which is included in this \nbill.\n\n\n                      Student Loan Interest Rates\n\n  Mr. REED. Just for a moment, let me raise another pending issue which \nis of critical importance. In 40 days, as I think many of us recognize, \nstudent borrowing rates for college will double unless we act. We have \nseen both sides of the aisle--colleagues from both sides--come down and \nsay we cannot let this happen. Well, we cannot let it happen. That \nmeans we have to take action to prevent the doubling of interest rates \non Stafford loans.\n  Unfortunately, last week we had a series of budget votes, which most \nof my Republican colleagues supported, which would have, if they had \npassed, mandated the doubling of the student loan interest rate. So I \nthink we have to move away from this debate and actually pass \nlegislation which would prevent the doubling of student loans by July \n1. I hope we can do it promptly, certainly before July 1.\n  Also, I hope we find an effective offset. What the Republicans have \nsuggested is using the Prevention Fund. The President made it clear he \nwould veto the legislation if it included that offset. Also, what \nshould be clear that using resources to prevent disease is not only \nhelpful to the American public, but it is also probably one of the most \npractical ways we are going to be able to begin to bend that very \nimportant cost curve going forward.\n  This Prevention Fund is going to help everyone, but it is going to \nparticularly help middle-income families who are struggling with \nmedical bills, who are struggling to find insurance, the same families \nwho are struggling to pay the cost of college for their children. It \nmakes no sense to me to take from one program that will largely\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\nbenefit working families to pay for another program that will benefit \nworking families.\n  We have an offset which is an egregious tax loophole that allows \nlobbyists, financiers, et cetera, to create subchapter S corporations \nto essentially avoid their payroll and Medicare taxes. I think that is \nan appropriate way to pay for this support for students' education. If \nthere are other ways beyond the prevention fund, I certainly am happy \nto listen to them. If there are other principled ways to avoid doubling \nthe interest rate for student loans, let's talk about them. Let's get \nthem on the Senate floor and let's debate them.\n  I yield the floor\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that execution of \nthe previous order with respect to S. 3187 occur at 11 a.m. on \nWednesday, May 24, and that all other provisions under the previous \norder remain in effect at that time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as I sit here this afternoon, I hope I am \nnot disappointed, and I hope the Senate is not disappointed in not \nbeing able to finish this FDA bill. We are on the bill. I hope we can \nwork out some finite list of amendments. That would be the best thing \nto do for this bill.\n  So I just say to everyone, I hope we can do that. I do not want to \nhave to come here tomorrow and file cloture on the bill. But that is \nthe choice I will have. Or I can do this: Maybe what I might do is move \nto reconsider the student loan legislation. I have the ability to do \nthat at any time. So I might do that. We need to get this done.\n  Today is Tuesday. I just think it is unfortunate. There is an event \ntomorrow night that we cannot get out of. It has been longstanding for \nthe Senate and their spouses. So we do not have a lot of time.\n  So tomorrow morning, if we do not have something worked out, I think \nwe will have to do some other things and recognize that all the happy \ntalk on this bill may not come to be.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I wanted to speak about an amendment \nwhich I intend to offer once we do get on this Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act. This is an important \namendment. I want to advise my colleagues and all who are listening \nabout it so they can, hopefully, look into it and wind up supporting \nit.\n  This is an amendment that Senator Vitter has worked with me on, as \nwell as Senators Franken, Shaheen, Kohl, Tom Udall, Tim Johnson, \nKlobuchar, Merkley, Sanders, and Sherrod Brown. The amendment has the \nstrong support of many organizations that are focused on the cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  Here is a list: AARP, AFL CIO, Walmart, Families USA, Consumer \nFederation of America, U.S. PIRG, Consumers Union, Center for Medicare \nAdvocacy, AFSME, National Legislative Association on Prescription Drug \nPrices, the Alliance for Retired Americans, various other companies and \norganizations--the New Mexico Pharmacy Association strongly supports \nthis legislation.\n  This amendment addresses the root cause of anticompetitive, \nanticonsumer settlements that are entered into between brand-name and \ngeneric pharmaceutical manufacturing companies. The effect of these \nsettlements they enter into is to delay timely access that consumers \nwould have to generic drugs. This practice is commonly referred to as \npay for delay. It costs American consumers and it costs the Federal \nGovernment billions of dollars each year in higher drug costs.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission, in 2010, pay-for-delay \nagreements, limiting access to affordable generic drugs, protected $20 \nbillion in sales from brand-name pharmaceutical companies. That was at \nthe expense of consumers who would have been able to pay much less for \nthose same drugs.\n  Ensuring access to affordable medication is an essential aspect of \naddressing the growth in health care spending. Prices for brand-name \nprescription drugs have continued to outpace inflation, and overall \nspending on prescription drugs has also increased sharply. These \nstatistics are amazing to me. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that \nin 2008, spending in the United States for prescription drugs was \n$234.1 billion. That is nearly six times what it was in 1990.\n  Since generic drugs are, on average, one-fourth of the price of their \nbrand-name alternatives, they can be an important source of affordable \nprescription drugs for many Americans. But to actually achieve the \nsavings for consumers, those generics have to reach market in a timely \nmanner.\n  In 1984, Congress passed the bipartisan Hatch-Waxman Act to create \nmarket-based incentives for generic pharmaceutical companies to bring \ntheir drugs to market as quickly as possible. The express purpose of \nthat law was to incentivize early generic drug competition while \npreserving incentives for pioneer companies to develop innovative new \nmedicines. Instead, the pay-for-delay settlements that our amendment \ntries to address--these pay-for-delay settlements between brand-name \nand generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have become commonplace.\n  These settlements stifle competition. They delay access to generic \ndrugs at significant costs to consumers and to the Federal Government. \nIn these settlements, the first filer generic drug company agrees to \ndelay market entry in exchange for monetary or other rewards. This has \nthe effect of blocking all subsequent generic filers in coming to \nmarket.\n  This is a complicated issue. I would like to take a few minutes to \nexplain how these agreements work under existing law and also how our \namendment would solve this problem as we see it.\n  Under current law, first-to-file generic drug applicants are rewarded \nwith 180 days of market exclusivity. Exclusivity is awarded only to \ngeneric companies that are the first to file. It is not available to \nsubsequent filers even if they successfully invalidate a patent and are \nready to come to market immediately. So subsequent generic filers can \nonly enter the market after the first generic filer has enjoyed its 180 \ndays of market exclusivity.\n  So under the pay-for-delay settlements, the first filer generic \ncompany essentially parks its exclusivity; that is, it blocks all other \ngeneric manufacturers from coming to market until 6 months after the \nmarket entry date. This is true regardless of the strength of the \npatent or the readiness of subsequent generic filers to come to market.\n  So this means under pay-for-delay settlements, first filer generic \ncompanies receive a reward from brand-name companies for delaying \nmarket entry, usually a cash reward, a very substantial amount. They \nalso get a reward from the current statute, this 180-day exclusivity \nperiod, and brand-name companies get to extend their monopolies beyond \nwhat was originally intended under the Hatch-Waxman legislation.\n  Consumers are left footing the bill and left with no option but to \nbuy the more expensive drugs and to keep buying it, even after the \ngeneric should have come to market.\n  ``Pay for delay'' settlements also typically include an agreement \nthat the first-filer generic company can accelerate its entry into the \nmarket in the event that a subsequent filer invalidates the patent in \nquestion. In such cases, the subsequent filer triggers the first \nfiler's exclusivity. Put simply, there is no incentive for subsequent \ngeneric filers to fight to invalidate weak patents and come to market \nas soon as possible, even when they believe strongly that they would \nwin their case in court. In other words, whereas the original intent of \nHatch-Waxman was to reward companies that were the first to file and \nactually bring their drugs to market, currently the reward goes to the \nfirst company to submit the necessary paperwork. Bringing the generic \ndrug to market immediately has become an option that can be negotiated \naway.\n  To fix the ``pay for delay'' problem, the law needs to be changed so \nthat first filers who enter into ``pay for delay'' settlements can no \nlonger block generic subsequent filers who successfully challenge \npatents from entering the market and bringing affordable drugs to \nconsumers. The amendment we are offering provides this solution or this \nfix in the following three ways:\n  First of all, the amendment grants the right to share exclusivity to \nany\n\n[[Page S3412]]\n\ngeneric filer who wins a patent challenge in the district court. This \nmeans that if a subsequent filer successfully challenges a patent, even \nafter a first filer has entered into a ``pay for delay'' settlement \nwith a brand-name company, that subsequent filer has a right to share \nexclusivity with the first filer. This provision provides an incentive \nfor subsequent filers to challenge patents and stimulates competition.\n  Second, the amendment we are offering maximizes the incentive for all \ngeneric challengers to bring products to market at the earliest \npossible time by holding generic settlers to the deferred entry date \nagreed to in the settlements they have signed.\n  Third, our amendment creates more clarity regarding litigation risks \nby requiring brand-name companies to make a decision to litigate a \npatent challenge within the 45-day window provided for in the Hatch-\nWaxman Act. This ``use it or lose it'' provision enhances market \ncertainty by eliminating the option for brand names to litigate patent \nchallenges well after a generic has come to market.\n  Finally, I think it is important to point out that the amendment we \nare offering does not interfere with the rights of the parties to \nsettle their patent litigation if they choose to do so.\n  There have been numerous antitrust experts and consumer groups that \nhave identified the Hatch-Waxman Act's structural flaw--the one I have \nbeen describing here--as the source of the ``pay for delay'' problem \nand have called for a legislative solution. In addition, in 2003 \nSenator Hatch himself expressed concern that the flaw remained despite \nan attempt to fix it by including a ``use it or lose it'' provision in \nthe Medicaid Modernization Act of 2003. Senator Hatch emphasized that \nthe law should be changed to reward, and not penalize, generic \ncompanies that successfully invalidate a patent and are ready to come \nto market.\n  Let me further underscore the need for this amendment with some \nconcrete examples.\n  I have a chart here that I think will make the point I am trying to \nmake. This table shows three drugs included in ``pay for delay'' \nsettlements. And this is just three; there are many of these \nsettlements entered into each year. The delay to market in years for \neach of the three drugs--the three drugs are Altace, Lipitor, and \nProvigil--the delay period the settlements called for in one case is 2 \nyears; in another case 1\\1/2\\ years; and in the other 6 years. The \nestimated lost savings to consumers is here.\n  Let me describe each of these a little bit. The first drug is King \nPharmaceutical's Altace. A generic version of Altace was delayed for 2 \nyears at an estimated cost of $637 million to consumers under a ``pay \nfor delay'' settlement. In 2007, Lupin invalidated a patent covering \nAltace. Lupin could not launch, or bring their generic to market, \ndespite being the party responsible for invalidating the patent and \nopening the market early. Instead, the first filer, Cobalt, accelerated \nits entry into the market and benefited from 180 days of exclusivity. \nLupin was left with no reward despite the fact that they had been the \none that succeeded in the litigation to invalidate the patent.\n  The second is a cholesterol-lowering drug familiar to most of us. It \nis the best-selling pharmaceutical drug in the history of the world, \nLipitor. According to a 2008 New York Times report, Pfizer and generic \nmanufacturer Randbaxy Laboratories agreed to a settlement delaying \ngeneric entry into the market by 20 months. The same report stated that \nthe generic version of the drug was estimated to sell for less than \none-third of the cost of the brand-name Lipitor, which had earned $12.7 \nbillion in sales the year before. A letter sent to FDA Director Hamburg \nlast year by some of my colleagues in the Senate indicated that the \nFederal Government was spending $2.4 billion a year on Lipitor and that \na generic version was expected to generate $3.97 billion to $6.7 \nbillion in savings annually.\n  The final example on the chart here is Provigil, which is a sleep-\ndisorder drug, a generic version of which could have come to market as \nearly as December of 2006. However, due to ``pay for delay'' \nsettlements, a generic version of Provigil just entered the market this \nyear instead of in 2006.\n  In addition, in October 2011, a subsequent generic filer, Apotex, \ninvalidated a patent covering Provigil. Because the first filers in \nthis case settled their patent litigation with the brand company 6 \nyears prior, Apotex could not begin selling generic Provigil despite \nits court victory. Even the CEO of Cephalon, which is the brand-name \nmanufacturer of Provigil, is quoted as saying--this is the CEO of the \nbrand-name company--this:\n\n       We were able to get six more years of patent protection. \n     That's $4 billion in sales that no one expected.\n\n  In other words, the Provigil case represents 6 years and tens of \nmillions of dollars in lost savings to consumers. One of the largest of \nthose consumers is the U.S. military. As this chart illustrates, this \nis an estimate of the effect of this settlement--the so-called ``pay \nfor delay'' settlement--related to Provigil on the Department of \nDefense. Assuming that a generic version of Provigil would have been \nreleased in 2006 with expiration of exclusivity, the DOD would have \nsaved $159 million for this drug accessed by almost half a million \nsoldiers between the years 2006 and 2011. Had our amendment, the Fair \nGenerics Act, been the law--and we have introduced it as a stand-alone \nbill--had the Fair Generics Act been the law, generic versions of \nProvigil would very likely have been available 6 years ago. The first \nfilers, knowing that the patent was weak and that subsequent filers \ncould invalidate it and come to market themselves, would have fully \nprosecuted the patent fight instead of just settling it as they did.\n  As these examples illustrate, by granting shared exclusivity rights \nto any generic challenger that wins its patent case or is not sued by \nthe brand company, our amendment will end the ``pay for delay'' problem \nand move us closer to the original intent of Hatch-Waxman. That \noriginal intent was more competition, greater access to affordable \ndrugs, and substantial savings to the U.S. Government and American \nconsumers.\n  I hope that when we get the opportunity to offer this amendment and \nconsider it on the Senate floor and have a vote on it, my colleagues \nwill support this amendment. It will be a substantial step forward for \nAmerican consumers and will help us greatly in our effort to reduce the \ncost of prescription drugs for Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I am pleased that the \nSenate is moving this week to consider the FDA Safety and Innovation \nAct, which is a very important piece of legislation that will help \nensure Americans have access to save, innovative medical treatments by \ngiving the FDA the resources it needs to review new products as safely \nand quickly as possible, while also giving the industry that certainty \nit needs to continue investing in new research. As I travel around \nMassachusetts, the No. 1 issue I find is that lack of regulatory \ncertainty and sometimes tax certainty. This is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I am pleased that this legislation takes many steps to strengthen the \nmedical innovation industry in the United States. I have championed one \nsuch provision with Senators McCain and Casey that will smooth the \nregulatory path that I referenced earlier for new, moderate-risk \nmedical devices.\n  The underlying bill before us needs to be passed as quickly as \npossible to guarantee regulatory certainty at the FDA for the industry \nand its stakeholders.\n  However, I am disappointed the Senate has not yet taken time to \naddress a key area of concern related to this bill; that is, the new \nmedical device excise tax. The new 2.3 percent tax on medical device \nsales that was imposed in the Federal health care law will cost our \neconomy thousands of jobs and limit Americans' access to the most \ngroundbreaking, state-of-the-art medical devices which people need.\n  For the past 18 months, I have been pushing for the Senate to \nconsider a medical device tax repeal bill that I introduced in February \nof 2011--one of the first bills I introduced. Today I, along with \nothers, will be introducing an amendment to repeal this job-killing \ntax--a tax that will, in fact, drive up the cost of health care for \npatients and make our workers and our companies less competitive.\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\n  I can tell you that in Massachusetts we have over 400 medical device \ncompanies. We are an innovative State. We have the ability to have \ncompanies like these in Massachusetts, and they are employing nearly \n25,000 workers and contributing over $4 billion to our economy. That is \nobviously a substantial industry in Massachusetts. And it affects every \nperson throughout this country indirectly. If it goes into effect next \nyear, this harmful tax will put American workers at a competitive \ndisadvantage and chase jobs overseas. There are already companies, over \nthe last year and a half, that have been looking overseas and already \nshifting their strategy.\n  Where is that 2.3 percent tax coming from? It represents, in some \ninstances, the entire net profit for some young companies in \nMassachusetts and throughout the country. It will potentially cost \n43,000 jobs across the country, with a loss of $3.5 billion in wages. I \nam not quite sure how that makes sense in anybody's book. Massachusetts \nalone is expected to lose over 2,600 jobs as a direct result of this \ntax, and up to about 10 percent of our entire medical device \nmanufacturing workforce will be affected. The bottom line is that we \ncannot have this kind of job loss in any sector of our economy when we \nare still struggling. In Massachusetts, we have over 400 medical device \ncompanies. We do generate a tremendous amount of revenue--in the \nbillions of dollars. So where is this tax going to come from? Is it \nfrom R, from growth and expansion, hiring, firing? Where? Nobody \nseems to know.\n  I can tell you that the Massachusetts companies and companies \nthroughout the United States are deeply concerned about this. I find it \nsurprising and disappointing that there is not a consensus to repeal \nthe medical device excise tax which will affect States across this \ncountry. Whether it is on another bill or a stand-alone bill, we need \nto get it done the way we did, in a truly bipartisan, bicameral manner, \non the 3-percent withholding, the 1099 fix, the hire a veteran bill or \nthe insider trading bill. We have worked together in a bipartisan \nmanner to get things done. It matters a great deal to Massachusetts, \nand it should concern every Member of this body.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, dietary supplements have become a common \nhealth aid in medicine cabinets all across America. More than half of \nus in America use dietary supplements, including this Senator, who, for \na variety of reasons, takes a multivitamin tablet every morning. In \nspite of their popularity, many people would be surprised to learn the \nFood and Drug Administration doesn't know how many dietary supplements \nare actually being sold in the United States. Most people don't know if \na dietary supplement ingredient presented serious health concerns, the \nFood and Drug Administration doesn't have the information to track down \nproducts containing the harmful ingredient. We assume if it is for sale \nin America, some government agency has taken a close look to make sure \nthat product is safe and that we know what is inside it and that it \nwouldn't harm an innocent customer. It turns out that may be true when \nit comes to prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs, but the \ndietary supplement world is a much different world, with minimal \nregulation.\n  I have an amendment which I will be offering to ensure the Food and \nDrug Administration has the information it needs to respond quickly and \nefficiently when safety concerns arise concerning dietary supplements. \nThis amendment would require dietary supplement manufacturers to give \nthe Food and Drug Administration the name of each supplement they \nproduce, along with a description, a list of ingredients, and a copy of \nthe label. It is not an onerous requirement, but for the first time the \nFood and Drug Administration would literally have a catalogue of all \nthe dietary supplements being sold to Americans all across the Nation. \nWith this information, the FDA would be better equipped to protect \nconsumers' health and to work with manufacturers to address any \nproblems should they arise.\n  A 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office found the Food \nand Drug Administration is limited in its ability to respond to safety \nconcerns because dietary supplement manufacturers don't always provide \nbasic information, such as product names or lists of ingredients. This \ncommonsense amendment I am offering is supported by the Consumers \nUnion, and it would provide the Food and Drug Administration the basic \ninformation it needs to protect the public.\n  Trust me. It will be opposed by certain interest groups. But I heard \nopposition almost 10 years ago when I introduced a bill to require \ndietary supplement manufacturers to report serious adverse events, such \nas hospitalizations or deaths, to the FDA. The need for mandatory \nreporting of adverse events was demonstrated by injuries and deaths \nacross the country caused by the popular and dangerous dietary \ningredient ephedra before it was banned in the United States in 2004. \nOne of the victims was 16-year-old Sean Riggins from Lincoln, IL--30 \nmiles from where I live in downstate Illinois. He died in September \n2002. Sean was a high school student, and he died from a heart attack \nafter he took something called Yellow Jackets. It was supposed to be an \nenergy boost, and he was headed off to play football. It contained \nephedra and it killed him.\n  Shortly before his death, Metabolife--the largest manufacturer of \nsupplements containing ephedra--claimed to the public they had no \nephedra-related adverse event reports, period. However, a lawsuit was \nfiled, and they were required under that lawsuit to disclose their \nrecords.\n  In October of 2002, under pressure, Metabolife gave FDA over 13,000 \nephedra-related adverse event reports. People had taken their \nsubstances with ephedra and had gotten sick or worse.\n  In 2006 I worked with Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and Tom Harkin of \nIowa to pass the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer \nProtection Act, which mandates reporting of adverse events to the Food \nand Drug Administration. It stands to reason if there is a drug for \nsale in the United States--a dietary supplement in this case--that \ncauses a problem, we should know about it. If it is causing a problem \nin a lot of different places, the Food and Drug Administration, through \nthese reports, will discover it.\n  Since the law took effect in 2007, dietary supplement adverse event \nreports submitted to the FDA have increased sevenfold, from 368 in 2007 \nto 2,473 in 2011. The FDA is using these reports as part of a \nsurveillance system to signal potential safety issues and, in some \ncases, to take regulatory action. Mandatory reporting of adverse events \nwas an important step to help protect consumer safety, but we need to \ndo more to ensure the FDA and consumers have the information they need.\n  Madam President, the sad reality of this amendment and this issue is \nthat it takes a tragedy to catch our attention. Someone has to be \nseriously hurt or worse before Members of Congress and others will take \nnotice and do something.\n  I recently learned about the tragic death of this beautiful young 14-\nyear-old girl. Her name was Anais Fournier from Maryland. Anais was an \nhonor student. She liked to read vampire novels. She watched chick \nflicks with her mom, and she had a passion for writing. Last December \nher life was cut short when she went into cardiac arrest. What caused \nit? Caffeine toxicity. She drank two 24-ounce Monster Energy Drinks in \nless than 24 hours, and it took her life.\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that adolescents, such \nas 14-year-old Anais, consume no more than 100 milligrams of caffeine \nevery day. But in less than 24 hours, Anais had consumed 480 milligrams \nof caffeine. That is the equivalent of 14 12-ounce sodas with ordinary \ncaffeine content. Of course, she did it with two drinks--Monster Energy \nDrinks.\n  A recent report by SAMHSA shows energy drinks pose potentially \nserious health risks. I might just say that in the Senate today, as I \nam speaking, are members of Anais' family. We want to\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\njoin them in mourning her loss and hope that her life will at least \ngive us notice there are things we can do to spare other families the \ngrief their family has gone through. Wendy Crossland is her mom, her \nsister Jade is here, her grandfather Dick and grandmother Faith. \nThey have come here today because they are hoping the Senate will hear \nabout this amendment and that we can take it up and pass it.\n\n  Anais' case is not the only one. Emergency room visits due to energy \ndrinks have increased tenfold between 2005 and 2009 from 1,128 in 2005 \nto 13,114 ER visits in 2009. Energy drinks target kids with flashy ads \nand names like Monster and Rockstar and Five Hour Energy Drink, but \nthere are serious concerns about the high level of caffeine in these \nbeverages and the herbal ingredients that act as stimulants and contain \nadditional caffeine.\n  But here is an interesting thing. If you walk in--as I have--to an \nordinary gas station--whether it is in New Hampshire or in Illinois--\nand you see the cooler with the drinks in it, and then you see others \non counters, you might assume, well, they are all subject to the same \nlevel of regulation. But that is not true. If we are talking about \nordinary beverages--sodas--they are characterized as food, and they are \nsubject to certain limits by the FDA. However, if you look at the fine \nprint--and you better look closely, because it is very tiny--you may \nfind this is being characterized and described as a dietary supplement.\n  By putting those two words on the label, the product escapes \nregulation. So we limit the caffeine in an ordinary soda pop, for \nexample--a cola--but when it comes to the dietary supplement side of \nthe story, there are no limitations. That is why this poor young girl \nwas a victim because of the huge amount of caffeine that was consumed \nin the name of a dietary supplement.\n  The FDA has the authority to regulate caffeine levels in beverages \nand to require beverage manufacturers to prove the additives they put \ninside that can or bottle are safe. But most energy drinks avoid FDA \noversight by calling their products dietary supplements.\n  I defy anyone to walk into a store and look at all the things they \ncan buy and pick out the ones that are regulated by the FDA and those \nthat are not. They are going to have to study long and hard and look \nclosely at the labels to figure it out.\n  Is that fair to consumers? Is it fair to families and parents that we \ndon't have even basic oversight and regulation of products that can \nliterally harm or take the life of a beautiful young girl? The \namendment I am offering would ensure the FDA knows about all of the \nenergy drinks being sold in the United States and can provide \ninformation about ingredients that could help the agency address \npotential safety concerns.\n  Most dietary supplements available today for sale are safe, and they \nare used by millions of Americans as part of a healthy lifestyle. Some \ningredients may be safe for the general population but may be risky for \nkids, pregnant women, or people with a heart condition or who are \ntaking certain prescription drugs.\n  Furthermore, in spite of the many responsible dietary supplement \ncompanies, sadly, there is a murky market space out there where some \nbad actors are selling potentially dangerous products--some of them \nimported into the United States--which literally do not even disclose \ntheir ingredients in an accurate way. This amendment will take an \nimportant step in protecting public health by requiring dietary \nsupplement manufacturers to submit basic information to the FDA that \nwould help the agency identify safety issues and respond more quickly.\n  No one wants to hear of the death of another 16-year-old who loved to \nplay football or a young girl such as this wonderful young 14-year-old \ngirl who loved watching movies with her mom. We can help prevent these \ntragedies by requiring that better information is reported to the FDA \nwhen these dietary supplements go on the market.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, as a member of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pension Committee, I rise for a brief speech. But I want to \nbegin that speech by thanking Chairman Harkin, Ranking Member Enzi, and \nthe entire staff of the HELP Committee, and my staff--Francie Pastor--\nwho have helped so much on this legislation which is so important to \nthe American people. There is a chance where we have a bipartisan \neffort in the Senate to do something constructive and meaningful, and I \ncommend both Senators on their work.\n  There are component parts of this legislation I want to illuminate \nfor a few seconds because I had a lot to do with them, and they are \nvery important. One deals with third-party logistics providers. As the \nChair is aware, and as the Senate is aware, we have a placeholder in \nthe managers' amendment for a third-party provider and logistical \nproviders with track and trace.\n  Track and trace is the mechanism of tracking the drug from its origin \nand tracing it all through the system to the individual using the drug \nto ensure we have safety and security. But there are third-party \nlogistics carriers who deliver an awful lot of content in the United \nStates, such as FedEx and UPS, that operate in all 50 States, and we \nought to have a 50-State seamless standard in terms of third-party \ndelivery rather than 50 individual States all having regulatory \nauthority.\n  So my first message today is to the conferees, that when the \nconference committee is ultimately reporting, it should take this \nplaceholder on these third-party logistics providers and make sure in \nthe track-and-trace legislation we provide a seamless national policy \nfor the delivery of pharmaceuticals. That is very important to our \ncountry and very important to the pharmaceutical industry, but mostly \nit is very important to those who consume those pharmaceuticals.\n  Secondly, there is another provision called the Medical Gas Safety \nAct, which was included in this legislation, and I am very grateful the \nmanagers of the legislation agreed to put it in the bill because it is \nequally important for the people of this country. I want to make sure \none thing is underlined. Medical gases are critically important to \nsustain life, gases such as oxygen. A gas such as nitrous oxide, which \nis sometimes called laughing gas by some, is sometimes used to sedate \nindividuals. I want to make sure as we go through this process we have \na system under which medical gases--that have stood the test of time--\nremain available through medical use and that brandnew medical products \nthat have never been through the testing of time go through an \nappropriate FDA review, which is what the original act--the Medical Gas \nSafety Act--included and which we want to be included in this \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, I also wish to further speak for a moment about an \nimportant section of this legislation--the Medical Gas Safety Act. I \nwant to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member, and Senator \nBlumenthal, for working with me to include this in the bill. The \nMedical Gas Safety Act has a number of important benefits for patients, \nhealth care providers, FDA and medical gas providers, it will ensure a \ncontinued supply of quality medical gases that patients can depend on, \nand it will provide regulatory certainty for FDA and providers.\n  The intent of the Medical Gas Safety Act is to create a process for \nthose medical gases and medical gas mixtures that have a history of \nsafe and effective use to become approved drugs. This will ensure that \nmedical gases that have a long history of use, like oxygen, become \napproved drugs. The legislation provides FDA with the authority to \nensure that any mixture of medical gases be ``medically appropriate.'' \nCongress urges FDA to work with industry to develop a guidance over the \nnext year to better define the term ``medically appropriate'' so that \nthose mixtures that have been on the market for a long period of time \ncan continue to be available to the patients that need them.\n  I think we have a finished product that everyone can support--it is a \nmatter of fine tuning at this point, which can be accomplished through \nFDA guidance. We need to have a system under which medical gases that \nhave stood the test of time remain available for medical use; and brand \nnew medical\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\ngas products that have never been tested go through an appropriate FDA \nreview--which is what the original bill envisioned.\n  I once again thank the chairman and ranking member for all of the \nhard work they have done to move this entire bill forward in such a \nbipartisan manner. The way the Committee has approached this important \nlegislation has resulted in a good bill that deserves everyone's \nsupport. I also want to express my appreciation for the inclusion of \nthe Medical Gas Safety Act in this bill. Senator Blumenthal deserves \ncredit for the work he has done in this area.\n  Madam President, I applaud my colleagues, Senators Bennet and Burr, \nfor their efforts to enhance the safety of America's pharmaceutical \nsupply chain. While we are fortunate in America not to have a \nwidespread problem with counterfeit drugs, the potential that they \ncould pose a serious health risk to consumers is significant.\n  Supply chain compliance and safety is currently a patchwork of \ninconsistent State requirements and licensing which potentially \njeopardizes the safety and welfare of millions of Americans. Unless a \nuniform Federal policy covering all pharmaceutical supply chain \nstakeholders is enacted, the United States will fail to provide the \nbest tools needed for regulators and law enforcement to do a more \neffective job. Additionally, the U.S. would be missing an opportunity \nto leverage technology that will provide superior, cost effective \nconsumer protection.\n  Third Party Logistics Providers, or 3PLs, are playing a growing and \nimportant role in making sure medicines reach their destination safely \nand securely. The term ``third party logistics provider'' refers to an \nentity that provides or coordinates warehousing, distribution, or other \nservices on behalf of a manufacturer, wholesaler, or dispenser, but \ndoes not buy, sell, or direct the sales of those products.\n  Currently, Federal law does not recognize the role of a 3PL. Only one \nState even offers a license for 3PLs. Other States require a 3PL to \napply for a wholesale distributor license, even though 3PLs do not buy \nor sell drugs. The varying patchwork of inconsistent State requirements \nmakes law enforcement more difficult and there is added cost without a \nsafety benefit.\n  Failure to include and define 3PLs in Federal language is simply \nwrong. Recognizing the role of 3PLs is a strong first step towards the \ndevelopment of uniform Federal standards for a 3PL license. Ensuring \nthat all entities are properly licensed within the pharmaceutical \nsupply chain not only makes sense, but it is one of the most effective \ndeterrents to dangerous counterfeit drugs entering the supply chain.\n  I thank my colleagues Senators Bennet and Burr, and their staff, for \ntheir leadership to enhance supply chain safety by working with all \nindustry stakeholders. I also express my gratitude to Ranking Member \nEnzi, Chairman Harkin and Senate leadership for their support.\n  Through a constructive conference process, I am confident we can \nenhance supply chain safety in a reasonable and cost effective manner. \nBy properly defining 3PLs, and ensuring that properly licensed entities \nhandle our medicines, we can help to ensure they safely and securely \nreach patients in need. My constituents in Georgia expect nothing less.\n  Once again, Madam President, I commend the chairman and ranking \nmember on their service and their fine work on the FDA bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement \nI am about to give appear as in morning business and not connected to \nthe motion at hand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Remembering Katie Beckett\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last week our Nation lost one of its most \ndetermined and courageous advocates for the rights of people with \ndisabilities, Katie Beckett.\n  I am proud to say that Katie was a native Iowan. She was born in \nMarch of 1978 and 5 months later contracted viral encephalitis. She \nsubsequently had a seizure and went into a coma for 10 days. This \nillness caused nerve damage to her brain and left her paralyzed and \nunable to breathe on her own. She received a tracheotomy, was placed on \na ventilator, and was fed using a tube.\n  Initially, after coming out of the coma, she could not move at all. \nSlowly, much of the paralysis receded, but she was not able to breathe \non her own until she was 2 years of age. During that time, she lived in \na pediatric intensive care unit. Naturally her family wanted her out of \nthe hospital and home where they could care, support, and love her.\n  By her third birthday, Katie's private insurance reached its $1 \nmillion cap, and she began to receive Medicaid for her health care. \nDoctors determined that she could leave the hospital with proper \nsupports at home. However--and here is the catch--Medicaid refused to \npay for such care even though it would cost one-sixth as much as \nhospital care. Medicaid would pay for institutional care but not for \ncare in her own home. She could only receive care in a hospital or \nnursing home in order to be covered.\n  Katie's predicament began to receive attention thanks to the \nintervention of many people, including then-Congressman Tom Tauke, who \nwas Katie's Congressman at the time. He began to speak out about this \nand brought it to the attention of then-President Ronald Reagan and \nmany in Congress. Because of that, President Reagan spoke out about \nthis and a new home- and community-based waiver was created to allow \nchildren in Katie's situation to receive their care at home rather than \nin hospitals. This new program is called the Katie Beckett Waiver. At \nthe time, it was thought the program would benefit only a few hundred \nchildren. However, since 1982 over half a million children have \nbenefited from the Katie Beckett Waiver, including 11,000 in Iowa. \nKatie and her family were true pioneers in changing the institutional \nbias in Medicaid and permitting children with significant disabilities \nto receive their support and services in their own homes rather than in \na hospital, nursing home, or other institutional setting.\n  Under the new program, Katie went home almost 3 full years after she \nwas admitted. At that time she was able to be off her ventilator for 6 \nhours a day. What happened after her discharge? Well, she attended \nschool. While her fellow students considered her different because of \nher medical condition, she never needed special education services. At \nan early age she became a passionate advocate for home- and community-\nbased care.\n  While in middle and high school, she testified before Congress, met \nwith Governors, and, as I said, even met with the President of the \nUnited States. She served as an intern at Exceptional Parent magazine \nwhile living in Boston. That summer between her junior and senior year \nof high school, Katie learned to manage her own medical care, directing \nnurses who provided her treatment and managed her ventilator.\n  Katie considered advocacy to be her vocation and chosen path--in \nparticular, to raise the consciousness of other young people about \ndisability issues. Even though she found this work rewarding, she \nsometimes felt uncomfortable in those pre-ADA days--the pre-Americans \nwith Disabilities Act days--and being singled out because of her \ndisability. All she really wanted, as she put it, was ``to fit in and \njust be normal.''\n  Katie's first job was at a music store in a local mall. She got the \njob, as any young person would, by virtue of her knowledge and interest \nin music. Katie said, ``Advocacy is in my blood and in my soul,'' so \nshe looked for work that would allow her to help other people. She \nvolunteered at the local YWCA in the secondhand shop that supported the \nonly homeless shelter for women and children in eastern Iowa and was \nthen hired as the receptionist at the Y. The job title ``receptionist'' \ndid not begin to describe her true job responsibilities. Katie was the \nfirst responder to sexual assault and domestic violence\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\nvictims. She helped with the neutral exchange program, where divorced \nor separated parents could drop off their children without having to \nencounter each other. She learned to quickly assess the needs of others \nand to help connect them to appropriate services and supports. She also \nhelped with the supervised visitation program and was soon promoted to \nbe the assistant to the supervisor of that program.\n  Later, Katie worked with her mother, Julie Beckett, to help establish \nthe Kids As Self-Advocates Network, a group designed to help children \nand youth with significant medical needs to speak up for their own care \nand support. Working through Family Voices, another organization \nspearheaded by Julie Beckett, Katie helped to teach hundreds of young \npeople how to advocate for their own health care. In addition, she \nserved as a Senate appointee on the Ticket to Work and the Work \nIncentives Advisory Panel, which provided advice to the Social Security \nAdministration, the President, and Congress on work incentives, \nemployment, and other issues facing people with disabilities.\n  Katie Beckett graduated from Mount Mercy College in Cedar Rapids, IA, \nin 2001. She later took writing courses at nearby Kirkwood Community \nCollege. She was close to completing a novel. A series of illnesses \nobliged her to put off returning to college to take the classes \nnecessary to become a teacher.\n  Katie treasured the freedom to engage in the kinds of activities that \nso many of us take for granted, including eating at Red Lobster, going \nto the shopping mall, and recently moving into her own apartment.\n  Katie will be greatly missed by so many people all across America. \nShe will be remembered for her determined advocacy and that of her \nfamily, which has changed countless families forever. She inspired a \nhost of young people with disabilities by showing that an ordinary \nperson can accomplish extraordinary goals through great spirit, \ndetermination, and persistence.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, ``Life's most urgent and \npersistent question is: What are you doing for others?'' During her \nmemorable but very short lifetime, Katie answered that question in \npowerful ways as an agent for change and as a determined advocate. Her \nliving legacy is the program that bears her name, the Katie Beckett \nWaiver, which will continue to improve the lives of children and young \npeople with disabilities far into the future.\n  I see my colleague from Iowa, who has also been a friend of the \nBecketts and has been very supportive of Katie and all of her work and \nof Julie Beckett. This has truly been bipartisan, bicameral support for \nthis wonderful family.\n  Katie's funeral is this Friday. We are all going to miss her. As I \nsaid, when you met Katie Beckett, you were inspired to do more than you \nthought you could do. She was a wonderful person, and it is tragic that \nher life came to such a short close, just last week. She is going to be \nremembered. As I said, she changed so many lives in this country for \nthe better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa for his \nvery nice remarks about Katie Beckett. I come to the floor for the same \nreason--to celebrate the life of Katie Beckett.\n  Never has the word ``inspiration'' been used more appropriately in \ndescribing somebody, and today I am grateful to be able to recognize \nthe inspirational life of Katie Beckett.\n  Mary Katherine Beckett--nicknamed ``Katie''--was born in Cedar \nRapids, IA, on March 9, 1978. Five months after she was born, Katie \ncontracted viral encephalitis, followed by grand mal seizures. The \nencephalitis caused damage to her central nervous system, her \nrespiratory system, and she was attached to a ventilator. She would be \nalmost 2 years old before she could breathe on her own.\n  As Senator Harkin said, under Medicaid law at the time, Katie could \nonly receive care through Medicaid if she remained in the hospital even \nthough she was able to receive the care at home.\n  Iowa Congressman Tom Tauke heard of Katie's situation and realized \nthat it made no sense to keep a child in the hospital who could be at \nhome with her family living a better quality of life as well as saving \nthe taxpayers money. Congressman Tauke worked to convince the \nadministration that the system should be changed to allow States to \nprovide Medicaid to children receiving care in their homes.\n  Ultimately, President Reagan took up Katie's cause, intervening so \nthat Katie could receive treatment at home and still be covered under \nMedicaid. This change in policy became known as the Katie Beckett \nWaiver, and to date more than half a million disabled children have \nbeen able to receive care in their homes with their families rather \nthan being forced into hospitals and institutions.\n  But Katie's story doesn't end there. As Katie grew up, as she battled \nto establish her own place in society as a young American with \ndisabilities, she realized she had an opportunity to serve others who \nfaced similar challenges.\n  In her own words--and this is from a piece Katie wrote in the year \n2002 entitled: ``Whatever Happened to Katie Beckett?''\n\n       I started my advocacy career at age ten. It was not my \n     choice, but rather a path chosen for me. It was not until I \n     was twelve or thirteen that I realized the important work I \n     was able to do because I was who I was and how much this work \n     helped other kids.\n\n  Katie graduated with a degree in English from Mount Mercy College in \nCedar rapids. She lived in the community. She wanted to be a teacher \nand write novels for young people. She was fiercely independent, \nsometimes to the consternation of her mother Julie. She was quick-\nwitted and funny and loved a good cup of coffee. She lived her life as \na tireless advocate for the disabled. She testified before Congress \nseveral times and was a contributing voice on numerous groups dedicated \nto disability policy.\n\n  When we took up policy proposals such as the Family Opportunity Act \nand Money Follows the Person, we wanted Katie's perspective and we \ndepended upon her advocacy in the community to get those laws passed. \nKatie was the living embodiment of a person with disabilities \nparticipating and contributing in society.\n  On Friday, May 18, Katie went home to be with the Lord. She leaves \nbehind thousands of lives touched by her presence. A light may go out, \nbut a light lives on in those of us fortunate enough to have known \nKatie Beckett.\n  We remain inspired to work every day to create opportunities for the \ndisabled to participate and contribute and live the life of service and \ndedication that Katie did. So, obviously, even though not alive today, \nKatie will remain that inspiration for many people for a long time to \ncome.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I think I can say I was blessed to be here \nright before the tribute to Katie that our colleagues from Iowa gave. \nWhat an inspiring life of a young lady. Although cut short, her impact \nis felt by many.\n\n\n                    VISN Reorganization Act of 2012\n\n  I rise today to speak on a bill that I introduced last week, S. 3084, \nthe Veterans Integrated Service Network Reorganization Act of 2012. \nThis legislation would significantly reorganize the structure of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Veterans Integrated Service \nNetworks, or VISNs, to make these networks more efficient and to allow \nresources to be moved to direct patient care.\n  The veterans' health care system in our country was originally \nestablished to treat combat-related injuries and to assist in the \nrecovery of veterans with service-connected disabilities. Since its \nstart, the scope of the Veterans Health Administration, or VHA, has \nexpanded and now treats all veterans enrolled in the health care system \nthrough hundreds of medical facilities located around the country. \nPrior to 1995, VHA was organized into four regional offices. These \nregional offices simply channeled information between the medical \ncenters and the VA's Washington, DC, headquarters office. Since the \nregional offices' duties were to pass\n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\non information to the facilities, they had little ability to exercise \nindependence in implementing policies based on the needs of the \nveterans in their region.\n  In March 1995, based upon the recommendations of former Under \nSecretary of Health, Dr. Kenneth Kizer, VHA underwent a significant \nreorganization of its Washington, DC, and regional offices. Basically, \nthe VHA health care system was divided up into 22 geographic areas--now \n21--with each region having its own headquarters with a limited \nmanagement structure to support the medical facilities in that region. \nThe goal of the reorganization was to improve access to, quality and \nthe efficiency of care to veterans through a patients-first focus. This \nstructure would improve care by empowering VISNs with the independence \nto decide how to best provide for the veterans in their region. This \nchange also would have made the most of spending for patient care by \nsuggesting that VISN management be located on a VA medical center \ncampus.\n  The aim was to provide a better organized system that would have \noversight management responsibilities of the medical facilities through \na new structure called the Veterans Integrated Service Network. This \nnew system intended to offer a clearer picture of what the duties were \nof both the VHA central office in Washington, DC, and the VISN \nheadquarters offices. Going forward, VHA central office's \nresponsibilities included changes to VA policies and medical procedures \nand monitoring the facilities' performance in providing care. Each VISN \nheadquarters' primary function was to be the basic budgetary management \nand planning unit for its network of medical facilities. Because the \nscope of their tasks was limited, it was expected that a VISN \nheadquarters could be operated with 7 to 10 full-time employees, for a \ntotal of 220 staff for all VISN headquarters nationally. Any additional \nexpertise needed was to be called up from the medical centers on an \ninformal basis.\n  I believe VHA has significantly strayed from the initial concept \nbehind the 1995 reorganization. While some growth and an increase in \nVISN management staff over 17 years is expected, the growth and \nduplication of duties we have seen at VISN headquarters offices and \nmedical facilities quite simply is troubling. Examples of such \nduplication are coordinators for homeless veterans, OIF OEF OND \nveterans, women veterans who are present at both the medical facilities \nand the VISN headquarters.\n  This duplication has not only redirected spending away from medical \ncenters, it has caused a bloating of the numbers of staff across the 21 \nVISN headquarters. VISN headquarters have grown well beyond the 220 \nstaff proposed by the 1995 reorganization to a total of 1,340 staff for \nthe 21 VISNs headquarters today--an increase from 220 to 1,340 \nemployees today. These staff are performing functions that have little \nto do with budget, management, and oversight, let alone direct health \ncare for our veterans. It appears that VHA has allowed VISN \nheadquarters staff to increase without the necessary oversight or an \nassessment of the impact on the original purpose for VISN. Also left \nunchecked are the changes in the veterans' population and how veterans \nhave moved between States to determine if there is a need to adjust the \nVISN boundaries to best serve the veterans seeking care.\n  This bill--my bill--would bring about a much-needed change to the \nVISN structure. It would, No. 1, consolidate the boundaries of 9 VISNs; \nNo. 2, move some jobs back to the VHA central office; No. 3, reduce the \nnumber of employees to 65 per VISN headquarters; and No. 4, require VHA \nto review the VISN staff and structure every 3 years. What a novel \nsuggestion, that we would actually review the progress we make.\n\n  My colleagues may find it a bit odd that we could reduce the staff of \nVISN headquarters while also increasing the size of the veterans' \npopulation and facilities from some VISN headquarters, but because we \nare reducing the tasks that the VISN headquarters perform while \ntransferring several jobs to new Regional Support Centers--or RSCs--\nVISN headquarters staff would be more productive in carrying out the \nsimple budget, management, and planning duties that they were \noriginally tasked with in the 1995 original reorganization.\n  While the consolidation of VISNs would result in the closure of nine \nVISN headquarters, no staff would lose their job as a result of this \nlegislation. Staff whose jobs would be eliminated because of the \nconsolidation would have a chance to be transferred to other positions \nwithin the VA. Staff who perform the oversight functions that would be \nmoved to the newly created RSCs would be given the opportunity to \ncontinue that work at the RSC. This legislation also returns the idea \nthat VISN headquarters should be located on VA campuses by directing \nthat VISN headquarters, if possible, be located on a VA medical center \ncampus. Relocating to vacant space on the VA medical center campus \nhopefully would reduce the cost to the VA in the long run but, more \nimportantly, it would bring the headquarters staff closer to the \nfacilities they oversee.\n  I realize this would be an enormous change in the way VHA does \nbusiness, and yet I believe this can be accomplished without any \nchanges to how VA provides treatment and care to our Nation's veterans. \nIn fact, I believe it will improve how VA cares for veterans by \nincreasing the resources directly available for patient care.\n  It is important that VA not lose sight of its primary mission, as \nstated by Abraham Lincoln: `` . . . to care for him who shall have \nborne the battle'' and, to that end, VA should redirect spending away \nfrom bureaucrats and back to the direct care of veterans.\n  I believe the VISN Reorganization Act of 2012 would provide a more \nefficient and effective health care system to our veterans, and I hope \nmy colleagues will see it in that light and support this effort at \nreorganization that is way past due.\n  I thank the Chair, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I came to the floor tonight to talk about \nthe FDA reauthorization bill that is before the Senate. I was sorry we \ncould not get it to a vote today. I am hopeful that tomorrow we will be \nable to because from my perspective, as someone who has only been here \nfor a few years, the process, the committee process that led to the \ncreation of this bill, is a model for how this town ought to be \nworking.\n  The conversation we have had for so many months and even years has \nfelt decoupled from the conversations I have been having in my townhall \nmeetings and across the country about the challenges we need to \naddress. This gap has been miles apart. But in this piece of \nlegislation, I think we have actually found something responsive to \npatients, responsive to consumers, and responsive to the bioscience \nindustry that is so important to my State and so many States across the \ncountry.\n  Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Enzi deserve enormous credit for \nrunning an excellent process that has enabled this Senator and others \non the committee to be responsive to what our constituents say they \nwant, which is a modern FDA with improved patient safety and \ninnovation. We have also had committee members who were interested in \nrolling up their sleeves and doing hard work together irrespective of \nwhich party they were in. We have been able to work through a markup \nwith virtually no partisanship.\n  This has been a uniquely fine process, which is why we have had such \ngreat momentum toward a full extension in what I call the Land of \nFlickering Lights. The standard of success around here has become: Keep \nthe government running for 1 more month, keep this extension in place \nfor 2 more months. We actually have on the Senate floor a rational and \nresponsible bill that is a 5-year extension of the Food and Drug \nAdministration authority.\n  Tonight I only want to talk about two aspects of the bill. There are \na number we worked on, but tonight I spare you with the rest. In 2010 I \nintroduced a bill called the Drug Safety and Accountability Act. \nChairman Harkin\n\n[[Page S3418]]\n\nand Ranking Member Enzi took notice, and we were able to form a working \ngroup to address serious problems in the FDA's statutory authority.\n  FDA laws that are supposed to protect our domestic drug supply were \ncreated in 1938 and desperately needed to be updated for the 21st \ncentury. Back then the lines of commerce were based on 48 States. Now \nwe live in an era where over 80 percent of the active ingredients in \nour pharmaceuticals and our drug supply are being manufactured abroad. \nCouple that with the FDA laws that force them to inspect American \nfacilities every 2 years but they have no mandates on how often they \ninspect facilities overseas. The GAO has found that FDA can only keep \npace with inspecting the most high-risk overseas facilities, the places \nwhere our moms and dads are getting their pharmaceuticals for our \nchildren, once every 9 years.\n  So patients taking their pills have no idea whether the ingredients \nin their drugs were made in China or India or if they were ever \ninspected. Our American manufacturers are operating on an uneven \nplaying field. They have to expect a surprise FDA inspection every 2 \nyears on average here and make sure they are following all of their \ngood manufacturing practices, when their foreign counterparts do not \nhave to worry about FDA visiting them for a decade, if ever, because \nthey can delay or refuse FDA inspection because they are overseas.\n  Patient groups and the industry came together to try to change that, \nand this bill does change all of that. It would implement a risk-based \ninspection schedule for both foreign and domestic manufacturing sites. \nIt would make sure that drug manufacturers know who is in their supply \nchain every step of the way. And for the first time, if you are abroad \nand you refuse or delay inspection without a fair reason, the FDA can \nrefuse to let your product into this country.\n  These are all the steps American families already think we have in \nplace to protect them. I cannot tell you how many townhalls I have had \nwhere people have been shocked to learn that the products they have in \ntheir medicine cabinets have never been inspected by anyone. This will \nchange that. It is a thoughtful, commonsense approach I think all of \nthe constituents to this debate support.\n  So we need to make sure that happens. I also want to talk about \nsomething called track and trace. American families also want to know \nwhat happens to their pills, pills that can mean the difference between \nlife and death, once they leave the manufacturer, enter the country and \nchange hands several times. Right now we can know a lot more from a bar \ncode on a gallon of milk than from a bar code on medication. That seems \nabsurd to people at home.\n  I take a moment again to thank the Chair and ranking member for their \ncommitment to working together to meet the challenge of developing a \nuniform traceability system. This is something that has been worked on \nfor over a decade in this town, and we are finally this close to making \nit the law of the land.\n  I thank, in particular, my colleague, Richard Burr, a Republican from \nNorth Carolina, for being such a great partner in this work. FDA, the \nHELP Committee staff, Pew, and other stakeholders across the supply \nchain have been meeting for weeks with my staff and with Senator Burr's \nstaff, all in good faith. Our goal is to finalize a plan after we wrap \nup this Senate bill.\n  Let me talk about another very exciting part of this bill. If we pass \nthis bill, for the first time the FDA is going to be able to apply \n21st-century science to the approval of drugs, particularly drugs that \nare breakthrough medications, drugs that we know will work in one \nsubset of populations even if they might not work so well in another.\n  This is very important to cancer patients all across the United \nStates who are looking to access these breakthrough therapies. So from \nthe standpoint of driving an industry in this country that in my own \nState has a median salary of roughly $74,000, and from the point of \nview of patient health and protecting our supply chain, this FDA \nreauthorization is a must pass.\n  I thank the members of the committee and especially the chairman and \nthe ranking member for establishing a model for how this Senate should \noperate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet.) The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I applaud my colleague from Colorado, Senator Bennet, \nfor the work he has done on the FDA legislation--as he pointed out, the \ngood work that has been done by our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to get to this bill, to move it forward and to have a responsible \nand reasonable amendment process. So I hope we can move it forward this \nweek and actually see its passage on the floor because it is so \nimportant to so many people who are dependent on what the Food and Drug \nAdministration does in this country.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Shaheen pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3218 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2149\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the inappropriate overuse of \nantipsychotics--which are associated with a higher risk of death in \nfrail elders--is a well-recognized problem that warrants new policy to \nensure that these drugs are targeted to people suffering from serious \nmental illness, and not to curb behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's or \nother dementias.\n  Addressing these concerns requires additional transparency and \naccountability on how antipsychotics are being used today in older \nadults with dementia. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Grassley \nand Blumenthal in filing an amendment to S. 3187, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act S. 3187, which would require \nthe HHS Secretary to develop standardized protocols for obtaining \ninformed consent, or authorization, before administering an \nantipsychotic for a use not approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Authorizations would be provided by patients or, as \nappropriate, their designated health care agents or legal \nrepresentatives. These informed consent protocols would provide \nvaluable information to patients and their families, including possible \nrisks and known side effects associated with the antipsychotic, as well \nas alternative treatment options that may be available.\n  This bipartisan amendment also calls for a new prescriber education \nprogram to promote high-quality, evidence-based treatments, including \nnon-pharmacological interventions. The prescriber education programs \nwould be funded through settlements, penalties and damages recovered in \ncases related to off-label marketing of prescription drugs.\n  While the Food and Drug Administration--FDA--has approved \nantipsychotic drugs to treat an array of psychiatric conditions, \nnumerous studies conducted during the last decade have concluded that \nthese medications can be harmful when used by frail elders with \ndementia who do not have a diagnosis of serious mental illness. In \nfact, the FDA issued two ``black box'' warnings citing increased risk \nof death when these drugs are used to treat elderly patients with \ndementia.\n  Last year, the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector \nGeneral--HHS OIG--issued a report showing that over a 6-month period, \n305,000, or 14 percent, of the Nation's 2.1 million elderly nursing \nhome residents had at least one Medicare or Medicaid claim for atypical \nantipsychotics.\n  The HHS OIG also found that 83 percent of Medicare claims for \natypical antipsychotic drugs for elderly nursing home residents were \nassociated with off-label conditions and that 88 percent were \nassociated with a condition specified in the FDA box warning. Further, \nit showed that more than half of the 1.4 million claims for atypical \nantipsychotic drugs, totaling $116.5 million, failed to comply with \nMedicare reimbursement criteria.\n  I hope this policy will send a strong signal that Congress is \ncommitted to improving the quality of treatment provided to millions of \nour most vulnerable Americans--older adults with dementia and the \nfamilies who support them.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Food and Drug \nAdministration Safety and Innovation Act,\n\n[[Page S3419]]\n\nwhich will help speed safe and effective drugs and medical devices to \nthe patients who need them. This bipartisan, consensus bill was \ndeveloped through a long and collaborative process involving the FDA, \nstakeholders, and Senators from both sides of the aisle. I commend the \nchair and ranking member of the HELP Committee for their tremendous \nleadership and hard work on this very important bill.\n  The legislation we are considering today reauthorizes existing user \nfee programs for prescription drugs and medical devices and creates new \nuser fee programs for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. \nIn addition, the bill reauthorizes programs that have helped make \nmedicines safer for children, upgrades the FDA's tools to police the \nglobal supply chain, increases incentives for the development of new \nantibiotics, and expedites the development and review of certain drugs \nfor the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases and \nconditions.\n  I particularly want to commend my colleagues for including provisions \nbased on legislation I sponsored with Senator Klobuchar to address the \nshortages of drugs that are causing significant disruptions in care and \nputting patients at risk.\n  I continue to hear from doctors, emergency medical personnel, and \nother medical professionals in Maine who are extremely concerned about \nthis issue. Many of the drugs in short supply are vital, used in \nhospitals and cancer centers for anesthesia, chemotherapy, and \ntreatment of infections. There are also continuing shortages of drugs \nused in emergency rooms and intensive-care units.\n  These shortages are causing serious problems around the country, \nincluding forcing some medical centers to ration drugs or postpone \nelective surgeries. Oncologists have told me of situations where they \nwere forced to change a patient's chemotherapy regime midcourse because \nthey suddenly encountered a shortage of a particular drug. Moreover, \nfor some drugs, there are no effective substitutes.\n  This crisis is widespread, with more than 80 percent of hospitals \nreporting that they have had to delay treatment due to shortages. That \nis why I joined my colleague from Minnesota in sponsoring the \nPreserving Access to Life Saving Medications Act to give the FDA tools \nto better manage, and hopefully prevent, shortages of life-saving \nmedications, including requiring manufacturers to provide an ``early \nwarning'' when a drug will not be available.\n  Providing early warning when a drug will not be available will help \nboth doctors and patients. It builds on the successful model of the \nFDA's Drug Shortage Program which encourages manufacturers to report \npotential or existing shortages so that problems can be addressed or \nother manufacturers can ramp up production. Through this voluntary \napproach, the FDA was able to avert almost 200 shortages last year.\n  The legislation we are considering today will give the FDA the \ninformation and tools it needs to help address and prevent drug \nshortages. It will also promote innovation, improve safety, and \nincrease access to the drugs and devices that are critical to our \nhealth. Again, I commend Senators Harkin and Enzi for their leadership \nand encourage all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address \nthe Senate as in morning business for no more than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Manufacturing\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, last week the Vice President was in \nmy State in the Mahoning Valley, in the Youngstown area, northeast \nOhio. He saw what I have been seeing in my State for the last several \nmonths, and he heard what I have been hearing from so many Ohioans in \nthe last several months. He went to the Lordstown auto assembly plant, \nwhich assembles the Chevy Cruze. He saw what we have been seeing in my \nState, where manufacturing finally is coming back.\n  From early 2000 to January 2010, about a 10-year period, the \nmanufacturing sector in this country lost a huge number of jobs--more \nthan 5 million jobs. In the 35 years before that, manufacturing jobs in \nthis country were pretty constant, up and down. In 1997 or 1998, we had \nabout the same number of manufacturing jobs in America that we had in \n1965--a smaller percentage of the workforce, or smaller percentage of \nGDP, perhaps, but roughly the same number of jobs. From January of 2000 \nto January of 2010, some estimates were as high as one-third of our \nmanufacturing jobs. We know there were at least 5 million jobs and some \n60,000 plant closings in that 10-year period, from 2000 to 2010. It is \nalmost impossible not to ascribe at least part of that to trade policy \nand tax policy--a tax policy that far too often has given manufacturing \ncompanies an incentive to shut down and move overseas. If you shut down \na plant in Warren, OH, or Mansfield, OH, or Springfield, OH, and move \nto Wuhan or Zihan or Shanghai, you can deduct the moving expenses and \nsave on your Federal taxes. It is hard to do anything but to ascribe at \nleast a part of that to some of the trade agreements we have signed, \nsuch as NAFTA, which the President pushed through Congress. And it was \nboth parties. I was just as critical of President Clinton for NAFTA as \nI was President Bush on CAFTA.\n\n  We know what the Central American Free Trade Agreement and the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement have meant, and we know what PNTR with \nChina did, where we went from not much more than a $10 billion trade \ndeficit in 2000 to trade deficits that were, I believe, $10 billion to \n$15 billion a month with China later in the decade. And we know from \nthe policy of tax cuts that went overwhelmingly to the wealthiest \nAmericans that passed in 2001 and 2003, going into two wars and not \npaying for those, a Medicare drug law that in the name of privatization \nbasically gave away huge incentives to the drug and insurance \ncompanies--all that played into an economic policy that didn't work for \nthe American people. We lost more than 5 million manufacturing jobs, \nwith 60,000 plant closings between 2000 and 2010.\n  What happened in 2009 and 2010 to finally turn that around? The House \nand Senate and the President of the United States rescued the auto \nindustry. We know the kind of job loss we were seeing and now look at \nwhat we have. It is not great yet. We are not seeing a huge growth in \nmanufacturing, but almost every single month since early 2010, in Ohio \nand across the country, we are seeing job growth in manufacturing. So \nfar, since early 2010, after that 5 million jobs lost in \nmanufacturing--from early 2000 to early 2010--we have seen a 400,000-\nplus net job increase in these 2-plus years. Again, that is too \nanemic--it is not enough--but it is the direction we need to go.\n  Let me give a couple of examples as to why this auto rescue meant so \nmuch to my State and the rest of America. The Jeep Wrangler and the \nJeep Liberty are assembled in Toledo, OH. Prior to the auto rescue, \nthese workers assembled the Wrangler and the Liberty with only 50 \npercent American-made components. After the auto rescue--today--about \n75 percent of the components that go into the Wrangler and the Jeep \nLiberty--assembled in Toledo, OH--come from components made in the \nUnited States.\n  Look at what has happened in Lordstown, OH. The engine is made in \nDefiance, OH, the bumper comes from Northwood, OH, the transmission \ncomes from Toledo, the speaker system comes from Springboro, OH, the \nsteel comes from Cleveland and Middletown, OH, the aluminum comes from \nCleveland, OH, the stamping is done in Parma, OH, and this is put \ntogether--all these parts come together in Lordstown, OH, near \nYoungstown, assembled by 5,000 workers on three shifts. Almost none of \nthat would have happened without the auto rescue.\n  Do you know what else the auto rescue was all about? It didn't just \nhelp Chrysler and GM, which had, in fact, gone into bankruptcy. The \nauto rescue was also supported by Ford and Honda in my State. We have \nhuge Ford and Honda investments in my State. Why\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\nwould they have supported the auto rescue when the support from the \ngovernment--the loans from the government, if you will--went to \nChrysler and GM, not to Ford and Honda? Because they knew the \nimportance of the supply chain. Because the supply chain for Chrysler \nand GM had collapsed, as it would have if those two companies had gone \ninto bankruptcy and not been restructured and financed so they could \ncome out of bankruptcy. If that had happened, the supply chain for Ford \nand Honda also would have partially collapsed. We see evidence of that \nin what happened with the tsunami in Japan, where Honda and others had \nto shut down for a period of time because they couldn't get the supply \ncomponents they needed--some of them--from Japan.\n  So the point is that we stepped in with the auto rescue not just for \nChrysler and GM, not just for Honda and Ford in my State--where 800,000 \njobs, it is officially estimated, are affiliated with the auto \nindustry--but also because it was important for these jobs at our tier \n1 suppliers. Some of these tier 1 suppliers were about to collapse. So \nthe rescue of the auto industry also directly helped to rescue some of \nthose tier 1 suppliers. I have seen those tier 1 suppliers--Magnum in a \nsuburb of Toledo. I have been there; Johnson Controls, which makes \nseats in Warren, OH--they make seats for the Chevy Cruze. I left that \none out. All those tier 1 suppliers were in trouble.\n  We also knew the tier 2, 3, and 4 suppliers for the auto industry--\nmaking components you might not know what they were for or recognize \nthem if you held them in your hands but that go into the Chrysler and \nthe Ford and the GM and the Honda--were not able to get financing many \ntimes, and so we helped them through that with the auto rescue.\n  So the point is that what Vice President Biden saw in Youngstown and \nin Lordstown, OH, and what I hear in Dayton and Columbus and Mansfield \nand in Toledo and Rossford and Parma and all over my State is these \nworkers saying they understand this auto rescue, where the government \ninvested because nobody else would have--these companies are paying \nthese investments, and that rescue saved all these jobs. It is why \nmanufacturing is beginning to turn around.\n  There are other factors, of course, and one of them is the President \nof the United States enforcing trade law. We see a new steel mill in \nYoungstown in part because the President stood up to the Chinese and \nenforced trade law when the Chinese were gaming the system on something \ncalled oil country tubular steel, used in drilling for oil and for \nnatural gas. All of that has mattered to this manufacturing job growth.\n  We are not there yet. We need the administration to step up on a real \npolicy for manufacturing, a real strategy. I think they are starting to \ndo that on better tax law, better trade law, and better enforcement of \ntrade laws. We want to assist manufacturing when we can partner with \nthem--not picking winners and losers but understanding that to create \nwealth, you either grow it, you mine it, or you make it. My State does \nall three and does it very well and will continue to do so with this \nkind of partnership as we move forward.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on April 19, 2012, I introduced \nS. 2325, the Iron Dome Support Act, along with my colleagues Senators \nBoxer and Kirk. This bipartisan bill authorizes further assistance to \nIsrael for the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system. As of today, 17 \nof our colleagues have also joined us on this bill, because we all \nrecognize that an investment in the Iron Dome is an investment in peace \nand security in the region.\n  The Iron Dome system uses small radar-guided missiles to blow up \nKatyusha rockets and mortar bombs in midair coming from 3 to 45 miles \naway--and can do so in any weather condition. The Israeli Defense Force \nreports that Iron Dome has already proven itself to be 90 percent \nsuccessful intercepting rockets well before they could potentially hit \nresidential neighborhoods, busy highways, shopping centers, or crowded \nstreets in southern Israel.\n  This is an incredible piece of technology. Right now, there are 3 \nIron Dome batteries in the south of the country. But Israel remains \nvulnerable to attacks on other fronts from terrorist groups. That is \nwhy I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 2325. \nIncreased support for this legislation will send a strong message to \ninclude additional funding for Iron Dome batteries in order to protect \nall of Israel.\n  The Iron Dome is just one of the ways the United States supports \nIsraeli missile defense. The Arrow Weapons System and David Sling \nprotect Israel from medium and long distance threats to the country's \nexistence.\n  We are developing these systems in cooperation with the Israeli \ngovernment, so we can harvest the technology for future American \nsystems. Our backing is important to keep the deployment of these \nsystems on track as they must keep pace with the aggressive development \nof threat missiles.\n  As the markup of the various defense bills moves ahead this month and \nnext, I urge my colleagues to fully support the accelerated deployment \nof anti-missile systems vital to the survival of our Israeli allies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/22/senate-section/article/S3420-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TAIWAN'S PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION\n\n  Mr. WICKER.

In \naddition, President Ma has made notable progress in improving cross-\nstrait relations.

Later this month, California residents and \nvisitors from around the world will gather to celebrate the 75th \nanniversary of a beloved California landmark: the Golden Gate Bridge.\n  The Golden Gate Bridge is without doubt one of the greatest \nstructures of the 20th century. This seamless stretch of cables and \nsteel beams was the vision of renowned bridge architect and engineer \nJoseph Strauss, whose prior experience prepared him to design the \nlongest suspension bridge of its day, which many said could never be \nbuilt.\n  But built it was, even in the middle of the Great Depression. After \nmore than 4 years of construction, the Bridge opened on May 27, 1937. \nHailed as an architectural masterpiece for its complex construction and \nstructural elegance, it soon became a cornerstone\n\n[[Page S3421]]\n\nof ground transportation in the Bay Area, carrying passengers and \ncommerce between San Francisco and its neighbors to the north.\n  The Golden Gate Bridge is much more than a transportation corridor or \nengineering marvel. With its breathtaking setting and dazzling golden-\norange color, the Bridge is the iconic symbol of the San Francisco Bay \nArea, holding a unique place in the hearts and minds of residents and \nvisitors alike. It is the gateway not just to the Bay Area but to the \nwestern United States.\n  During World War II, the Bridge gained fame as the last site our \ntroops saw as they shipped off to fight in the Pacific and the first \nstructure they saw when they arrived back home. In dozens of movies \nshot in San Francisco, the Bridge appears in the opening scenes to let \nyou know immediately where you are: in one of the most beautiful places \non earth.\n  This year the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District \nand the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy--in cooperation with the \nNational Park Service, the Presidio Trust, and the City and County of \nSan Francisco--have launched a 75th anniversary program, with 75 \ntributes to celebrate the countless ways in which the Bridge connects \npeople and places.\n  On May 27th, the anniversary season will culminate in a Golden Gate \nFestival, with events along the San Francisco waterfront from Fort \nPoint to Pier 39. With the theme of ``Bridging Us All,'' this community \ncelebration will honor a beloved landmark that represents and reflects \nthe ingenuity, inclusiveness, and creativity of the San Francisco Bay \nArea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/22/senate-section/article/S3421-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SISTER JEANNETTE MURRAY\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and \nlegacy of Sister Jeannette Murray, Order of Saint Benedict, who \ncofounded the Benedictine School in Ridgely, MD. According to Sister \nJeannette, it has always been her lifetime dream to provide a complete \nand total program that will meet the needs of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities. She has more than accomplished that goal. \nThe Sisters of St. Benedict recognized the need for a school that would \neducate children and young adults with developmental disabilities and \nestablished the Benedictine School in 1959 with 19 students. Since that \ntime, the school has provided comprehensive services for more than \n1,000 individuals, including those with no meaningful family support. \nIn 2009, the Benedictine School celebrated 50 years as a nationally \nrecognized, accredited, and cost-effective living and learning \nenvironment for children and adults with developmental disabilities. \nMost recently, Sister Jeannette led the charge for the school's \ntherapeutic aquatic center, spearheaded a $10 million campaign for \ncapital projects and endowments, and challenged the community to \nrealize her dream of providing 24/7 care for aging loved ones. In April \n2012, the Benedictine School broke ground for Senior Homes, ``universal \ndesign'' homes for seniors with disabilities that will offer around-\nthe-clock care.\n  Earlier this year, Sister Jeannette retired as executive director of \nBenedictine School, and on June 24 she is being honored by the \ncommunity--donors, students, residents, civic and community leaders--\nfor her work on behalf of the developmentally disabled. Sister \nJeannette has made a tremendous difference in the lives of her students \nand their families and to all who hear and believe in her work. Her \ndream has benefitted not only her students and their families but also \nthe larger community.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Sister Jeannette \nMurray--the ``little woman with the huge heart'' as the parents of her \nstudents call her--for her vision, dedication, and service and in \nwishing her well in her retirement as she continues to inspire others \nto share her vision ``to see people with developmental disabilities \nliving meaningful, personally satisfying and well supported lives in \nthe community of their choice.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/22/senate-section/article/S3421-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING GARY LUKASIEWICZ\n\n Mr. CASEY.

He was a varsity athlete in multiple \nsports, a member of the National Honor Society, and the President of \nhis class. After being diagnosed with cancer, Gary bravely waged a two-\nyear fight against the disease and inspired Northeastern Pennsylvania \nand the Nation. A Twitter hashtag ``Keep Fighting Gary'' was spread by \ntens of thousands of Twitter users and seen by countless more.\n  The day before Gary passed, he was able to find the strength to \nattend his senior prom, where he was crowned ``Prom King.'' As Gary's \nfamily and friends mourn his loss, we offer our condolences and we pray \nthat they find comfort in their love for Gary and memories of him.

This award, which is given out by the \nNational Council on Foundations, recognizes those organizations that \ndevelop top-notch communications plans to increase attention and \nsupport for nonprofit foundations and corporate giving programs. \nIncreasing public awareness of these organizations helps them to better \nserve the community.\n  The Harford Foundation for Public Giving received this honor for its \n2010 annual report, ``Creating Brighter Futures.'' This report focused \non the foundation's 25-year, $30 million initiative to improve school \nreadiness and success in early grades for Hartford children. The \naward--one of 12 awarded out of 140 entries in 4 categories--was \npresented during the Council on Foundations Annual Conference, April 29 \nto May 1, in Los Angeles.\n  Of course, this award did not come as a surprise to me, considering \nall the great work the foundation has done in the Hartford region. \nFounded in 1925, the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving is the \ncommunity foundation for Hartford and 28 other towns in Connecticut's \ncapital region. Devoted to enhancing the quality of life in the region, \nthe foundation provides grants and other support to a broad range of \nnonprofit organizations, helps donors make effective charitable giving \ndecisions, and brings people together to discuss important community \nissues. The foundation has awarded $532 million since opening its doors \nin 1925 in grants in the areas of arts and culture, children and youth, \neducation, health, housing and economic development, and family and \nsocial services.\n  I am proud to honor the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving on \nhaving been named the Bronze Award winner for excellence in \ncommunications by the 2012 Wilmer Shields Rich Awards Program.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor one of \nNew York's finer institutions of higher education, Hamilton College in \nClinton, NY. On Saturday, May 26, 2012, Hamilton College will celebrate \nits 200th anniversary as a chartered institution of higher education in \nthe State of New York.\n  Founded in 1793, by the Reverend Samuel Kirkland, missionary to the \nOneida Indians, the college was originally called the Hamilton-Oneida \nAcademy. Samuel Kirkland presented his proposal for the academy to \nPresident George Washington who expressed approbation and to Secretary \nof the\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\nTreasury Alexander Hamilton who consented to be a trustee of the new \nschool, to which he also lent his name.\n  On May 26, 1812, Hamilton College received its charter from the \nRegents of the University of the State of New York ``for the \ninstruction and education of youth, in the learned languages and \nliberal arts and Sciences.'' The third college to be established in New \nYork State, it is today among the oldest in the Nation. Originally an \nall-male institution, Hamilton taught a traditional classical \ncurriculum focusing on Greek, Latin, philosophy, religion, history, \nmathematics, and stressing the importance of public speaking.\n  In 1978, Hamilton College merged with all-female Kirkland College to \nform one coeducational institution of higher learning dedicated to \nacademic freedom and the pursuit of truth. Alumni of Hamilton College \nare some of the most distinguished individuals and include public \nservants at every level. Among them are a former Vice President, \nnumerous U.S. Senators and Representatives, U.S. district and appellate \ncourt justices, Cabinet members, ambassadors, Governors and State, \ncounty and local officials.\n  Hamilton College also boasts alumni recipients of the Noble Prize, \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Pulitzer Prize; and its \ngraduates are among the Nation's most prominent business leaders, \nscientists, artists, teachers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, entertainers, \nwriters, journalists as well as my brother.\n  Hamilton College is known for teaching its students to express their \nideas with clarity and precision, to think creatively and analytically, \nand to act ethically and with conviction.\n  Mr. President, today, I ask all Members of this esteemed body to join \nme in celebrating Hamilton College's 200th anniversary. Here is to \nanother 200 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/22/senate-section/article/S3422-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nLincoln High School Constitution team of Portland, OR for winning the \n``We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution'' national finals. \nThe ``We the People'' competition requires high school students to \nillustrate their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution through a rigorous \nset of simulated congressional hearings.\n  These amazing students had the drive and commitment to master the \nU.S. Constitution. Lincoln High students, their teachers, and coaches \nput in hundreds of hours on weekdays, weeknights, and weekends to reach \nthis point. The team, made up of 36 students and 9 teachers and \nvolunteers, continues to exemplify excellence and is part of a storied \nhistory. Lincoln High School has now won the national competition 4 \ntimes, the Oregon State championship 16 times, and finished in the top \n10 at nationals 9 times in its 25 year history.\n  I wish to again, congratulate the students on the Lincoln High School \nConstitution team, their teachers, and their supporters on their \nvictory at the ``We the People'' national finals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/22/senate-section/article/S3422-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING WALNUT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. PORTMAN.

By 1918, the \nschool had dedicated itself to preparing students for college admission \nin the liberal arts. The Walnut Hills High School program became so \npopular that the school was expanded in 1931 to accommodate more \nstudents. My dad was a proud graduate.\n  Walnut Hills High School prides itself on a diverse faculty and \nstudent body striving for excellence in education. The school's motto \nbest reflects its attitude toward education: Sursum ad Summum, ``Rise \nto the Highest.''\n  Mr. President, I recognize Walnut Hills High School for the honorable \nachievement of being named the No. 1 high school in Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/22/senate-section/article/S3422-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 3220.

A bill to strengthen entrepreneurial education, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today during \nNational Small Business Week to discuss a strong, widely-supported bill \nthat I filed today with the help of Senators Lieberman, Kerry, and \nHarkin. Over the past several months, as Chair of the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have held three roundtables \nfocused on strengthening the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the United \nStates. We heard from entrepreneurs, small business owners, academics, \nlocal and Federal officials, and regulators, and we built quite a long \nlist of strong ideas that we can implement or facilitate legislatively. \nI have converted many of these ideas into legislative proposals that I \nwill file this week and markup soon in my Committee.\n  We have included several of such proposals in Today's Entrepreneurs \nare America's Mentors Act, or what I refer to as the TEAM Act. The TEAM \nAct addresses the domain of ``Mentorship'' in our entrepreneurial \necosystem. Its four provisions aim to nurture young Americans' innate \nentrepreneurial skills from the elementary school classroom through \npostgraduate business school and onward. We want to create jobs, and \nfor posterity's sake we must begin with our young entrepreneurs. This \nbill will strengthen America's entrepreneurial ecosystem by empowering \nthe Small Business Administration's, SBA, Office of Entrepreneurial \nEducation, OEE, and invigorating students of all ages, entrepreneurs \nand mentors throughout the country. We want you to join the TEAM.\n  President Bush created the SBA OEE administratively in 2008. \nCurrently, the OEE receives $131,000 in annual funding. This OEE \nfunding sustains its oversight of the successful SCORE nonprofit \nassociation, comprised of 11,500 volunteer business counselors \nthroughout the United States. The TEAM Act will formally authorize the \nSBA OEE\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\nand create a program, aside from overseeing SCORE, to conduct \nentrepreneurial education outreach and mentorship in K 12 schools and \nwill be required to work with existing groups in the entrepreneurial \neducation space. These groups are not-for-profit organizations, for-\nprofit companies, community civic organizations, and SBA resource \npartners. We do not want to reinvent the wheel or allow for some \nbureaucratic intrusion. We simply want the SBA OEE to act on what its \ntitle suggests and coordinate among these already successful groups and \nfacilitate and sustain the great momentum they have built in \nentrepreneurial education.\n  Second, the OEE will administer a scholarship program for MBA \nstudents to counsel local startup companies and small businesses. With \na $1,500 scholarship, 100 MBA students from around the country could \nshare what they are learning in business school with small business \nowners near the school. The selected applicants would offer free \ntechnical assistance, TA, financial planning, and sustainable business \npractices. This scholarship program would scale up on the national \nlevel a successful program pioneered by the Idea Village in New \nOrleans. We know something about innovative entrepreneurship in \nLouisiana: Forbes magazine named New Orleans the ``Biggest Brain \nMagnet'' of 2011 and the second ``Best City for Jobs;'' in 2010, the \nBrookings Institute reported that the entrepreneurial activity in New \nOrleans is 40 percent above the national average; and Inc. Magazine \ncalled New Orleans the ``Coolest Startup City in America.'' With all \nthat said, I do not mind borrowing a few good ideas from the innovators \nin my hometown.\n  Third, the OEE would, in consultation with the Secretary of \nEducation, give Congress a report on a possible correlation between \nrecord high student debt and record high youth unemployment and whether \nor not student debt deters someone from starting a business. If the OEE \ndoes find a correlation, the study should provide Congress some \nrecommendations for legislation to address it in a manner that assists \nentrepreneurship.\n  Finally, the TEAM Act also requires the SBA to sponsor competitions, \nthrough its ten Regional Offices, in which local entrepreneurs, \ninventors, and small businesses compete to solve local public-private \nchallenges. There would be a $50,000 grant for each region's winning \nidea. The idea for these ten competitions is modeled after both the \n``Water Challenge'' sponsored by New Orleans's Idea Village and the \nnational mobile app competition for college students run by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  Now that you understand the provisions in the TEAM Act, let me read \nout a long list of supporters. These organizations have been \ninstrumental in providing my Committee with their ideas and \nperspectives on how best to help young entrepreneurs with this \nlegislation. Most are national groups that have worked for decades on \nteaching young Americans entrepreneurship and the importance of \nfinancial literacy and good business practices. Others are local, but \nnationally recognized groups with a national impact on jobs creation.\n  The TEAM Act has also received endorsements from Girl Scouts of \nAmerica, Venture for America, and Mayor's Office, City of New Orleans.\n  We urge all of my colleagues here in the Senate to join us on the \nTEAM to promote entrepreneurial education and nurture the \nentrepreneurial spirit inside all young Americans. The TEAM Act will \nhelp students, entrepreneurs, and small business owners in all 50 \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STUDY ON ENTREPRENEURIAL DEFERMENT OF STUDENT LOANS.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Education, shall submit to Congress a report that includes \n     detailed recommendations for legislation--\n       (1) establishing a program to forgive student loans in a \n     manner that assists youth entrepreneurship by making \n     available capital for business formation; and\n       (2) establishing a program to defer student loan repayments \n     in a manner that assists youth entrepreneurship by making \n     available capital for business formation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 18, 2012.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: It is with great enthusiasm that I \n     submit this letter of support for Today's Entrepreneurs are \n     America's Mentors (TEAM) Act.\n       Over a decade ago New Orleans was in a downward spiral, \n     failing in all relevant areas of community vitality: \n     education, jobs, health and crime. As a result, there was an \n     exodus of talent; from 1990 2000 over 41,000 23 35 year olds \n     left the State of Louisiana. This ``brain drain'' created a \n     vacuum of innovative thinking needed to redirect the economy \n     and to address critical social issues.\n       The Idea Village formalized as an independent 501c (3) \n     nonprofit in 2002 to address the ``brain drain'' with a \n     mission to identify, support and retain entrepreneurial \n     talent in New Orleans. What began as a small group of local \n     entrepreneurs has evolved into an engaged global \n     entrepreneurial ecosystem of over 2,028 CEOs, professionals, \n     investors, MBA and high school students, corporations, \n     entrepreneurs and civic leaders who have invested over 56,949 \n     hours of mentorship and $3.3 million in seed capital in 1798 \n     New Orleans entrepreneurs. This network has helped create \n     over 1,006 jobs and $83 million in annual revenue.\n       Today New Orleans is at a tipping point and the movement \n     that started in 2000 is showing measurable results. The \n     August 2009 issue of Entrepreneur Magazine described New \n     Orleans as a blueprint of economic recovery through \n     entrepreneurship, and in April 2011, an article in Inc.com \n     called New Orleans the ``coolest startup city in America.'' A \n     2011 Forbes article named New Orleans the ``#1 brain magnet \n     in the country'' and the ``#2 best big city for jobs.'' \n     During the second annual New Orleans Entrepreneur Week in \n     March 2010, noted author and historian Walter Isaacson said, \n     ``New Orleans is a brain magnet instead of a place that will \n     suffer a never-ending brain drain.''\n       Two of The Idea Village's most impactful programs that can \n     be duplicated nationally are IDEAcorps and Entrepreneur \n     Challenge Competitions:\n       1. IDEAcorps is an MBA service learning program started in \n     the wake of Hurricane Katrina as bright MBA students around \n     the nation descended on New Orleans to utilize their business \n     skills to help local entrepreneurs execute high impact \n     projects. Since 2008, 15 national business schools and 596 \n     MBA students have participated in IDEAcorps. Participating \n     universities include: Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, \n     Cornell, Duke, Berkeley, DePaul, MIT, Columbia, Tulane, \n     Loyola, University of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago and \n     Xavier Labour Relations Institute in India.\n       2. Entrepreneur Challenge Competitions have become an \n     impactful way to provide entrepreneurs with much-needed \n     resources while also galvanizing the community to develop \n     for-profit solutions to regional problems. The Idea Village \n     began this program by working with local partners to launch \n     the Water Challenge in 2011, a six month intensive start up \n     accelerator for entrepreneurs solving serious water \n     management issues. The Water Challenge culminates in a \n     $50,000 pitch competition during the annual New Orleans \n     Entrepreneur Week in March, bringing together entrepreneurs, \n     industry experts, investors, students and civic leaders to \n     support innovative solutions to local challenges. In \n     addition, The Idea Village has executed an Education \n     Challenge to encourage entrepreneurs to find innovative \n     solutions to closing the education gap.\n       Entrepreneurial ecosystems require consistent support and \n     nurture from the entire community. The Today's Entrepreneurs \n     are America's Mentors (TEAM) Act is an excellent step towards \n     infusing entrepreneurship throughout our communities and \n     nation and I urge the Senate to give all due consideration to \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Tim Williamson,\n\n                                                  Cofounder & CEO,\n     The Idea Village.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       Empact,\n\n                                       New York, NY, May 21, 2012.\n     Senator Mary L. Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chair Landrieu: My name is Michael Simmons, and I'm \n     the Co-Founder and CEO of Empact, one of the leading youth \n     entrepreneurship education organizations in the U.S.\n\n[[Page S3427]]\n\n       Over the last six years, we've held entrepreneurship \n     conferences on over 500 college campuses and high schools \n     featuring the country's top young entrepreneurs. In addition, \n     we've held a 300-person, invite-only, annual Summit for the \n     entrepreneurship education industry at the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, White House, and Capitol Hill featuring the field's \n     top leaders. Our work with Chair Landrieu and the Committee \n     on Small Business and Entrepreneurship began at the Capitol \n     Hill portion of our Summit in 2011.\n       Through our work in these areas, our company has seen the \n     large unmet need in exposing today's youth to \n     entrepreneurship as a viable career path. We are in full \n     support of the Today's Entrepreneurs are Mentors (TEAM) Act, \n     as we believe it will have a large, positive impact on the \n     entrepreneurship education field and help fill this unmet \n     need.\n       Specifically, I believe the TEAM Act will help lead to a \n     new generation of young people who look at problems as \n     opportunities rather than stopping points. I am particularly \n     in favor of the recreation of a program within the Office of \n     Entrepreneurial Education that would conduct outreach and \n     mentorship in K 12 schools.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Michael Simmons,\n     Co-Founder and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 21, 2011.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair of the Committee on Small Business and \n         Entrepreneurship, Russell Senate Office Bldg., \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: We are writing to commend your work \n     to reduce barriers to youth entrepreneurship in America and \n     express our strong support for the TEAM Act. The ``Today's \n     Entrepreneurs are America's Mentors'' Act contains a number \n     of strong provisions that can provide that vital boost young \n     adults need to start a business and find new economic \n     opportunity. The TEAM Act reflects an important investment in \n     the future of our country, and in the potential of this \n     younger generation to be drivers of innovation and job \n     creation.\n       In particular, the TEAM Act contains some of the key \n     priorities that Young Invincibles and our partners in the \n     entrepreneurship space have advocated for as part of the \n     Youth Entrepreneurship Act \n     (www.YouthEntrepreneurshipAct.com). The TEAM Act helps to \n     increase the SBA's focus on young entrepreneurs by providing \n     badly needed support for the Office of Entrepreneurial \n     Education. This office has tremendous potential to support \n     and expand some of the strong entrepreneurship education \n     models that have already sprung up in high schools, community \n     colleges, and universities across the country. The TEAM Act \n     also strengthens support for entrepreneurship competitions, \n     which have been a great and cost-efficient way to introduce \n     young adults to the challenge of starting a successful \n     business.\n       Finally, the TEAM Act requires the SBA to study and issue \n     detailed recommendations to Congress on the feasibility of a \n     student loan forgiveness and deferment program for people who \n     start businesses. Young Invincibles has outlined this \n     innovative policy idea in our Youth Entrepreneurship Act, and \n     it has found considerable support among young adults as a way \n     to address a major hurdle for young adults trying to start a \n     business: the tens of thousands in student loans that are all \n     too common for recent graduates. During our recent 20-state \n     bus tour, we heard directly from young entrepreneurs \n     struggling to pay back student loans and stand-up a new \n     business simultaneously. We look forward to working with the \n     SBA and Congress to advance and study this promising idea.\n       Thank you again for your support of America's young \n     innovators.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Aaron Smith,\n\n                                  Co-Founder & Executive Director,\n     Young Invincibles.\n                                  ____\n\n     Re Support for TEAM Act.\n\n     Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: Thank you for your support of \n     entrepreneurship as a critical tool in economic development. \n     I'm excited to endorse your efforts to authorize the Small \n     Business Administration's Office of Entrepreneurial Education \n     (OEE). Entrepreneurship Education is essential to DECA's \n     mission to develop emerging leaders and entrepreneurs.\n       The Office of Entrepreneurial Education will strengthen \n     small businesses, the backbone of our economy through \n     partnerships with DECA and other entrepreneurship education \n     organizations. It will provide new avenues to reach high \n     school and college students with the exciting opportunities \n     they have to create their own future through \n     entrepreneurship.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Edward L. Davis,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     DECA Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 18, 2012.\n       Chair Landrieu and the Senate Committee on Small Business \n     and Entrepreneurship: As founder of the Young Entrepreneur \n     Council, an invite-only nonprofit organization comprised of \n     several hundred of America's top young entrepreneurs, I write \n     today to express how proud we are to support your efforts to \n     strengthen the youth entrepreneurship ecosystem with \n     proposals included in the TEAM Act.\n       Since its inception in 2010, the YEC has promoted \n     entrepreneurship as a means to overcome unemployment and \n     underemployment by providing students and aspiring \n     entrepreneurs with access to tools, peer-to-peer mentorship \n     and resources to support each stage of a business' \n     development and growth. Provisions of the TEAM Act will go a \n     long way toward helping the thousands of young people we \n     mentor each year achieve their goals--and spur new job \n     creation.\n       Specifically, empowering the Small Business \n     Administration's Office of Entrepreneurial Education (OEE) to \n     conduct outreach and mentorship in K 12 schools will \n     significantly impact the way we teach opportunity recognition \n     to our youth, and regional SBA-sponsored entrepreneurial \n     competitions will spur youth-led innovation at a relatively \n     low cost to the government (but with the potential to lead to \n     great gains in new jobs and businesses). The SBA Pilot MBA \n     Scholarship program will change many lives, as has already \n     been demonstrated in New Orleans, and we support the Senate \n     Committee's vision for scaling the program nationally. \n     Finally, a study on the effect of student loan deferment on \n     youth entrepreneurship is timely and much-needed. Based on \n     the obstacles facing young entrepreneurs that we've \n     documented throughout our #FixYoungAmerica campaign, we \n     believe that the results of this SBA-led study are the first \n     step toward empowering young entrepreneurs burdened with \n     student loan debt to create new businesses and jobs at a time \n     when America needs it most.\n       With policy reforms such as the TEAM Act, the YEC can \n     continue to speak out, educate, empower and improve our \n     youth's ability to sustain themselves in today's challenging \n     economy, and we are proud to voice our support for these \n     importantly and timely efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Scott Gerber,\n\n                                                          Founder,\n     Young Entrepreneur Council.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 21, 2012.\n       Chair Landrieu and the Senate Committee on Small Business \n     and Entrepreneurship: As Chief Executive Officer and \n     President of the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship \n     (NFTE), I am happy to extend our organization's support to \n     the TEAM Act and your efforts to strengthen the resources \n     available to expand entrepreneurship education to all young \n     people in our country.\n       For nearly 25 years NFTE has partnered with schools and \n     local business leaders to bring entrepreneurship education to \n     youth in some our most challenged and under-resourced \n     communities across the nation, and we've seen firsthand how \n     this type of intensive, experiential programming can \n     demonstrate the relevance of school, invest students in \n     academic pursuits and unlock in young people their potential \n     as entrepreneurs, scholars and leaders in their communities.\n       The provisions outlined in the TEAM Act will serve as \n     powerful catalysts to grow the impact of the work NFTE and \n     other like-minded organizations do, in particular, by further \n     empowering the Small Business Administration's Office of \n     Entrepreneurial Education (OEE) and creating a network of \n     regional entrepreneurial competitions.\n       The young people we work with each day face many obstacles \n     and the policy reforms contained in the TEAM Act will create \n     a powerful platform of solutions and tools to support the \n     achievement of their personal and professional goals. We are \n     proud to support these important efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Amy Rosen,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer, NFTE.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          National FFA Center,\n\n                                   Indianapolis, IN, May 21, 2012.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairwoman Landrieu: Today there are over 540,000 \n     student members of FFA in nearly 7,500 high school programs \n     across the United States studying agriculture, developing \n     their leadership skills and preparing for career success \n     through agricultural education. A key part of agricultural \n     education is experiential learning experiences that provide a \n     hands-on way for students to learn, develop their skills and \n     apply the knowledge learned in the classroom to serve real-\n     world problems. We have always put a high degree of focus on \n     developing our students' knowledge and application of \n     entrepreneurship education as away of helping them achieve \n     their career goals.\n       As a Senator from Louisiana I am sure you have a special \n     appreciation for the role of small business and the critical \n     role entrepreneurs play in starting businesses and creating \n     jobs in rural communities. Entrepreneurship is a critical \n     part of agriculture and is particularly important to the \n     development and sustainability of rural communities. It is \n     vitally important that young people learn and develop these \n     skills in their earliest years to help them achieve success.\n       We support the expansion and increased focus of \n     Entrepreneurship Education by the Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship Committee. We also encourage the committee \n     to\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\n     consider language in the bill that would direct, incentivize \n     and enable the Small Business Administration to work with \n     other agencies such as USDA, Department of Education and \n     others in developing an interagency working group that can \n     develop a more comprehensive plan and approach to k 12 \n     Entrepreneurship Education. To the degree that we can \n     participate in supporting that collaboration and planning we \n     would be happy to do so.\n       Thank you for your leadership in recognizing the importance \n     of this issue and for putting forward legislation that will \n     increase the visibility and effectiveness of Entrepreneurship \n     Education. It is important to young people, our communities, \n     our nation and the world.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Kent Schescke,\n     Director of Strategic Partnerships.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Council of Graduate Schools,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2012.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Chair, Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, I am writing in support of Today's \n     Entrepreneurs are America's Mentors (TEAM) Act, legislation \n     that is intended to strengthen the U.S. entrepreneurial \n     ecosystem by empowering the Small Business Administration's \n     Office of Entrepreneurial Education and invigorating students \n     of all ages, entrepreneurs and mentors throughout the \n     country.\n       We are particularly supportive of the SBA Pilot MBA \n     Scholarship program that would provide a scholarship/\n     fellowship to MBA students. Scholarship recipients would \n     provide free technical assistance, financial planning and \n     sustainable business practices to local small businesses and \n     start-up companies. This provision recognizes the increasing \n     importance of graduate education in providing the highly \n     skilled talent the nation needs to be successful in the 21st \n     century global economy. The role of graduate education in \n     preparing a highly skilled workforce was addressed in the \n     landmark report, The Path Forward: The Future of Graduate \n     Education in the United States. That report reviewed trends \n     and vulnerabilities in our nation's system of graduate \n     education and proposed a set of recommendations to strengthen \n     the enterprise. The report and executive summary are \n     available at http://www.fge\n     report.org/ \n       A recent report, Pathways Through Graduate School and Into \n     Careers, proposed increased collaboration among business \n     leaders and university leaders to develop and support the \n     next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators and is \n     available at http://pathwaysreport.org/. Both reports were \n     produced by the Council of Graduate Schools and ETS under the \n     guidance of commissions of business leaders and university \n     leaders.\n       We would welcome the opportunity to work with you and your \n     colleagues on exploring additional ways that U.S. graduate \n     education, a strategic national asset, can support our \n     nation's entrepreneurial enterprise. Thank you for your \n     leadership in introducing this important legislation.\n           Regards,\n                                                 Debra W. Stewart,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Junior Achievement USA,\n\n                               Colorado Springs, CO, May 21, 2012.\n     Chairwoman Mary Landrieu,\n     Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairwoman Landrieu, on behalf of Junior Achievement \n     USA, I am writing in support of the proposed Today's \n     Entrepreneurs are Mentoring (TEAM) act. This legislation \n     would strengthen the federal entrepreneurship education \n     outreach to our nation's schools and further empower groups \n     like Junior Achievement to inspire students, entrepreneurs, \n     and mentors throughout the United States.\n       With the job landscape of the 21st century continuously \n     changing, an increased emphasis on entrepreneurial education \n     for our nation's students is needed more than ever. The TEAM \n     act appears to do just that. By encouraging the SBA Office of \n     Entrepreneurial Education (OEE) to work with existing \n     entrepreneurial outreach organizations, I believe more \n     students will be inspired to take the innovative action \n     needed to successfully compete in the world's marketplace.\n       As you may know, Junior Achievement (JA) annually prepares \n     more than 4 million K 12 students across the United States. \n     For close to 100 years, educating and training youth on \n     entrepreneurship has been a vital component of JA's purpose \n     as an organization. Along with financial literacy and work \n     readiness, teaching students about entrepreneurship through \n     hands on activities that promote an entrepreneurial spirit is \n     woven into JA's programs. Since 1919, the JA Company Program \n     has taught millions of students about the skills and \n     responsibilities needed to start and run a business.\n       Given JA's history and scope of impact in the \n     entrepreneurial education space, we stand ready to assist the \n     OEE were your bill to become law. Thank you for introducing \n     this important piece of legislation and we look forward to \n     possibly working with you and your staff in the weeks and \n     months ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Jack E. Kosakowski,\n                                                President and CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself and Ms. Ayotte):\n  S. 3218. A bill to improve the coordination of export promotion \nprograms and to facilitate export opportunities for small businesses, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, this week we celebrate National Small \nBusiness Week. Small businesses are so important to job creation in \nthis country. So much of the innovation that takes place in this \ncountry happens as the result of the work of small businesses. Two-\nthirds of the jobs we expect to be created to lead us out of the \nrecession and through this recovery are going to be created by small \nbusinesses.\n  It is important that in this Chamber we do everything we can to \nsupport small businesses. I am pleased that I have been able to be a \nmember of the Small Business Committee. I applaud the leadership of \nSenator Landrieu and Senator Snowe, the chair and ranking member, for \nall of the good work they have done for small business.\n  I can tell you from my own personal experience just how important \nsmall businesses are. My husband and I started our married life and for \n8 years ran a family business. It put us both through graduate school \nand gave us a downpayment on a house. It employed a number of young \npeople for 8 years. It taught me a lot about meeting a payroll and \nmaking sure we could take care of our employees, help make sure they \nhad good jobs. So I have had that personal experience to make me \nunderstand just how critical small businesses are to our economy.\n  I am here on the floor also to talk about bipartisan legislation that \nmy colleague from New Hampshire, Ms. Ayotte, and I are introducing \ntoday to boost small business exporting.\n  Just as small businesses are the backbone of so much of this \ncountry's economy, they are clearly the backbone of New Hampshire's \neconomy. It should come as no surprise to all of our constituents in \nNew Hampshire that both Senator Ayotte and I serve on the Small \nBusiness Committee because we know how important those businesses are \nto our State. We both recognize how critical it is for us as a \ndelegation to work across the aisle and across Chambers when possible \nto help the small businesses in New Hampshire provide the good jobs the \nresidents of New Hampshire need.\n  So I am glad Senator Ayotte and I are working together to introduce \nlegislation to help remove barriers to exporting for small businesses \nin New Hampshire and across the United States. The bill we are \nintroducing today, the Small Business Export Growth Act, is the result \nof a Small Business Committee field hearing that we hosted together in \nManchester, NH, last August. We held that hearing because we recognized \nthat exports offer a tremendous opportunity for small businesses.\n  Unfortunately, for so many small businesses, those foreign markets \nhave remained an untapped resource for most of them. Over 95 percent of \nthe world's customers live outside of the United States, but only 1 \npercent of our small businesses export. That is a particularly shocking \nnumber when we compare to it large businesses because over 40 percent \nof large businesses sell their products overseas. So we have to do more \nto help our small businesses get into those international markets.\n  At our field hearing we heard about some of the barriers our small \nbusinesses face when they try to go global. Our legislation is an \nattempt to remove some of those barriers so that small businesses can \naccess new sources of revenue and create jobs. One of the problems we \nheard about is that navigating the Federal bureaucracy can be a special \nchallenge for small businesses that wish to export. I know the \nPresiding Officer and I can both appreciate that because we know how \nhard it is for us to navigate the Federal bureaucracy.\n  Senator Ayotte and I heard from two such New Hampshire companies that \nrely on State and Federal offices to help them export. I want to talk \nabout one of those companies specifically. It is a company that is \ncalled Secure Care. Secure Care has developed a technology that \nprotects Alzheimer's patients who may wander away from\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\ntheir home or their place of residence. It also protects newborns who \nare still in the maternity ward.\n  Grace Preston, who is the international sales manager for Secure \nCare, told us that the company has significantly expanded its growth by \nselling overseas. Grace also told us that Secure Care could not have \ndone that without Federal and State export programs working together. \nIn New Hampshire, we are very fortunate because our State and Federal \nexport services work seamlessly, and that has been important in helping \nour businesses grow their exports.\n  In 2010 New Hampshire's exports grew about 40 percent. That was \nalmost twice the national average and the most of any State in the \ncountry. So it has been very critical to our small businesses.\n  But we also heard that State and Federal agencies don't always have \nthat same collaborative relationship in other places across the \ncountry. According to our former New Hampshire trade director, Dawn \nWivell, these services sometimes, in some places, can overlap or, even \nworse, sometimes there are agencies that refuse to work together. Our \nbill attempts to require better coordination to make more successes \nlike Secure Care a reality across the country.\n  Our bill also encourages the Federal Government to do more to promote \nthe opportunity of exporting and to get the word out about Federal \nexport programs.\n  Foreign markets can be daunting for small businesses, but that should \nnot stop our innovators from trying to compete. Our small businesses \nmust be assured that the Federal Government will help them when \nconsidering exporting. Part of our responsibility is to try to do \neverything we can to put into place policies that help small businesses \nwhen they want to try to export.\n  I thank Senator Ayotte for her cooperation and for the work we have \ndone together. I thank both Senator Ayotte and her staff, along with \nmine, for working on this issue. I look forward to advancing this \nlegislation in the Senate and to continue to recognize the important \nrole that small business plays in our economy.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, in introducing the Small Business \nExport Growth Act, which would help small businesses better navigate \nthe complex process of promoting and selling their goods abroad.\n  Senator Shaheen and I serve together on the Small Business Committee, \nand as she mentioned, we held a field hearing in Manchester, New \nHampshire, last August to examine the role of exports in small business \ngrowth and job creation. We heard testimony from key national and New \nHampshire-based stakeholders about ways to improve coordination among \nregulatory agencies, and how to ease the burdens faced by small \nbusiness owners seeking to grow and export their products to foreign \nmarkets. The Small Business Export Growth Act represents a commonsense, \nbipartisan response to the issues identified at that hearing.\n  This legislation makes improvements to the operational efficiency of \nthe Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, TPCC, and improves \nCongressional oversight of the TPCC's activities. The bill also gives \nthe Small Business Administration a larger voice in developing export \npolicy and facilitates more networking opportunities for small \nbusinesses.\n  New Hampshire companies export to 160 countries and our exports are \nincreasing at the fourth highest rate of any State. In fact, New \nHampshire is leading the ten northeastern states in exports. Since \n2003, New Hampshire exports have risen three times faster than the \nState's economy. Small businesses comprise over 96 percent of all New \nHampshire firms, and it is imperative that we empower them with the \ntools they need to grow and hire. Opening markets around the world for \nour small businesses is an area in which we can find bipartisan \nagreement.\n  During the Manchester Small Business Week Forum I attended yesterday, \nI heard first-hand about the challenges small business owners are \nfacing as they try to grow and create jobs in this tough economic \nclimate. Exporting represents an enormous opportunity, not only for New \nHampshire small businesses, but for small businesses across the \ncountry. The Small Business Export Growth Act will help smaller firms \nto compete in the global marketplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/22/senate-section/article/S3429-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2127.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In this title, the following definitions \n     shall apply:\n       (1) 100-year floodplain.--The term ``100-year floodplain'' \n     means that area which is subject to inundation from a flood \n     having a 1-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any \n     given year.\n       (2) 500-year floodplain.--The term ``500-year floodplain'' \n     means that area which is subject to inundation from a flood \n     having a 0.2-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in \n     any given year.\n       (3) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n       (4) National flood insurance program.--The term ``National \n     Flood Insurance Program'' means the program established under \n     the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4011 et \n     seq.).\n       (5) Write your own.--The term ``Write Your Own'' means the \n     cooperative undertaking between the insurance industry and \n     the Federal Insurance Administration which allows \n     participating property and casualty insurance companies to \n     write and service standard flood insurance policies.\n       (b) Common Terminology.--Except as otherwise provided in \n     this title, any terms used in this title shall have the \n     meaning given to such terms under section 1370 of the \n     National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4121).\n\n     SEC. 104.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Commission on Natural \n     Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which struck the \n     United States in 2005, caused, by some estimates, in excess \n     of $200,000,000,000 in total economic losses;\n       (2) many meteorologists predict that the United States is \n     in a period of increased hurricane activity;\n       (3) the Federal Government and State governments have \n     provided billions of dollars to pay for losses from natural \n     catastrophes, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic \n     eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, droughts, \n     and other natural catastrophes;\n       (4) many Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to \n     obtain and afford property and casualty insurance coverage;\n       (5) some insurers are not renewing insurance policies, are \n     excluding certain risks, such as wind damage, and are \n     increasing rates and deductibles in some markets;\n       (6) the inability of property and business owners in \n     vulnerable areas to obtain and afford property and casualty \n     insurance coverage endangers the national economy and public \n     health and safety;\n       (7) almost every State in the United States is at risk of a \n     natural catastrophe, including hurricanes, earthquakes, \n     volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, flooding, wildfires, \n     droughts, and other natural catastrophes;\n       (8) building codes and land use regulations play an \n     indispensable role in managing catastrophe risks, by \n     preventing building in high risk areas and ensuring that \n     appropriate mitigation efforts are completed where building \n     has taken place;\n       (9) several proposals have been introduced in Congress to \n     address the affordability and availability of natural \n     catastrophe insurance across the United States, but there is \n     no consensus on what, if any, role the Federal Government \n     should play; and\n       (10) an efficient and effective approach to assessing \n     natural catastrophe risk management and insurance is to \n     establish a nonpartisan commission to study the management of \n     natural catastrophe risk, and to require such commission to \n     timely report to Congress on its findings.\n\n     SEC. 203. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a nonpartisan Commission on Natural \n     Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance (in this title \n     referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 204.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Preserve Access to \n     Affordable Generics Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \n     Restoration Act (Public Law 98 417) (referred to in this \n     title as the ``1984 Act''), was enacted with the intent of \n     facilitating the early entry of generic drugs while \n     preserving incentives for innovation.\n       (2) Prescription drugs make up 10 percent of the national \n     health care spending but for the past decade have been one of \n     the fastest growing segments of health care expenditures.\n       (3) Until recently, the 1984 Act was successful in \n     facilitating generic competition to the benefit of consumers \n     and health care payers--although 67 percent of all \n     prescriptions dispensed in the United States are generic \n     drugs, they account for only 20 percent of all expenditures.\n       (4) Generic drugs cost substantially less than brand name \n     drugs, with discounts off the brand price sometimes exceeding \n     90 percent.\n       (5) Federal dollars currently account for an estimated 30 \n     percent of the $235,000,000,000 spent on prescription drugs \n     in 2008, and this share is expected to rise to 40 percent by \n     2018.\n       (6)(A) In recent years, the intent of the 1984 Act has been \n     subverted by certain settlement agreements between brand \n     companies and their potential generic competitors that make \n     ``reverse payments'' which are payments by the brand company \n     to the generic company.\n       (B) These settlement agreements have unduly delayed the \n     marketing of low-cost generic drugs contrary to free \n     competition, the interests of consumers, and the principles \n     underlying antitrust law.\n       (C) Because of the price disparity between brand name and \n     generic drugs, such agreements are more profitable for both \n     the brand and generic manufacturers than competition, and \n     will become increasingly common unless prohibited.\n       (D) These agreements result in consumers losing the \n     benefits that the 1984 Act was intended to provide.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by \n     stopping anticompetitive agreements between brand name and \n     generic drug manufacturers that limit, delay, or otherwise \n     prevent competition from generic drugs; and\n       (2) to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by \n     prohibiting anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical \n     industry that harm consumers.\n\n     SEC. _03. UNLAWFUL COMPENSATION FOR DELAY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 44 et seq.) is amended by--\n       (1) redesignating section 28 as section 29; and\n       (2) inserting before section 29, as redesignated, the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 28.
