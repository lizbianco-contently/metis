Madam President, I want to make a couple of \nobservations this morning about what is going on in Washington at the \nmoment and what is not. What is going on is that Democrats are obsessed \nfor some reason with raising taxes. That is the only possible way to \nexplain their latest idea to impose a permanent tax hike on about \n300,000 U.S. business owners and then use the money to bail out cities \nand States that cannot pay their bills. That is the proposal we will be \nvoting on apparently tomorrow.\n  I do not know if our friends on the other side have noticed, but \nWashington cannot pay its own bills right now. Think about it. The \nFederal Government spent $3.6 trillion last fiscal year, a new all-time \nrecord. And in the wake of the single largest spending year in history, \nDemocrats want to put together another bailout.\n  Add up the projected deficits of all 50 States this year and you get \n$103 billion. That is all 50 States' deficits added up. Well, what \nabout us? What about us here in Washington? We are expected to run a \ndeficit of $1.3 trillion. Washington needs to prove it can get its own \nhouse in order before it starts demanding more money from job creators \nand throwing together another bailout.\n  This is the third time in 3 years the President has asked us to bail \nout the States. How many more times? And how many more billions before \nsomeone realizes this is a very bad idea? More bailouts. More bailouts \nare not going to solve the problem. They will just enable it.\n  But the bottom line is this: Everyone knows the last thing you want \nto do in a jobs crisis is raise taxes. It is common sense. The \nPresident himself has said as much. But for some reason he is \ndetermined to keep trying anyway. And Republicans are not about to go \nalong with it. So Democratic leaders in Congress have decided to do \nnothing instead. If they do not get their tax hike, then they do not \nwant to do anything at all. That is why rather than working with us on \nlegislation that would get the government out of the way so the private \nsector can create jobs, including legislation that is in the \nPresident's own bill, they have\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\nchoreographed a political sideshow this very week.\n  Here is how it works: The President proposes a stimulus bill and \ncalls it a jobs bill. Congress rejects it in a bipartisan way for very \nsensible and straightforward reasons. The President then goes on a bus \ntour to criticize Republicans for voting against the so-called jobs \nbill. Democratic leaders consult with the White House on breaking the \nsame bill into smaller pieces. And how do they break it up? By \nidentifying parts they know Republicans will oppose, then add the tax \nhike just to make sure. Then another bus tour or a press conference \nwith the President complaining about Republicans again. Repeat for 13 \nmonths in the hopes that Americans will forget they are all now living \nunder the economic policies that were enacted during the first 2 years \nof the Obama administration, and hope for success. That is the game \nplan. In other words, they are actually designing legislation on the \nother side to fail so they will have someone else to blame for the \neconomy 13 months from now. That is what is going on in the Senate this \nweek.\n  So what is not going on? What is not going on is the kind of \nbipartisan cooperation Americans want. My friend the majority leader is \nout there telling people the Republicans are rooting for the economy to \nfail. Nothing could be further from the truth. Look, if Republicans \nwanted the economy to fail, we would all line up behind the President's \neconomic policies rather than opposing them, because they have not \nsolved this jobs crisis we have been in. We have done that.\n\n  The President got everything he wanted the first 2 years he was in \noffice. So I think it is time Democrats realize they were elected to \nlead, not to choreograph political theater. It is completely \npreposterous. At a time when 14 million Americans are looking for a job \nin this country, for the President to be riding around on a bus saying \nwe should raise taxes, it is completely preposterous for the President \nto be riding around on a bus saying we should be raising taxes on the \nvery folks who create jobs.\n  Think about that. We have 14 million people out of work and two self-\nidentified conservatives for every liberal in this country, and the \nPresident is out there doing his best Howard Dean impersonation. He is \ncompletely out of touch. Let's forget about the tax hikes.\n  Let's drop the talking points about millionaires and billionaires and \nlet's work together on bipartisan jobs legislation that is designed to \npass, not designed to fail.\n  Republican leadership in the House and Republican leadership here in \nthe Senate has been crystal clear. We are ready to work with the White \nHouse on legislation on which we can all agree. The two parties did it \nlast week on trade bills. There are other areas where we can do the \nsame.\n  The House voted on three bills this year, one as recently as last \nweek, to roll back excessive regulations by bureaucrats in Washington \nwho are destroying jobs and threatening to put even more Americans out \nof work. All three of those House bills got solid bipartisan support. \nWhy do we not have those votes in the Senate and show that we can work \ntogether to help businesses create jobs? Let's park the campaign bus, \nput away the talking points, and do something to address the jobs \ncrisis.\n  The American people want action. The election is 13 months away. Why \ndo we not do what we were elected to do?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6702-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, my friend the Republican leader--and I \nwill talk in more detail in a few minutes--is complaining about a tax \nof one-half of 1 percent--one-half of 1 percent on people who make more \nthan $1 million a year to pay for a program that would stop teachers \nfrom being laid off and rehire some of the teachers who have been laid \noff.\n  The massive layoffs we have had in America today of course are rooted \nin the last administration. It is very clear that private sector jobs \nhave been doing fine. It is the public sector jobs where we have lost \nhuge numbers. That is what this legislation is all about. It is \nunfortunate my friend the Republican leader is complaining about that.\n  I would also note that my friend said the House passed another bill. \nWell, they pass lots of bills, but they rarely go anyplace. A report \nled by Henry Waxman of California, long-time Member of the House, \nindicated last week that the House has voted 168 times to roll back \nregulations on clean air, clean water. These safeguards are important \nto have a healthier America. But the Republican response has been \ncutting back environmental and health safeguards, I guess hoping that a \nsicker, more polluted country is a better place to create jobs. It is \nnot.\n  I am going to talk a little bit today about the legislation that I \nmoved to on Monday dealing with, as I have indicated, maintaining jobs \nfor teachers, firefighters, and police officers. Seventy-five percent \nof Americans support this legislation. This is not a poll that some \nDemocratic pollster did, it is a CNN-Gallup poll.\n  This week, my Republican colleagues have rallied against teachers and \nfirst responders. That is our latest proposal, to create hundreds of \nthousands of American jobs and save other jobs. Republicans point to a \nsimilar program with a proven track record keeping 422,000 teachers in \nthe classroom. That is important. They are using this as evidence that \nour programs are a failure.\n  I know the American Recovery Act saved Nevada from going into \nbankruptcy. The money we got there, hundreds of millions of dollars, \nallowed the Governor, a Republican Governor, to save Medicaid. Money is \nfungible. It saved teachers. It saved a lot of programs in Nevada.\n  So I say again, they call Democratic legislation--my Republican \ncolleagues, my friend the Republican leader--legislation that created \nhundreds of thousands of jobs a failure. That is because they are using \na different benchmark for success than we are.\n  Democrats' No. 1 priority is to create jobs. There are 14 million \nAmericans out of work today. So to us, putting hundreds of thousands of \npeople back to work teaching children, having more police patrolling \nour streets, firefighters fighting our fires, doing the rescue work \nthey do so well, is our priority.\n  It seems that the No. 1 priority of my Republican colleagues is to \ndefeat President Obama. Their strategy is to keep the economy weak as \nlong as possible, so they oppose legislation with a solid record of \ncreating jobs. Never mind that Republicans have yet to propose a single \nidea on their own--a single idea--to get 14 million people working \nagain. Never mind that in the past they have supported every one of the \njob-creating measures we have proposed. We have a bill that was \ndefeated, so we have taken pieces of that legislation, and virtually \nevery piece of that legislation Republicans, in the past, have \nsupported.\n  It appears that Republicans suit up every day and come to work with \nthe sole purpose of defeating President Obama instead of suiting up \nwith the sole purpose of creating jobs. And they oppose the policies \nthat will turn our economy around for one reason and one reason only: \npolitics and defeating President Obama.\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\n  The famous author Gore Vidal once said: ``It is not enough to \nsucceed. Others must fail.'' It seems this is the Republican motto this \nCongress. To me and to most Americans, putting politics ahead of this \ncountry's economic future is so far outside of the mainstream, it is \nbarely on the map. That is where the Republicans have headed.\n  Republicans have been candid about their goal this Congress. My \nfriend the minority leader said:\n\n       The single most important thing we want to achieve is for \n     President Obama to be a one-term President.\n\n  Defeating job-creating legislation, defeating the economy, and \ndefeating the President--that is how Senate Republicans measure \nsuccess. But it is not how Republicans in the rest of the country \nmeasure success. The rest of America doesn't share those out-of-touch \nvalues. Like Democrats, the rest of the country believes there are some \nthings more important than politics, even in an election year. Creating \njobs is that most important thing.\n  To Democrats and the vast majority of Americans, there is no goal \nmore important than getting our economy humming once again. That is why \nAmericans overwhelmingly support our plan to retain or rehire more than \n400,000 teachers and put more cops and firefighters back doing the \nthings they do to keep our communities safe.\n  In Nevada, this legislation will provide an additional $260 million \nto keep teachers in the classroom and maintain class size. It will \nsupport 3,600 jobs in my State and pump much needed money back into the \neconomy.\n  Seventy-five percent of Americans believe we should help State and \nlocal governments put teachers, police, and firefighters back to work, \nand 76 percent of Americans agree that the wealthiest people in this \ncountry should help get our economy back on track. I repeat, three out \nof four Americans--actually, it is a little more than that: 76 \npercent--including two-thirds of Republicans, support the Democrats' \nTeachers and First Responders Back to Work Act.\n  Republicans in Congress aren't just out of touch with America, they \nare out of touch with other Republicans. Fifty-four percent of \nRepublicans support the Democrats' plan to create jobs building roads, \nbridges and schools. Fifty-eight percent of Republicans support our \nplan to extend the payroll tax for American workers and businesses. \nSixty-three percent of Republicans support our plan to put teachers in \nthe classroom and police officers on the beat. Fifty-six percent of \nRepublicans even support our proposal to ask millionaires and \nbillionaires to contribute their fair share--one-half of 1 percent--to \npull our Nation out of this terrible recession.\n  The trend is clear: Americans overwhelmingly support the Democrats' \nplan to create jobs, even with Republicans supporting our ideas by a \nwide margin. Yet my friend the Republican leader said this yesterday on \nthe Senate floor:\n\n       There's a growing bipartisan opposition to trying the same \n     failed policies again. And there's bipartisan opposition to \n     raising taxes, especially at a time when 14 million Americans \n     are out of work.\n\n  Well, I say to my friend the Republican leader, you are entitled to \nyour own opinion but not to your own facts. There is not bipartisan \nopposition to legislation that will create and save jobs for teachers \nand first responders. On the contrary, there is bipartisan support for \nthe legislation. I have just gone over those numbers. Republicans, like \nthe rest of Americans, do not oppose our proposal to ask millionaires \nto contribute their fair share. On the contrary, they support that \nproposal--a one-half of 1 percent surtax on people making more than $1 \nmillion a year. It is only in Congress that Republicans oppose job-\ncreating legislation and fair tax policy for the sake of politics.\n  In the rest of the country, Republicans, like other Americans, are \nfocused on where their next paycheck will come from and how they will \nmake their mortgage payment. Like Democrats, they are tired of \nRepublicans in Congress rooting for the economy to fail instead of \nworking with us to secure our economic future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6703-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, in some ways, I hate to come to the floor \nand talk about this because I very seldom do, but I am announcing to \nall my colleagues and to the administration that I am putting a hold on \nall Treasury Department nominations until I get something resolved.\n  Let me back up and tell the story. Some of my colleagues are familiar \nwith this story because this has come up a few times before and I have \nalready spoken on the floor a couple times about this and certainly in \nthe Homeland Security Committee I have spoken about this.\n  A few years ago, in Arkansas, we had some floods. In this one \nparticular area around Mountain View, AR, some people's houses were \nflooded. FEMA came in. In one particular case--in the Guglielmanas \ncase, which is a family there--they talked to this couple. They are on \nSocial Security. They talked to this couple about how they are entitled \nto some FEMA recovery money to repair their home. FEMA was actually in \nthe home, took pictures, helped them fill out the paperwork, walked \nthem through the entire process, and they ended up getting $27,000 in \nFEMA money for disaster recovery. The Guglielmanas did everything \nabsolutely by the book. They followed all of\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\nFEMA's directions. They did it picture perfect, exactly the way we \nwould think all citizens should conduct their business.\n  Then, 3 years later, they got a notice in the mail and FEMA said: Oh, \nwe messed up. We shouldn't have given you that money because of some \ntechnical reason and because of that we now want all that money back.\n  They worked a great hardship on this family. This is supposed to be \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people. That is \nnot what has happened in this case. This has worked a great hardship on \nthis family.\n  There are lots of community efforts around these floods: local civic \nclubs, churches, the community at large rolled out to help people. The \nGuglielmanas said they didn't need that because they had FEMA's help. \nSo they have foregone a lot of local assistance, a lot of charity \nassistance, general help from their friends and neighbors because of \nFEMA. Now FEMA has come back and said they owe them the entire $27,000. \nThis could ruin them financially.\n  I have met with FEMA Director Fugate. He and I have had what I would \nthink of as productive conversations, although this matter hasn't been \nresolved. One of the things we talked about is to get an amendment to \nthe existing statute. We are working on that. We are working that bill \nthrough the system right now in the Senate. I have worked with \ncolleagues on the Homeland Security Committee and also the \nAppropriations Committee. I am not saying we would have unanimous \nagreement on my approach, but certainly I have been trying to work with \nanybody in the Senate to make this bill better.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened in the last few days is FEMA has now \ntaken the additional step of turning this matter over to the Department \nof Treasury for debt collection. To add insult to injury and to rub \nsalt in the wounds, this $27,000 debt, now with fines and penalties and \ninterest, has gone to $37,000--$37,000 in debt after these folks were \nassured by the government they were completely entitled to because this \nwas flood recovery; and the only reason they are not entitled to it is \nbecause of some technical issues that FEMA should have recognized from \nday one. They should have never offered to help these people, but what \nthey have done is, they have now caused them great injury.\n  This is a matter of equity and fairness. Enough is enough. We have \nbeen talking to FEMA for months about this. Now Treasury is involved. \nEnough is enough. We need to get this resolved for this family and \nmaybe a few others.\n  It is not just localized in Arkansas. We are going to see this happen \nover and over around the country because FEMA has a backlog of these \ncases--it is a long story--that got tied up in litigation for a few \nyears and I can almost guarantee that virtually every Senator in this \nChamber at some point is going to have to deal with this.\n  I hope all will listen to what I am saying and, hopefully, help me \nget this resolved. But that is why I am putting a hold on all the \nTreasury nominees. We need to get this resolved, and we are going to do \nwhatever it takes to get it resolved. We want to resolve this situation \nfairly for this family in Arkansas. Again, they are just the first of \nmany whom we are going to see who have this same type problem.\n  FEMA has done them harm. Our government has done them harm and put \nthem at a disadvantage. There is a principle in law called detrimental \nreliance. These people clearly relied on the government and relied on \nFEMA to their detriment and they are paying the price and the penalty \nfor that now. When the IRS and Treasury gets involved, there are \npenalties and interest. American citizens should not be treated this \nway, especially those who are playing by the rules and don't have any \nother recourse.\n  That is all I wanted to say in my morning business--I see we have \nseveral in the Chamber to talk on other matters--that I am putting \nTreasury on notice that I am going to hold all their nominees until we \nsit down and work through this and, hopefully, get a good and fair \nresult for this one family in Arkansas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, there has been a lot of talk about how \nwe go about rebuilding the infrastructure after recent disasters and \nhow we assist struggling States to accomplish that goal.\n  Many in this body do not believe the Federal Government should borrow \nmoney in an attempt to bail out States. We have our own financial mess \nright here at the Federal level that citizens across this country are \nsaying, rightfully so, we have to get solved. But we can all agree that \none of the best things the Federal Government can do is get out of the \nway and cut through the redtape. We must remove Federal hurdles and \nbarriers, so much cumbersome process that constitutes the largest \nbarrier to rebuilding our infrastructure.\n  In fact, I am very pleased to rise this morning and report there is \nlanguage in the appropriations bill that I believe should get unanimous \nsupport in this body. It is part of the transportation section.\n  It simply says States may rebuild their roads and their bridges that \nhave been damaged in disasters without having to repeat environmental \nstudy after study.\n  Gosh, what a commonsense solution.\n  Keep in mind, we are talking only about replacing roads and bridges \nthat have already been through process, that are already there, that \nwere carrying traffic before the disaster. What we are saying is the \nmost practical we could possibly say; that is, there is no need to \nrepeat the expense of the time-consuming studies. Let's get out there \nand help the States get the work done. In other words, it saves States \ntime and money by cutting through redtape and allowing them to, very \nsimply, rebuild their roads and bridges.\n  I commend the senior Senator from the State of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson, \nfor authoring this language. It is a commonsense approach, something we \nare used to in the Midwest, and it doesn't add one dime or one dollar \nto the Federal deficit.\n  This language should receive unanimous bipartisan support, especially \nfrom every Senator whose home State has been hit by disaster. \nLiterally, as I speak, our State is trying to figure out how to \nrecover.\n  Notwithstanding the fact that I think most people would agree this is \nso common sense, my colleague from Washington State, Senator Murray, \nhas an amendment that would strike this language. I can't imagine why \nthis body would stand in the way of States trying to rebuild their \nroads and bridges. In fact, in addition to States, Senator Nelson's \nlanguage would help counties and communities that are so cash strapped, \nwith so limited tax base, saying we will help them too.\n  For local authorities, the cost of repeating environmental studies is \ncrushing. Even President Obama has called on his administration to drop \nunnecessary regulations and to look for redtape to cut through. Senator \nMurray's amendment, in all due respect, would do exactly the opposite. \nHer amendment would dig our bureaucratic heels into the sand, and it \nwould say to States and communities and counties we know they have been \nstruggling, we know they have been hit hard by disaster, but we are \ngoing to keep our expensive hurdles squarely in place. We are going to \nforce them to jump over each and every one of them.\n  The language authored by my colleague, Senator Nelson, is a \ncommonsense way to remove these Federal hurdles. I received assurance \njust this morning from the department of roads in my home State that \nthis language would clear the way for several rebuilding projects in \nNebraska. But we are not alone. I am guessing road departments across \nthis country would say the same. There is little doubt in my mind that \nit would do the same for other States that have been faced with \ndisasters, from the Midwest to the Northeast. We should rally behind \nSenator Nelson's language and make sure his efforts to clear a pathway \nfor recovery are not blocked by the Murray amendment.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote against the Murray amendment, to \nstand with me on the side of cutting redtape preventing States from \nrebuilding roads and bridges.\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to speak to an issue that I think \nhas been on the minds of a lot of people here and hopefully people \nacross this country too; that is, this failed CLASS Act Program, which \nlast week we finally got some--I would characterize it as good news \nbecause I think this is a program that was destined to fail.\n  On Friday last week, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen \nSebelius came out and said: Despite our best analytical efforts, I do \nnot see a path forward for CLASS implementation at this time.\n  Essentially, what came with that and what accompanied that was a big \nvolume of analysis that had been done that essentially supports the \nconclusion that it doesn't add up. We can't make the math work. I think \nthat is something that hopefully my colleagues, as what we know now, \nwill recognize; that we ought to eliminate and we ought to repeal this \nCLASS Act once and for all. That is something I tried to do as we were \ndebating the health care bill almost 2 years ago. I offered an \namendment in December of 2009 that would repeal the CLASS Act, \nbelieving at the time it wasn't going to work. We had, at that time, \nplenty of evidence to that effect. Unfortunately, it was included as a \npart of the health care reform bill to help pay for it. At that time, \nit was estimated it would generate about $70 billion in revenue to be \nused to offset the cost of the health care bill or at least to put it \nin balance and to claim there was some deficit reduction associated \nwith it.\n  I think the more recent estimate of what it would generate in terms \nof revenues in the early years is on the order of about $86 billion. \nBut we--those of us who have been skeptics about this program--\nsuggested at the very beginning that this was not, in fact, the case, \nthat it was a budgetary gimmick, and that it was going to saddle the \nNation with additional debts. That was what the Congressional Budget \nOffice concluded. There would be revenue in the early years, but as you \ngot into the outyears, as the premiums came in there would be some \nrevenues, but in the outyears, when the demands on the program started \nto come in, it just didn't add up and would add significantly to the \nFederal deficit. I think that is a conclusion now that has been drawn \neven by those who supported the program.\n  So my thinking at this time is that we, as a Senate--and hopefully \nthe House of Representatives--ought to move to repeal the CLASS Act \nonce and for all. We should not leave this on the books and allow it to \nbecome an opportunity at some point in the future for someone to say we \nought to try to reactivate this or implement this, knowing full well it \ndoes not work.\n  There were a lot of warning signals along the way that were ignored. \nThere were repeated warnings by the Actuary and the administration that \nthis was not going to work that were ignored by the Obama \nadministration in their push to pass health care reform.\n  We did a report not that long ago. There was a working group that \nexamined this. The report was called ``CLASS's Untold Story.'' It was \nmyself and some of my colleagues in the Senate and some of my House \ncolleagues who requested it and delved into a lot of the e-mail traffic \nthat occurred prior to its inclusion in the health care reform bill. We \ncame across a number of warnings that were issued by the HHS Actuary.\n  The Chief Actuary predicted at the time that this would result in an \n``insurance death spiral.'' He said:\n\n       This could be a terminal problem for this program. The \n     program is intended to be actuarially sound, but at first \n     glance this goal may be impossible. The resulting premium \n     increases required to prevent fund exhaustion would likely \n     reduce the number of participants, and a classic assessment \n     spiral or insurance death spiral would ensue.\n\n  That was in May 2009. In May 2009, that warning was coming from the \nActuary at HHS.\n  Some time passed. This continued to be part of the discussion with \nregard to the health care bill. Come August or July of 2009--and this \nwas again after additional analysis, review, and examination of this \nparticular proposal--the Actuary went on to say:\n\n       Thirty-six years of actuarial experience lead me to believe \n     that this program would collapse in short order and require \n     significant Federal subsidies to continue.\n\n  It would collapse in short order. That is what was said by the HHS \nActuary in July of 2009.\n  So they continued to plow forward, thinking that somehow they were \ngoing to be able to salvage this program, figure out a way to make it \nwork.\n  In the August and September timeframe of 2009, the Actuary again \nsays:\n\n       As you know, I continue to be convinced that the CLASS \n     proposal is not actuarially sound.\n\n  That was the expert advice that was given to the administration about \nthis proposal way back in 2009. Yet they plowed ahead and in December \n2009 added it to the health care bill, assuming it would help offset \nthe cost of that health care legislation.\n  At the time, many of my colleagues here on the floor talked about \nwhat a great program it was and how it all was going to pay off and was \nall going to balance out. We had people say it was a critical program, \nit was a breakthrough program, it was a win-win. We had Democrats come \nover here and talk about the virtues of this program--I believe knowing \nfull well there were questions about it.\n  Having said that, there was a big push on at the time to pass health \ncare reform. As a consequence, this piece of that reform was included \nnotwithstanding our efforts to repeal it or to strike it at the time. \nSo we went forward. Here we are now 18, 19 months later, and there is \nfull recognition of the fact that this does not pencil out, it does not \nadd up, the math flat does not work.\n  Where do we go from here? In my view, what we ought to be doing is \nrepealing this bill, which is why it seems mystifying to me that the \nadministration is now suggesting that if Congress were to repeal the \nCLASS Act, he would veto the repeal bill. You have all this actuarial \ndata; you have all these statements; you now have all this analysis \nthat has been done that demonstrates the very point we were making at \nthe initial consideration of this; that is, it was just not going to \nwork.\n  So I hope and invite my colleagues here on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in the effort to repeal this legislation. I introduced a bill, \nalong with Senator Graham, back in April of this year that would repeal \nthe CLASS Act. It has 32 cosponsors. I hope we get enough cosponsors \nhere in the Senate to where we can put an end to this once and for all.\n  We are going to be looking for opportunities to do that in the weeks \nand the months ahead because, as I said, this is something that clearly \ndoes not work. It now not only has all the arguments that were being \nmade at the time prior to its passage, but subsequent to its passage \nall the analysis that has been done comes to the same conclusion; that \nis, the numbers just do not add up.\n  What does that mean for the future of long-term care? I submit there \nare other things we should do. I don't think this is an issue which is \ngoing to go away. We have more people who are living longer in this \ncountry. Long-term care is a very serious issue. But going about it and \ntrying to fix it in a way that would burden future generations with \nmore and more mountains of debt piled on their backs--the cost of this \nover time--is the wrong way to go about it, and that is precisely what \nthis particular approach would do.\n  We have had many discussions about various remedies for the long-term \ncare issue. We will continue to put our ideas forward in hopes we can \naddress it as part of some bill that would take a look and examine \nthese issues but do it in a way that is fiscally responsible, fiscally \nsound, that is actuarially sound, and that does not create the massive \namount of borrowing, the massive amount of debt, and that does not put \nin place a flawed program that we knew at its inception was not going \nto work.\n  I hope we will put an end to this, that we can get colleagues on both \nsides together to agree to that, and that we will be able to add \ncosponsors to that piece of legislation and look for the first \nopportunity to repeal this legislation and make sure we end it once and\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\nfor all, knowing full well this was ill-conceived and ultimately would \nbe a failed program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I am here today, as we debate H.R. 2112, the Agriculture, \nRural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, to address a particular provision that, in my view, \nneeds to be addressed. I also hope to have the opportunity later today \nto offer an amendment regarding the Watershed Rehabilitation Program \nand to allocate some additional funds for that program, and I hope to \nhave the chance to speak during the debate on this bill on the proposed \nschool lunch regulations the Senator from Maine has so appropriately \naddressed previously.\n  At this time, I would like to turn my attention to a problem with the \npending legislation; that is, its failure to address the proposed rule \ntitled ``Implementation of Regulations Required Under Title XI of the \nFood, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008; Conduct in Violation of the \nAct,'' commonly known as the GIPSA rule. This proposed rule has the \npotential to adversely affect livestock producers in my State and \naround the country, as well as consumers of meat products.\n  The House included a funding limitation on implementation of this \nrule in its appropriations bill. That is not included in the Senate \nversion of the bill. I am a member of the agricultural appropriations \nsubcommittee and believe that, in this case, the House is correct.\n  Initially, this rule that the Department of Agriculture is proposing \ngrew out of the 2008 farm bill. As a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives back then, I was a member of the conference committee \nthat developed that farm bill. It directed the Department of \nAgriculture to issue regulations in five very discrete areas.\n  In June 2010, the Department of Agriculture responded with the \nissuance of its proposed GIPSA regulations that clearly went way beyond \nthe mandate of that 2008 farm bill and way beyond the Department of \nAgriculture's authority under the Packers and Stockyards Act. The GIPSA \nrule as written is exactly the type of burdensome regulation that was \nthe focus of our President's January 18 Executive order.\n  In addition to the Executive order, the President promised to have a \nvery transparent and open administration in regard to the development \nof rules. Unfortunately, the process surrounding the GIPSA rule has \nbeen far from transparent. This rule was proposed with zero economic \nanalysis from the Department despite the major impacts it could have on \nthe agricultural economy.\n  For months, USDA denied that this would be an economically \nsignificant rule, until multiple private sector studies and \noverwhelming comments from agricultural producers and others, such as \nthose in my home State of Kansas, finally convinced the USDA this rule \nwould indeed have a significant economic impact. Private analysis at \nthat time indicated that these GIPSA regulations, if finalized as \nproposed, would cost the U.S. meat and poultry industry nearly $1 \nbillion.\n  Under this pressure, the Department of Agriculture is now conducting \nan economic analysis. While I certainly welcome that economic analysis, \nI am very concerned about whether this analysis will be made public \nbefore a final rule is announced and whether the public will be able to \nanalyze and comment on the data and methodology used by USDA to \ncomplete the study.\n  In fact, I asked the Secretary of Agriculture, during an agriculture \nappropriations subcommittee hearing, if he would release that economic \nanalysis before the comment period concluded or open a comment period \nafter the analysis is complete so people can make comments based upon \nwhat the economic analysis demonstrates. Certainly, in my view, the \nSecretary failed on a number of occasions to answer my question and \ngive me that commitment that the process would be open and transparent \nand that a comment period would occur.\n  I sincerely believe it is incumbent upon this Congress to exercise \nits oversight discretion and direct the necessary transparency and \nthoughtful analysis that USDA to date has not publicly provided. We \nneed time to study and comment on the methodology, and we need to make \nsure we get these rules right if they are going to be implemented. It \nwould be irresponsible to not adjust the rules to mitigate a negative \neconomic impact determined by the Department's own economic analysis.\n  As I mentioned, the House included a provision barring funding for \nthe current proposed GIPSA regulations, and USDA should be delayed from \ngoing forward until it can limit itself to the five areas set forth in \nthe farm bill--its congressional authority--and until public comments \ncan occur regarding that economic analysis. We ought not have a final \nrule without the benefit of the economic analysis. The Department of \nAgriculture should not just be going through the motions because there \nwas insistence that an economic analysis occur. We need to be able to \nmitigate any negative impacts that we learn from that economic \nanalysis.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity at this point in the \nday to address an issue that is appropriate as we discuss the \nagricultural appropriations bill throughout today. I look forward to \nbeing back on the floor later today to offer an amendment to that bill \nregarding watershed rehabilitation and also at that time to speak in \nregard to what I view as some crazy ideas that are proposed School \nLunch Program regulations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to remember the 10th anniversary \nof the anthrax attacks on our country.\n  During the weeks following the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2011, our Nation was exposed to chemical warfare for the first time.\n  Two anthrax attacks were delivered through our country's postal \nsystem. The first set of letters was mailed to media outlets, including \nABC, CBS, NBC, the National Enquirer, and the New York Post in \nSeptember.\n  Three weeks later, two other anthrax letters were mailed to U.S. \nSenators--Senator Daschle and Senator Patrick Leahy. The letter to \nSenator Leahy never made it to Capitol Hill. The envelope addressed to \nSenator Daschle, however, was opened on October 15 in the Hart Senate \nOffice Building in the mailroom of the office I use today. Emergency \nresponders rushed to join Capitol Police to evaluate the situation and \ndetermine the extent of contamination.\n  It was 10 years ago this week on October 17, 2001, the Capitol was \nevacuated. At that time I was a Member of the House of Representatives. \nI remember the fear and trepidation all Americans felt in the days and \nweeks following September 11.\n  I take this time to honor the courage of our Nation's Federal \nemployees. Two made the ultimate sacrifice, dying from the exposure of \nthe deadly anthrax toxin at the postal facility that handled all the \nmail that came to the Senate and House offices. U.S. postal workers \nThomas L. Morris, Jr. and Joseph P. Curseen, Jr. gave the ultimate \nsacrifice after being exposed to the infected Senate mail while they \nworked in the Brentwood post office facility here in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. Morris and Mr. Curseen were Maryland residents. Like so many \nother Federal employees, they went to work every day, serving the \nAmerican people and trying to earn a living for themselves and their \nfamilies. Less than a week after being exposed to the deadly anthrax at \nthe mail facility, both men died of their exposures.\n  The Brentwood postal facility, which was shuttered for months while \nthe building was disinfected, now proudly bears their names, honoring \ntwo Federal employees who died doing their jobs.\n  Literally thousands of other Federal employees bravely went back to \nwork, making sure our government continued to function in the most \nuncertain of times. While most Federal workers\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\ncrammed together in small makeshift office space, other brave Federal \nemployees put themselves in harm's way trying to contain the spread of \nthe weaponized spores and to clean up the deadly bacteria.\n  It has been fashionable of late to criticize the Environmental \nProtection Agency, but I remind everyone that members of the EPA's \nregion 3 led the emergency response efforts following the anthrax \nattacks. They were joined by a small army of other EPA emergency \nresponders from around the country who responded to the call for extra \npersonnel to manage the massive decontamination efforts.\n  The EPA's headquarter staffers were fully engaged as well. The EPA \nnational pesticide program worked quickly to develop new methods \nnecessary to wipe out the anthrax. Scientists worked primarily out of \nEPA's pesticide lab, which is located 20 miles away in Fort Meade, MD.\n  It was not just EPA employees who answered the call to duty. Capitol \npolice were the first ones to respond, and they continued to provide \nprotection to legislative branch employees as well as the emergency \nresponders and the public.\n  The Department of Defense lent its expertise. As the cleanup \nprogressed, thousands of tests were taken and then sent to Fort Detrick \nin Maryland where chemical weapons specialists analyzed samples and \nreported results to the emergency command center. Defense Department \npersonnel were also engaged in the decontamination efforts, working \nside by side with EPA emergency responders.\n  The photos I brought to the floor today show some of the emergency \nresponders wearing specialized protective gear, working on the \ndecontamination of Senator Daschle's office. Each desk, chair, filing \ncabinet, and piece of paper in the office was removed. The last item to \nbe removed from room 509 at the Hart Building was an American flag that \nhung in Senator Daschle's front office. Emergency responders are seen \nhere folding the flag that was placed in a special sealed bag and sent \noff to be decontaminated. Countless employees at the Sergeant at Arms, \nthe Architect of the Capitol, and Senate and House staffers continued \nthe business of running our government and the legislature. It was \ncritical that Congress continue to function, demonstrating to the \nNation and the world that terrorist attacks could not cripple the \ninstitution of democracy.\n  Other Federal employees put themselves in harm's way during and after \nthe anthrax attacks. These Federal employees worked hard to do what \nmany thought impossible, putting public buildings back into use after a \nchemical attack. At great risk to themselves, they bravely met the \nchallenges to ensure our government continued to function.\n  Today I honor the memory of Thomas L. Morris, Jr. and Joseph P. \nCurseen, Jr. who gave their lives while engaged in public service. \nToday I salute those Federal employees who risked their own lives so \nthat the legislative branch of the greatest government on Earth could \ncontinue, and those who continued to work every day in the face of \ngrave danger and uncertainty. Today I simply want to give a heartfelt \nthank you to all of America's Federal employees. You recognize that \npublic service is an honorable calling and you work every day to keep \nthis Nation the great Nation it is.\n  With that, let me once again thank our Federal workforce and what \nthey do for our country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have come to the floor this \nmorning to talk about the most important issue facing our country and \nour people; that is, jobs and job creation. In a bit of good news last \nnight, overcoming 18 months of obstacles in the Senate, the Senate \npassed my Ski Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act that will \nhelp expand economic opportunities in many of our mountain resort towns \nin Colorado. It will also help create jobs throughout the rest of the \ncountry in States such as the Presiding Officer's, New York, which has \na robust ski industry, as our State does.\n  I wish to acknowledge Senators Barrasso of Wyoming and Risch of \nIdaho. They have been tremendous partners in this effort, both in this \nCongress and in the last one. I thank them upfront for their leadership \nin pushing for passage of this important piece of bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Even though our economy is showing some signs of recovery, there is \nstill a long way to go. This is especially true in rural communities \nthat are dotted all over my State of Colorado. I know this question of \njob creation is on the forefront of the minds of all my colleagues. It \nis on the minds of Coloradans wherever I am in the Centennial State. So \nthe action we took last night not only represents a major step forward \nin our efforts to create jobs, it is a reminder to the American people \nthat we can work together on commonsense, job-creating legislation.\n  Let me speak a little bit about the bill we passed last night. It is \nnarrowly tailored, it is pragmatic, it is bipartisan, it doesn't cost \none dime to the American taxpayers, and it reduces government \nregulation while allowing businesses to create more jobs. That is the \ndirection we need to head. It gives greater flexibility to businesses \nto productively use public lands. It facilitates outdoor recreation, \nand it endorses responsible use of our natural resources.\n  Often, ski areas are located on National Forest lands through the use \nof permits issued by the Federal Government that spell out what \nactivities are allowed. But under the existing law--although we are \ngoing to change the law given what we did last night--the National \nForest Service limits ski area permits primarily to ``Nordic and Alpine \nskiing.'' This is the phrase used in Federal regulation. But the \nclassification I mentioned doesn't reflect the full spectrum of snow \nsports or the use of ski areas for nonwinter activities. For example, \nthe word ``snowboarding'' is not used in the law, even though we know \nsnowboarding now exists in every single ski area across the country. So \nthe problem with that regulation is it has created uncertainty for both \nthe foresters and the skiers as to whether now other activities, \nparticularly those in the summer, can occur in permitted areas. In \neffect, ski areas on National Forest lands are restricted to winter \nrecreation as opposed to year-round recreation. One only has to imagine \nwhat will happen when we open ski areas to year-round recreation. We \nwill create opportunities for businesses to expand and openings for new \nbusinesses to explore previously restricted ventures. Colorado ski \nresorts have told me they will be able to create more jobs this year \nwhen they are given more flexibility, and Colorado's ski towns have \nsaid the same to me, so it is just plain common sense.\n  The Ski Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act clarifies how \nski area permits can be used. It ensures that ski area permits can be \nused for additional snow sports such as snowboarding, as well as \nspecifically authorizing the Forest Service to allow additional \nrecreational opportunities, such as summertime activities, in these \npermitted areas.\n  Let me note that the authority--this expanded authority--is limited. \nIt doesn't give ski areas carte blanche use of public lands. The \nprimary activity in the permit area must remain skiing or other snow \nsports.\n  We want to preserve the unique characteristics of our world-renowned \nmountain communities. Therefore, certain types of development--water \nparks, amusement parks, and other activities that require new and \nintrusive structures--are prohibited. Rather, we envision opening \nopportunities for zip lines, mountain bike terrain parks, Frisbee golf \ncourses, ropes courses and activities that are similar. As I mentioned, \nnot only will they increase economic activity and create new jobs, the \nski areas tell me it will actually help them recruit more Americans for \njobs that currently go to foreign visa holders.\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\n  Many Coloradans would love to work year-round in and around our \nmountain communities, but they are forced to take other jobs that can \nensure them year-round employment. Subsequently, our ski areas often \nrecruit visa holders to run the lifts, work in the resorts, and cover \nthe winter months because they oftentimes can't recruit locals for such \nshort-term employment. In effect, this bill we passed last night will \nhelp create year-round demand in our mountain communities and provide \nthe year-round employment that Coloradans need. This is a win-win \nsituation.\n  For those who earn a job because of this bill, it will be very \nwelcome news from a Congress they see as increasingly ineffective and \ndisengaged.\n  As I have implied and said already, I represent a State where the use \nand the enjoyment of the outdoors is just who we are. It is why we live \nin Colorado. One could say it is in our blood, but it is also in our \nwallets. Tourism and outdoor recreation is the No. 1 economic driver \nfor our State. Activities such as hiking, skiing, shooting, and angling \ncontribute over $10 billion a year to our economy, supporting over \n100,000 jobs and generating $500 million in State tax revenue.\n  This is not limited to Colorado. The Outdoor Industry Foundation \nfound that outdoor recreation activities add over $730 billion to the \nnational economy every year. In fact, during this time of economic \nuncertainty, outdoor recreation and tourism are two very bright spots \nin our economy. Perhaps most important, this is an area of our economy \nthat continues to grow. It has grown by more than 6 percent in just \n2011, and it has outpaced U.S. economic growth more generally.\n  More Americans are spending time outside, enjoying nature and getting \nexercise. I have long felt it is in the National interest to encourage \nAmericans to engage in outdoor activities that can contribute to our \nhealth and wellbeing. But as Americans enjoy recreating outdoors, they \nare also supporting a large and growing industry of supply stores, \nmanufacturers, guides, hotels, and other important businesses that are \nthe backbone of many rural communities.\n  Ski resorts are a major component of this economic sector in \nColorado, many western states, and, indeed, many places throughout the \ncountry. This bill is a huge priority for them and its passage--while \nlong overdue--is truly a remarkable move that will help job creation \nall across the country.\n  Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association, said \nit best when he noted:\n\n       Ski areas serve as a portal to the country's national \n     forests. Bringing summer and year-round recreation to rural \n     communities is the No. 1 priority in Washington for ski areas \n     today. We are anxiously awaiting to plan and implement year-\n     round operations at ski areas, create year-round jobs and \n     encourage more kids and families to enjoy the great outdoors. \n     All of this will of course benefit the rural communities in \n     which ski areas are located.\n\n  The ski areas have been great partners in this effort, and I cannot \nwait for President Obama to sign this important legislation into law so \nthey can begin immediately creating the important and well-paying jobs \nAmericans are desperately waiting for.\n  At a time when it seems as though Congress is too wrapped up in \npartisan wrangling to find commonsense ways to create jobs, this is a \nremarkable achievement. It signals to job seekers everywhere that not \nonly are we capable of finding creative ways to create jobs, but that \nwhen we put our minds to it, we can set aside our differences and work \ntogether.\n  I hope this bipartisan action will catch on and that we can continue \nto chip away at both our unemployment numbers and our record of \npartisan dysfunction.\n  Here is what is most important to note: The outdoor recreation \nindustry is a part of our economy across our country and there is very \nsignificant growth occurring. So this is an important achievement \nbecause we have been tied up in partisan knots. We showed last night we \ncan actually do something on behalf of the American people that will \nhelp create jobs.\n  I wish to particularly acknowledge the staff who worked so hard on \nthis piece of legislation. Scott Miller, a longtime staffer on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, worked tirelessly, as did a \nformer staff member of mine, Doug Young, who now works for the Governor \nof Colorado, John Hickenlooper. We began this work in the House of \nRepresentatives, where the Presiding Officer and I both served. I wish \nto thank also, in special fashion, Wendy Adams and Stan Sloss, who \npersevered time and time again as we fought through a series of \nprocedural holds and other setbacks. While economic challenges still \nface our country, this is a positive step forward.\n  I wish to thank all my colleagues for supporting me in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6708-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil noon will be equally divided between the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. McCain, and the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the final \n10 minutes of debate prior to noon on the McCain amendment No. 739 be \nequally divided between Senator McCain and myself or our designees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. To lead us off on this very important amendment and to \nexplain why it is important to not support the McCain amendment is a \nsenior member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and a great \nmember of that committee and a great supporter of the environment and \ntransportation, Senator Cardin of Maryland. I yield him 6 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I thank Senator Boxer for her \nextraordinary leadership as chair of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\nShe has stood for legislation that will allow us to rebuild our roads, \nour bridges, our infrastructure in this country, to create jobs, and \nmake America competitive.\n  I rise to oppose the McCain amendment, and I will give three reasons \nwhy: First, jobs; secondly, the transportation enhancement programs \nhelp our traveling public. It is what they want, what they need; third, \nthere is a safety issue.\n  First, on jobs. Let me point out that the Transportation Enhancements \nProgram represents 1.5 percent of the annual Federal surface \ntransportation funds--1.5 percent--a relatively small amount of money \nof the total pie. But it is interesting that the projects funded by the \nTransportation Enhancements Program actually yield more jobs per dollar \nspent than the funds that are used for the traditional transportation \nprograms. So on a jobs basis, we actually get more jobs from a lot of \nthe projects that are in the Transportation Enhancements Program.\n  Secondly, let me talk about the type of programs involved. We are \ntalking about bicycle paths. We are talking about when people travel on \na road and there is a pulloff where one can safely view the scenery. \nThese types of projects we are talking about could be jeopardized by \nthe McCain amendment.\n  I know my colleague from Alaska talked yesterday about the safety \nissue, but let me underscore it. Today, more accidents are caused from \nour pedestrians and our bicyclists. They are on the rise. There are \nactually an increased number of fatalities related to cyclists and \npedestrians. Fourteen percent of roadway fatalities involve cyclists or \npedestrians and two-thirds of these accidents occur on Federal \nhighways. Accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists result in far \nmore serious injuries. While motorist fatalities are on the decline, \npedestrian and cyclist fatalities are on the rise.\n\n  When we have a pulloff on a highway where someone can pull their car \nsafely off in order to look at the vista, that is the way it should be. \nIn my own State of Maryland, we are constructing the Harriet Tubman \nscenic byway so people can visit the Eastern Shore of Maryland and see \nfirsthand where Harriet Tubman operated the Underground Railroad. These \nroads are county roads. These are roads which are narrow and on which \nwe have a lot of commercial traffic as well as people who just want to \nlook at the scenes. The State of Maryland should have the flexibility \nof using these transportation enhancement funds in order to do what the \ntraveling public wants them to do; that is, to provide a safe \nexperience for the motorists to be able to enjoy our transportation \nhighways. That is what the Transportation Enhancements Program allows \nour States to be able to do. The McCain amendment would jeopardize \nthose funds.\n  So the Transportation Enhancements Program offers flexibility to our \nStates to be able to provide the whole array of transportation options. \nIt is a very small part of the overall transportation budget. It \nprovides those enhancements that the traveling public wants and needs. \nIt creates jobs, and it allows for greater public safety.\n  So for all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject the McCain \namendment.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during this \ndebate, all time that elapses during quorum calls be equally charged to \nboth sides of the debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Transportation Enhancements Program \nthat the McCain amendment would essentially cripple was established in \n1991 in a bipartisan transportation bill signed by President George \nH.W. Bush, and it has been continued in subsequent bipartisan \ntransportation bills which passed in 1998 and 2005.\n  This program benefits all Americans by making significant investments \nin safety, helping to reduce congestion, expanding transportation \nchoices, and it strengthens local economies, provides jobs, protects \nthe environment.\n  This amendment eliminates seven of the activities eligible under the \nTransportation Enhancements Program, and it prevents any funds from \nbeing spent on those activities.\n  Here is the thing about the TE Program, the Transportation \nEnhancements Program: There are things in it we need to reform. Senator \nInhofe and I, along with Senator Vitter and Senator Baucus, are working \nvery hard, and we have a bill, a bipartisan bill. The Acting President \npro tempore is a proud member of our committee. We are going to mark up \nthat bill very soon. Yes, it needs reform. But this amendment takes a \nmeat ax to a very important program, and it would have far-reaching and \nunintended consequences.\n  By prohibiting any funds to be used on these activities that Senator \nMcCain has singled out, this amendment actually eliminates the \nflexibility of our States and prevents them from spending funds on \nactivities which are necessary to construct and maintain our highway \nsystem.\n  So even setting aside the loss of jobs that would incur as a result \nof the McCain amendment, let me tell you the other unintended \nconsequences. But maybe Senator McCain intended that there would be \nfewer jobs. But I am assuming he did not intend, for example, this kind \nof a situation.\n  In the case of historic bridges, a bridge could be deficient, but \nunder this amendment we could not fund a rehabilitation project because \nthe bridge is historic. Because he says we cannot spend any money on \nhistoric sites, a regular fix to a bridge that happens to be historic \nwould not take place.\n  I just happened to have finished a book I strongly recommend: ``The \nGreat Bridge: The Epic Story of the Building of the Brooklyn Bridge.'' \nWhat a story David McCullough tells. That bridge was built in the \n1800s. It is historic. Under the McCain amendment, they could no longer \nget funds. That is the unintended consequence because it is historic. \nSo even though it is probably one of the heaviest traveled bridges--and \nthe Acting President pro tempore could attest to that--in our Nation, \nimagine this amendment which would not allow bridges such as this to \nget funded. It is a poorly drafted amendment. I do not know, maybe this \nwas intended. I cannot imagine it was intended, but this is the truth. \nThis is what would happen.\n  We also have in this amendment a prohibition on the use of funds for \nlandscaping, which is necessary to complete any Federal aid highway \nproject in order to prevent erosion along a highway. So I happen to be \na person who believes, when we do a project, it ought to look good, it \nought to make people feel good. Landscaping is important and it creates \njobs and it cleans the air. OK. But setting all that aside, it is a \nsafety question because a lot of times those plants will hold the soil \nin place and stop erosion when we have strong and heavy rains.\n  Yesterday, our friend from Alaska, Senator Begich, mentioned the \nSeward Highway outside Anchorage and how scenic overlooks were added to \nprovide a safe place for tourists to pull over. Under the McCain \namendment, as I understand it, we could not spend money on scenic \noutlooks. But let me tell you, in the case of this particular scenic \noutlook, it was necessary for safety because people were so inspired, \nbefore the scenic outlook, they would just pull over in a dangerous \nway, have no place to go, and it was not good for safety.\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\n  I wish to talk about the Transportation Enhancements Program in \nSenator McCain's State of Arizona. The demand is so strong from Arizona \nfor these funds that Arizona submitted three times what they were \nactually able to get under the Transportation Enhancements Program. For \nexample, in 2006, 72 applications requested $31 million in local \nproject TE funding, but only $11 million was awarded to 24 projects.\n  In Safford, AZ, TE funds are being used to improve five intersections \nand the surrounding streetscapes along Main Street to provide safer \nmeans of travel for pedestrians. According to the city of Safford, in \nArizona, this project provides a viable transportation component \ndedicated to pedestrian safety within the increased vehicle traffic on \nMain Street. This downtown project to improve safety, mobility, and \ncommerce was supported by the town of Thatcher, the Safford Downtown \nAssociation, and the Graham County Chamber of Commerce.\n  Again, we have a situation where I believe this amendment has very \nadverse consequences to our local people, to our States.\n  Right now, the way TE is in our bill--the old bill--it is up to the \nStates whether they want to do this. No one can force them to spend the \nmoney on this. They have the flexibility.\n  So now seven ways of using these funds would be taken away from the \nStates. Let's be clear on it. This is a State decision how they spend \nthis money. They do not have to take this money. They make the decision \nthemselves. This amendment would take away that ability.\n  There is also a prohibition on controlling outdoor advertising in the \nMcCain amendment. That means if a State wanted to remove outdoor \nadvertising, they could not use any Federal funds to do it, and they \ncould not effectively control their advertising, which is required \nunder current law. Again, they are supposed to control outdoor \nadvertising, but the funds would not get to them to do that. I think if \nwe ask the average person, they want their local people to have control \nover these things. So we need to defeat the McCain amendment or table \nthe McCain amendment.\n  My friend from Arizona also is telling us that 10 percent of surface \ntransportation funding goes to transportation enhancements. That is not \ncorrect. The Transportation Enhancements Program represents a tiny \nfraction of the Federal highway program--about 2 percent--not 10 \npercent, as my colleague John McCain said. Furthermore, the seven \nactivities prohibited by the amendment have represented less than 1 \npercent of the entire Federal highway program.\n\n  This amendment is making a dramatic and sweeping policy change in \nwhat should otherwise be a clean appropriations bill. It represents an \nissue we have been discussing at the EPW Committee for quite some time \nin the context of a multiyear surface transportation reauthorization \nbill, which, as I said at the outset, is the proper vehicle for such a \npolicy change.\n  I thought we had decided as a Senate--Republicans and Democrats--we \nshould not legislate on these bills. Senator McCain does not like seven \nthings in the Transportation Enhancements Program. Maybe I do not like \ntwo things or Senator Gillibrand may not like four things. It is not up \nto one colleague to stand here and decide, without any hearings or any \ndiscussion, what they do not like in a particular bill.\n  I do not think that is the way we should legislate, especially since \nthe TE Program is run by the States. We make the funds available. They \ndecide whether they want the funds for those activities. They do not \nhave to do it. They do not have to take the funds. They do not have to \ndo any of the eligible projects. So it, at the moment, has a lot of \nflexibility built in. As we reform in the next bill, we will look at \nsome of the areas where we think we can make this a better program.\n  Believe me when I tell you that Senator Inhofe and I have been \nworking very closely on this, along with Senator Vitter and Senator \nBaucus. So we think we are going to have a very good reformed TE \nProgram. This is not the place to change a program that our States \nlike. They like it because it is flexible. They like it because it has \na number of ways they can use the funding.\n  So we are going to have a bill. It is called MAP-21, which stands for \nMoving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century. It is going to have a \nlot of reforms in it. It is going to consolidate a lot of programs. It \nis going to be a bill most of us can embrace and be happy with. It is \ngoing to have a reform TE Program, and that is the way to do this. \nThere will be significant reform. But it is not right, in my view--and \nwe will see how the vote goes--for one Senator to say: I do not like \nseven things that are in this potpourri of things we can use TE for, so \nI am saying we cannot do it. We cannot use the funds.\n  It is just not right, and I pointed out how this is worded in such a \nfashion that bridges such as the Brooklyn Bridge and other historic \nbridges could lose all their funding as a result of the way this is \ndrafted.\n  So let's turn away from this McCain amendment. We know what works \naround here. What works around here is bipartisan cooperation, \ncoordination. I see the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, in the \nChamber. She works so closely with Senator Rockefeller, and I will tell \nyou what that means. It means we have wonderful progress in the \nCommerce Committee, which we would never have. Senator Inhofe and I \nwork very closely in the EPW Committee. Everyone kind of smiles about \nit because they know on the environment side we do not work closely. \nThat is true. We know that. He thinks global warming is the biggest \nhoax ever perpetrated on the American people. I think it is happening. \nIt is real. So we know we do not see eye to eye on that, and we have \ndecided that is just a fact. So we do not engage in long arguments \nabout it. We pursue our agendas, and we try to get the votes. But on \ninfrastructure, he is one of the most conservative, I am one of the \nmost liberal Members here. The fact is, there is no daylight between us \non infrastructure because he believes that is one of the major \nfunctions of our government and I do, too, and it makes a lot of sense.\n  I want to note the McCain amendment is opposed by the National \nAssociation of Counties, the American Association of State Highway \nTransportation Officials, the National League of Cities, the National \nTrust for Historic Preservation, and the U.S. Travel Association. \nAmerica does not support this amendment.\n  This is a group of bipartisan organizations. When you look at the \nNational Association of Counties, I started as a county supervisor. You \nhave Republicans, Democrats, Independents, everything in between.\n  Highway Transportation Officials is completely nonpartisan. National \nLeague of Cities, we have Republicans and Democratic mayors and \ncouncils; National Trust for Historic Preservation, again a mixture of \ndifferent views. And the U.S. Travel Association. I mean, I do not know \nhow that breaks down, but it certainly is a bipartisan group.\n  Please, I hope people will turn away from the McCain amendment. It is \nnot good for jobs. It is going to hurt jobs. It is going to have the \nunintended consequences of not allowing us to fix some of our most \ndeficient bridges. It goes against the people we are supposed to \nrepresent here, the people out there on the ground: our county \nofficials, our State highway transportation officials, our city \nofficials, and those who work so hard to preserve the history of this \ngreatest Nation in the world.\n  We cannot turn our backs on historic preservation. Otherwise we do \nnot know what our past was. I cannot tell you how many mistakes were \nmade in California where in the early years we did not realize what we \nwere losing. What people would give back to get back some of those old \ncourthouses that were torn down--I cannot tell you--from the 1800s. And \nthey could have been fixed up. But people did not have the foresight. \nThis McCain amendment would do real damage.\n  The U.S. Travel Association, you know, we are talking here about \nsmall businesses. We are talking about people who work in recreation, \nin airline travel. They do not want to see this happen, this McCain \namendment. So I am assuming Senator McCain will be here. We have \nreserved the last 10 minutes before noon.\n  At this point I think I have said all I can say to persuade my \ncolleagues, who\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\nI hope are listening in their offices, that they should turn away from \nthe McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I would suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to speak for a moment in regard \nto amendment No. 739, which is Senator McCain's amendment. Senator \nMcCain has been very careful with this amendment, to make sure, in \nterms of enhancements, that he excluded those things that were most \nimportant to a lot of people in this country in terms of alternate \ntransportation.\n  This amendment, which limits the expenditures, mandatory expenditures \non enhancements of the Highway Trust Fund money, does not include--in \nother words, it would not prohibit funding for bicycle paths, or \npedestrian and bicycle facilities, pedestrian and bicycle safety, and \neducation activities, the conversion of abandoned railway corridors to \ntrails, for either trails or bicycle paths. It would not prohibit \nfunding for environmental mitigation of highway runoff pollution, \nreduce vehicle-caused wildlife mortality, maintain habitat \nconnectivity, and it would not prevent funding for the acquisition of \nscenic easements and scenic or historic sites. I think Senator Cardin \nmight have related something other than that. I wanted to clarify that \nfor my colleague who cannot be here.\n  What a lot of Americans do not realize is that we have several \nhundred thousand bridges in our country that are substandard, in \ndisrepair, or are at great risk for those who travel over them. And by \nmandating that 10 percent of highway funds have to be spent on \nnonhighway needs, at a time when our country is running massive \ndeficits, has almost $15 trillion worth of debt--as a matter of fact, \nwe are in excess of $15 trillion worth of debt right now, that we \nshould make sure we only apply those enhancements to the things that \nare most specifically needed.\n  We do have a commitment from Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe that we \nwill have some flexibility with enhancements in the future on the next \nhighway bill. What Senator McCain is trying to do here will legitimize \nthat and certainly does not harm the purpose of that.\n  Basically what Senator McCain's amendment would do, funding this bill \nfor 7 of the 12 transportation enhancement activities, is it would \nprohibit funding for scenic and historic highway programs, including \ntourist and welcome centers. We should not be building a welcome center \nwhen there is one bridge in any State that is a danger for the American \npeople who are going across it.\n  Landscape and scenic beautification are nice things. But you know, \nwhen you are down making hard choices about the things that are most \nimportant, that is not one of them. Historic preservation we cannot \nhave as a priority now. Rehabilitation and operation of historic \ntransportation building structures or facilities; we should not, in \nfact, spend that money on archeological planning and research when, in \nfact, we have dangerous bridges that people are coming across every \nday.\n  Finally, although transportation museums are great, that cannot be a \npriority today when we are borrowing $13 trillion every year to keep \nthe transportation trust fund at a level that will not allow us to \nincrease the level at which we resolve these difficult bridges. We \ncannot continue to borrow that $13 trillion. So this is a commonsense \namendment. It is a modification of what I have offered in the past. It \nis a smarter amendment. It is a better amendment. It still allows the \nbicycle community and the enhancements associated with that to \ncontinue.\n  I would remind my colleagues, the Federal Highway Administration \nobligated $3.7 billion in enhancement funds for 10,857 projects between \n2004 and 2008.\n  That included $1 billion for signing, beautification, and \nlandscaping. That billion dollars could have fixed well over 5,000 \nbridges that are dangerous today.\n  There was $224 million on projects to rehabilitate and operate \nhistoric transportation buildings. Another 2,500 bridges could have \nbeen fixed for that. And $28 million to establish 55 separate \ntransportation museums.\n  It is not about not wanting the money to get out there, about \ntargeting the bicycle community--it is absolutely protected in this--\nbut it is about ordering our priorities. If there is anything we have \nnot done a good job of in Congress over the last 10 or 15 years, it is \nmaking hard choices about what is a priority and what isn't. I think \nthe vast majority of Americans would think the safety of the bridges \nthey drive across is more important than any of these things Senator \nMcCain is saying we are going to limit in this bill.\n  Of the 604,000 bridges in the United States in 2010, 24 percent of \nthem are deficient. This includes 69,000 that are structurally \ndeficient. In other words, they have significant deterioration, and \nthey have had to have load reduction carrying capacity limitations \nplaced upon them. And 77,410 bridges are functionally obsolete; they \ndon't meet the criteria of design standards.\n  These figures expose a nationwide problem of deficient bridges as \nwell as the misplaced priorities of Congress. We need to fix this, and \nI am in support of the McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor at this time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment is about white squirrel \nsanctuaries, museums, roadside landscaping, Lincoln highway, roadside \nmuseums, antique bike collections--my favorite is the National Corvette \nMuseum Simulator Theater. I will try to go to that one, since my first \npurchase as a young naval officer was a wonderful Corvette, which I \nremember with great affection. I would like to go back into their \nsimulator theater.\n  Then, of course, there are wildlife echo passages. We have some great \npictures here of some of the things. I think the squirrel sanctuary is \ngood. But one of my favorites is, of course, the roadside museum \nfeaturing a giant coffee pot. I am a coffee drinker, so I think a \ncoffee pot is pretty nice.\n  You know, we have some fun stuff here. Here we have 60 antique bikes \nfor a bicycle museum. They paid $440,000 for 60 antique bikes for that \nmuseum. Again, I think bicycle museums are nice. But it is also a fact \nthat more people travel over deficient bridges every day--that is 210 \nmillion people--than go to McDonald's. So we have these projects here--\nand, obviously, full disclosure, we picked some of the more interesting \nand exciting ones to get our colleagues' attention. But the fact is \nthat we have deficient bridges and we have highways that need to be \nrepaired.\n  What I am saying here is let the States decide their priorities. Do \nnot force the States to set aside 10 percent of their funding for these \nso-called transportation enhancement activities. If they want to have \nenhancement activities--and we do--I am so pleased, when driving \nthrough Phoenix and Tucson, to see the bougainvillea, the cactus, and \nother things that have been built there and put in, which have been \nvery helpful. But those decisions on those State highways were made by \nthe State of Arizona and the cities and the counties.\n  Instead, we have forced every State in America to use 10 percent of \ntheir taxpayer dollars, which are in the form of gasoline taxes, which \nwere originally put in to build the national highway system in America \nunder the Eisenhower administration, which they pay--they pay that. At \nthe same time, we have a situation, such as the deputy director in \nsouthern Nevada of the Nevada Department of Transportation, saying:\n\n       It is really getting out of hand to where these pots of \n     money have those constraints associated with them and you \n     can't spend money where you want to.\n\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\n\n  That is what this is all about. This is a fundamental philosophical \ndifference that we have about where taxpayer dollars should go and who \ndecides. That is what this amendment is about. I want the mayor of \nPhoenix to decide where the money goes. I want the Department of \nTransportation in Arizona to decide where the money is best spent. We \nshould not be forcing people to spend money on things that are not \nnecessary anymore.\n  I think a white squirrel sanctuary is probably an important thing and \nsquirrel lovers all over America are overjoyed. But who loves this \nboulder? Really, $498,750 to beautify an interchange with decorative \nrocks?\n  It is not as if this money is spent in a vacuum. It is that we have \nto set priorities. I want the States to set those priorities, rather \nthan them be mandated by some provision enacted in the Senate, which \ndoes not have a good handle on what those States' priorities are.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from Washington, who wishes to use \na few minutes in opposition to the amendment. I look forward to hearing \nher eloquent opposition. Maybe she will change my mind.\n  I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would very much like to thank the \nSenator for yielding me time and will take just a couple minutes in \nrising to speak in opposition to the McCain amendment No. 739.\n  I believe the intent of my colleague is to prohibit the use of funds \ncommunities across the Nation use for streetscaping and bike and \npedestrian paths and transportation improvements that help separate \nmotor vehicles from local wildlife.\n  I believe communities should determine for themselves, as they have \ndone for decades, how to use those funds. And the proper place for \nupdating these laws would be in the reauthorization process. So I \noppose the amendment on those grounds alone.\n  However, the amendment goes much further than that. It actually \nprohibits the use of funds in the entire division C; that is, the \nTransportation, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, \nfor any landscaping or historic preservation. So this impacts not just \nthe Department of Transportation but also HUD. In particular, it would \nprohibit cities and towns from using their CDBG dollars for eligible \nactivities, such as historic preservation or basic landscaping or \nstreetscaping activities.\n  It actually prohibits the use of funds for the rehabilitation or \noperation of historic transportation buildings, structures, and \nfacilities. That would cripple Amtrak. There are over 126 stations that \nAmtrak services in 41 States that are on the National Register of \nHistoric Places. Under this amendment, Amtrak would not be able to \noperate or rehabilitate any of them. Amtrak could not make any \nimprovements to stations to comply with access requirements for persons \nwith disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Amtrak \ncould not even operate in Union Station.\n  The amendment would also prohibit the structural preservation and \nrehabilitation of historic bridges, such as the Brooklyn Bridge, or \nother covered bridges in the Northeast.\n  This amendment goes too far, and it is not appropriate for the \nTransportation-HUD appropriations bill we are currently considering. So \nI urge my colleagues to oppose the McCain amendment.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for yielding time to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I believe I heard the Senator from \nWashington say that it would prohibit activities by Amtrak. I know of \nnothing in this page-and-a-quarter amendment that would in any way \naffect Amtrak or the Brooklyn Bridge. In fact, I would like for the \nmoney to be used to repair bridges because there are so many thousands \nof bridges in the country. There are 146,633 deficient bridges in this \ncountry. I would hope the Senator from Washington would agree with me \nthat deficient bridges are a threat and a danger. I believe it was in \nthe State of Washington where one collapsed, as I recall.\n  So you can distort this amendment if you want to. You can say it \nwould be the end of Western civilization as we know it. You can say \nthis will cause irreparable harm and damage. It doesn't, my friends. It \ndoesn't. It just says that none of the amounts would be for scenic or \nhistoric programs or tourist and welcome centers. And we are not \nprohibiting these things from being built. If the States want to build \nthem, if the counties want to build them, if the cities want to build \nthem, let them do it. But right now we are mandating that 10 percent of \nthe money they get go to certain purposes, which results in this \noutcome.\n  So I say, with respect to my colleagues who are opposing this \namendment, if my colleagues would like to amend the amendment so that \nit doesn't have the Draconian effects that are predicted here, I would \nbe more than happy to amend the amendment to make sure that doesn't \nhappen. What I am trying to say and what this amendment clearly says in \nits 10 lines on the front and 4 lines on the back is that we think \nthese things are unnecessary in light of the fact that we have so much \ninfrastructure in need of repair.\n  So, again, I had no contemplation that civilization would be affected \nso terribly by such an amendment which would try to give the director \nof transportation in southern Nevada the ability to be able to say: It \nis really getting out of hand to where these pots of money have these \nconstraints associated with them, and you can't spend money where you \nwant to. That is what this amendment is all about, my friends.\n  I have been engaged in many debates on the floor of the Senate on \nvarious amendments, but to construe this very short amendment as \nsomehow inhibiting or harmful to the work that needs to be done is \nobviously, in my view, fairly transparent and certainly not applicable \nto this amendment.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If Senator Inhofe would like to use that time, I would be \nhappy to yield to him.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding that the last 10 minutes would be \nequally divided, but perhaps the Senator from Arizona has already used \nmaybe 2 of those minutes. Is that correct? I just want to be recognized \nfor, say, 6 minutes in opposition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is this in addition to the 5 \nminutes that the Senator was allocated, so a total of 11 minutes of \ndebate?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well, let me clarify. It doesn't make any difference to \nthe Senator from Arizona or to me how much time I have. I need to have \nabout 5 minutes to clarify a couple of things.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am happy to yield my 5 minutes to \nSenator Inhofe at the appropriate point.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think the appropriate time is here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, I disagree with the Senator from Washington \nfor a different reason than the Senator from Arizona disagrees with \nher. I think his amendment goes too far--not just far enough but too \nfar--and I think it is very important that people understand.\n  Let me talk to the conservatives, let me talk to the Republicans, \nbecause this is certainly misunderstood. It wasn't drafted that way to \ncarry out the intent of the Senator from Arizona, I am quite sure. This \namendment doesn't eliminate the mandate that States have to spend 10 \npercent of their surface transportation funds on transportation \nenhancements.\n  Now, for clarification purposes, the 10 percent really is not \nrepresented properly. It really should be 2 percent. It is 2 percent of \nthe State's total highway program. That happens to equal 10 percent of \nthe Surface Transportation Program. But let's go ahead and use the 10 \npercent.\n  There are currently written into the law 11 eligible transportation \nenhancement activities. There is not room to put them all up, but we \nwill put up this\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\nchart. What the Senator from Arizona is saying is that you still have \nto spend 10 percent of your surface transportation money on \ntransportation enhancements, but he is saying the States have to use it \non his transportation enhancements. Those are the bike and pedestrian \nfacilities, the bike and pedestrian safety, rails to trails. The bikers \nare going to be very happy with this. They are the only ones coming out \nahead should this be passed.\n  Now, environmental mitigation in our law is restricted specifically \nto wildlife, bridges and tunnels, and to stormwater runoff \nenhancements. Now, stormwater runoff is taken care of anyway; these are \nthe enhancements.\n  So what this amendment is saying is that we are going to have to \nspend this 10 percent on bicycles and on various types of wildlife, \nbridges, and tunnels so that the turtles can get under the highways and \nnot get run over, and that is not what I know the Senator from Arizona \nwants.\n  In other words, we are taking the flexibility away from the cities, \naway from the States, and saying to them: You have to spend your 10 \npercent, and you have to spend it on these four things. I would just \nsuggest to you that in my State of Oklahoma, these are not the four \nthings on which we would want to spend it. I come down here all the \ntime, and there is this mentality that we have in Washington: No idea \nis a good idea unless it comes from Washington. Well, in my State of \nOklahoma, we have a great highway program. I want them to have the \nlatitude to decide what is really best.\n  Now, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nSenator Boxer, and I have disagreed on environmental issues tooth and \nnail. We have fought with each other more than any two people on the \nfloor of the Senate. She knows I have done everything within my power \nto do away with all transportation enhancement requirements. I have \ndone this.\n  If this amendment had eliminated the mandate that States spend 10 \npercent of their Surface Transportation Program funds on all \ntransportation enhancements, I philosophically would have supported it. \nIf the McCain amendment had said that we want to do away with all \ntransportation enhancements, I would have philosophically supported it. \nThe problem with that is we would not be able to get a highway bill \ndone.\n  I often say that I have been actually ranked as the most conservative \nmember of the Senate probably more than anyone else, but I have also \nsaid I am a big spender in two areas: No. 1 is national defense and No. \n2 is infrastructure. That is what I think we are supposed to be doing \nhere--roads and bridges.\n  I am sure my colleagues will recall that during the debate on the \nextension of the highway bill last month, Senators Boxer, Coburn, Reid, \nand I worked out an agreement that reforms the Transportation \nEnhancement Program which would be included in the next highway bill \nthat the EPW Committee will be marking up next month. I hope we will be \nmarking this up next month. These reforms would allow the States to \nmake a determination as to how they want to spend their funds.\n  To go back to this 10 percent, the idea behind this is this would \nincrease what we are able to do and let the States have the discretion, \nso they can totally eliminate all enhancements. The States can do that. \nBut they also would be allowed to use the 10 percent of the surface \ntransportation funding on the various programs that are out there \nhaving to do with endangered species and the burying beetle and all \nthat. That is where the problems really are.\n  So I don't think we should mistakenly vote for the McCain amendment \nand say to the people in this country: You have to spend 10 percent of \nyour surface transportation funds on these four things. And again, the \nbikers would love the bike trails and all that, but I don't believe \nthat is what we should be doing here.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona has 2 minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, again, the question is, What do we do \nwith the money? And obviously, when taxpayers are told that, with \n146,633 deficient bridges in this country, that we don't need to be \nspending it on the examples I have provided--I hope it is well \nunderstood that if those projects are felt needed by the States and the \ncounties and the elected officials in the States, then they should be \nable to go ahead with them, but if they don't choose to, they should \nalso have the right not to. It is time some of this kind of stuff \nstopped.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of the amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would ask the Chair how much time I have remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No time is remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that I have 30 seconds remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I only want to say that I agree with everything the \nSenator from Arizona is saying in terms of the bridges. I have fought \nfor the bridges and highways.\n  I have tried my best to get rid of all the enhancements--all of them. \nBut to have an amendment that says to my State of Oklahoma: You still \nhave to spend 10 percent of your surface transportation funds, but you \nhave to spend it on bike trails and turtle bridges, I think that is \nwrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6713-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6713-S6716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF MARK RAYMOND HORNAK TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF ROBERT DAVID MARIANI TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF ROBERT N. SCOLA, JR., TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                  FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under previous order, the Senate \nwill proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnominations, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nominations of Mark Raymond Hornak, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, Robert David Mariani, of Pennsylvania, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, \nand Robert N. Scola, Jr., of Florida, to be United States District \nJudge for the Southern District of Florida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 10 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak on both nominees. I will \nstart with Bob Mariani. And I refer to him that way because I have \nknown him a long time, but his full name is Robert David Mariani. Bob \nMariani is someone I know to be a person of not just high intellect and \nability but also someone with great integrity.\n  Bob Mariani was born in Scranton, PA--the same city in which I was \nborn. I still live there and so does he. He received his law degree cum \nlaude in 1976 from the Syracuse University School of Law and also \nreceived his college education cum laude from Villanova University, \ngraduating within the top 10 percent of his class. He was ranked second \nwithin his major field of study as an undergraduate.\n  Bob Mariani is a well-respected lawyer and advocate in northeastern \nPennsylvania. He has received the highest rating--well qualified--from \nthe American Bar Association. He spent 34 years as a civil litigator in \nScranton, PA, where he specializes in labor and employment law. Since \n2001, he has been the sole shareholder in the law firm that bears his \nname. He was also the sole proprietor of a similar law office that \nbears his name from 1993 to the year 2001, and a partner as well in an \nearlier iteration of that law firm,\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\nMariani & Greco, from 1979 to 1993. Bob has taught labor law at Penn \nState University and been an instructor at Penn State's Union \nLeadership Academy Program, where he taught labor law and collective \nbargaining.\n  Bob has received a whole series of commendations and awards that I \nwon't list due to the time we have today, but probably the most \nimportant thing I could say about Bob--and I know I might be a little \nbiased because I know him and have great respect for him--is that he is \na person who will apply the law; who understands when someone comes \nbefore him, they should be accorded basic fairness no matter who they \nare, no matter what point of view, and no matter where they come from.\n  I know integrity and commitment to public service--not just of the \nlaw but the public service a judge can provide--are the values that \nwill guide Bob Mariani as a judge, and so I am very happy we will be \nvoting on his nomination.\n  Also today, we will be voting on the confirmation of Mark Raymond \nHornak. I have not known Mark as long as I have known Bob Mariani, but \nI have known him for more than 15 years now. Mark is a native of \nHomestead, PA--southwestern Pennsylvania.\n  By way of a quick summary of his educational background, he got his \nlaw degree summa cum laude--the highest honors--in 1981 from the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh Law School, graduating second in his class. He \nwas editor-in-chief of the University of Pittsburgh Law Review. He got \nhis college degree from the University of Pittsburgh as well, and was a \ndean's list student and member of the honor society there.\n  His career has been varied and significant as a lawyer and advocate. \nHe has been a partner in the law firm of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney \nsince 1982. He has specialized in civil litigation, labor and \nemployment law, media defense and governmental representation, and is a \nmember of the firm's executive committee.\n  He is the solicitor of the Sports & Exhibition Authority of \nPittsburgh and Allegheny County, and also has been very active in his \ncommunity in Pittsburgh.\n  He also represents national television, radio, and publishing clients \nin media litigation, including defamation, first amendment and access \nissues, and in transactional matters.\n  Prior to joining the Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney firm, Mark served as \nlaw clerk to the Honorable James M. Sprouse of the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  Mark also has a long list of honors and achievements that I won't \nlist today, but, again, he is someone who has great integrity and \nability and who understands serving on the bench on a Federal district \ncourt--whether it is in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, as in Bob \nMariani's case, or the Western District of Pennsylvania, as in Mark \nHornak's case--is public service, and with it comes the \nresponsibilities and obligations of being a public servant. Both of \nthese candidates understand that--both Bob Mariani and Mark Hornak--and \nso I am honored to be able to speak today regarding their nominations.\n  I would urge a ``yes'' vote on both nominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have a judge who will be in \nfront of the Senate, and it is my understanding it has been worked out \nthat there will be a voice vote. I want to thank the leadership of the \nappropriate committee, the Judiciary Committee, for handling this with \ndispatch. In a big-growth State such as Florida, where there is such a \ncaseload in the Federal judiciary, when we have a vacancy it needs to \nbe attended to right away.\n  Fortunately, the two Senators from Florida have tried to take the \npolitics out of the selection of judges by letting the interviewing \nprocess, the selection process be done by a panel of prominent citizens \ncalled a judicial nominating commission, and they recommended these \nthree to the two Senators. The Senators then interviewed them and let \nthe White House know, and the White House agreed--much to the credit of \nthis White House--that they would select from among those we submitted. \nThose we submitted are the ones who came out of the judicial nominating \ncommission. Thus was the selection of Judge Robert Scola, whom we will \nconfirm today, and who was nominated in May of this year.\n  Judge Scola received his bachelor's from Brown University, went to \nBoston College for law school, and graduated cum laude. He practiced \nlaw as a criminal defense attorney representing individuals and \ncorporations in both State and Federal courts and then he spent 6 years \nworking as a prosecutor in the Miami-Dade County State Attorney's \noffice. He was then appointed back in 1995 by the Governor to the \nEleventh Judicial Circuit Court bench, where he has sat as a State \ncourt judge all the way up until today. He received his well-qualified \nrating from the American Bar Association.\n  Certainly Senator Rubio and I told the White House when we submitted \nthe names from the judicial nominating commission that we agreed with \nall of these nominees. So with this strong tradition of bipartisan \nsupport for our judicial nominees, I bring to the Senate's attention \nfor confirmation Judge Robert Scola.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise for literally 30 seconds, because I \nfailed, when talking about both the Mariani and Hornak nominations, to \nthank Senator Toomey, my colleague from Pennsylvania. We worked \ntogether on both these nominees to arrive at a consensus position, and \nso I am grateful for Senator Toomey's help, and grateful for the work \nof his staff as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate will vote today on 3 of the 26 \njudicial nominations reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and \nstill awaiting a Senate vote. All three of these nominations, two to \nFederal district courts in Pennsylvania and one to the Southern \nDistrict of Florida, were reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee before the August recess. All three have the support of both \nDemocratic and Republican home State Senators. Two of them are to fill \njudicial emergency vacancies. Senate Democrats were prepared to have \nvotes on all three nominations 3 months ago when they were first \nreported to the Senate. I have heard no reason or explanation for why \nthe Republican leadership refused until now to consent to votes on \nthese nominations.\n  There is also no good reason or explanation for the Republican \nleadership's continued refusal to vote on the more than two dozen \nnominations stalled before the Senate. With Republican agreement, we \ncould vote on all of them. Like the three nominations the Senate \nconsiders today, 21 of the other judicial nominations pending on the \ncalendar and still being delayed were reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee. At a time when vacancies on Federal courts \nthroughout the country remain near 90, with over 10 percent Federal \njudgeships vacant, the delays in considering and confirming these \nconsensus judicial nominees is inexcusable.\n  The American people need functioning Federal courts with judges, not \nvacancies. In his recent letters to the Senate majority leader and \nRepublican leader, Bill Robinson, the president of the American Bar \nAssociation, highlighted the serious problems created by these \nexcessive vacancies, writing:\n\n       Across the nation, federal courts with high caseloads and \n     longstanding or multiple vacancies have no choice but to \n     delay or temporarily suspend their civil dockets due to \n     Speedy Trial Act requirements. This deprives our federal \n     courts of the capacity to deliver timely justice in civil \n     matters and has real consequences for the financial well-\n     being of businesses and for individual litigants whose lives \n     are put on hold pending resolution of their disputes.\n\n  Mr. Robinson is not alone. We recently heard from Justice Scalia, who \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the extensive \ndelays in the confirmation process are already having a chilling effect \non the ability to attract talented nominees to the Federal bench. Chief \nJustice Roberts has also described the ``persistent problem of judicial \nvacancies in critically overworked districts.'' Justice Kennedy has \nspoken about the threat to the quality of American justice. This is not \na partisan issue, but an issue affecting hardworking Americans who are \ndenied justice when their cases are delayed by overburdened courts.\n\n[[Page S6715]]\n\n  Though it is within the Senate's power to take significant steps to \naddress this problem, refusal by Senate Republicans to consent to \nvoting even on consensus judicial nominations has kept judicial \nvacancies high for years. The number of judicial vacancies has been \nnear or above 90 for well over 2 years. A recent report by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that we are in the \nlongest period of historically high vacancy rates in the last 35 years. \nThese needless delays do nothing to help solve this serious problem and \nare damaging to the Federal courts and the American people who depend \non them.\n  More than half of all Americans--almost 170 million--live in \ndistricts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled \ntoday if the Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations \nnow pending on the Senate calendar. As many as 25 States are served by \nFederal courts with vacancies that would be filled by these \nnominations. Millions of Americans across the country are harmed by \ndelays in overburdened courts. The Republican leadership should explain \nwhy they will not consent to vote on the qualified consensus candidates \nnominated to fill these extended judicial vacancies.\n  Senator Grassley and I have worked together to ensure that each of \nthe 26 nominations on the Senate calendar was fully considered by the \nJudiciary Committee after a thorough but fair process, including \ncompleting our extensive questionnaire and questioning at a hearing. In \nfact, all the nominations reported by the committee have not only gone \nthrough vetting by the committee, but were vetted by the \nadministration. The White House has worked with the home State \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats, and each of the judicial nominees \nbeing delayed from a Senate vote is supported by both home State \nSenators. The FBI has conducted a thorough background review of each \nnominee. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has \nconducted a peer review of their professional qualifications. When the \nnominations are then reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, \nthere is no reason for months and months of further delay before they \ncan start serving the American people.\n  Despite the damaging high vacancies that have persisted throughout \nPresident Obama's term, some Republican Senators have tried to excuse \ntheir delay in taking up nominations by suggesting that the Senate is \ndoing better than we did during the first 3 years of President Bush's \nadministration. It is true that President Obama is doing better in that \nhe has worked more closely with home State Senators of both parties. As \nI have noted, all of the judicial nominees pending and being stalled on \nthe Senate Executive Calendar have the support of both home State \nSenators in every case. That was not true of President Bush and led to \nmany problems.\n  I have continued the practices I followed as chairman when President \nBush was in office. In fact, when the Kansas Senators reversed \nthemselves and opposed a judicial nominee that they had once approved, \nI honored their change of position and did not proceed to a vote in \ncommittee on that nominee.\n  But it is wrong to suggest that the Senate has achieved better \nresults than we did in 2001 through 2003. As I have pointed out, in the \n17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002, the \nSenate confirmed 100 of President Bush's Federal circuit and district \ncourt nominees. By contrast, after the first 2 years of President \nObama's administration, the Senate was only allowed to proceed to \nconfirm 60 of his Federal circuit and district court nominees. Indeed, \nas 2010 was drawing to a close, Senate Republicans refused to proceed \non 19 judicial nominees that had been considered and reported by the \nJudiciary Committee and forced them to be returned to the President. It \nhas taken the Senate nearly twice as long to confirm the 100th Federal \ncircuit and district court judge nominated by President Obama as we had \nwhen President Bush was in the White House.\n  During the third year of President Bush's administration, the Senate \nconfirmed 68 of his Federal circuit and district court nominees. \nIndeed, by mid-October 2003, 63 judges had been confirmed. In contrast, \nthis year the Senate has yet to confirm 50 of President Obama's \njudicial nominees--despite the fact that 26 have been ready for final \nconsideration and approval and remain stalled from confirmation by the \nSenate.\n  For those who contend percentages are significant, I note that the \nWashington Post reported this week that a lower percentage of President \nObama's nominees have been confirmed than President Bush's, with only \n68 percent of President Obama's Federal circuit and district court \nnominees confirmed compared to 81 percent of President Bush's.\n  I think confirmations and vacancy numbers better reflect the reality \nin our Federal courts and for the American people. It is hard to see \nhow the Senate is supposed to be doing better when it remains so far \nbehind the pace we set in those years. During President Bush's first 4 \nyears, the Senate confirmed a total of 205 Federal circuit and district \ncourt judges. As of today, we have almost 100 confirmations of \nPresident Obama's circuit and district court nominations to go in order \nto match that total during the next 12 months. At this juncture in \nPresident Bush's administration the Senate had confirmed 163 Federal \ncircuit and district court judges, and the vacancy rate was down to 5 \npercent, with 46 vacancies. By contrast confirmations of President \nObama's Federal circuit and district court nominees total only 109, and \njudicial vacancies are now nearly twice as high with a vacancy rate of \nover 10 percent.\n  This is not the way to make real progress. No resort to percentages \nof nominees ``processed'' or ``positive action'' by the committee can \nexcuse the lack of real progress by the Senate. In the past, we were \nable to confirm consensus nominees more promptly, often within days of \nbeing reported to the full Senate. They were not forced to languish for \nmonths. The American people should not have to wait weeks and months \nfor the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and ensure the \nability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around \nthe country.\n  All three of the nominations the Senate will vote on today were \nreported unanimously by the committee in July. President Obama first \nnominated Robert Mariani in December 2010 to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Mr. Mariani has been a \nlitigator in private practice for 35 years. For almost 20 years, he has \nmanaged his own law firm as a solo practitioner. Mr. Mariani has the \nbipartisan support of his home State Senators, a Democrat and a \nRepublican. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated him ``well qualified'' to serve, its highest possible \nrating.\n  Mark Hornak is nominated to fill a vacancy in the U.S. District Court \nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania. As with Mr. Mariani, both of \nPennsylvania's Senators support Mr. Hornak's nomination, which received \nthe highest possible rating from the ABA's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary, unanimously ``well qualified.'' Mr. Hornak has \nworked in private practice for 30 years in the Pittsburgh office of \nBuchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney, where he is a member of the firm's \nexecutive committee. He has served as a court-approved mediator and \nspecial master in the Western District of Pennsylvania, the district to \nwhich he is nominated. Following his law school graduation, he served \nas a law clerk to Judge James Sprouse of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fourth Circuit.\n  We will also vote on the nomination of Judge Robert Scola to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy in the Southern District of Florida. For the \npast 16 years, Judge Scola has served as a State judge in the Eleventh \nJudicial Circuit of Florida. He has been reelected to that position \nthree times. Judge Scola previously spent 9 years in private practice \nas a criminal defense attorney, and 6 years as a State prosecutor in \nMiami-Dade County. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated Judge Scola ``well qualified'' to serve, \nits highest rating. Judge Scola has the bipartisan support of his home \nState Senators, a Democrat and a Republican. The Chief Judge for the \nSouthern District of Florida, Judge Federico Moreno, a President George \nH.W. Bush\n\n[[Page S6716]]\n\nappointee, wrote months ago to the Senate to urge the speedy \nconfirmation of Judge Scola to address his court's overburdened \nschedule. I am glad we are finally able to consider his nomination \ntoday.\n  I hope that in the weeks ahead we can build on today's progress by \nconsidering more of the nearly two dozen well-qualified nominees still \nawaiting a Senate vote. This is an area where the Senate must come \ntogether to address the serious judicial vacancies crisis on Federal \ncourts around the country that has persisted for well over 2 years. We \ncan and must do better for the nearly 170 million Americans being made \nto suffer by these unnecessary Senate delays.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on three more \njudicial nominations. With these votes, we will have confirmed 14 \nnominees this month and 52 nominees this year. We continue to achieve \ngreat progress in committee as well. Eighty-four percent of the \njudicial nominees submitted this Congress have been afforded hearings. \nOnly 78 percent of President Bush's nominees had hearings for the \ncomparable time period during his Presidency. We have reported 76 \npercent of the judicial nominees, compared to only 71 percent of \nPresident Bush's nominees. In total, the committee has taken positive \naction on 83 of the 99 nominees submitted this Congress, or 84 percent. \nOverall, we have confirmed over 70 percent of President Obama's \njudicial nominees since he took office.\n  I will support the confirmation of each of the nominees today. I have \na few words to say about each nominee.\n  Mark Raymond Hornak is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania. Mr. Hornak graduated with a B.A. from \nthe University of Pittsburgh in 1978, and with a J.D. from the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1981. He began his legal \ncareer as a clerk for Judge Sprouse on the Fourth Circuit. Since his \nclerkship, the nominee has spent his entire career at Buchanan \nIngersoll & Rooney where he practices labor and employment law, \nrepresenting primarily employers and public agencies.\n  Mr. Hornak received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\n  Robert David Mariani is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the \nMiddle District of Pennsylvania, a seat deemed to be a judicial \nemergency. He received his A.B., cum laude, from Villanova University \nin 1972, and his J.D. from Syracuse University College of Law in 1976. \nMr. Mariani began his legal career by practicing labor, employment, \ncommercial, real estate, civil, and criminal law. During this time, Mr. \nMariani also served as the Solicitor to the Scranton-Dumore Sewer \nAuthority.\n  Beginning in 1980, Mr. Mariani dedicated himself to the exclusive \npractice of labor and employment law. His expertise includes collective \nbargaining, labor arbitration, and employee pension and benefits law \nunder ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. Mr. Mariani has practiced \nbefore Federal and State courts, the NLRB, the EEOC, and the \nPennsylvania Human Rights Campaign. He also serves as counsel to the \nNortheast Pennsylvania School District Health Trust and the Berks \nCounty School District Health Trust. In addition to his practice, Mr. \nMariani also serves as an arbitrator, where he resolves complex labor \ndisputes through negotiation.\n  Mr. Mariani received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\n  I had some initial concerns regarding Mr. Mariani's nomination. Mr. \nMariani has expressed labor policy preferences against at-will \nemployment and in favor of card check for union employees. I asked him \nabout these statements at his hearing and in followup questions. Based \non his responses, I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt \nthat he will be able to be fair and impartial as a judge.\n  Robert N. Scola is nominated to be U.S. district judge for the \nSouthern District of Florida, another seat deemed to be a judicial \nemergency. Judge Scola earned his B.A. in 1973 from Stanford University \nand his J.D. from Boston College of Law in 1980. From 1980 to 1986, \nJudge Scola served as a prosecutor in State court. He began with \nmisdemeanor cases and finished with prosecuting first degree murder and \ndeath penalty cases.\n  From 1986 to 1995, Judge Scola served as a criminal defense attorney. \nHe practiced solo for most of this time. From 1992 to 1993, he joined \ntwo other attorneys in criminal defense. Judge Scola specialized in \ncriminal defense in both State and Federal court.\n  Governor Lawton Chiles appointed Judge Scola to his current position \nas a circuit judge for the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida in and \nfor Miami-Dade County in 1995. Since then, the circuit has elected and \nreelected him without opposition in 1996, 2002, and 2008. He has served \nin the family division, civil division, and has also served as an \nappellate judge for county court and administrative law cases.\n  Judge Scola received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Hornak and Scola \nnominations are confirmed.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Robert David Mariani, of Pennsylvania, to be United States District \nJudge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, could we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I ask for order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The reason I asked for order is because this amendment \naffects each and every one of you and\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\nyour constituents. The McCain amendment says to the States that they \ncannot use a certain section of the transportation bill for several \nthings, including scenic or historic highway programs, including \ntourist centers, landscaping, or scenic beautification, historic \npreservation, and it goes on.\n  The point I want to make is this amendment is opposed by the National \nAssociation of Counties, the American Association of State Highway \nTransportation Officials, the National League of Cities, the National \nTrust for Historic Preservation, and the U.S. Travel Association. That \nis a nonpartisan list, and let me tell you why. The way this amendment \nis drafted, historic bridges could never even be repaired. The Brooklyn \nBridge or other historic bridges could not be repaired and we could not \ncontrol erosion. We would have major problems.\n  I move to table the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That motion is not in order while time is \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have made the argument that these \nprojects are unnecessary. We have tens of thousands of bridges that are \ndeficient. We need to spend the money where it should be spent, and I \nhope my colleagues will understand that this might have been \nappropriate some time ago, but in this day and age, with our crumbling \ninfrastructure, we need to put the money in the right place.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to table McCain amendment No. 739, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n       Unanimous Consent Request--Authority for Committee to Meet\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions be authorized to meet in \nexecutive session during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, \nOctober 19, 2011, in Dirksen Room 106, for the consideration of a bill \nto reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I find it a \ntragedy that in the Senate we are operating in a way that allows an \n868-page bill to be offered with only 48 hours to read it and \napproximately 1,000 pages' worth of amendments to this bill with \nvirtually no time to even think about the amendments. I think it is \nprecisely what is wrong with this body, that we would try to rush \nthings through.\n  I have been here since January, and there have been no hearings on No \nChild Left Behind. I have had no hearings that involve teachers, no \nhearings that involve superintendents, no hearings that involve \nprincipals. I think this is an affront to the process.\n  As I go around my State and I talk to teachers, I have yet to meet \none teacher who is in favor of No Child Left Behind. They abhor it. \nThey hate all the stuff we are telling them to do from Washington. They \nwant more local control.\n  I am one of the old-fashioned conservatives who believes that schools \nare and should be under local and State control. There is no provision \nin the Constitution for the Federal Government to be involved, period. \nThis was part of the Republican platform for nearly 30 years, that we \ndidn't believe in Federal control; we wanted to have local control.\n  I met with six teachers recently from Marion County. Some of them are \nspecial ed teachers. They like what they do. They like teaching kids \nwho have difficulty learning and have to be taught in a different \nfashion in order to get through to these kids. But they showed me a \ncute little boy of 15 years old who has a three-word vocabulary. He was \ntested in world geography and then the teacher was told she is a bad \nteacher because the child, who has a three-word vocabulary, did poorly \non testing.\n  This is insane, and it needs to be discussed in a rational fashion. \nWe need to have teachers involved in the process, for goodness' sakes, \nprincipals, superintendents.\n  I have a letter here from the American Association of School \nAdministrators, the National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals, the National Education Association, the National School \nBoards Association, and the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, and they said:\n\n       We . . . hope that the important work of getting policy \n     right will not be pushed to the side in a race against the \n     clock. . . .\n\n  I feel pushed aside--an 868-page bill and 48 hours to read it. It is \nwrong. All I am asking for is a hearing to listen to teachers--should \nwe not listen to the teachers--a hearing to listen to the \nsuperintendents, a hearing to listen to the principals. Let them read \nthe bill and find out what is in the bill.\n  I am not going to accept what Nancy Pelosi said: You can read about \nit after the fact. That is the process that is going on here. Mr. \nPresident, 868 pages--when are we going to read it? After they pass it. \nWho has been involved in crafting this legislation? I am on the \ncommittee. Nobody asked me. Nobody consulted with me. And I think that \nis the same with most of the people on the committee.\n  The letter from this group also says:\n\n     . . . we note that the proposed law . . . is still heavily \n     reliant on the idea of testing every child, every year \n     through one single high-stakes summative assessment. . . .\n\n  There are many problems. I would be in favor of getting rid of No \nChild Left Behind. No teachers are for it. I would like to see a survey \nof teachers. I would like to have the teachers do a survey of their \npopulation to ask who is in favor of No Child Left Behind before we \nact. I would like teachers to propose amendments to my office to fix No \nChild Left Behind if we are not going to scrap it. I would like to hear \nfrom the superintendents: What do you think of this 868-page bill we \ngot yesterday or on Monday? What do you think of this bill, and how \ncould we make it better?\n  We will not have time to hear from them because we are struggling to \nget through the 868 pages and another thousand pages of amendments. \nThis process is rotten from the top to the bottom.\n  What I would ask for is that we have a hearing. Let's invite teachers \nto\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\nWashington, let's invite superintendents, let's invite principals to \nWashington. Let's find out what they think of No Child Left Behind \nbefore we rush through an 868-page bill that no one has had time to \nread. This is what is wrong with Washington. This is the type of \narrogance about the way Washington works that is really making us \nunpopular in the public's eyes.\n  I say fix No Child Left Behind. I say repeal it or fix it, but at \nleast give us time to read the bill.\n  I object to this unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am sorry the Senator from Kentucky is \nobjecting to our meeting.\n  I say to my friend from Kentucky, the one thing I believe both \nSenator Enzi and I did and other members of our committee on both sides \nof the aisle did to get this bill to where it is was to put aside \nideology--to put aside ideology--to do what is best for our kids.\n  I believe the HELP Committee--on both sides of the aisle, Senator \nEnzi and I on both sides--has done everything possible to move the bill \nin a considerate, logical legislative manner. We started on this last \nyear. I say to my friend from Kentucky, we had 10 hearings last year--\n10 good, long hearings. We had superintendents. We had teachers. We had \nprincipals. We had broad input from across America as to what they \nwanted in a reauthorization bill. I am sorry the Senator was not here \nlast year, but the Senate is a continuing body. Does that mean every 2 \nyears we have to start all over from scratch every time? So we had all \nour hearings last year. And that was cleared again with Senator Enzi \nand me. We talked about: Well, lets get the hearings out of the road, \nand this year we could focus on putting the bill together. So we had \nour hearings. I say to my friend, we brought in teachers, principals, \nsuperintendents from all over America.\n  Then, starting in January, we began a time-honored process whereby \nthe chair and ranking member started working on putting the bill \ntogether with our professional staff. That is why we have professional \nstaff. Senator Alexander was involved in that. Other Senators were \nbrought in--Senator Bennet, Senator Franken. Others on the Republican \nside were brought in on that.\n  I would say this: The Senator from Kentucky had every day since he \nwas sworn in in January to come to me or go to Senator Enzi and say: I \nam on the committee. Here is what I would like in the bill. And that \nwould have been considered. Other Senators did that. I see two of them \nsitting here right now who came and said: Here is what I would like to \nhave in the bill.\n  Well, I sat down with Senator Enzi. We discussed it. Some yes, some \nno, some modifications--we would work it out through the process as we \nwent through. I do not know if the Senator from Kentucky went to see \nSenator Enzi about what he wanted in the bill. I know he did not come \nsee me. Our doors are open. There was no secret that we were meeting \nabout this. We started in January. Everybody on our committee, the \nstaffs, all knew that.\n  That is the legislative process. When it was all done, we wanted to \nput together a bipartisan bill. That is what we did. I say to my friend \nfrom Kentucky, it was not filed 48 hours ago; it was filed a week ago \nyesterday, Tuesday. That bill was filed. It was put online. I put that \nbill online. So we had a whole week to look at it, and, quite frankly, \nwhat happened is we got feedback. I say to my friend, we put the bill \nonline. We got feedback from a lot of people--the community out there--\nand as a result of that, we made some final changes. That is the \nlegislative process. Senator Enzi and I worked together on a managers' \namendment to incorporate some of the objections that came in during the \nweek to make the bill even more bipartisan. We filed that managers' \namendment on Monday morning at 10 o'clock. But that was not the whole \nbill. I put the whole bill online a week ago Tuesday. It was just the \nmanagers' amendment that was, again, a fine-tuning of it before we met \nin markup.\n  So I say the Senator from Kentucky had every opportunity to let us \nknow what he wanted in that bill, and I never saw him. I never saw him. \nHe never came to me. I am on the floor all the time. My door is open. \nMy staff is available. My professional staff is available. If the \nSenator from Kentucky had something he wanted in the bill and it was \nnot included, he has the right to offer an amendment.\n  I wanted this committee to operate in an open manner--in a manner in \nwhich we have operated in the past legislatively. If the Senator did \nnot have something in the bill that he wanted in, he has the right to \noffer an amendment and to debate it and to get a vote on it in our \ncommittee.\n  The Senator has filed 74 amendments. We had 144 amendments filed. \nUnder our rules, they had to be filed 48 hours before. The Senator from \nKentucky filed 74 amendments. Well, now the Senator from Kentucky is \nobjecting to our even meeting to consider his own amendments. Please, \nsomeone, explain the logic of that to the Senator from Iowa. He has the \namendments. The process is open. He can offer amendments, get them \ndebated, get them voted on. But the Senator from Kentucky is objecting \nto us meeting in order to even consider his amendments.\n  Secondly, I heard the Senator again on the floor today--and earlier, \nwhen we met earlier this morning in committee to start our process of \nmarking up the bill--he said he wanted to do away with No Child Left \nBehind. That is exactly what this bill does. It gets rid of No Child \nLeft Behind and some of the narrow proscriptions and prescriptions in \nthe bill and does, in fact, return a lot to local control. And we build \na partnership with the Federal Government and State and local \ngovernments--a better partnership than what we have had in the past. I \nthink that is why we have a good, bipartisan bill.\n\n  Again, the Senator from Kentucky and I probably have different views \non this. I understand that. That is why we have the Senate. That is why \nwe have debates. That is why we have committee meetings and markups. If \nI were writing the bill, I would write a completely different bill than \nthe Senator from Kentucky would write. He would write one completely \ndifferent from mine. That is why we meet in committees. That is why we \nhammer these things out over a long process. You do not just shut the \ndoor and say: It is my way or no way.\n  I am the chairman. I am willing to listen to his amendments and have \nhim offer them. But how can I hear his amendments, how can we consider \nhis amendments if the Senator will not even allow us to meet under the \nrules of the Senate? I have no logical explanation for that.\n  Well, there is a lot more I could say, Mr. President, but this is \njust illogical. That is all I can say: It is just illogical.\n  I see the Senator from Colorado on his feet. I yield to the Senator \nfrom Colorado for any questions he might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I have never done this in the 2\\1/2\\ years \nI have been in the Senate. I have not been here a long time, and I have \nspent a lot of time complaining about the way this place works. But I \nhad to come to the floor to implore the Senator from Kentucky to \nreconsider his objection. I do it not because I have a perspective on \nthis as a Senator; I do it because I had the honor of serving as the \nsuperintendent of the public schools in Denver for 4 years of my life \nand have dedicated years of my life but, more importantly, seen the \ndedication of the people who are working in our schools.\n  The Senator speaks of the tragedy of this process. I will tell you \nwhat a tragedy is. A tragedy is that only 9 of 100 children living in \npoverty in this country, in 2011, can expect to get a college degree--\nthat is a tragedy; the fact that when I became superintendent in the \nDenver public schools, on the 10th grade math test, there were 33 \nAfrican-American students proficient on that test and 61 Latinos \nproficient on that test--the test that, if we are honest with \nourselves, which we are not, measures a junior high school standard of \nmathematical proficiency in Europe. That is a tragedy. It is a tragedy \nthat there are people working in our schools right now, at 11:15 a.m. \nin Colorado, doing the best they can to serve our kids, and we think a \n2-hour meeting is too long. That is a tragedy.\n\n[[Page S6719]]\n\n  I would not have drafted the bill exactly the way it has been \ndrafted. The chairman knows that. He and I even have disagreements \nabout some of the things in this bill. But finally, after 2\\1/2\\ years, \nthere is a bipartisan piece of legislation in front of the committee \nthat is having the benefit of the work of the Senators who are there, \nand we are told that meeting for 2 hours is too long.\n  The Senator has every right to make his objection under the Senate \nrules, which the Presiding Officer has observed may need some updating. \nBut I think if you ask yourself, why is it that we have a 12-percent \napproval rating, which is going down, it is because of this kind of \nthing.\n  I actually look forward to hearing the amendments of the Senator from \nKentucky. I wanted to know what they were. As the chairman mentioned, \nthere are 146 amendments that have been filed. I have some I have \nfiled--only three or four. The Senator from Kentucky has 74 of the 140 \namendments.\n  In the 2 hours we met today, we considered three amendments or voted \non three. We were debating a Republican amendment, and I was very \ninterested in what Senator Isakson had to say when our meeting came to \nan end. If we are going to do this in 2-hour increments, my math--I am \nproficient in math, thank goodness--is that it would take 60 days to do \nthis in 2-hour increments.\n  Do you know why people are fed up with this place? It is because they \ndo not think the debate we are having is about them. They think the \ndebate we are having is about us. And do you know what. They are right \nabout that.\n  The teachers all across my State, all across the district I worked \nin, want us to lift this burden from them--in my view, the biggest \nFederal overreach ever in domestic policy. That is what the bill does, \nnot for ideological reasons but to help respond to the voices of our \nteachers, respond to the voices of our superintendents, respond to the \nvoices of our parents who are sick and tired of the almost comical but \nto them painful measures of annual, yearly progress--the idea that we \nare going to label all our schools ``failing'' by 2014 because we have \na completely made-up accountability standard in Washington, DC.\n\n  This bill does away with that. It does not do it in exactly the way I \nwould want to do it, left to my own devices, but it does it in a way \nthat can get bipartisan support in the Senate. I mean this broadly. I \nam not saying it in this case. When people see the political games that \nare being played, when they see people who are unwilling to work \ntogether, and they are killing themselves to deliver for our kids, I am \nnot sure there is anything more backhanded we could do.\n  So I would beg the Senator from Kentucky to let us have the hearing, \nthe committee meeting. Let us consider his amendments. I and all the \nrest--today's conversation was one of the first--I regret saying this--\none of the first substantive conversations I have had in a committee \nhearing since I have been here.\n  I thank the chairman and I thank the ranking member for creating a \ncontext where that can happen. Let's have the conversation. I would be \nhappy to meet 24 hours a day to talk about this subject with the \nSenator from Kentucky--24 hours a day, every day. Because if we care \nabout the widening gap between rich and poor in this country, we cannot \nsustain anything remotely approaching our----\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNET. I will in 1 second--anything remotely approaching our \nclaim to be a land of opportunity when 9 out of 100 children born in \npoverty can graduate with a college degree, when 91 out of 100 children \nwho are unfortunate enough to be born poor are constrained to the \nmargin of our democracy, the margin of our economy. I will stop here.\n  But to be clear about it, there are 100 seats in the Senate. When I \nwalk into this room, I think about what if the 100 people who were here \nwere children living in poverty in the United States. Here is how many \nwould have a college degree. That chair. That chair. That chair. These \nfour chairs and this one. That is it. The rest of this Chamber would be \noccupied by people who did not have the benefit of a college degree.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNET. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I want--I recognize the Senator wants to speak. \nLet's do this in a logical, orderly manner. If people want to be here \nto speak, I think the Senator from Colorado made some good points. I \nwas yielding to him for a question. I would yield if the Senator from \nMinnesota has a question. Then, obviously, the Senator from Kentucky \nwill have every right to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Parliamentary inquiry: Under the current structure, how \nlong before a Member on this side can be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A Senator cannot be recognized until the floor \nis relinquished.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota for a question.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the chairman for allowing me to ask a question. \nI want to know because I have only been here 2-plus years. But it seems \nto me that actually, from my perspective--this is my perspective--this \ncommittee has worked in a pretty functional way. It took a long time. \nWe started having hearing on this however long ago was it, about a year \nand a half?\n  Mr. HARKIN. It started at least a year and a half ago, maybe a year \nand three-quarters.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. During this whole period, I talked with the Senator. I \nhave asked to see the ranking member and meet with him in his office to \ntell him what I wanted to see in this bill. I agree with the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, who has talked about there is just one test at the end \nof the year and the kids do not--the teachers do not get to see the \nresults until the kids are out the door. I think that is terrible. I am \noffering an amendment that the ranking member referred to today.\n  I have gone all around my State since I have been a committee member \nand talked to teachers about what they want to see to fix this or to \nget rid of No Child Left Behind and replace it with something that \nmakes sense. That is exactly what we are doing. Is this not the normal \norder of things?\n  That is my question.\n  I went to Senator Alexander and met with him in his office to explain \nwhat I wanted. My staff has been meeting every other Member--not every \nother Member's staff but every other Member's staff who seems to be \nengaged in this on both sides of the aisle, with Senator Harkin's \nstaff, with the committee staff, with staff from Senator Enzi's office. \nI keep hearing whose staff they are talking to about this piece of this \namendment or that amendment or this piece is going to be in the \nmanagers' bill. I think I have spent more time on this bill than on any \nother bill in my time here, and nothing has stopped me from being \nengaged in it. I do not think there is anything that has stopped anyone \nin our committee from going back over the transcripts of the many \nhearings we had. I do that often.\n  So my question is: Am I wrong or has this not been conducted in a way \nthat is actually, as these things go, pretty functional for any Member \nwho wants to be engaged in the process? I think there is a \nresponsibility on the behalf of committee members, and is there not a \nresponsibility on the behalf of committee members to be active in the \ncommittee, to come to hearings, to be engaged in the process, to \napproach the chair, to approach the ranking member? Is that not part of \nour responsibility?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Minnesota, I think that is right. \nIf the Senator wants to be engaged in the process of legislation, then, \nas I say, the Senator from Minnesota has talked to me many times about \nwhat he wants in the bill. The Senator from Colorado and even Members \non the Republican side have talked to me about what should be in the \nbill, what should not be in the bill. That is the process.\n  I would say to my friend from Minnesota, I have been chairman twice \nbefore, not of this committee but of the Agriculture Committee when we \ndid major agricultural bills. One was in 2001 and the other one was in \n2007, and\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\nboth times I worked with the ranking members, basically, the same kind \nof process. We got bipartisan bills through that were signed by \nPresident Bush both times, 2001 and in 2007. This was the process we \nused.\n\n  We let amendments be offered. We opened it up. No one on the \ncommittee ever raised an objection to our meeting during the Senate \nsession. We got our jobs done. That is the way we have always done it. \nThat is just the legislative--as I said, considerate, logical \nlegislative process. That is the way we have always conducted it. What \nit does is it allows Members--Senators who are interested, as the \nSenator from Minnesota has been so keenly interested in this Education \nbill, to give them time to go to the ranking member, to go to me, to go \nto other Members, to see what they can get in the bill.\n  I say to my friend from Minnesota, I am sure we did not put in \neverything the Senator wanted in the bill.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Absolutely not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. But I think the Senator has the right to offer the \namendments in committee.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I wish to thank the ranking member. We talk on the phone \nabout this. We have talked over dinner about this bill. I wish to thank \nSenator Alexander, whom I asked to come to his office. We spent a very \nsubstantive session talking exactly about how I saw this--what was \nwrong with No Child Left Behind and how we could essentially get rid of \nit and solve what it is that every teacher hates about it and what \nprincipals hate about it and what superintendents hate about it.\n  Senator Alexander and I had some disagreements on things. But, man, I \nthink we agreed on 80 percent of this. I think I had an 80-percent \nagreement--I mean, that is Senator Enzi's rule. He has this 80-percent \nrule, which is that we agree on 80 percent and we focus on the 20 \npercent. I have a 64-percent rule which is that 80 percent of the time \nwe agree on 80 percent. We see that Senator Bennet laughed because he \nis proficient at math.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did not know if the Senator from Kentucky wanted me to \nyield to him for a question to get involved in the colloquy or the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. I would like my own time.\n  Mr. PAUL. I do have a question. Several Senators on the committee \nhave said they would be happy to have meetings 24 hours a day. Why do \nwe not have a hearing on the bill? Why do we not invite teachers, \nsuperintendents, and principals? There has been no hearing since the \nlast election. There is no reason why we cannot.\n  The other question we have and we need to answer is: What do we say \nto the American Association of School Administrators, the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals, the National Education \nAssociation, the National School Boards Association, and the National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals that say: Let's do not get \npushed aside in this race against the clock.\n  I am not opposed to much of what is going to happen with the bill. I \nthink No Child Left Behind has many errors and we can fix some of them. \nWhat I am opposed to is the process of giving us an 868-page bill \nyesterday and saying take it or leave it. We need more time to read the \nbill. We need these organizations that are very interested in \neducation--it is their livelihood--to come in and make comments on this \nbill. That would be an open-hearing process. Anything else to me is \ndisingenuous.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield the floor very soon. I say to my friend from \nKentucky, I will say again: We put this bill online 1 week ago Tuesday. \nSome of the mail the Senator is talking about, the letters came in \nafter that because they read the bill. I think the primary objections \non all those letters had to do with teacher evaluations and what we \nwere going to do in the bill on teacher evaluations.\n  That is what we fixed in the managers' amendment that we laid down \nMonday morning. I am told--I have not seen it--but I am told the \nNational Education Association, for example, has withdrawn from that \nletter because of the fix we made. That is why we put the bill online.\n  I said that earlier. We put it online. A lot of objections came in. \nWe modified it in the managers' amendment to move forward on that bill. \nThat is exactly how we do it. I say to my friend from Kentucky that we \nhave had a whole week.\n  Again, my friend filed 74 amendments to the bill. How can you file 74 \namendments if you haven't read the bill? It seems to me that if you \nfile 74 amendments, you must have read the bill. I assume that last \nweek the Senator must have read the bill and then filed 74 amendments. \nYou cannot have it both ways--say I haven't read the bill, but here are \n74 amendments. That doesn't hold together logically.\n  Again, I will close on this note. The Senator from Colorado is \nabsolutely right. We are here talking about process and who is up, who \nis down, all of this kind of stuff. These teachers out in America who \nare grappling with kids who are under this burden of No Child Left \nBehind and these AYPs, knowing that no matter how much they progress \ntheir kids in 1 year, they are still failing--this bill relieves them \nof that, takes that yoke off them.\n  Every one of us has heard from teachers, parents, and administrators \nthat this No Child Left Behind is not good, that it has to be fixed, \nand that is what our bill does. How are we going to change it and fix \nit if we are not even allowed to meet?\n  Again, I hope the Senator from Kentucky will allow us to move forward \nin this process and allow us to have our amendment process. I say to my \nfriend he has another shot at this bill on the floor. We will have \ncommittee, and we will come to the floor, and amendments will be \noffered on the floor. That is the legislative process. No one person \ngets to dictate what is in this bill--not me, not Senator Enzi, not the \nSenator from Kentucky. But all working together collaboratively in a \nbipartisan fashion, I think we can move this bill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that there were a lot \nof blanket statements about one's level of participation. I have \nnegotiated with the chairman of this committee for 9 months on the \nreauthorization of our emergency preparedness and biodefense in this \ncountry. I know what negotiations are. I know what compromise is. I \nknow what commitment of time is. I got this bill last Friday. I will \nfind out where it went online, or which copy went online. My staff got \nthis bill last Friday. Yes, we have read it. We have eight amendments, \nwhich is not as voluminous as Senator Rand Paul; but he gets that \nability, as he gets the ability to be heard.\n  The minority's only leverage in this institution is to have an \nopportunity to offer amendments and to debate them. I hear what the \nSenator is saying, but based upon the timeframe you set--you don't get \nthe privilege of doing that when you have to deal with the minority.\n  I know the chairman, for whom I have deep respect, has been here a \nlong time, and he knows it. This could have been something very easily \nworked out with communications on both sides of the aisle. The fact is \nthat, as I prepared for this markup, I was told there was an agreement, \nand that agreement meant the chairman and ranking member were going to \nhold this bill intact. There were going to be no exceptions to it. They \nwere going to vote to make sure this bill didn't change.\n  That doesn't give one a lot of comfort, knowing what the outcome of \namendments will be regardless of the merit of the amendments. When we \nstarted this morning, the chairman was very gracious and let me say my \ndue for about 5 minutes. I am appreciative of that. I made it very \nclear to Members at that time, the only thing I asked them to do was \nweigh it on the merits of the amendment--my first amendment out of the \nchute, and it was my best shot. I will say right here on the floor, it \nwas a damn good amendment. You know what. Lockstep we went down the \nline, and they proved to me that there is a deal.\n  You know, the next amendment was offered by Senator Franken. I was \nthe first one who stood up and said I disagree with the base text--it \nwas offered by both of them--but I will support it. I am in year 17. \nSenator Franken said he spent more time on this bill than any bill \never. Boy, if that is the case,\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\nthat is a sad statement about how much time we spend on legislation, \nbecause you could not have had it more than since last Tuesday, \naccording to the chairman himself.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURR. I will take questions at some point, but I patiently sat \nhere waiting for my own time. I will use it, and then I will allow the \nSenator to stand and ask a question.\n  In the same statement, there was criticism of the participation. \nApparently, I or Senator Paul had not spent the time or hadn't devoted \nthe time to this particular piece of legislation. I have been working \non this for years. I think the chairman knows I am passionate when I \nget involved. It is not from a standpoint of a lack of knowledge, it is \nfrom a standpoint of trying to achieve the right end.\n  The chairman said very clearly that we are not going to make this \nperfect out of committee; we are going to have another shot at it on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that 55 times in this Congress the \nmajority has chosen to fill the amendment tree, meaning that no \nminority Member has had an opportunity to amend the legislation. How \ncould I feel good about a truncated markup process that happens 4 days \nafter I physically got an 868-page bill, when the caveat that I am \ngiven is: Oh, but you will have another opportunity to do it on the \nfloor? Maybe, maybe not. I don't think the chairman can make an \nassurance to me that we are going to have an open rule on the Senate \nfloor that allows unlimited amendments. If he can, I will yield to him \nfor that consent. It is above his pay grade. It is above mine, too. \nThat decision won't be made by the chairman or ranking member, and it \nwon't be made because somebody is trying to perfect the bill.\n  I learned a long time ago that coming to the Senate floor and \nscreaming doesn't do any good. It wakes people up in the gallery, and \npeople at home think this must be important. This is about our kids. \nThis is about whether K-12 education works. There is one takeaway we \ncan all make: No Child Left Behind was well-intended legislation, and \nit was implemented poorly, embraced by very few. North Carolina \nhappened to be a State that received a tremendous amount of waivers. We \ngot a waiver from Average Yearly Progress because our State had a \nyardstick that was actually better, and the Secretary of Education \nrecognized that. It didn't, through those waivers, change any of the \nFederal intrusion into K-12.\n  Let me explain what I mean. We have right now about 93 education \nprograms that are authorized; not all of them are funded. If your \nsystem determines that you can use one of those programs, you can \naccess that money. But if there is not a program for what your problem \nis, you don't get a shot at the money. I suggested through legislation \nthat we take all of those programs and throw them into two pots and \ngive States full flexibility to decide how they use the money.\n\n  This bill--they talk about flexibility. Well, it does eliminate the \ntitle of 40 programs, and it throws them into 6 new major mega-\neducation programs--still with the strings. You have to spend it the \nway we design it in Washington, not the way you interpret it at home. \nAnd for a superintendent, that should not settle real well--flexibility \nversus prescription. One way is Federal intrusion into local education. \nThe other is a partnership for education success.\n  Having gone with this one-size-fits-all called No Child Left Behind, \nI would think the natural swing would be, gee, if we want to fix \neducation, why don't we enlist educators, superintendents, and \nprincipals in this bill? The 868 pages that we are going to debate--it \nwill happen; minority rules can only last so long, and we will be \nmarking this bill up and, hopefully, it will come to the floor and we \nwill get an opportunity to amend it.\n  But incorporated into this bill is 20 pages that define reading. I \nwant you to think about that. When the claims are made that this is not \nFederal intrusion, a one-size-fits-all, this bill spends 20 pages \ndefining for every local school system what reading is. This is insane.\n  I have a simple challenge for my colleagues. What happened about the \naccountability of parents, teachers, principals, elected school boards, \nand community leaders? Healthy communities today have a relatively \nsuccessful K-12 education system. In most cases, it is because \nemployers recognize the fact that that is potentially their future \nworkforce, and their educational success is that community's success \nfor survival and for advancement.\n  But what this bill does is say we are going to determine what \n``highly gifted'' is for teachers, and we will determine what success \nor failure is. We are going to take the place of the parent, teacher, \nsuperintendent, elected officials, and the business community; we are \ngoing to take that all over.\n  From the standpoint of the amount of money, we are still \nparticipating at about the same level--about 10 percent of the overall \ncost of K-12. But if you don't play by our rules, you don't get our \nprograms or our money. I daresay there is not one of us who recognizes \nthe fact that every community has a unique problem--where one is a \nschool building, the next one is available highly gifted teachers; and \nwhere one might be the ability to have a second language taught, the \nother might be the passion of Teach for America teachers that \ninfiltrate their system.\n  I cannot come up--no matter how many pages I write--with a K-12 \neducation bill that I can honestly say trumps any community's that I \nrepresent that they could come up with on their own. If anything, I \nknow I would be woefully short of what they could do.\n  The answer, to me, is let's get them more in charge, empower them \nmore, and let's give them greater flexibility. Let's be what we are \nbest at--a financial partner in the success of education. As a matter \nof fact, we will take up an amendment at some point that triggers the \nflexibility in the 868 pages. But it is only triggered if a school \nsystem accepts one of six things. One of those things is actually \nfederally mandated firing of the principal or X amount of teachers of a \nfailing school.\n  How in the world could we put in Federal legislation that you get the \nfull flexibility if you are willing to go out and fire the principal or \n20 teachers at a school that has been determined by Washington to be a \nfailure?\n  This is almost surreal to me. In many ways, it goes way past where No \nChild Left Behind tried to get to, which was creating a measurement \ntool that could be seen by all and judgments made based upon that, \nthough it wasn't perfect.\n  What my colleague Senator Paul has asked for, quite honestly, is very \nreasonable. Take the bill--the one that we are considering, not the one \nthat went up last Tuesday--I got this e-mail while I am standing here, \nwhich says:\n\n       The original ESE bill was put up on line one week ago. The \n     managers' amendment on Monday. The document explaining the \n     changes was online yesterday.\n\n  So everybody is right. The only problem is what Senator Paul \ndescribed, which was the bill that we are considering right now went up \non Monday.\n  The explanations for the changes went up yesterday. I am sure if \nSenator Paul came up with 74 amendments, his staff has been a little \nbusier than mine because they only came up with 7 or 8. But what \nSenator Paul has asked for is very reasonable.\n  Take this bill--not a hypothetical bill--and let's have a hearing on \nit--not a markup, a hearing--at whatever speed the chairman can put it \ntogether, where we bring in actual educators, we bring in \nsuperintendents or we bring in school board members, maybe we bring in \na parent. That would be novel.\n  I can still remember, when I started 17 years ago, and reading about \nthe Washington, DC, schools, my first teacher-parent mentor meeting. I \nremember the expectations I had of a parent who didn't care about a \nfifth grader's future. If they did, why would this child be so \nchallenged to read? What I was met with, as I walked in and met with \nthat parent, was the parent of a fifth grader who said: Congressman, \nyou are my son's only hope. I want him to have so much more than I do.\n  I wasn't there because of a government program. I was there because I \nthink every child ought to have the opportunity to succeed, and we \ncan't write that in a bill. We can't describe for every community how \nthey get to success. If we could, No Child Left Behind would have been \nperfect because\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\neverybody believed it would have that big a change. So you see, this is \nabout not just changing a system, it is about creating passion--a \npassion for success.\n  I will tell you, passion for success is not taking the Federal \nGovernment's HR Department--which is pitiful--and saying: Well, let's \nexport this to every school in America. That is not the answer. The \nanswer is for us to get out of the way and for us to empower those \nlocal officials to make the changes they need to and for the judgment \nto be of those community leaders and those parents.\n  We will have a debate soon on what is highly qualified, and it is \nvery proscriptive as to what a highly qualified teacher needs to be. \nBut in my definition, highly qualified is a pharmacist who has decided \nthey don't want to work in a store anymore and would like to teach \nchemistry in a high school. Unfortunately, under all the Federal \nstandards today, that person can't do that because they don't have a \ncertificate to do so. We will codify that into law, in 868 pages, and \nall the talented folks we have around the country--who could walk into \na classroom and not only have the educational foundation to be able to \nteach our students but the passion to want to be there and to say it in \na way that isn't taught out of a textbook but is learned through their \noccupation--will be gone. It will be gone. Even though that pharmacist \nmay not want to compound drugs anymore, if their choice is that or \nretirement, they will retire because we have cut out something that \nwould allow them to contribute.\n  I didn't mean to go this long, but I will be honest, in my patience \nto get the opportunity to speak, I heard some outlandish comments that, \nquite honestly, I could take to be very personal. To suggest any Member \nhad sufficient time to review this legislation--the only person who \ncould make that comment would be one who got the bill before I did, and \nI think I am entitled to have it at the same time every other member of \nthe committee gets it.\n  To have an agreement that says we are not going to take amendments--\nthat says one can offer them, but we are not going to take them--I \nthink that is a black eye on the entire institution, if we would adopt \na policy such as that. But I have seen it up close and personal \nalready.\n  I would love to take the chairman at his word that we will have an \nopportunity on the floor to fix this bill, but--based upon how the \nfloor has been run up to this time--I can't believe there will be even \none opportunity for me to offer an amendment. So I have to roll my dice \non the markup process in committee, and I have to do it in a way that \naccommodates every member. If Senator Paul believes he needs more time, \nI have to be there to try to defend his time.\n  If that is inconvenient for people, it is going to be inconvenient. \nThe truth is, our children's future is way more important than our \nconvenience. Our children's future is way too important to rush a bill. \nOur children's future is way more important than a deal between a \nranking member and a chairman as to how to make this easy out of \ncommittee so we can fix it on the floor.\n  I have been here 17 years. Perfection is not possible in Congress, \nbut perfection should be our goal every day. When we look at what we \nhave debated, we understand why less than 15 percent of the American \npeople think highly of us. I think what we are getting ready to do will \nhave a significant impact on how that number is reduced, not how it is \nincreased.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience. They certainly don't have \nto request time from me. I will yield back and gladly allow them \nwhatever of their own time they would like to take.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I would like to say to the Senator from North Carolina, \nbefore he leaves the floor, that I am well aware of his longstanding \ncommitment to education issues and to the kids in this country. I have \nno doubt of that, and I hope he didn't take anything I said to suggest \nthat. I actually think the two of us probably share a lot of agreement \non what we ought to be doing.\n  My issue is simply--and as I said about the Senator from Kentucky, he \nhas every right to do this--that, as my colleague and other members of \nthe committee, I want to engage in a debate on the bill. I want to \nconsider the amendments of my colleagues and to offer my own.\n  I am painfully aware, having been in a school system, that Congress \nwas supposed to reauthorize this bill in 2007. It is now 4 years later, \nand because of our own fecklessness, our own inability to get anything \ndone, every single year teachers and parents and principals keep having \nto put up with what is the crudest accountability system I could \nimagine. The only thing cruder than the accountability system was the \nresponse of big school districts, such as the one I used to work in, to \nthat accountability as people tried to comply with well-intentioned but \nincredibly poorly thought-through laws and regulations from Washington, \nDC. I don't want these schools to have to endure 1 more year of this \nmeaningless accountability, where we are comparing this year's fourth \ngraders to last year's fourth graders and telling ourselves that \nactually makes a difference.\n  There is a lot of good work being done in our States right now around \nstandards--elevating them--so we quit fooling ourselves about whether \nwe are meeting international norms when it comes to our kids. There is \na lot of great work being done in Colorado and other States that have \ncome along creating a growth model that we--not we but moms and dads \nand teachers and principals--can actually track how this group of fifth \ngraders did compared to how they did as fourth graders and how they did \nas third graders and then compare them to similarly situated kids \nacross the country. That makes all the sense in the world compared to \nwhat we currently have.\n\n  I sat out there in absolute despair wondering why this town was so \nmean to our teachers and to our kids. Isn't it a bare minimum that the \nCongress could reauthorize the legislation when they were supposed to--\nin 2007? Yet now we find ourselves here.\n  I thought the Senator from North Carolina was very eloquent this \nmorning and today on the floor as well and I appreciated the points he \nmade. My objection is a narrow one, which is the idea that the right \nway to approach reauthorizing No Child Left Behind, the right way to \napproach trying to fix this situation is to create a bunch of \nprocedural barriers that don't allow us to have a substantive \ndiscussion about it.\n  I agree completely with what the Senator from North Carolina said 1 \nminute ago. There is a reason we have not a 15-percent approval rating \nbut a 12-percent approval rating. There is a reason. I think we should \ncome together in a bipartisan way and reauthorize this bill, get rid of \nAYP, and do some of the important things in this legislation. Then I \nhope the Senator would look at one of my amendments, because one of my \namendments has his pharmacist in mind, if only we could get to a \ndiscussion of the merits of this bill.\n  I see the Senator from Kentucky has left the floor, but I would just \nsay that my only objective in coming down here today was simply to \nimplore him to withdraw that objection. Knowing it is his right to \nobject, I can't think of why he would do it if he wanted to change the \ntrajectory of the work from the Federal level.\n  I thank the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from \nMinnesota and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I also respect my good friend from North \nCarolina, and I want to thank him for his vote on my amendment. I think \nhe is going to like some of my other amendments too.\n  I wish to take issue too with one thing he said. I think he said it \nin a moment where, if he thought about what he said, he might \nreconsider it. I had commented that I have spent more time probably on \nthis bill than on any other, and I have spent a lot of time on the \nAffordable Care Act. The Senator from North Carolina then said, if I \nhad spent more time on this bill than any other, that is a pathetic \ncommentary or a sad commentary because we just got this bill the other \nday. The fact is--and I think the Senator would acknowledge this--work \non any piece of legislation doesn't start when the bill is introduced. \nMy work on this bill\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\nstarted very soon after I arrived in the Senate.\n  My work started with a bill I coauthored with Orrin Hatch, which is \ngoing to be an amendment. It is an amendment to recruit and train \nprincipals for high-needs schools. We have had schools I have seen \nturned around by principals because principals can create the ethos of \nthe school. They have so much to do with selecting the teachers and \ntransforming a school. This amendment would create a program where we \nrecruit people who want to be principals in high-needs schools and have \nthem monitored--if they haven't been a principal before--by a principal \nwho has successfully turned around a high-needs school. That work \nstarted immediately upon my getting to the Senate.\n  I have been going back to and traveling around the State of Minnesota \ntalking to teachers and superintendents and principals. The Senator \nfrom North Carolina talked about the need to have superintendents and \nprincipals and teachers here. We had 10 hearings. I believe it was the \nother side at one point that said, please, stop the hearings.\n  My colleague talked about the transformation models, which I do have \nproblems with. What do we do with a school that has failed? What do we \ndo now with a school in the bottom 5 percent? If the Senator from North \nCarolina was there, we had a superintendent--Joel Klein, superintendent \nof schools or chancellor of the schools in New York--who spoke exactly \nto the transformation models. Again, what works in New York certainly \ndoesn't work in Pine City, MN, or parts of North Carolina, but there \nare plenty of teachers available and plenty of principals available in \nNew York City. So I think we need more flexibility in transformation \nmodels than in this bill--than Joel Klein suggests--and maybe that is \nin the managers' bill now. Joel Klein is a superintendent, and he spoke \nto the transformation models. He said the transformation models gave \nhim the ability to fix schools that were failing, schools that were \ndropout factories.\n\n  So the very thing we have been asked for here: Let's have testimony \nfrom superintendents; aren't these transformation models surreal? We \nhave had these hearings.\n  I would suggest to the Senator from Kentucky who has just come in, my \noffice will print out the transcripts of all the hearings we have had \nand you can read what teachers and principals and superintendents have \nsaid.\n  I have to say that the work you do on these bills doesn't start when \nthe bill hits the desk. In my case, it started 2 years before. And I \ndon't think the Senator actually meant----\n  Mr. BURR. Would the Senator yield for 1 second?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. For a question. Sure.\n  Mr. BURR. If the Senator interpreted my comments to be personally \ntargeted to him, then I do apologize. The Senator said--and I wrote it \ndown: I spent more time on this bill than any other bill ever.\n  My criticism about the statement was, I said: If the Senator got the \nbill when I did, then there is not a whole lot of time between Friday \nwhen I got the bill and Wednesday when it was marked up.\n  I don't question for a minute the Senator from Minnesota or the staff \nhas spent a tremendous amount of hours on education. But in defense of \nSenator Paul and what he has sought is there has not been a hearing on \nthis legislation. There are some things in this 868-page bill our \ncommittee has not had a hearing on that it would be great to have the \nopportunity to ask someone who is an education professional. In the \nabsence of the ability to do that, you, I, the Senator from Kentucky, \nour staffs, all have to rely on what committee staff tells us. And that \nis not always the most accurate thing, regardless of which side of the \naisle you are seeking that information.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Minnesota has said. I think that \neducation should be a passionate debate, and we have seen some passion \nhere this afternoon. I would hope the Senator from Minnesota would \nsuggest to Senator Harkin, maybe there is a pathway where we can get \npredictability in the number of amendments, predictability in the time \nit takes to mark this up, with some accommodation to the sensitivities \nthat Senator Paul and others have raised, because I hope the Senator \nfrom Minnesota will agree with me, there is not an urgency to do it \nthis week, and if we could, when we come back from the end of October, \nhave a hearing, I think we could have a pathway to mark up and \ncompletion.\n  Having said that, it probably will be a product that I couldn't \nsupport, I will aggressively try to amend, and I would be anxious and \nhopeful that I would have the opportunity again on the floor to try to \naffect its content.\n  But if the Senator will be an advocate for that, I think there is a \npathway that doesn't in any way, shape, or form delay our ability in \nthis institution to conference with the House or to present the \nPresident a bill. I would be more concerned with whether we produced \nthe right product, and I think we can achieve that better.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding to me.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Certainly. And obviously I believe in the markup we will \nhave a healthy discussion of every part of this bill and of every \namendment. I think the Senator from North Carolina is going to be so \nthrilled with my amendments, that at the end of the day he is going to \nnot just cast an aye vote on the bill but an enthusiastic one.\n  I accept your apology. I don't think you said exactly what you said \nyou said. What you said was if the Senator spent--it is not worth going \ninto.\n  The point is that your work on a bill doesn't start when a piece of \nlegislation is written. Most of the work comes before. And I want \neveryone to understand that who is listening.\n  This bill has been a tremendous passion of mine. You mentioned \npassion for success. I want the growth model. Senator Bennet was \nsuperintendent of the Denver schools, and very successful. When I did \nmy principal bill, I went to a school in St. Paul, MN, Dayton's Bluff, \nwhich had been a failed school and was turned around by a successful \nprincipal. So I had a roundtable there. This was very early in my \ntenure here. One of the principals said, You know those No Child Left \nBehind tests, we call them autopsies. What he meant was you take them \nat the end of the year, you take them in late April, and you don't get \nthe results until the kids are out of school, and then the results are \nabrogated.\n  We have something in Minnesota that the teachers, superintendents, \nand principals agree on, something called the NWEEA tests. What are \nthose? They are computer-adaptive tests. What does that mean? In \nMinnesota, very often they take these three times a year. They are \ncomputer tests so that teachers get the results right away. The \nprincipal called the No Child Left Behind test autopsies because the \nkids are out of school and the teacher can't use it to inform \ninstruction. If you do a computer test and you get it right away, the \nteachers can use the tests to inform their instruction. I think that is \nwhat most parents thought we were doing in the first place when \nPresident Bush first suggested this law.\n  Secondly, they are adaptive. What does that mean? Well, that means if \na kid gets a question right and keeps getting questions right, the \nquestions get harder; but if they start getting questions wrong, they \nget easier. It is much more diagnostic and you can see exactly where a \nchild is. Right now, the No Child Left Behind test forbids these \nassessments from going outside grade level.\n  Arne Duncan, Secretary of Education, said something profound. He said \nthat a sixth grade teacher who takes a kid from a third grade level of \nreading to a fifth grade level is a success, is a great teacher; but \nunder No Child Left Behind, the way it is now, that teacher is a \nfailure. That makes no sense whatsoever. We have to measure growth. \nThat is what the Senator from Colorado was talking about. We need to \nmeasure growth. And that is no mystery.\n  I go around to schools, and I remember being in a school in St. \nCloud, MN. I was introduced by the principal to the teacher who won \nTeacher of the Year, a math teacher. I met the math teacher, and the \nmath teacher said, ``Growth.''\n  This is not a mystery, and we have had hearings on this and we know \nthis. We need to be measuring how much kids grow, and that will help \nkids who are from poor schools, because they are starting at a lower \nlevel. But if the\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\nschool is good and they are increasing their growth, they will be \nrewarded.\n\n  My daughter graduated from college. I am looking at the pages now who \nare juniors in high school. My daughter, immediately out of college, \nbecame a teacher at a school in the Bronx, 97 percent free and reduced \nprice lunches, a third-grade teacher. That is the first year they do No \nChild Left Behind testing. She had to take her kids from here to here, \nto this arbitrary level of proficiency in order to be considered a \nsuccess, where 15 miles to the north a teacher in Westchester had to \ntake her kids from here to here. That doesn't make any sense.\n  In Minnesota, I have learned from my teachers I have talked to that \nthere is something called ``the race to the middle.'' What is that? \nUnder No Child Left Behind, the way it works now is that there is an \narbitrary bar of proficiency a teacher is judged on, on what percentage \nof their kids in these different subgroups meet or exceed that bar of \nproficiency.\n  Well, the smartest kid in the class is going to pass, no matter what. \nThere is nothing you can do to that kid that won't make that kid exceed \nthe bar of proficiency. So guess what. The teacher ignores that kid.\n  The kid at the bottom, the most challenged kid, well, no way that kid \nis going to make it, so let's ignore that kid.\n  A race to the middle. The kid right below and right above \nproficiency, those are the kids who are drilled--drilled and killed, as \nthey call it in Minnesota.\n  We know what is wrong with No Child Left Behind. We have been \ndiscussing it for 1\\1/2\\ years in hearings. We have been talking about \nit. I have been talking to the ranking member. He mentioned today these \ncomputer-adaptive tests in the markup. These things aren't mysteries. \nMembers were welcomed to the hearing, and some didn't come.\n  But the work on a bill doesn't start the day the bill hits the table. \nThe work of a Senator, if the Senator is a hard-working Senator, is \nevery day. It is going back to your State and finding out what teachers \nand principals and superintendents need. It is going to the hearings. \nIt is talking to the other Members, to the chairman, to the ranking \nmember, and to your staff. And your staff is getting information from \nother staffers--not just the committee staff but from other staffers. I \ndon't want to leave people with the impression that we work once the \nbill hits the table.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I would suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I would like to speak about two \namendments, if I could. One is about basic civil rights and fair \nhousing organizations and the other is about counseling and I would \nlike to speak on both of them.\n  Our Nation's fair housing organizations help enforce basic civil \nrights, something that has been important in this country for many \nyears. They investigate housing discrimination and they educate tenants \nand homeowners of their rights. They fight the pernicious \ndiscrimination that targets and redlines low-income Americans in \ncommunities of color. Housing discrimination not only violates our \nlaws, it is a barrier to economic mobility. That is why the Department \nof Housing and Human Development invests in the Fair Housing Initiative \nProgram which supports fair housing groups across the country.\n  They investigate mortgage lending fraud and predatory lending. They \ninvestigate foreclosure cases that force homeowners out of their \nhomes--an endemic problem in the Presiding Officer's State of Maryland, \nmy State of Ohio, and across the country--before facts and underlying \nrights are observed. Simply put, FHIP helps the very organizations that \neducate the public and enforce the laws that protect people from \nhousing discrimination.\n  The program is cost-effective, saving HUD money as it streamlines \ngovernment resources to move more effectively and efficiently and \ninvestigate complaints. The fair housing organizations investigated 65 \npercent of the Nation's complaints of housing discrimination, nearly \ntwice as many as all agencies combined. Fair housing advocates in \nCincinnati, Dayton, Toledo, Cleveland, Akron, Columbus, and in towns \nacross Appalachian Ohio fight predatory lenders.\n  For millions of Americans, the barrier to opportunity and security is \nthe latent discrimination of ruthless landlords and unscrupulous \nlenders. Without FHIP, our country and our economy are subject to the \nvery discrimination that not only hurts individual renters and \nhomeowners but holds too many communities back. That is why I am \noffering this amendment to restore full funding to FHIP in line with \nthe House level. State and Federal fair housing enforcement is already \nstretched thin. In my home State, the State Civil Rights Commission has \nfour investigators devoted to housing complaints. It would be \ndevastating to cut private fair housing programs any further.\n  This amendment is supported by the Leadership Conference on Civil and \nHuman Rights, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the \nNational Fair Housing Alliance. It is also supported by Miami Valley \nFair Housing Center, Neighborhood Housing Services of Greater \nCleveland, the Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio, the Ohio \nCDC Association, the Toledo Fair Housing Association, and the \nHomeownership Center of Greater Dayton.\n  On Sunday, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial was dedicated on our \nNational Mall. It is a reminder of the era that blatant Jim Crow laws, \nbrutal beatings and segregation may be over, but our fight to remove \nstains and strains of discrimination continues.\n  It continues through thousands of fair housing organizations that \nserve millions of our fellow Americans. It continues with this body \ninvesting in these organizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of \nendorsement of many organizations. This is a letter from those civil \nrights organizations supportive of our legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 October 18, 2011.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye and Ranking Member Cochran: The, \n     undersigned civil rights organizations, urge you to support \n     level funding for the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) \n     by accepting the House number of $42.5 million in your \n     upcoming negotiations. FHIP funding is crucial to protecting \n     all families and individuals seeking fair housing choices \n     across the United States.\n       As you know, the Senate Appropriations Committee's \n     Transportation-HUD bill includes only $35.9 million for FHIP, \n     $7 million less than the figure approved by the House \n     Subcommittee. Such a decrease in FHIP funding would greatly \n     limit the abilities of local organizations to educate the \n     community and the industry about fair housing, and limit the \n     establishment of fair housing organizations in areas where \n     pervasive housing discrimination occurs unchecked.\n       FHIP provides unique and vital services to the public and \n     the housing industry. Private non-profit fair housing \n     organizations are the only private organizations in the \n     country that educate the community and the housing industry \n     and enforce the laws intended to protect all of us against \n     housing discrimination.\n       FHIP saves money for the federal government, and for state \n     and local governments. According to a recent HUD-funded \n     study, ``FHIP grantee organizations weed out cases that are \n     not covered by civil rights statutes'' or that do not have \n     merit, thereby avoiding costly lawsuits and mediations. The \n     vetting of complaints by fair housing organizations ``saves \n     resources for HUD and state agencies that do not have to \n     investigate these complaints.''\n       ``FHIP funding is a critical component of the U.S. civil \n     rights enforcement infrastructure,'' according to HUD. 71% of \n     the cases in which a FHIP organization is a complainant \n     result in conciliation or a cause versus 37% of nonFHIP \n     referred cases.\n       Cuts to FHIP and FHAP will leave entire states and many \n     communities without a place to protect their rights or to \n     report housing discrimination. Over the past ten years, more \n     than 25 fair housing organizations have already had to close \n     their doors or drastically limit their staff due to \n     insufficient funding levels. By cutting FHIP, many more \n     states and communities will be at risk of losing any fair \n     housing resources.\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\n       Fair housing organizations operate efficiently and \n     effectively on shoestring budgets. In 2010, there were 28,851 \n     complaints of housing discrimination filed. This number of \n     complaints still represents less than one percent of the \n     annual incidence of discrimination, which is estimated to \n     exceed four million. Private fair housing organizations \n     investigated 65% of the nation's complaints, i.e. almost \n     twice as many as all government agencies combined.\n       We cannot afford to leave states and communities without a \n     place to protect their rights or report housing \n     discrimination. With the cuts HUD currently faces, the role \n     of fair housing organizations will only become increasingly \n     important.\n       We thank you for your past support for the Fair Housing \n     Initiatives Program, and we ask that you support level \n     funding of $42.5 million as the budget process moves forward. \n     In this economy and devastated housing market, everyone \n     deserves a fair shake at purchasing and renting the home of \n     their choice, regardless of their identity characteristics. \n     We as a nation cannot afford to limit the housing activities \n     of any single family or individual.\n           Sincerely,\n         Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Lawyers' Committee \n           for Civil Rights Under Law, Leadership Conference on \n           Civil and Human Rights, NAACP, National Association of \n           Neighborhoods, National Community Reinvestment \n           Coalition, National Council of La Raza, National Fair \n           Housing Alliance, National Gay & Lesbian Task Force \n           Action Fund, Poverty & Race Research Action Council.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I would like to speak on a second \namendment. Since a peak in 2006, housing prices, as we know in this \ncountry, have fallen by nearly one-third. Total homeowner equity \nslashed in half with the loss of more than $7 trillion. Some 6 million \npeople have lost homes since the height of the financial crisis. Yet \njust yesterday we heard a leading Republican Presidential candidate \ntell an editorial board in Nevada that his solution to the Nation's \nhousing crisis is to speed up the rate of foreclosures. This despite \nclear evidence that basic legal requirements have often gone ignored in \nforeclosure proceedings; this despite clear evidence that some banks \nhave specifically targeted certain communities in specific \nneighborhoods for foreclosure; this despite the fact that persistent \nforeclosures are dragging down property values across the Nation.\n\n  I remember some years ago in Cleveland, in Cuyahoga County in my \nState, we had more foreclosures--except for the moratorium year last \nyear--every year than the year before for the last 14 years. I remember \nneighborhoods in Cleveland where there might be only a couple of \nforeclosures on a street, but we knew what happened when those homes \nwere foreclosed on--well, what obviously happened was vandalism and \nstripping off the aluminum siding and stealing the pipes, and the \nproperty would be degraded and the property would be ignored--and what \nhappened to other homes in the neighborhood and what happened to the \nprices and the values of those homes even though people were paying \ntheir mortgages and staying in their homes.\n  So this--this statement to the Nevada newspaper--this despite the \nclear message from my distinguished colleagues, Senator McCain of \nArizona and Senator Nelson of Florida, representing States such as Ohio \nthat have been devastated by high rates of foreclosures.\n  Earlier this week, my colleagues stated on this floor--some \ncolleagues said we need to do more to get people mortgages they can \nafford, to make payments on them, rather than throwing them out of \ntheir homes. I couldn't agree more. If we are going to strengthen our \neconomy, we must find a stronger response to the foreclosure crisis, \nnot rushing the process but better managing it.\n  Right now, the provision of homeowner counseling is one of the most \neffective ways we have to deal with this crisis. I remember talking to \nfair housing coalitions and organizations in Toledo and Dayton and all \nover my State, telling how they were able, one family at a time, to \navert foreclosure. We know what that means not just for that family but \nto that community because they were able to do foreclosure counseling. \nI have seen firsthand in my State how these programs help better manage \nthe mortgage payment process that helps to keep homeowners in their \nhomes.\n  Organizations such as the Neighborhood Services of Greater Cleveland, \nthe Columbus Housing Partnership, and the Coalition of Homelessness and \nHousing in Ohio are leaders in foreclosure counseling. The Department \nof Housing and Urban Affairs invests in the Housing Counseling \nAssistance Program that supports these Ohio programs and hundreds like \nthem across the country. Housing counselors provide guidance and \nassistance and advice to help families meet the responsibilities of \ntenancy and home ownership.\n  Foreclosure counseling is particularly valuable to those obviously in \ndanger of losing their home. According to a study by the Urban \nInstitute, homeowners who are assisted by mortgage counselors have a \n60-percent better chance of saving their home. If a family has \ncounseling with a professional counselor, somebody to advocate for them \nand assist them, they have a 60-percent better chance of saving their \nhome than if they don't have that assistance.\n  HUD has requested $88 million for housing counseling for each of the \nlast 2 fiscal years. Yet, last year, Congress provided no money for \nthis important program--a program that keeps people in their home, \nhelps their neighbors because this house might not be foreclosed on, \nhelps those people build equity and savings that are essential for \nstable houses, stable families, stable homes, stable neighborhoods, \nstable communities.\n  Given this lack of funding, I am particularly grateful for the work \ndone by the subcommittee chair and ranking member in restoring funding \nfor this program. Special thanks to Senator Murray and Senator Collins. \nThe subcommittee has worked hard to find $60 million to fund the \nprogram. I applaud them for their efforts. Senator Sanders has also \nbeen a great champion in this effort. Even with this level of funding, \nthe demand for housing counseling exceeds the level of services that \nwould be supported.\n  It is imperative that we provide these investments. They are \nnecessary to meet the needs of the record number of homeowners facing \nforeclosure, they are necessary to help advise borrowers preparing to \npurchase new homes, and they are necessary and vital to our housing and \neconomic recovery.\n  Historically, we know that to pull ourselves out of recession in this \ncountry, we need a vibrant manufacturing sector, especially driven by \nauto, and we need housing, more home construction, more home \nrenovation, and appreciation of housing prices. We are doing OK with \nauto manufacturing, but we are not doing nearly well enough with \nhousing.\n  I applaud my colleagues for their work. I appreciate their support \nfor this program, and I look forward to their continued support and to \ntheir supporting the Senate number in conference.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Missouri is here, \nand I am going to make a unanimous consent request that I anticipate he \nwill object to on behalf of other Senators. So let me do that formally \nand then make my comments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. \n112; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any \nrelated statements be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I object on behalf of Senator Hatch and \nSenator Isakson.\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I certainly understand that my friend from \nMissouri is doing this on behalf of other Senators. I want to express \nmy disappointment that these Senators are objecting to the confirmation \nof William J. Boarman, an individual who is eminently qualified to be \nour Nation's 26th Public Printer and head of the Government Printing \nOffice.\n  President Obama nominated Bill Boarman 18 months ago. The Senate \nCommittee on Rules and Administration reported the nomination favorably \nin July of 2010. The nomination languished because of Republican \nobjections so President Obama made a recess appointment on January 3, \n2011, and renominated Mr. Boarman on January 27, 2011. Again, the \nSenate Rules Committee reported the nomination favorably by voice vote \nthis past May.\n  The Public Printer is not a controversial position. Previous Printers \nhave been confirmed without controversy or delay. This obstruction is \nunprecedented.\n  Bill's career in the printing industry spans 40 years. He started as \na practical printer, trained under the apprenticeship program of the \nInternational Typographical Union and served his apprenticeship at \nMcArdle Printing Company in Washington, DC.\n  In 1974, he accepted an appointment as a journeyman printer at the \nGPO. Mr. Boarman was elected president of his home Local 101-12 when he \nwas 30 years of age. He later served as a national officer with the \nITU, where he was a key architect of the merger between the ITU and the \nCommunications Workers of America. He was elected ITU president shortly \nbefore the merger and has been reelected to seven successive terms \nsince.\n  He has served as an unpaid consultant to several Public Printers and \nhas testified before various congressional committees regarding GPO \nprograms and policies. He is an expert in this field. He is eminently \nqualified. I think the Members of this body know that.\n  Mr. Boarman served as chairman of the $1 billion CWA/ITU Negotiated \nPension Plan and the $125 million Canadian Negotiated Pension Plan. He \nhas experience in management. He was among the union leaders who \nspearheaded the creation of the AFL-CIO Capital Stewardship Program and \nthe Center for Working Capital in the Federation.\n  Because of his experience in the field of pension administration, he \nwas chosen to represent CWA on the Council of Institutional Investors, \nserving 12 years as a member of the CII Executive Board and three terms \nas its cochairman. He has also served on the Maryland Commission on \nJudicial Disabilities and as cochair of the Taft-Hartley Northern \nAmerican Study Group educational investment conference.\n  He has served as president of the Union Printers Home, a 122-bed \nskilled nursing facility in Colorado Springs, CO. I mention his \nextensive background to underscore the point that Bill Boarman is, \nperhaps, uniquely qualified to serve as the Nation's Public Printer, \nand there is absolutely no good reason to hold up his confirmation.\n  All we are asking is, let's bring this nomination forward for a \nvote--a person who has eminent qualifications. There is no substantive \nobjection to his confirmation. I hope my colleagues who have raised the \nobjection will allow us to move forward.\n  The Public Printer serves as the chief executive officer of the GPO, \nthe agency charged with keeping the American people informed about the \nwork of the Federal Government.\n  GPO is one of the world's largest printing plants and digital \nfactories and is one of the biggest print buyers in the world. GPO \ndisseminates the Congressional Record and the Federal Register and a \nnumber of other products and services in both print and digital form.\n  The agency has been tasked to build its digital capability into a \nstate of the art operation to improve transparency and citizen access \nto government documents and reports.\n  We hear all the time about making this system more transparent. Mr. \nBoarman knows how to do that. Let's give him a confirmed position so we \ncan help bring the public more into what we do here in Congress.\n  Bill Boarman faces the challenges of maintaining the traditional \nprinting skills of an aging workforce while helping a 150-year-old \norganization adapt to a world in which most documents are ``born \ndigital.''\n  As Bill has said:\n\n       Few Federal agencies can count as their heritage the scope \n     of the work GPO has performed, ranging from the first \n     printing of the Emancipation Proclamation to providing \n     digital access to the Government's publications today. The \n     men and women of GPO are responsible for that heritage.\n\n  It is past time that Bill Boarman--a man with over 40 years of \nexperience in the printing industry--be considered and confirmed as the \nNation's 26th Public Printer.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle: Let the \nSenate do what it is legally responsible to do: advise and consent on \nthese nominations. Let us vote so we can confirm this position that was \nfirst brought forward over a year and a half ago.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of my colleague from Maryland regarding the nomination of Mr. \nBoarman. My colleague from Maryland has offered a spirited and \ncomprehensive description of why Mr. Boarman should be confirmed as our \nPublic Printer. I wish to, one, validate everything he said; and, \nsecond, Mr. Boarman, we need to know, is a reformer. He has the heart \nof a reformer. He has the spirit of a reformer. He has the know-how of \na reformer.\n  As we look at the position he is being asked to serve in, we need \nsomeone who has technical competence in the field, experience in \nmanaging a large organization, and also one who has dealt with the \nchallenges related to both delivering a product but also those related \nto the workforce.\n  I think we are doing a national disservice by not putting this man in \noffice so he can take charge and maintain something that is a \nnonpartisan job--the Government Printing Office. It is not as though he \nis going to be in some back room reprinting little pamphlets from the \n1930s Bread March. He is here to be our Public Printer.\n  We know we are into a new age, a digital age. He has a lot of reform \nto do. We know there is workforce reform that needs to be done but done \nwith sensitivity. Again, he is somebody who himself is from the rank \nand file.\n  I think this: Once again, we are playing politics with a job that \ncertainly is not political. We have an esteemed, qualified individual \nwho wants to be a reformer, to get the job done, and who knows we are \nin a more frugal atmosphere.\n  I think we are wasting time, we are wasting money, and we are wasting \nthe talent of an exceptional individual.\n  I am going to say this: The more we continue to delay and be \ndeleterious on these appointments, why would anybody want to come forth \nto serve in the public domain? They often have to give up jobs or put \ntheir jobs on hold while they are waiting for these confirmation \nprocesses. We put more sand in the gears of government, and then we \nblame government for grinding to a halt.\n  Let's have an orderly way of dealing with nominations and at least \ngive the man a vote up or down, yes or no.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the American people are watching this \nand saying: What are they doing? Well, actually we are doing a lot. \nSenator Blunt and I are managing the bill. You might say: But there is \nnothing going on. Well, there is a lot going on because we are \nreviewing amendments of Senators. That is what all this discussion is, \nto see what we can take or there might even be bipartisan agreement. \nAnd then we are lining up how we will proceed on the next four to six \namendments, again alternating both sides of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\n  So if people are watching this and saying: What are they doing, just \nwhat are they doing, well, we are doing a lot. We hope to, by the close \nof business tomorrow, finish the Agriculture, Commerce-Justice, and \nTransportation-Housing bill appropriations. We are going to have some \nrobust debate on some amendments. Some are quite controversial. But \nright now, we are trying to see what we agree on and, what we don't \nagree on, how could there be a regular, civilized, orderly process for \nhaving a debate and then voting.\n  We anticipate that somewhere around 5:30 or 6:00, we will have a \ncluster of votes. So that is kind of the game plan so far.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nfirst-degree amendments in order to be called up and made pending to \nH.R. 2112 and the substitute amendment No. 738 be the following: \nAyotte, No. 753; Crapo, No. 814; Moran, No. 815; Coburn, No. 793; \nCoburn, No. 798; DeMint, No. 763; DeMint, No. 764; Grassley, No. 860; \nSessions, No. 810; Lautenberg, No. 836; Brown of Ohio, No. 874; \nMerkley, No. 879; Bingaman, No. 771; Gillibrand, No. 869; Feinstein, \nNo. 855; and Menendez, No. 857; further, that a motion to recommit from \nSenator Lee be in order; that, if offered, the motion be set aside and \nthe Senate return to the consideration of the pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this means this is now the order in \nwhich we will proceed. These are the amendments that both sides have \nagreed should be offered in this tranche or cluster.\n  We are saying to the Senators who now have these amendments, get \nready to come to the floor. As I understand it, Kelly Ayotte will be \nhere to offer her amendment, which will be important, and then what we \nwould like to do is alternate on both sides of the aisle. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire will offer her amendment. We hope then that there \nwould be a Democrat, and we will go back and forth. If a Senator is not \nhere, we will move on to the people who are here.\n  We have 16 amendments. We would like to finish these amendments this \nevening. The more that can come and be ready to offer their amendments \nand debate--and Senators will be able to present their amendments and \ndebate them, but we would like to do that.\n  That is the way we are going to proceed. These are the amendments. We \nwill alternate on both sides of the aisle. We encourage Senators who \nhave these amendments to come over and we will call them up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I join my good friend in suggesting we \nwould like to see our colleagues come over here. These three \nappropriations bills are being handled on the floor and they are open \nto amendment. We haven't had appropriations bills on the floor of the \nSenate in this way in quite a while. We would like to get these bills \ndone. Hopefully, we can get these bills done maybe even this week and \nsend them on over to the House to talk about these bills and their \nbills--3 bills, 16 amendments, and those aren't all the amendments we \nexpect to be offered. But we hope these amendments are offered today--a \nsignificant number--and as the Senator from Maryland said earlier, we \nexpect votes on some of these amendments around 6 o'clock. Between now \nand then, we look forward to a vigorous debate on as many of these as \nthe sponsors can come and debate. But the Agriculture bill that I am \nthe ranking member of; the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment bill, which the Senator represents so well; and the \nCommerce-State-Justice bill are all bills that are moving forward in as \nclose to a regular process as we have had in a while.\n  We look forward to seeing these amendments debated this afternoon and \nsome of them--as many of them as possible--voted on this afternoon and \nthis evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri is right. We \nhaven't had a regular order for some time. Leadership on both sides of \nthe aisle has created this fantastic opportunity. We are actually \nfollowing a regular order on our appropriations. We are actually \nfollowing a regular order. This is our opportunity to show we can have \na regular order, that we can move our annual appropriations together in \na well-measured, well-paced, well-debated, and well-scrutinized way.\n  I hope our colleagues who have amendments will come over. We know \nSenators have lots of opinions, and opinions sometimes get translated \ninto amendments. But we ask our colleagues now to show we can govern. \nCome down, come to the floor and offer these amendments and show we can \nmove three very important bills. The one affecting transportation and \nhousing is important to our economy. This is a jobs bill, putting \npeople to work building highways, roads, and housing. Agriculture is an \nimportant part of our economy, and also Commerce, Justice, and Science \nis the innovation committee, the trade committee, and the advocacy for \njustice committee. We look forward to these amendments and debating \nthem.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in a few minutes, I want an opportunity \nto, for clarification, talk about the LRA, troops who have gone over to \nnorthern Uganda, including Rwanda and south Sudan. I will wait now \nbecause a lot will want to speak subject to these amendments.\n  I wish to mention something I think is significant because nobody is \ntalking about it. People have heard me talking over the years about the \noverregulation being pursued by this administration in every area and \nwhat it is costing in terms of jobs.\n  I know I talk about this quite often, but this time I am talking \nabout a different area of overregulation. Most of the time I am talking \nabout what the EPA is doing to destroy businesses in this country. I do \nthat because I am the ranking member on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, which has jurisdiction over the environmental \nregulations and the EPA.\n  When we see what they are doing, it is something that is more \nserious--or at least as serious as all the deficits that are coming out \nof this administration because it is chasing jobs overseas. We will \ntalk about that. This is a different area altogether.\n  We talk about the overregulation that comes from the EPA in the EPW \nCommittee, where we have jurisdiction. Today, I want to mention what is \ngoing on in the USDA. In the 2008 farm bill, the USDA was instructed to \nrevisit and update the marketing regulations authorized to the Packers \nand Stockyards Act of 1921. That particular act is governed by the \nGrain Inspection, Packers, and Stockyards Administration, or GIPSA, as \nit is referred to. That is all within the USDA.\n\n  The agency is supposed to regulate and deal with the marketing \npractices within the livestock industry. I am from Oklahoma, and it is \na huge industry in Oklahoma. This provision of the farm bill was \nheavily debated and amended when it was considered and, ultimately, the \nUSDA was instructed to provide regulations for a few explicit \nobjectives. Among them were broader contract cancellation rights for \nlivestock growers; the disclosure of foreseeable future necessary \ncapital investment required for contract growers within their growing \ncontracts; and criteria for GIPSA to determine whether producers are \ntreated with unreasonable preference or advantage. The House already \nconsidered this. In fact, they have done their Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  Several months after the farm bill was enacted--the one I referred \nto--GIPSA released its preliminary rule,\n\n[[Page S6728]]\n\nand the rule they published went far beyond the requirements that were \nexplicitly stated in the law.\n  One of the biggest problems with the rule is that it would allow \nGIPSA and the USDA to punish livestock producers and buyers for \nengaging in practices it considers unfair or unjust, even when there is \nno proof that their practices are actually harming competition within \nthe industry. They want to do this in the name of leveling the playing \nfield, which we hear a lot about around here, and that playing field \nwould be between the packers and livestock producers, but what they are \ndoing is regulating this industry in a way that would prohibit any real \ninnovation or differentiation among companies in the industry. It \nforces a one-size-fits-all approach to running the livestock industry.\n  For one, the new rule would require packers and stockyards to keep \nwritten documentation justifying any differentiation in price that one \npays to different livestock producers. Can you believe this? The USDA \nwants stockyards to justify every pricing decision they make. If that \nisn't big government, I don't know what is. The USDA wouldn't require \nthis if they didn't intend to review these documents to determine \nwhether the stockyards provided this justification. When doing this, \nthe USDA bureaucrats will have the power to punish and fine stockyards \nthat it believes are behaving unfairly. This is government determining \nwhether they are behaving unfairly.\n  My question is this: In what other industry would this be considered \nacceptable or even appropriate? Can we imagine Walmart being forced to \nsend the Federal Government justification for every price it negotiates \nwith its suppliers? No. That would be ridiculous, and we all understand \nthat.\n  The livestock industry is no different. This is American business, \ncapitalism, and the individuals participating are doing so voluntarily. \nNo one is forcing anyone to be in the livestock business. Negotiating \nprices--where some folks get higher and some folks get lower prices--is \npart of the deal. Some get advantages and some disadvantages, but it \nisn't government making that determination. That is the way it should \nbe.\n  Another problem with this rule is that it would ban packer-to-packer \nsale of livestock. I don't know why the USDA wants to do this. Who \ncares if one stockyard sells or buys from another? It is none of their \nbusiness. It seems perfectly American to me. But this will have a \nparticularly negative impact in Oklahoma.\n  Right now, we only have one pork packing plant of any size in my \nState of Oklahoma, and the next closest plants are in Iowa, Missouri or \nprobably Nebraska--I am not sure--maybe hundreds of miles away. If \npackers or entities owned by packers are no longer allowed to sell hogs \nto other packers, it will force Oklahoma producers to ship hogs out of \nthe State to get them to market. This would increase operating costs, \nit would be prohibitive, and it would take them out of the market. Even \nif Oklahoma pork producers chose to ship hogs out of State, the \nprohibition of packers to sell animals to other packers would force \nproducers to incorporate a middleman to eliminate the direct sale \nbetween packers. All this would do is increase the cost of production. \nThat would make us in Oklahoma less competitive.\n  Let's keep in mind that the Oklahoma pork industry only took off \nafter the construction of a pork processing plant. In 1987, before this \nplant was constructed, the annual cash receipts for pork producers were \n$33 million. That was it. The pork processing plant was constructed in \nthe mid-1990s, provided necessary infrastructure to our State to do \nthis. However, since then, the pork industry's annual cash receipts \nhave risen more than tenfold to $555 million in 2007. So making this \nprocessing plant less capable of serving the needs of Oklahomans and \nour pork producers will undoubtedly hurt our industry and our \nconsumers.\n\n  Unfortunately, these are only a few examples of the bad provisions of \nthe new GIPSA rule I have heard about extensively from my livestock \nproducers, and I am sure everyone else from agricultural States has \nheard about the concerns their States have. They believe that if this \nrule is finalized, it will force them to completely change the way they \nconduct business, and no government rule should force private \nbusinesses to do this, especially when the industry practices they have \ndeveloped have been very effective at safely bringing meat products to \nthe market.\n  Another problem with this rule is that the USDA has not publicly \nreleased the study it did to determine its economic impact. And we know \nwhy they haven't. It is very expensive. Several private studies have \nbeen done, and one of them estimated that the rule would reduce U.S. \neconomic activity by $14 billion and would result in the loss of over \n100,000 jobs. The USDA needs to release the economic impact analysis it \ndid. There is no justification for their not doing this. So we have \nmade that request, and we are waiting for that to happen.\n  There is a nominee for Secretary of Commerce--a very nice person, a \nfine person named John Bryson--whom I oppose. The reason I oppose John \nBryson is he has been very active in this whole movement on cap and \ntrade. We all know what that is. We have talked about it for 10 years. \nWe had the Kyoto Convention that we did not become a part of, and there \nhave been several efforts to have bills on the floor to have cap and \ntrade, supposedly to stop catastrophic greenhouse or global warming. \nNow people know the science has been debunked. It is not real. Yet they \nare going ahead and doing it. But if the President is able to pass \nthese regulations, it will cost the American people between $300 \nbillion and $400 billion a year.\n  Now, I would say this. There are a lot of people out there saying: \nWell, it doesn't hurt to pass a tax increase of $300 billion if it is \ngoing to do something about global warming. Even President Obama's EPA \nnominee and choice, Lisa Jackson--now confirmed--has gone on record. In \nresponse to the question, if we were to pass any of these bills, \nwhether it would be the McCain-Lieberman bill or the Waxman-Markey \nbill, any of these cap-and-trade bills that would be passing on a $300 \nbillion to $400 billion tax increase, if that happened, would that \nreduce emissions, her answer was no.\n  Just logically look at that. If we do that in the United States, it \nwill not change the emissions because this isn't where the problem is. \nThe problem is in China and India and in Mexico.\n  So the cost of these regulations is unbearable for our economy, and \nhere we are with over 9 percent unemployment. We are very fortunate in \nmy State of Oklahoma because we have diversified, and our unemployment \nrate is down to 5\\1/2\\ percent. But nationally it is a disaster. So \nregulations are a very important part of this.\n  I want to make sure we make it very clear that it is not just the \nregulations that come from the Environmental Protection Agency because \nthese regulations we are talking about are going to be from the USDA.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, unless there is no one \nwaiting.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would advise the Senator that we are \nwaiting for one of the Senators to come and offer an amendment, if he \nwishes to speak on another subject.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to, and I would be happy to yield the floor \nto anyone else who comes to offer an amendment, if the Senator would \nalert me to that.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Why don't you proceed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right, I will.\n\n\n                     U.S. Troops in Northern Uganda\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I know there is a lot of confusion, and a \nlot of people are blaming President Obama for sending 100 troops into \nnorthern Uganda.\n  First, I want to make sure everyone knows I am not a fan of President \nObama. He is responsible for all these regulations that are driving out \nAmerican businesses. He is responsible for the deficit. Actually, his \nthree budgets have had deficits each year of $1\\1/2\\ trillion, and he \nis up to almost $5 trillion in deficits. It is coming not from the \nDemocrats, not the Republicans, not the House or the Senate, it is \ncoming from President Obama. And I disagreed with his position with \nLibya, sending our troops in there the way he did.\n  I am on the Armed Services Committee, the second ranking member, and \nI am very much concerned about what is happening right now and what \nthis President has done to our military\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\nin reducing our capability to the extent he has. But having said that, \nlet me say that the criticism he has received for sending 100 American \ntroops into northern Uganda is not justified, and let me explain what I \nam talking about.\n  This picture here is of a guy whose name is Joseph Kony. Joseph Kony \nis a monster. For 25 years, he has been in northern Uganda, but he has \nbeen in other countries too--Rwanda, now the new country of South \nSudan, the Central African Republic, and the Congo. Those five \ncountries are where he has been.\n  This is what he does. Many people don't know about him. In fact, 3 or \n4 days ago Rush Limbaugh was commenting that nobody knows what the LRA \nis; that is, the Lord's Resistance Army, and so I am here to tell you \nand tell you why these troops were sent over. It was not President \nObama; it was I who did this. We passed a law requiring that to be \ndone. Let me explain why.\n  I have been active in Africa for many years. Fifteen years ago, I was \nin northern Uganda, in an area called Gulu, and I found out there is a \nguy up there by the name of Joseph Kony.\n  This is Joseph Kony. He is a spiritual leader. What he does is he \ngoes into the villages and he abducts hundreds and thousands of young \nkids, usually between the ages of 11 and 14, and then he takes the \ngirls and sends them into prostitution, but he trains the boys to be \nsoldiers. We are talking about kids 11 to 14 years old. So he teaches \nthem how to use AK-47s, and when they graduate, these kids have to go \nback to the villages from where they were abducted and kill their \nsiblings and kill their parents. If they do not do it, they come back--\nand this is significant--and they are then mutilated.\n  These are all kids. See, they are holding their AK-47s and all that.\n  This next chart shows what happens if one of these kids comes back \nand he doesn't kill his parents or do as Joseph Kony says. He mutilates \nthe kids, and the way he does it is he cuts off their ears, cuts off \ntheir noses, their lips, or cuts off their hands. This guy here, John \nOchola, his hands were cut off and his nose and ears were cut off. This \none just went through it, and he is still bleeding.\n  These are kids. These are kids, 12 and 14 years old. This is what he \nhas been doing to thousands of kids for 25 years now. So having \nsympathy for that, I came back and talked to some of my colleagues \nhere, and I said: We have to do something about this. At that time, we \nwere not allowed to send troops in. This has nothing to do with sending \ncombat troops into an area. Certainly this has nothing to do with what \nthe President did in Libya. But we passed a law that said that we are \nsending assistance into northern Uganda and the other four countries, \nbut they are specifically precluded from entering into combat. In other \nwords, the 100 troops who went in cannot even carry a weapon. They \ncannot be involved by law. I put that in the law. Those words are \nthere. So what we are doing is we are able to go in and assist them in \nintelligence, maybe loan them a helicopter or whatever they need to \ntake this guy out or to bring him to the international court. That \nwould probably be better.\n\n  But this is what this guy has been doing for 25 years, and you have \nto go see it to really appreciate it--these mutilated little kids.\n  Well, anyway, I will say this. Those who are critical of me for \nsupporting sending our troops over are ill-founded in their criticism \nfor two reasons. First of all, we already have troops all over the \nworld in places such as Africa. In the continent of Africa, we have \nseveral thousand American troops in a program called Train and Equip. \nIt is specifically called 1206 and 1208 funding. That means we go into \nthese countries and we help train the African nations to prepare for \nwhen the squeeze takes place in the Middle East and the terrorists come \ndown through Djibouti and the Horn of Africa and spread out through the \nAfrican Continent. We are building five African brigades. We are \ntraining them so that when something happens, as it did happen in the \ncountries where we are currently in battle, we don't have to send our \ntroops in because we are training them so they can take care of their \nown problems. That is essentially what is happening.\n  I was in this brandnew country the other day, South Sudan. We have \nall heard about Sudan and Khartoum and heard and been told about all \nthe atrocities that are committed there, and it just makes you cry when \nyou see what is happening. Well, they now have split off, so South \nSudan has a separate country. I was there last week. I was the first \none there in terms of Members of the Senate just to cheer them on.\n  I had 25 members of the Parliament of this new country called South \nSudan with me for a period of 2 hours. Do you know what they said, Mr. \nPresident. They said: If you really want to do something about \nterrorism, get this growing force that Joseph Kony has and help us take \nhim out.\n  This question was asked of me today on a talk radio show: Why is it \nwe can't get Uganda or Congo or Rwanda to do this?\n  I would suggest that the Presidents of these three countries came \nfrom the bush. President Museveni was a warrior in the bush, and he \ndoesn't like to admit he can't take care of one monster named Joseph \nKony by himself. The same is true with Paul Kagame, who is President of \nRwanda. Remember 1994 when they had the genocide? And he came from the \nbush. He is a tough warrior, but he doesn't want to admit he would have \nto have help to take care of that. Joe Kabila, from the Congo, the same \nthing.\n  Well, I was able to get the three of them together, and they agreed \nthey would work together with each other, and they asked if they could \nhave some support from the United States in the way of intelligence and \nmaybe a helicopter or two, and I said yes. So we passed the law. This \nlaw we passed was right here in the Senate. There was not one Senator \nwho voted against it. I had 64 cosponsors--the largest number of \ncosponsors on any bill addressing a problem in Africa in the history of \nthis Senate. So we are all in accord.\n  A lot of Members are not courageous enough to tell the truth about \nthis. A lot join in saying: Oh, we are not going to send more troops \nover. Let me assure you, these troops are going to go over and save \nlives. And they could very well be saving American lives because if \nthis terrorist movement is allowed to continue, then we will have \nanother terrorist movement in that part of the world that should be \ngetting a lot of our attention.\n  So with that, just to repeat two things, first of all, we already \nhave troops over there in Training and Equip. These same troops will be \ndoing that while there. Secondly, there won't be one American troop in \nharm's way in northern Uganda, the Central African Republic, South \nSudan, Rwanda, or any of the other places where Joseph Kony might be \nleading his reign of terror.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 753 to Amendment No. 738\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment, and I call up my amendment No. 753.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Ms. Ayotte] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 753 to Amendment No. 738.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the prosecution of enemy \n         combatants in Article III courts of the United States)\n\n       After section 217 of title II of division B, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 218. (a) Prohibition on Use of Funds for Prosecution \n     of Enemy Combatants in Article III Courts.--None of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available for the Department \n     of Justice by this Act may be obligated or expended to \n     commence the prosecution in an Article III court of the \n     United States of an individual determined to be--\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\n       (1) a member of, or part of, al-Qaeda or an affiliated \n     entity; and\n       (2) a participant in the course of planning or carrying out \n     an attack or attempted attack against the United States or \n     its coalition partners.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Article III court of the United States'' \n     means a court of the United States established under Article \n     III of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (2) The term ``individual'' does not include a citizen of \n     the United States.\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I filed amendment No. 753 to H.R. 2012, \nthe appropriations minibus. My amendment would prohibit the use of \nfunds for fiscal year 2012 for the prosecution of enemy combatants in \nour article III courts. This prohibition would apply to individuals who \nare members of al-Qaida or affiliated terrorist groups and who have \nparticipated in the course of planning or carrying out attacks against \nour country, the United States of America, or our coalition partners.\n  In no other conflict have we treated our enemies as criminals and \ntried them in our civilian court system. I believe we need to stop \ncriminalizing this war, and that is why I have brought forward this \namendment. These individuals should be treated with military custody \nand tried in military commissions, and that is why I have brought \nforward this amendment at this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I am here to speak in favor of the entire \nappropriations legislation that is before us, but particularly the \nCommerce, Justice, and Science appropriations bill. I thank Senator \nMikulski for her leadership, and all of the members of that \nsubcommittee who have worked on this portion of the appropriations \nlegislation before us.\n  Given the current financial constraints we are facing, I know this \nhas been an especially difficult time to be trying to address the needs \nin the critical areas of our Federal budget, particularly with respect \nto Commerce, Science, and Justice, but I am here to speak to the \nsection of the bill that deals with the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n  I am here on behalf of New Hampshire, because we have a particular \ninterest in this section of the legislation because it directs the \nBureau of Prisons to activate three Federal prisons which are currently \nbuilt but are not yet opened. One of those prisons is in Berlin, NH, in \nthe northernmost part of our State.\n  I came to the floor last spring when we were debating the 2011 \ncontinuing resolution to talk about this issue of opening the Berlin \nprison because it was completed and not yet opened. The prison is a \nmedium-security prison. It was completed last November at a cost of \n$276 million. Since November, when the project was completed, it has \nbeen costing us $4 million to maintain security at the prison to make \nsure that damage is not done to this new facility. We have had a warden \non board since about that time, but she has not been able to hire any \nof the staff she needs to activate this prison.\n  Since that time, when I last came to the floor, our Federal prison \nsystem has gotten even more overcrowded. Last spring, I talked about \nthe fact that our prison system was 35 percent overcrowded, and that \nfor medium-security facilities it was 39 percent overcrowded. Since \nthat time, we have had a net increase of 7,541 Federal prisoners in our \nsystem, so now our entire prison system is 39 percent overcrowded and \nmedium-security prisons are 51 percent over capacity. If we are going \nto ensure safety, we need to begin to open some of these new \nfacilities, and I am very pleased that we have language in the \nCommerce, Justice, and Science bill that would address opening these \nnew facilities, including the Berlin prison.\n  This is a project that has bipartisan support. The new prison in \nBerlin was started under President Bush. It was continued under \nPresident Obama. The congressional delegation in New Hampshire supports \nthe facility. It will create about 340 jobs in a region of the State \nthat is very much in need of new jobs because it has lost a lot of its \nmanufacturing base because the paper industry has moved offshore. It \nwould have an impact of about $40 million to the region of the State \nwhere it is located which is, again, very important for a region that \neconomically is in need of jobs and economic activity.\n  The community of Berlin has already spent $3 million for water and \nsewer upgrades. Since 2008, the residents of Berlin, local businesses, \nand State workforce development officers have been preparing for the \nprison to open. The community and local government officials have \npartnered with the business community to coordinate their resources. \nThey have been waiting for these jobs.\n  When the New Hampshire Department of Employment Security first began \nreaching out to people in the North Country about the opportunities in \nthe prison, the workshops were full of job seekers. We have been \ntalking a lot about job creation here in this Congress, and now we have \nan opportunity to act on this bill to get people back to work in \nnorthern New Hampshire.\n  Families in New Hampshire and across the country are struggling. We \nneed the jobs this legislation is going to create. At a time when we \nshould be focused on reining in wasteful spending, we can't continue to \nspend millions of taxpayer dollars to maintain an empty building. So \nthis funding is good economic policy, it is good fiscal policy, and I \ncertainly intend to support this piece of the appropriations \nlegislation before us, and I hope all of my colleagues will do the \nsame.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator from Idaho wish to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. VITTER. And if I could address the Senator through the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I have a modification to my amendment which will take \nabout 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, what I wish to suggest as a way of \nproceeding, with the concurrence of the other side, is the Senator \nmodify his amendment, because that is quick. Then we will go to the \nSenator from Idaho. Then I have some rebuttals to some of the \namendments offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 769, As Modified\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I call for regular order with respect to \namendment No. 769 and that the amendment be modified with the changes \nthat are at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending. The amendment will \nbe so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 83, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act for \n     the Food and Drug Administration shall be used to prevent an \n     individual not in the business of importing a prescription \n     drug (within the meaning of section 801(g) of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381(g))) from \n     importing a prescription drug from Canada that complies with \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act: Provided, That the \n     prescription drug may not be (1) a controlled substance, as \n     defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 802); or (2) a biological product, as defined in \n     section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262). \n     None of the funds made available in this Act for the Food and \n     Drug Administration shall be used to change the practices and \n     policies of the Food and Drug Administration, in effect on \n     October 1, 2011, with respect to the importation of \n     prescription drugs into the United States by an individual, \n     on the person of such individual, for personal use, with \n     respect to such importation by individuals from countries \n     other than Canada.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nStabenow and Bingaman be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. In closing, let me state that this again very tightly \nnarrows the amendment to a very specific purpose, to allow safe FDA-\napproved prescription drugs to be reimported for individual consumer \nuse from Canada, and Canada only.\n  In doing so, this makes it a nearly identical amendment to that which\n\n[[Page S6731]]\n\nwas approved in the last Senate on a strong bipartisan vote. I urge and \nlook forward to that same strong support for this Vitter amendment No. \n769.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 814 to Amendment No. 738\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I call up my amendment No. 814.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo], for himself, Mr. \n     Johanns, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Moran, and Mr. Vitter, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 814 to amendment No. 738.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the orderly implementation of the provisions \n    of title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n                Protection Act, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 83, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission--\n       (1) to promulgate any final rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall \n     Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-\n     203; 124 Stat. 1376) (including under any law amended by that \n     Act) or the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), \n     until the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, jointly with \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission and the prudential \n     regulators (as defined in section 1a of the Commodity \n     Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a))--\n       (A) has, pursuant to the notice and comment provisions of \n     section 553 of title 5, United States Code, adopted an \n     implementation schedule for title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall \n     Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 8301 et \n     seq.)

I wish to note that as cosponsors of the amendment, \nSenators Johanns, Shelby, Toomey, Moran, Vitter, and Kirk are also \nsupportive.\n  The unprecedented scope and pace of agency rulemaking in the United \nStates today is posing incredible uncertainty and threat to our \neconomy. Americans today know that jobs are the No. 1 issue we face, \nand consistently across the country Americans are also recognizing that \nthe explosion of government regulatory action is one of the huge \nimpediments to our job creation efforts in America.\n  Unfortunately, under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are seeing one of the \nmost significant rulemaking levels of activity in every part of our \neconomy. Many of the proposed rules do not give sufficient \nconsideration to how they will affect Main Street or our economy as a \nwhole, how they will interact with one another or, frankly, how they \nwill impact our global competitiveness.\n  Through this amendment, I focus on the CFTC to send a strong message \nto all regulators involved in the rulemaking process that we cannot \nafford regulations that unnecessarily burden our businesses, our \neconomy, and our competitive position in the global marketplace.\n  This amendment does three basic things:\n  It prohibits funds from being used by the CFTC to promulgate any \nfinal rules until the agency substantiates that those rules are \neconomically beneficial; secondly, it adheres to congressional intent \nto provide end users with a clear exemption from margin requirements; \nand, third, it sets clear bounds on the overseas applications of the \nderivatives requirements.\n  With regard to the process portion of the amendment, in February, \nwhen many members of the banking committee wrote to our financial \nregulators, we strongly urged them to employ fundamental principles of \ngood regulation in their statutory mandate and not to sacrifice quality \nand fairness in exchange for speed. We had two main concerns: that the \nregulators are not allowing adequate time for meaningful public comment \non their proposed rules; and that the regulators are not conducting \nrigorous quantitative analysis of the costs and benefits of their rules \nand the effects those rules can have on our economy and our competitive \nposition in a global marketplace.\n  On April 15, 2011, the Office of Inspector General for the CFTC \nissued a report of an investigation entitled ``An Investigation \nRegarding the Cost Benefit Analyses Performed by the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission in Connection with Rulemakings Undertaken Pursuant \nto the Dodd-Frank Act.'' Unfortunately, the IG report demonstrated that \nthe CFTC is not using rigorous economic analysis to shape its \nrulemaking.\n  In April, Harvard Law Prof. Hal Scott testified on urgently needed \nfixes in the Dodd-Frank rulemaking process. We also began hearing from \nCFTC Commissioners Scott O'Malia and Jill Sommers about problems with \nthe rulemaking process, specifically with economic analysis.\n  In August, CFTC Commissioner Scott O'Malia stated that the current \nprocess\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\nof enacting rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act is \ninadequate, and excoriated the regulatory body for not putting together \na clear rulemaking order and implementation schedule for public \ncomment.\n  Again, in August, CFTC Commissioner Jill Sommers stated:\n\n       I believe it is a mistake for us to begin the process \n     without a plan to logically sequence our consideration of \n     final rules along with a transparent implementation plan.\n\n  In July, the SEC's proxy access rule became the first Dodd-Frank rule \nto be successfully challenged in court for failing to adequately \nanalyze its economic costs and benefits. In the unanimous decision to \nvacate the rule, U.S. Circuit Court Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote:\n\n       The Commission inconsistently and opportunistically framed \n     the costs and benefits of the rule; failed adequately to \n     quantify the certain costs or to explain why those costs \n     could not be quantified; neglected to support its predictive \n     judgments, contradicted itself; and failed to respond to the \n     substantial problems raised by commenters.\n\n  In this amendment, we require the CFTC to fix its rulemaking process \nby prohibiting funding for any final CFTC rules until the Commission, \njointly with the SEC and other prudential regulators, publishes a \nschedule outlining the order in which the agencies will consider and \nimplement the final rules. Affected market participants will be able to \nweigh in and be heard about how rules should be adopted and \nimplemented. Agencies will have to work together to come up with \ncoordinated schedules for proceeding with rulemaking and \nimplementation. The agencies will have to take into consideration \neconomic impacts, international competitiveness, the interaction of \ntheir rules one with another, and the implications of inconsistencies \nin the approaches taken by different regulators.\n  It is more important that the CFTC and other agencies allow for \nmeaningful public comment and economic analysis than it is to rush \nthrough these rules and risk undermining the integrity of the process \nand diminishing the utility of this important market.\n  Secondly, we protect end users from the burdensome margin \nrequirements of the statute. When the Dodd-Frank conference was \nreopened to deal with the scoring issue, Senators Dodd and Lincoln \nacknowledged that the language for end users was not perfect, and tried \nto clarify the intent of the language with a joint letter, stating:\n\n       The legislation does not authorize the regulators to impose \n     margins on end users, those exempt entities that use swaps to \n     hedge or mitigate commercial risk.\n\n  However, regulators have interpreted the actual Dodd-Frank \nlegislative language as providing authority to require end users to \npost margin. This amendment provides certainty for Main Street \nbusinesses that played no role in the financial crisis by establishing \na clear exemption from excessive margin requirements.\n  End users have emphasized the critical importance of addressing this \nproblem. In its letter, the Coalition for Derivatives End-Users \nhighlighted the stakes of getting this issue right. They said:\n\n       While the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations do \n     much to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk in the \n     derivatives market, they include provisions that, if \n     implemented as proposed or otherwise expected, would impose \n     unnecessary burdens on end-user companies. While we believe \n     it is important to reduce risk within our financial markets, \n     transactions with end users have not been found to pose \n     systemic risk. Our companies and our economy cannot afford to \n     unnecessarily tie up capital that would otherwise be used to \n     promote growth and create jobs.\n\n  MillerCoors echoed these sentiments when it said:\n\n       This amendment protects our ability to efficiently buy \n     malting barley, hops and other ingredients used to brew our \n     beers.\n\n  FMC and the National Association of Corporate Treasurers noted:\n\n       This legislation addresses concerns that are of critical \n     importance to end-users--companies using derivatives to \n     reduce business and financial risk and not to speculate. FMC \n     and the other members of the NACT support legislation \n     enabling end-users to continue their cost-effective use of \n     derivatives to manage the commercial risks that they face \n     when they make investments to expand plant and equipment, \n     conduct research and development, build inventories to \n     support higher sales, and to sustain and ultimately grow \n     jobs.\n\n  The third thing the amendment does is to limit the extraterritorial \nreach of Dodd-Frank--of the CFTC rulemaking to streamline regulation \nand protect American competitiveness. Chairman Johnson and Congressman \nFrank recently sent a letter to the regulators that brought up the \nconcern that the extraterritorial imposition of margin requirements \nraises questions about the consistency with Congressional intent \nregarding title VII.\n  They pointed out that Congress generally limited the territorial \nscope of title VII activities to within the United States. \nExtraterritorial application of one nation's laws to another nation's \nmarkets and firms is especially problematic in a global market such as \nderivatives, where it is common for counterparties based in different \nparts of the world to engage in transactions with each other.\n  The historical practice of U.S. regulators is to recognize and defer \nto foreign regulators when registered entities engaged in activities \noutside the United States are subject to comparable foreign regulation.\n  Given recent statements and actions by U.S. regulatory agencies, \nthere is concern that proposals could create uncertainty as to how \nadditional regulations could apply across borders and alter regulatory \nprecedent. While there is bipartisan support from Members of Congress \nto encourage our regulators to work with their international \ncounterparts to seek broad harmonization, there is a growing list of \nnoteworthy and critical items that we are seeing related to the lack of \nprogress on international harmonization.\n  The CFTC and the SEC are taking divergent approaches on some \nderivatives rules, raising questions about whether we can harmonize \neven within our own borders, let alone with foreign regulators. Foreign \njurisdictions in Europe, not to mention Asia and Latin America, have \noutright rejected many reforms--such as the section 716 swap pushout \nprovisions. It remains unclear as to what foreign jurisdictions will \nimpose a margin requirement such as proposed by our prudential \nregulators. Simply put, the rest of the world is not following us in a \nnumber of critical areas.\n  Third parties, including market analysts and economists and \nacademics, have also indicated that these rules will negatively impact \nU.S. competitiveness and growth. Our Fed Chairman Bernanke recently \nwarned that the extraterritorial application of margin rules could \ncreate a significant competitive disadvantage for U.S. companies. We \ncan't force Europe or Asia or Latin America to follow, and if our rules \nare finalized in the United States before other jurisdictions' rules, \nwe risk substantially harming U.S. competitiveness, growth, and \nfinancial stability. That is why this amendment sets clear bounds on \nthe overseas applications of the derivatives requirements, while \nallowing regulators to stop systemically dangerous transactions \nintended to evade U.S. requirements.\n  In conclusion, there can be no doubt about our resolve to address the \nroot causes of the financial crisis. But equally, there can be no doubt \nabout our resolve to ensure that we do this with great care. Failing to \ndo so will threaten our businesses, our economy, and our \ncompetitiveness globally. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment as an important step to ensuring that while working together \nfor the former, we do not neglect the latter.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 879 to Amendment No. 738\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

or\n       (2) represented that goods described in paragraph (1) were \n     produced in the United States.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to offer this amendment for the \nconsideration of this body because it is important to boosting American \njobs and manufacturing and ensuring that more of our American dollars \nare spent here at home. When the Federal Government spends tax dollars, \nit should be looking to American companies to provide goods and \nservices. Recently, an issue came to light that gave me substantial \nconcern.\n  A few months ago, a bid was awarded to a Chinese company to provide \nsteel for a freight rail bridge in Alaska, the Tanana Bridge. There was \nstrong American competition. However, the award went to the Chinese \ncompany.\n  If there were a level playing field, that would be one thing. But, in \nfact, China is employing a three-tiered strategy that provides enormous \nsubsidies to its own manufacturing, tilting the playing field \nconsiderably. The first part of that strategy is to peg its currency so \nits products have a 25- to 40-percent subsidy--equivalent to that \nsubsidy--because of the pegging of the currency.\n  The second piece is it provides all kinds of subsidies that are not \nactually permitted under WTO, but China is doing it anyway. These go \ndirectly to the heart of manufacturing competition. Recently, a \nbipartisan amendment was put forward. I applaud my colleagues from \nWyoming, Senator Enzi and Senator Barrasso. We said China is required \nunder the WTO to post its subsidies, to notify the parties of its \nsubsidies. It has done so only once since 2006. It is in violation. \nAlso, under the WTO, the American Trade Representative is authorized to \ncounternotify if China fails to do so--and we had not done so. So we \ncalled upon our Trade Representative to counternotify. Very \ninterestingly, the next week we get this list of 200 subsidies that \nChina is utilizing outside the framework of WTO to subsidize its \nmanufacturers and compete unfairly against the United States.\n  The third part of the strategy is that China is using its central \nbank as the only authorized bank to control the interest rate on \ndeposits and thereby also being able to control the interest rates on \nloans in a fashion that provides enormous subsidies to our competitors \nin China. Until recently, America had stood on the sidelines and not \nconfronted any of these three Chinese strategies other than to say in \nsome cases that are relevant to our national defense and our national \ntransportation system there needs to be a provision to buy products \ninside America.\n  But this particular project fell between the cracks. Although the \nfunds came from the Defense Department, it was not a straight Defense \nDepartment program, and although it was a rail program, it was not a \npassenger rail program. This amendment closes this loophole.\n  At a time when Americans everywhere are searching for jobs, we should \nbe supporting American companies that employ and hire Americans, \nespecially to make sure American companies are not disadvantaged by \nthis three-tier Chinese strategy that tilts the playing field against \nour companies and thereby destroys jobs in America. Under this \namendment, freight rail transportation contracts exceeding $100,000, \nfunded in the appropriations bill, would use steel, iron, and \nmanufactured products produced in America.\n  There is flexibility provided to the Secretary of Transportation to \nwaive this requirement under one of three scenarios--if the application \nis inconsistent with the public interest, if the materials and products \nare not available in sufficient quantity or quality or that the \ninclusion of domestic material would increase the price by more than 25 \npercent.\n  I am not sure 25 percent is high enough, given that just pegging its \ncurrency creates a 25-to 40-percent subsidy for Chinese products, so \nthis may not go far enough. This may only go a small portion of the way \nto leveling the playing field. I lay it down as a marker that we should \ncreate fairness so American manufacturers can compete. This amendment \nmay not go as far as it should, but it is certainly a stride in the \nright direction. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support\n\n[[Page S6734]]\n\nit. If we do not make things in America, we will not have a middle \nclass in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 6, line 17, insert ``: Provided further, That \n     $8,000,000 of the amount made available by this heading shall \n     be transferred to carry out the program authorized under \n     section 14 of the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 1012)'' before the period at the end.\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, the amendment I am offering today was one \nI discussed in the agricultural appropriations subcommittee. I am a \nMember of that subcommittee and am very interested in the topic of the \nappropriations for the Department of Agriculture. This amendment would \ntransfer $8 million from the Department's administrative account to the \nWatershed Rehabilitation Program. The Watershed Rehabilitation Program \nis a bit broader than this, but basically what we are talking about are \nPL-566 watershed structures. Across our country, more than 1,000 \nstructures have been built over a long period of time. Many of them are \nup to 50 years old. These structures are built for purposes of flood \ncontrol, for nutrient management, for conservation, wildlife habitat, \nfor recreation. Clearly, these structures have been an important \ncomponent of the economy and well-being of communities and people \nacross America for a long time.\n  In fact, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service of \nthe Department of Agriculture, these PL-566 structures provide \nagricultural benefits at their estimate of $404 million. These benefits \nare things such as erosion control, animal waste management, water \nconservation, water quality improvement, irrigation efficiency, changes \nin land use--things such as that.\n  There are also nonagricultural benefits which the NRCS estimates at \n$877 million in benefits. These are associated with recreation, fish \nand wildlife, rural water supply, water quality, municipal and \nindustrial water supply, incidental recreation uses. Then, of course, \nwhat is particularly important as we look at what has happened in our \ncountry during this season, during this year: flood \ncontrol. Agricultural flood control by NRCS estimates is a value of \n$320 million; nonagricultural flood protection, $425 million. We are \ntalking about flood control structures that have benefited, for a \nnumber of reasons, about $2 billion. This amendment does not create the \nopportunity to construct more of those structures. The problem this \namendment addresses is that those structures are aging. As I said \nearlier, many of them are nearly 50 years old.\n\n  In my view, it is very much like the analogy we have with bridges. We \nfocused some attention over the last several years on deteriorating \nbridges and infrastructure in our highway system. We know if we don't \nprovide the maintenance, the deterioration occurs, and ultimately we \ncould have a catastrophe. That is what I am trying to address here, is \nmy fear that in the absence of paying attention to the maintenance of \nthese flood control structures, we run the potential of having a \ndisaster. Not only do the benefits accrue to agriculture and to \ncommunities and water supply and recreation, but the real thing here is \nabout the loss of property values and, more importantly, the loss of \nlife. In the absence of maintaining these structures, we run the risk \nthat the investment we have made over decades begins to disappear. Not \nonly do we lose the value of the asset, we potentially lose life by \nthose who would be harmed by the flooding that will occur in the \nabsence of these flood control measures.\n  Therefore, a watershed rehabilitation program was created years ago. \nThe problem in the funding we have today in the appropriation bill \nbefore us is there is no money, zero money in the bill, to maintain \nthese structures. So ours is a very modest proposal to keep the program \nongoing of transferring $8 million into that rehabilitation program to \nmaintain those structures and prevent bad things from happening. This \nis probably woefully inadequate in regard to the amount of resources \nthat should be devoted to this. Looking at the bill and looking at the \nstructure of the bill and how we tried try to find the right priorities \nand the balance within the agriculture appropriations subcommittee and \nat the full Appropriations Committee, we concluded that we had the \nopportunity to at least put $8 million into the program.\n  The watershed rehabilitation program is administered by the Natural \nResource and Conservation Service, and here is what it is described to \ndo. It assists project sponsors with rehabilitation of aging project \ndams. Only dams installed under PL-566 and a couple of other programs \nare eligible. The purpose of this program is to extend the service life \nof dams and meet applicable safety and performance standards. Priority \nis given by NRCS to those structures that pose the highest risk to life \nand property. Projects are eligible when hazard to life and property \nincreases due to downstream development and where there is a need for \nrehabilitation to extend the planned life of the structure.\n  What that is saying is in many of these instances where the structure \nhas been built, almost 50 years ago, communities have been built \ndownstream and the dam becomes even more important to protect property \nand life for that development. So we are here trying make certain there \nis a level of funding for repairing and replacing deteriorated \ncomponents, repairing damage from catastrophic events, such as the \nfloods we have experienced this year, and upgrading the structures to \nmeet new dam safety laws or to even decommission a structure.\n  I would guess we are not going to fund new structures here in this \nCongress in this fiscal environment. We ought to at least take the \nresponsibility of providing money to maintain the structures that are \nthere. In my view, it is important that we do so. Unlike in past years, \nwe can be assured that the money we put into this bill will go to the \nhighest priority projects, the dams that are in the most need of repair \nand maintenance. There is no opportunity for Members of Congress, under \nour rules here in the Senate, to earmark these dollars, and so the \nUSDA, the Department of Agriculture, through the Natural Resource and \nConservation Service, will make those decisions.\n  We are not one of the States that has the most dam structures, \nalthough it is an important aspect of maintaining water in its proper \nplace and to provide wildlife habitat and conservation practices and \nimprove the agricultural environment. Those structures are important to \nus, and we see this each and every day.\n  In fact, for most of the time I have been in Congress, we do an \nannual what I call conservation tour. We look at the role of the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the private sector, wildlife and habitat \norganizations, and how they partner and come together to make good \nthings happen to improve our environment. This year we focused on water \nquality and water quantity. Clearly this program of PL-566 structures \nis critical.\n  When I talk about that partnership, it would be important for Members \nof the Senate to know that this program requires a 35-percent local \nmatch. There is local money. The sponsors of these projects, these dams \nacross our country, will have to find local resources in order to make \nthat match.\n  I would ask the Senate to approve the amendment I am offering today. \nAgain, it is something I raised in our subcommittee and raised in our \nfull committee with the hopes we would be able to find a satisfactory \noffset, and from my view, the priority we place on this program is one \nthat is deserving of Senate support.\n  I offer the amendment as I described.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6735]]\n\n          Amendment No. 771, as Modified, to Amendment No. 738\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 771, and ask \nthat it be modified with the changes that are already at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment, as modified.\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment No. 771, as modified, to \n     amendment No. 738.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 771), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide an additional $4,476,000, with an offset, for the \n Office of the United States Trade Representative to investigate trade \n violations committed by other countries and to enforce the trade laws \n  of the United States and international trade agreements, which will \nfund the Office at the level requested in the President's budget and in \nH.R. 2596, as reported by the Committee on Appropriations of the House \n                          of Representatives)\n\n       On page 209, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 542. (a) The matter under the heading ``salaries and \n     expenses'' under the heading ``Office of the United States \n     Trade Representative'' in title IV of this division is \n     amended by striking ``$46,775,000'' and inserting \n     ``$51,251,000''.\n       (b) Of the unobligated balance of amounts made available to \n     the Department of Justice for a fiscal year before fiscal \n     year 2012 for the ``Legal Activities, Assets Forfeiture \n     Fund'' account, there are permanently rescinded $8,000,000, \n     in addition to the amount rescinded pursuant to section \n     529(c)(2).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this is an amendment to increase \nfunding for the U.S. Trade Representative so that the Trade \nRepresentative can conduct trade enforcement activities.\n  The amendment is cosponsored by Senator Stabenow, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to add Senator Coons and Senator Brown from Ohio as cosponsors \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. This amendment would provide an additional $4,476,000 \nto the Trade Representative's Office above the level that is provided \nfor in the bill. That amount is fully offset. It would fund the USTR at \n$51,251,000 this year. That is the same level of funding that the \nPresident has in his budget request, and also the same level of funding \nthat has been arrived at in the House Appropriations Committee in their \nlegislation. Clearly, there is bipartisan support for this level of \nfunding for the Trade Representative's office.\n  Last week, as all of us will remember, we sent to the President three \nnew free-trade agreements. I supported those free-trade agreements \nbecause they promised to open new markets for American businesses so we \ncan sell more goods that are produced here in the United States. \nHowever, if American businesses and workers are to benefit from trade \nagreements, the United States needs to do more to ensure our trading \npartners are competing fairly. This means we have to enforce the trade \nagreements and the U.S. trade laws. Right now, in my view, we are not \nproviding enough resources to the Trade Representative's Office for \nenforcement activities.\n  The USTR's general counsel's office has 30 attorneys. Of that 30, 22 \nare staff attorneys actually involved in day-to-day litigation. These \ntwo dozen or so people are responsible for preparing and prosecuting \ntrade dispute cases at the World Trade Organization or under the \ndispute resolution mechanisms in our free-trade agreements. They are \nalso responsible for defending the United States when other countries \nfile complaints against us. In my view, this is not enough staff to \nrespond in a timely manner to the numerous allegations about unfair \ntrade practices that are being committed by our trading partners.\n  For example, the U.S. Trade Representative's investigation into \nChina's export restraints on rare earth minerals has been underway for \nmore than 2 years. There are many other concerns about China's trade \npractices. In fact, many have been discussed here on the Senate floor \ntoday. Does China provide subsidies to its companies that are \ninconsistent with the World Trade Organization? Is China unfairly \nclosing its markets to U.S. goods or unfairly requiring U.S. companies \nto transfer technology and intellectual property to Chinese companies \nas a condition of doing business in China? These are serious questions \nthat American businesses have raised informally. In fact, the United \nSteel Workers formally raised these issues in a section 301 petition \nlast year. Many of these allegations are not fully investigated because \nwe simply have not committed the resources in the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's Office to do the investigations.\n  Only two attorneys in the U.S. Trade Representative's general \ncounsel's office work on the rare earths and raw materials cases. USTR \nneeds the resources to act quickly to combat unfair trade practices \nbefore U.S. industries are irreparably harmed.\n  The Senate also recently demonstrated bipartisan support for trade \nenforcement when it passed the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform \nAct. That was on October 11. The vote there was 63 to 35. I voted for \nthat bill as well. This amendment I am offering today would help \nprovide the U.S. Trade Representative with additional resources to \nenforce the provisions in that bill as well. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  Let me say a few words about the offset. The amendment would propose \nto rescind $8 million from the Department of Justice asset forfeiture \nfund. This fund contains the funds that DOJ obtains from seizing and \nselling assets, for example, speedboats that are seized from drug \ndealers. The Department of Justice uses some of these funds for law \nenforcement, but most of the funds are not used. The fund had a balance \nof more than $841 million at the end of fiscal year 2009; $974 million \nat the end of 2010; $701 million at the end of fiscal year 2011. The \nDepartment of Justice projects it will collect more than $1.7 billion \nfrom seized assets this year.\n  Because of the excess funds in this fund, this asset forfeiture fund, \nthe President's budget suggested that we rescind 620 million of those \ndollars. The proposal I am making in this as an offset is that we add \nan additional $8 million so that the total amount rescinded from that \nfund would be $628 million rather than $620 million. This would leave \nin the fund $474 million, which I believe is an adequate amount to \nensure that the Department of Justice has the resources it needs for \nits law enforcement activities.\n  I believe this is a very meritorious amendment. I think it improves \nthe very good legislation that has been brought to the Senate floor by \nthe Appropriations Committee, but I hope that this amendment can be \napproved and added to the legislation when the issue is raised for a \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from New \nMexico for his comments regarding the U.S. Trade Representative and the \nwork of the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.\n  We do have to fight unfair and even predatory trade practices. In his \ncogent comments, he spoke about steel. We have been trying to look out \nfor steel in my State for some time against these unfair practices. \nSometimes we win, most of the time we lose ground. The amendment that \nis offered by the Senator from New Mexico would, as he said, increase \nthe funding by $4.5 million for a new total of $51 billion. That is \nidentical to what the House has. The amendment does rescind money from \nthe forfeiture fund which has been used for law enforcement task \nforces, including drugs, human trafficking, and other things. I am \ninclined to support the amendment. I certainly support the \nphilosophical thrust of the amendment. We have some questions about the \noffset. We have to get the concurrence of CBO to make sure it is budget \nneutral, and we are consulting with my ranking member to get her \nthoughts and views on it.\n\n  Again, I wish to say to the Senator from New Mexico that I support \nthe thrust of the amendment, and I need to consult. We are waiting for \na comment from our ranking member who is tied up on other legislative \nmatters and we expect to hear from her shortly. When we do, we will be \nable to talk about how we will dispose of this amendment.\n\n[[Page S6736]]\n\n I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his advocacy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  I wish to speak on another matter, which is an amendment that was \nraised, amendment No. 753, on terrorists and prosecutions, which was \noffered by the Senator from New Hampshire earlier. In order to expedite \nproceedings, I withheld my rebuttal, and now I choose to take this time \nto rebut the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I rise in opposition to her amendment. Although well intentioned, \nthere are serious objections to it. Her amendment would prohibit the \nDepartment of Justice from trying anyone charged with terrorism-related \nconcerns in an article III court in the United States.\n  I oppose the amendment for three reasons. First, the amendment is \nunnecessary. The Department of Justice has a strong track record of \nsuccessfully prosecuting terrorists in criminal courts.\n  Second, it goes beyond the law that already prohibits certain \nterrorist suspects from even coming into the United States, even for \nprosecution. This was language included in the 2011 continuing \nresolution, and our fiscal year 2012 CJS bill does carry that same \nlanguage. For example, we have already dealt with someone such as \nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed. This amendment also would reach beyond that and \nit wouldn't allow prosecutions on any new non-U.S. citizen on \nterrorism-related charges.\n  Third, this amendment is opposed by the Departments of Justice and \nDefense. I don't mean just the Departments. Attorney General Eric \nHolder and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta object to this amendment. \nThey feel they have a working agreement on how best to try terrorists.\n  I say to my colleagues, I hope they would reject the amendment of the \nSenator from New Hampshire when it comes up.\n  The Department of Justice has a strong record of successfully \nconvicting terrorists in their criminal courts. One can look at the \n1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the attack on the U.S. \nEmbassies in East Africa, and the trial and conviction of the Blind \nSheik. Over 400 terrorists have been tried and convicted since 2001. \nJust last week, another success, the so-called underwear bomber, Umar \nFarouk Abdulmutallab, pled guilty in Federal court in Michigan. There \nwere and are major cases resulting in criminal convictions of \nterrorists. So I would suggest the Senator from New Hampshire's concern \nthat the Department of Justice is not equipped to try terrorist \nsuspects does not have traction because the record shows otherwise.\n  I think we have to be careful because this amendment goes beyond \ncurrent law. In 2011, we passed the Defense Authorization Act and then \nthe 2011 continuing resolution, both of which prohibit the \nadministration from bringing Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United \nStates even for prosecution. Congress will have to change restrictions \nin law before Gitmo detainees are transferred to the United States for \nprosecution or detention. Senator Ayotte's amendment would go beyond \nthese restrictions to say that anyone indicted on a terrorism-related \ncharge who isn't a U.S. citizen couldn't be prosecuted in Federal \ncourts, unnecessarily court-stripping.\n  I have no sympathy for terrorists, and I am going to make sure we \nhonor international law but that we prosecute to the fullest extent \npossible. What we want to be able to show is that the Department of \nJustice has successfully prosecuted them, and this amendment would \nprohibit--this amendment would not be about prosecuting terrorists, it \nwould be about choking the Department of Justice.\n  Let me go to my third reason, which is the opposition by Secretary \nLeon Panetta and Attorney General Holder. Defense and Justice share \nresponsibility for prosecuting terrorists. Justice prosecutes in \ncriminal courts and the Defense Department prosecutes in military \ncommissions. Defense and Justice have a joint protocol where they work \ntogether to evaluate terrorist cases to decide where best, where most \neffectively to prosecute them. In light of the restrictions Congress \nhas already made on these trials, the Defense Department decided \nearlier this year to resume new charges in the military commissions. \nBut Congress shouldn't restrict the ability of the executive branch to \ndecide where best to prosecute terrorists--understanding some of the \ndynamics of international law, criminal codes, codes of military \nconduct, to decide where best to prosecute terrorists.\n  We don't want to set a dangerous precedent, if Defense or Justice are \nrestricted from using every tool available to bring the terrorists to \njustice.\n  I hope, when we vote on this amendment, we defeat it, recognizing \nthat the Senator from New Hampshire wants to be sure justice is served, \nand we want it too. The best way to serve justice is to let the Defense \nDepartment and Justice Department decide what court or tribunal is the \nbest way to proceed--to ensure the fairness of a trial but to make sure \nwe have the best, most effective, most efficient way to do it. I must \nsay, when one looks at the record of the Justice Department in \nprosecuting these terrorists in civilian courts, prosecutions were \nachieved, convictions were obtained, and as the world watched it, \njustice was served. I am pretty proud of that.\n  I hope we will defeat the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire \nbut that we be united as a Congress and the Senate in making sure we \nprosecute those who engage in any predatory activity directed to the \nUnited States of America and its citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to stand and second the remarks \nmade by the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, related to the Ayotte \namendment. I think it is important for us to reflect on recent history.\n  It was last week that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab pled guilty in \nFederal court to trying to explode a bomb in his underwear on a flight \nto Detroit, MI, on Christmas Day, 2009. Mr. Abdulmutallab, who will be \nsentenced in January, is expected to serve a life sentence. I wish to \ncommend the fine men and women at the Justice Department and the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation for their extraordinary work on this \ncase. America is safer because the Obama administration chose the right \ninvestigative agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as \nour article III court system, to try Mr. Abdulmutallab.\n  One would never know this from the speeches on the floor and from the \namendment which has been offered by the Senator from New Hampshire \nbecause the suggestion is, it was a big mistake--a mistake for us to \nconsider trying a terrorist in our criminal courts. She suggests, and \nothers have joined her in this suggestion, that all these cases should \nbe tried before military tribunals, military commissions.\n  I wish to put on the Record, in support of what Senator Mikulski said \nearlier, the facts in this case. I can recall when Senator McConnell, \nthe minority leader, came to the floor and spoke in reference to \nAbdulmutallab:\n\n       He was given a 50 minute interrogation, probably Larry King \n     has interrogated people longer and better than that. After \n     which he was assigned a lawyer who told him to shut up.\n\n  That was from Senator McConnell.\n  Unfortunately, as colorful as that depiction of the facts might have \nbeen, it just wasn't accurate. It turns out that experienced \ncounterterrorism agencies from the FBI interrogated Abdulmutallab when \nhe arrived in Detroit. According to the Justice Department, during the \ninitial interrogation, the FBI ``obtained intelligence that proved \nuseful in the fight against al-Qaida.''\n  I say to my colleagues, watch this Ayotte amendment carefully, \nbecause it says that if there is a reference to a terrorist associated \nwith al-Qaida, we can't turn him over to the FBI or to the court \nsystem. He has to go to military tribunals.\n  After this initial interrogation, Abdulmutallab refused to cooperate \nfurther with the FBI. Only then, after he stopped talking, did the FBI \ngive him his Miranda warnings, which are required, of course, under \ncriminal law in the United States. What the FBI did in this case was \nabsolutely nothing new. During the Bush administration, the previous \nRepublican President's administration, the FBI also gave Miranda \nwarnings to terrorists when they were detained in the United States. \nHere is what Attorney General Holder said:\n\n       Across many Administrations, both before and after 9/11, \n     the consistent, well-known, lawful, and publicly-stated \n     policy of the FBI has been to provide Miranda warnings prior \n     to any custodial interrogation conducted inside the United \n     States.\n\n  In fact, the Bush administration adopted new policies for the FBI \nthat say: ``Within the United States, Miranda warnings are required to \nbe given prior to custodial interviews.''\n  Let's take one example from the Bush administration: Richard Reid, \nthe so-called shoe bomber. Reid tried to detonate an explosive in his \nshoe on a flight from Paris to Miami in December of 2001, very similar \nto what Abdulmutallab tried on that flight to Detroit. So how does the \nBush administration's handling of the shoe bomber compare with the \nObama administration's handling of the underwear bomber? The Bush \nadministration detained and charged Richard Reid as a criminal. They \ngave Reid a Miranda warning within 5 minutes of being removed from the \nairplane and they reminded him of his Miranda rights four times within \nthe first 48 hours he was detained.\n  If we listen to the Republican Senators who come to the floor, they \nwould suggest to us that giving Miranda warnings is the end of the \ninterrogation. Once a potential criminal defendant is advised that they \nhave the right to remain silent, the Republican\n\n[[Page S6738]]\n\nSenators who support this amendment would argue: That is it. We just \ngave it away. They are going to lawyer up and shut up, and we won't \nlearn anything.\n  Listen to what happened in the Abdulmutallab case: He was stopped. He \nwas interrogated by the FBI. He spoke to them for awhile. He stopped \ntalking. He was given his Miranda warnings. Let me tell my colleagues \nwhat happened next. He began talking again to FBI interrogators and \nprovided valuable intelligence. There was no torture, coercion or \nwaterboarding involved.\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller described it this way:\n\n       Over a period of time, we have been successful in obtaining \n     intelligence, not just on day one, but on day two, day three, \n     day four, day five, down the road.\n\n  Let me remind my colleagues: Mr. Abdulmutallab is associated with al-\nQaida, the very type of terrorist that would be precluded from an FBI \ninvestigation and an article III court prosecution by the Ayotte \namendment.\n  How did this happen? Do you know how it happened? Instead of using \ncoercive techniques, the Obama administration convinced Abdulmutallab's \nfamily to come to the United States, and his family sat down with him \nand told him: Why don't you cooperate with the FBI? And he did. That is \na very different approach from what we saw in a previous administration \nwhen coercive techniques were used.\n  But real life is not like the TV Show ``24,'' when old Jack Bauer \ntortures somebody and they cannot wait to spill the beans. Here is what \nwe learned during the Bush administration: In real life, when people \nare tortured, they will say anything to make the pain stop. They will \nlie and fabricate and go on and babble as long as necessary to stop the \npain of the torture. They often provide false information instead of \nvaluable intelligence.\n  Richard Clarke was the senior counterterrorism advisor to President \nClinton and President George W. Bush. Here is what he said about the \nObama administration's approach:\n\n       The FBI is good at getting people to talk . . . they have \n     been much more successful than the previous attempts of \n     torturing people and trying to convince them to give \n     information that way.\n\n  So what is the record here? The record is worth recounting. I will \ntell you, I am not sure of the exact number, but I have been told that \nanywhere from 200 to 300 accused terrorists have been successfully \nprosecuted in the article III criminal courts of America. The Ayotte \namendment would stop the President of the United States from using that \noption--an option that has been used repeatedly over the last 10 years \nto stop terrorists in their tracks, prosecute them, incarcerate them, \nand make them pay a heavy punishment for what they tried to do to the \nUnited States.\n  This Ayotte amendment would tie the hands of this President and \nfuture Presidents where they could no longer make a decision about \nwhether a case should be tried in the article III criminal courts or in \na military commission or tribunal.\n  Look at the facts. Since 9/11, more than 200 terrorists have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted, among them, Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of \nthe 1993 World Trade Center bombing; Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called \nBlind Sheikh; the twentieth 9/11 hijacker Zacarias Moussaoui; Richard \nReid, the ``Shoebomber;'' Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber; Terry Nichols, \nthe Oklahoma City coconspirator; and now Abdulmutallab.\n  The Ayotte amendment would stop the President of the United States \nand the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense from picking the \nright place to investigate, to gather information, and to prosecute an \nindividual who is suspected of terrorism in the United States.\n  During that same period of time, how many individuals have been \nsuccessfully tried by the military commissions, which Senator Ayotte \nbelieves should be the exclusive place to try a would-be terrorist? \nThree. So the record is, if you are keeping score, over 200 in the \ncriminal courts; 3 in military commissions. Senator Ayotte says: \nConvincing evidence for me. It is pretty clear to me, everybody should \ngo to a military commission. Really? And of the three who were \nprosecuted in military commissions, two of them spent less than a year \nin prison and are now living freely in their home countries of \nAustralia and Yemen.\n  Let's go to GEN Colin Powell, a known member of a former Republican \nadministration and former Secretary of State and former head of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. You would think this man, with his special life \nexperience and responsibilities to fight terrorism, would be a good \nplace to turn. What does GEN Colin Powell think about the notion behind \nthe Ayotte amendment, that we should not try people in criminal courts, \nonly in military commissions? Well, GEN Colin Powell is quite a \nmilitary man. Here is what he said:\n\n       The suggestion that somehow a military commission is the \n     way to go isn't borne out by the history of the military \n     commissions.\n\n  It is a very honest statement. It should be honest enough and direct \nenough to guide Members of the Senate to defeat the Ayotte amendment. \nWhether it is a Democratic President or a Republican President, they \nshould have every tool at their disposal to keep America safe. They \nshould pick the forum they believe they can most effectively use to \ngather information and prosecute terrorists. Time and time and time \nagain, under Republican President Bush and Democratic President Obama, \nthey have turned to our court system, and they have successfully \nprosecuted terrorists.\n  One point made by Senator Mikulski that I think is worth repeating: \nWhat we are saying to the world is, come to America's court system, the \nsame court system where we prosecute people accused of crimes and \nmisconduct in America, and the would-be terrorists are going to be held \nto the same standards of trial. It will not be a military commission. \nIt will be a court setting which can be followed by the public, not \nonly in the United States but across the world. It says to them that \nour system of justice is fair and open, and whether a person is a \ncitizen of this country or a suspected terrorist, they can be subjected \nto the same standards of justice.\n  I urge my colleagues, do not tie the hands of this President or any \nPresident in protecting America against terrorists. Leave to those \nPresidents the tools they need to effectively protect the United States \nof America.\n  Defeat the Ayotte amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, let me speak to this amendment. I offer \nthis amendment along with my distinguished colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Isakson, to temporarily restore the conforming loan limits that \nexpired--the loan limits we had under the law that created the \nopportunity to loan at these levels--on September 30 of this year. In \npast years, extending these loan limits has usually occurred on the \nTHUD appropriations bills.\n  As the chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, I can tell you that \ngetting our housing market moving again is one of the most important \ntasks facing our country today because if we do not get that weak \nhousing market moving again, we will not get the kind of robust \neconomic recovery that the American people deserve. Historically, \nwhenever we have been in the midst of an economic challenge or a \nrecession, housing has been part of what has led us out of that \nrecession.\n  Congress could be doing a great deal to get the housing market moving \nagain. But perhaps the first rule we should follow is: Do no harm. Do \nno harm. But at this point, Congress, in my view, is doing harm to the \nhousing market and to our economic recovery by allowing the higher loan \nlimits to expire. With this bipartisan amendment, we could easily \ncorrect this problem.\n  The lower loan limits of the Federal Housing Administration, \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises, and Veterans Administration have \nalready resulted in a reduction of consumer credit in 669 counties \nacross 42 States in our country. The expiration is making a weak \nhousing market even weaker. It also makes it harder for middle-class \nhome buyers to get mortgages when credit is already tight. And every \nday that passes is another day in which creditworthy borrowers are not \ngetting loans or are having to pay much higher rates that could price \nthem out of the market, and those loans are not going to come back.\n  I recently chaired a Housing Subcommittee hearing on a different \ntopic, where the witnesses were not chosen for their views on a \nparticular issue. They represented an entire cross section of all of \nthe interested stakeholders in the housing field, including those who \nwere submitted to us by our Republican colleagues to consider as \nwitnesses. And there were several. Eight of the nine bipartisan \nwitnesses who testified in the hearing agreed that the conforming loan \nlimits should be temporarily extended to boost the housing market, and \nthat now is not the right time to let them expire.\n  One of the witnesses, Dr. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's \nAnalytics, urged that the limits be extended for ``at least'' another \nyear. That is a reversal of Dr. Zandi's position from earlier this \nyear, when he had supported the expiration. He said at the hearing that \nthe markets remain too fragile and that allowing the limits to expire \nwould be ``an error.''\n  A recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nfound that ``virtually no''--no--``jumbo mortgages are being \nsecuritized'' today. In other words, in an ideal world, the private \nsector would fill this gap in home mortgages, but the reality is that \neconomic conditions right now are not allowing for that. It certainly \nhas not taken place.\n  And in terms of cost, our amendment will actually save $11 million \nover the next 10 years, and $2 million in fiscal year 2012 according to \nCBO. It is more than fully paid for in a fair way by creating a \n``premium loan fee'' of 15 basis points per year that would apply \nonly--only--to the affected loans. This makes sense because the people \nbenefiting from the loans would be directly responsible for paying the \ncosts of those loans so taxpayers are made whole and no other home \nbuyers would pay. And, as I say, it saves $11 million over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Additionally, the amendment will likely help increase returns to \ntaxpayers because FHA audits for the past decade have stated that the \nlarger loans actually perform better and default at significantly lower \nrates than smaller loans, so allowing the larger loans could actually \nimprove returns to taxpayers.\n  Finally, I thank the cosponsors of a very similar bipartisan bill--\nsimilar to the very essence of what we are trying to do in this \namendment--that Senator Isakson and I have introduced, the \nHomeownership Affordability Act: Senators Akaka, Begich, Blumenthal, \nBoxer, Scott Brown, Cardin, Chambliss, Coons, Feinstein, Inouye, \nLautenberg, Lieberman, Merkley, Mikulski, Bill Nelson, and Schumer. I \nwish to thank the National Association of Realtors, the National \nAssociation of Homebuilders, the Mortgage Bankers Association, and all \nthe other groups that have advocated support for this effort. This is \nan important tool that we can use to boost our housing market and \neconomic recovery at no cost to the taxpayers.\n  I see my distinguished colleague Senator Isakson on the floor, and I \ncertainly would invite him, as a cosponsor of this amendment--someone \nwho has a long history in the private sector, before he came to the \nCongress, on the whole question of real estate--I would be happy to \nyield to him at this time.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nMenendez, for his leadership on this issue.\n  I ask to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me try to dispel what concern there may be and the concern I \nheard right before we adjourned in August as to why not to extend the \nloan limits. People were afraid--and I understand the fear--that it \nmight cause some additional liability in cost to the government and the \ntaxpayers.\n  Let me make something crystal clear: We are going through a terrible \nforeclosure problem right now in this country, not because of loan \nlimits but because of underwriting. Underwriting today, because of the \nramifications of\n\n[[Page S6740]]\n\nthe real estate collapse, is the most pristine underwriting I have ever \nseen.\n  I was in the business for 33 years--since 1966. I have seen a lot of \nhousing recessions go by. I have seen a lot of difficulties. This one \nis the worst I have ever seen, but it was not caused by the amount of \nloans made. It was caused by underwriting.\n  As Senator Menendez has said, this will pay the government back \nbecause of the fee associated with the loan, in the first place. In the \nsecond place, it will answer the big objective we need to start \napplying in this country, and that is doing no more harm. A lot of the \nproblems that have been manifested in the real estate industry have \nbeen manifested by our doing the harm, either in what we imposed on \nFreddie and Fannie or what we did not allow to have happen.\n  The restrictions now on mortgage underwriting under Dodd-Frank and \nthe requirements that are now true in all of our underwriting agencies \nare so strict that the underwriting of loans is so pristine that only \nthe best of the best is being made. The unintended consequence of not \nextending these increases in August caused a number of real estate \ntransactions that were made to never close. Because the limit went \ndown, therefore, the loan went down.\n  No one in this body should confuse the amount of a loan with its \nability to be repaid. They need to understand, it is the underwriting \nof the loan that ensures the repayment.\n  This, as the Senator said, will add an income to the U.S. Government. \nIt will not add additional pressure on the U.S. taxpayers. It will at \nleast give us breathing room in a housing industry that is still \nstruggling terribly.\n  So I would ask any of our Members who were objecting back in August \nto these loan limits being restored, please come see me. I do not know \na lot about many things. I know a whole lot about this because I made \nmy living in this all of my life. I have no interest anymore, so there \nis no self-interest, except to know we are in deep trouble in our \neconomy.\n  You are never going to get 9 percent unemployment down until you \nbring construction back. You are never going to get the American \nconsumer to have more confidence until they feel as though the value of \ntheir homes is secured. Those things are not going to happen if a \nreluctant Congress continues to pass suppressing legislation or keep \nthese loan limits down rather than doing things that will do no harm \nand help the housing market.\n  So I lend my full support to Senator Menendez and what he has done. I \nask for favorable consideration by our colleagues in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to compliment the Senator \nfrom New Jersey for this amendment. I think it is common sense. I think \nit accomplishes so many objectives. No. 1, it helps people with real \nproblems be able to get back on their feet, maintain home ownership, \nand get our economy going and put people to work.\n  I know the Senator from New Jersey and others here support an \ninfrastructure bank. Yes, we want to build roads and bridges. I would \nlike to take broadband to every part of America. But we also need to \nlook at home building, and Maryland's has come to a screeching halt, \neven in a robust State such as Maryland. Everybody I talk to in the \nMaryland business community says: Unless you crack the housing \nsituation, you cannot crack the economic situation.\n  By having access to the American dream, which has now become an \nAmerican nightmare, this American dream created jobs, whether it was \npeople who built them, the real estate developers who developed them, \nor the people like Senator Isakson who made a career of selling them. \nThis was about building a home, and in many instances it was about \nbuilding community.\n  I think that where we are, if we agree to the Menendez amendment, \nthat will go a long way in being able to help people. We have to really \ndeal with this. Quite frankly, I have been disappointed. Just about \nevery darn thing we have done to ``help with the housing mortgage \nsituation'' has been a bust. It has been an absolute bust. We spent \nmillions and so on. We had this program. We had catchy little titles. \nBut nothing catches on to solve the mortgage crisis.\n  I believe the Menendez amendment, supported by someone who really \nunderstands business and housing and community--I think this amendment \nis a winner. I am happy to put my name on it. I will look forward to \nvoting for it when the time comes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, just very briefly, I thank my colleague \nfrom Maryland and the bill manager. I hope we will get to a point where \nwe can cast a vote on this. I appreciate Senator Isakson joining me and \nothers in this effort, and particularly his expertise. If we listen to \nvoices of reason as well as experience here, then Senator Isakson's \narguments should be a winner. I look forward to hopefully having a \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have a motion to recommit with instructions \nwith respect to H.R. 2112.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee] moves to recommit the bill \n     H.R. 2112 to the Committee on Appropriations with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate with \n     reductions in spending in each division required to bring the \n     overall spending for the division to fiscal year 2011 levels \n     which shall not exceed $130,559,669,000 for division A (Ag), \n     $58,786,478,000 for division B (CJS), and $55,368,096,000 for \n     division C (THUD).\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand to speak on behalf of this motion to \nrecommit. What we are looking at here with H.R. 2112 is a measure that \nactually spends more in each of those areas than what we spent in \nfiscal year 2011. We are in dire economic circumstances in this \ncountry. We are currently spending at a rate of roughly $1.5 trillion \nannually in excess of what we are bringing in.\n  We have gone to great lengths through a number of accounting \nmechanisms to demonstrate to the American people that we are doing our \nbest to spend less. In many circumstances, the message that has been \nsent has been a message of austerity. It becomes increasingly difficult \nto manage and to maintain that necessary message of austerity, one that \nis accompanied by hundreds of millions of Americans making sacrifices \nevery day in response to this economic downturn.\n  It becomes absolutely essential that we actually make cuts. To make \nactual cuts, I think that means necessarily that we have to spend less \nin fiscal year 2012 than we spent in fiscal year 2011. We will \ncontinue, I fear, to lack credibility if we persist in using whatever \ntechniques we use, accounting-wise or otherwise, to claim we are \nreducing spending when, in fact, this appropriations package--this \nminibus spending package, as we sometimes refer to it--actually spends \nmore money than was spent in 2011.\n  This is why I have submitted this motion. I hope my colleagues will \nshare this concern I have expressed, which has caused me to submit this \nmotion. The idea of the motion is that we bring our spending levels \nback down in each of these areas to what we spent in fiscal year 2011.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nrecommit is set aside.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We have set aside the motion to recommit offered by the \nSenator from Utah; however, I wish to rise in opposition to his motion. \nThis is all about budget-speak. It is really hard to follow between \nbudget authority and expenditures, et cetera. But let me just say this \nin plain English.\n  This bill is $500 million less than we spent in 2011--$500 million \nless than we spent in 2011. Now, this is not the chairperson of the CJS \nbill kind of making up numbers. This is confirmed by the Congressional \nBudget Office. It has been certified by the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. The CJS bill is nearly $500 million less than last year.\n  Now, am I doing fuzzy math? No. I do not do fuzzy math. The CJS bill \nis consistent with something called the\n\n[[Page S6741]]\n\nBudget Control Act. The Budget Control Act requires appropriations to \ncut $7 billion for our fiscal year 2012. When we got our allocation, \nthe CJS subcommittee allocation was $500 million below 2011. I am going \nto say it again--$500 million below what we spent in 2011.\n  This allocation required the CJS subcommittee to take stern and even \ndrastic measures. I eliminated 30 programs. Yes, Senator Barbara \nMikulski, a Democratic, a liberal, I cut and eliminated 30 programs: 4 \nin Commerce--I think you objected to 1; 20 in Justice; 1 in Space; 4 in \nthe National Science Foundation. I could not believe it, but that is \nwhat we had to do.\n  We cut the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Lab by $1 \nbillion. That was a $1 billion project the National Science Foundation \nwanted. We said we would like it too but not in these austere times. \nThere were other programs that we were able to do. And we were not \nhappy about it. We absolutely were not happy about it. We cut the \nBaldridge Program. We cut the public telecommunications facility \nplanning and communications. I mean, we did what we had to do.\n  So while the Senator looks at I am not sure what, I can tell you we \nare $500 million below 2011. The Congressional Budget Office says it. \nThe numbers were reviewed by the Budget Committee itself. The chairman \nsigned off that we were $500 million below, to help the overall \nAppropriations Committee reduce its expenditures by $7 billion.\n  So that is for 2011. Now let's look at 2012. I mean, the President \ncame to Congress and gave a dynamic State of the Union speech. It \ntouched America deeply when he said: I want to outbuild, outeducate, \noutinnovate anyone in the world. And he proposed his budget.\n  When you look at what we are doing here, my appropriations, my \nCommerce-Justice appropriations, is $5 billion--that is ``b'' as in \n``Barb''--not $5 million, like ``m'' in ``Mikulski.'' We are $5 billion \nbelow what the President said he needed in Commerce-Justice-Science, \ntechnology, the innovation subcommittee, to help outeducate and out-\ninnovate anybody else in the world. So I am $5 billion less than what \nthe President of the United States said he needed to have to accomplish \nnational goals.\n  Now, we talk a lot about that we want America to be exceptional. \nWell, you have to spend money to be exceptional, and when you put your \nmoney in science, technology, and education, we can come up with new \nideas, new products that we can make and sell around the world, and our \nchildren know they have a future in this new global economy.\n  I do not want to be nickel-and-dimed here. I have already been \nnickel-and-dimed to be able to comply with this bill. You know, I am \nback to where Obama was in January, that cold day, and now here we are. \nSo when we talk about cutting, we have cut. We have absolutely cut. We \ncut discretionary spending at an incredible level. And do you think it \nis has helped create one job? Do you think the market is going \n``hoorah, hoorah, look at what they are doing''? No. Do you know why? \nBecause the private sector knows that if we are going to be a 21st-\ncentury nation, if we are going to be America the exceptional, we must \neducate.\n  We also must invest in scientific research so that the private sector \ncan take that basic research we do, value add to it, and with the \ngenius that is America, the ability--that intellectual property you can \nown and be protected, that you are going to develop a product, and you \nhave the National Institute of Standards to come and help you develop \nthe standards so that you will be able to sell it in America in every \nState and sell it around the world in every nation.\n  So come on. If we want to be America the exceptional, stop nickel-\nand-diming. One of the ways you deal with debt is a growing economy, \nrestoring consumer confidence, restoring citizen confidence, No. 1, \nthat we can govern ourselves and that we can govern ourselves in a \nsmart fashion. Yes, we do need to be frugal, but we sure do not need to \nbe stupid.\n  I am going to oppose this amendment, and I sure hope the people pass \nmy bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 815\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I see that I have other colleagues on the floor. I will \nonly be a couple of minutes.\n  Today I rise to oppose an amendment offered by Senator Moran, \namendment No. 815. I really do appreciate the intent of Senator Moran's \namendment. I actually support the intent of what he is trying to do \nbecause he is trying to support the Watershed Rehabilitation Program.\n  While I am not opposed to that program, and I recognize that \ndifficult decisions had to be made in order to meet our statutory \nspending caps outlined in the Budget Control Act, I regret to say I \ncannot support the Senator's amendment as it is written because its \noffset comes from departmental administration which provides numerous \nessential services to the USDA.\n  These cuts would force USDA to reduce their number of employees, \nwhich would have a detrimental effect on the Department and its \noperation. In fact, Secretary Vilsack reached out to the Agriculture \nAppropriations subcommittee staff to relay his serious concerns.\n  These USDA employees provide essential services to some of the most \nrural areas in the country, so I cannot support the amendment that \nwould, in effect, reduce services to rural America.\n  On top of that, it is important for my colleagues to understand that \nthe level for departmental administration is already over $13 million \nbelow the fiscal year 2010 level and $7 million below the President's \nrequest.\n  Although I definitely support the watershed rehabilitation program, I \ncertainly hope Senator Kohl and Senator Moran can find a good offset \nthat is agreeable to the majority of us. Still, I must oppose this \namendment and urge other Senators to oppose it as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I see my colleague from Colorado. I was going to call \nup an amendment and make some remarks. Is there a procedural matter or \nsomething the Senator would be interested in doing before that? If not, \nI will go forward. I thought maybe the Senator wanted to comment on \nSenator Pryor's comments.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I have another set of comments I want to make \non a pending amendment. I don't know where we are in the order here.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator wish to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I will rise in opposition to an amendment \nalready offered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Then I guess I have the floor, Mr. President.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am seeking clarification.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator for that purpose.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator wish to comment on the Moran \namendment?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Amendment No. 753 offered by the junior \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We are alternating back and forth, so we will go to \nSenator Sessions and then Senator Udall.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Thank you. I look forward to hearing from the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Then we will go to the Senator from Colorado for his \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Colorado be recognized after I complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 810 to Amendment No. 738\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous consent \nagreement, I call up Sessions amendment No. 810.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 810 to amendment No. 738.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6742]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to allow categorical eligibility \n           for the supplemental nutrition assistance program)\n\n       At the end of title VII of division A, add the following:\n       Sec. _.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act shall be used to pay the salaries and \n     expenses of personnel to carry out the supplemental nutrition \n     assistance program established under the Food and Nutrition \n     Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) in any manner that \n     permits a household or individual to qualify for benefits \n     under that program without qualifying under the specific \n     eligibility standards (including income and assets \n     requirements) of the program, regardless of the participation \n     of the household or individual in any other Federal or State \n     program.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the purpose of amendment No. 810 is to \neliminate the categorical eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program, called SNAP, or the Food Stamp Program. A \ncategorical eligibility standard has been imposed, and it has been \ncausing a substantial increase in unjustified expenditures in the Food \nStamp Program.\n  Let me share briefly the history over the last decade of the Food \nStamp Program. Of course, we in America strongly believe that persons \nought not to go to bed hungry, if we have the food and the ability to \ntake care of them. We have had a very generous Food Stamp Program for a \nnumber of years. But in the last decade, it has shown incredible, \namazing increases in spending. As a matter of fact, I think it has \nincreased faster than probably any other significant item in the entire \nFederal budget. It is probably increasing more even than the interest \non the debt, which is one of the most surging expenditures this Nation \nhas.\n  In 2001, we expended $20 billion on the Food Stamp Program. This \nyear, we are projected, under this bill, to spend $80 billion. In 10 \nyears, spending on food stamps would have quadrupled. This year's \nproposal calls for an increase of 14 percent over last year. This is a \nstunning amount of money.\n  This country is headed to financial crisis. Erskine Bowles and Alan \nSimpson, who headed President Obama's debt task force, told us in the \nBudget Committee that the country has never faced a more serious \nfinancial crisis than the debt crisis we are now in. One of the reasons \nis that we have had these incredible surges of expenditures in programs \nover a period of years. We have not watched them or contained them and, \nindeed, we have done things to make them less accountable and efficient \nand more subject to fraud, abuse, and waste.\n  Again, this year proposes another 14-percent increase in the Food \nStamp Program. That is $80 billion. The House proposed only a $1 \nbillion increase; theirs comes in at roughly $71 billion for food \nstamps. So theirs is more level. But it still has an increase. \nCertainly, it is far less than this.\n  To give some perspective on what we are talking about when we say $80 \nbillion, let me share a few facts. The Federal prison system costs $7 \nbillion. The Department of Justice--the entire Department of Justice, \nwhich Senator Whitehouse and I served in--and were proud to do so--gets \n$31 billion. Federal highway funding for the entire year is $40 \nbillion. Food stamps is twice that of the Federal highway bill. Customs \nand Border Patrol get $12 billion. The Federal Education Department is \n$30 billion. $80 billion dwarfs the budgets of, I think, most any State \nin the country, except for maybe New York or California. Alabama's \ngeneral fund budget and education budget is less than $10 billion. This \nis $80 billion and is increased $9 billion this year under this bill.\n  We have to get real. We don't have the money. We are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend. No wonder Congress is in such \ndisrepute. How can we defend ourselves against the charge of \nirresponsibility to good and decent American citizens when we are \nspending at this rate and continuing to show increased spending at this \nrate? I am still amazed at the budget the President submitted to us \nearlier this year, calling for a 10-percent increase in the Education \nDepartment, 10 percent for the Energy Department, and 10 percent for \nthe State Department, at a time we are borrowing money at a rate we \nnever borrowed before, when we have never, ever systemically faced such \na substantial threat to our country's financial welfare--as every \nexpert has so told.\n  I know we want to help poor people. I don't want to see people \nhungry. But do we need to be spending four times as much on food stamps \nas we were in 2001? Can we not look at this program and think we can \nmake it better and more efficient? We need to get focused on what we \nare doing here and try to bring this matter under control. We can do \nbetter.\n  Federal regulations allow States to make households ``categorically \neligible'' under the Food Stamp Program. By the way, States administer \nthe program. They don't get money to enforce it and supervise it. They \npay that out of their own budgets. But the food stamps benefit is a \n100-percent Federally funded program. So there is a little bit of a \nconflict of interest. States are benefitting when more food stamps come \ninto their State, right? They are receiving more Federal dollars. They \nare not paying any money into it. Why spend their money to catch fraud, \nwaste, and abuse and crack down on problems? Why not utilize every \npossible action that would bring more food stamps to the State? That is \nwhat is happening.\n  I know a little bit about that because, unless the Presiding Officer \nis one, I am probably the only person in this body who actually \nprosecuted food stamp fraud. They were using it as currency in drug \ndealing. A lot of fraud is going on, and we need to do better about it. \nThe States aren't stepping up because they don't have an incentive to \ndo so.\n  Again, Federal regulations now allow States to make households \n``categorically eligible'' for SNAP--the Food Stamp Program--simply \nbecause the household also receives certain other benefits or \nassistance from Federal programs. ``Categorical eligibility'' is a \nfancy way of saying ``automatically qualified.'' For example, if you \nqualify for one, you qualify for the other. Households that receive \nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, or Supplemental Social \nSecurity income benefits or assistance are automatically eligible for \nSNAP benefits in some states.\n  These other programs, however, have looser eligibility standards than \nthe Food Stamp Program. To be eligible for SNAP benefits, a household \nmust meet specific income and asset tests. Households with income above \na certain threshold, or savings above a certain amount, cannot qualify \nfor food stamps. If you have a substantial savings, even if you don't \nhave any income, you are not entitled for somebody else to pay for your \nfood. I don't know what the number is, but if you have a savings \namount, and if you are above that, you don't get food stamps. Is that \nirrational?\n  But in 42 States there is no limit on the amount of assets certain \nhouseholds may have to qualify for TANF. As a result, households with \nsubstantial assets but low income would be deemed eligible for SNAP \nbenefits even if they have substantial assets.\n  Astonishingly, households can be categorically eligible for SNAP even \nif they receive no TANF-funded service other than a toll-free telephone \nnumber or informational brochure. I kid you not. Receiving the \ninformation about TANF or other applicable information can qualify a \nhousehold to be categorically eligible for SNAP benefits.\n  A 2010 GAO report revealed that one State included information about \na pregnancy prevention hotline on the SNAP application, and that was \nused as a basis to grant categorical eligibility. Other States reported \nproviding household brochures with information about marriage classes \nin order to confer categorical eligibility for food stamps.\n  According to officials with the Food and Nutrition Service, increased \nuse of ``categorical eligibility'' by States has increased approval of \nSNAP benefits to households that would not otherwise be eligible for \nthe program due to SNAP income or asset limits. The Food and Nutrition \nService, which supervises this, acknowledged that more people are \neligible if you use this ``categorical eligibility'' rather than \nrequiring them to comply with explicit requirements of the Food Stamp \nProgram.\n  So my amendment would eliminate categorical eligibility for SNAP \nbenefits, meaning that only those who meet the income and asset \nrequirements\n\n[[Page S6743]]\n\nunder the program would be eligible for benefits. They would have to \napply just like anyone else.\n  Is it too much to ask someone who is going to receive thousands of \ndollars in food benefits from the Federal Government to fill out a form \nand to honestly state whether they are in need, to the degree they \nqualify for the program? Automatic eligibility through other income \nsupport programs would end under my amendment.\n  Last Friday, the Treasury Department closed the books on fiscal year \n2011 and declared the Federal Government ended the year with $1.23 \ntrillion in additional debt. That makes our gross debt now $15 \ntrillion. Our appropriations for the SNAP program have gone from $20 \nbillion in 2001 to $71 billion in 2011 and are projected now to go to \n$80 billion. From 2001 through 2011, there is a huge increase in \nfunding for the program.\n  The percentage of people using food stamps has increased sevenfold \nsince the program's national expansion in the 1970s, with nearly one in \nseven Americans now receiving the benefit. Meanwhile, food stamp funds \nhave been mishandled and misused, and there are many examples of this. \nI have seen it in my personal practice as a Federal prosecutor. One \nrecent notorious case was a defendant in Operation Fast and Furious. \nOne of the people who came in, bought a whole host of illegal weapons \nin Arizona to take back across into Mexico, was a food stamp recipient. \nAccording to the report, he spent thousands of dollars on these guns, \nmaybe tens of thousands of dollars on these expensive weapons. He \nbought 300 high-powered assault rifles. He had money for that. Yet we \nare buying his food for him.\n  In another case, a Michigan man was able to continue receiving foods \nstamps after winning $2 million in the lottery--$2 million. He even \nasked about it. He said: Can I continue to receive food stamps? Guess \nwhat they told him. Yes. The lottery winnings are an asset, and we are \nnot checking assets now. It is not income, it is an asset. So he got to \nkeep having food stamps while American working people were paying for \nit.\n  Categorical eligibility--that flawed practice--allows SNAP recipients \nto avoid the asset test required to determine need. This is a policy we \ncannot afford at a time this country is having a huge debt crisis.\n  President Obama has coined a somewhat disingenuous term called the \nBuffet rule in his push to raise taxes on millions of Americans who \nhave zero in common with Mr. Buffet. Of course, he is one of the \nPresident's big allies. I would like to suggest something called the \nSolyndra rule. Under this rule, before any proposals are offered to \nraise any taxes, we first put an end to the wasteful, inappropriate \nspending in Washington.\n  Shouldn't we first clean up our act before we demand the American \npeople send more money up here? Until we do that, raising tax rates \nwill only be funding the continued abuse of the American taxpayer. \nRaising taxes to bail out Congress is akin to giving money to an \nalcoholic on the way to the liquor store. It doesn't help matters if \nthe money comes from a wealthy person, if the money is going to be used \nfor an unwise or unhealthy result. It is time for the President and \nthis Senate to get their spending habits under control. These bills \nbefore us, I am afraid--and the ones we will be seeing in the future--\ndon't reduce spending but increase spending, and I thank the Chair for \nthe opportunity to express my concerns about it.\n  Finally, I would just say we are told: We can't do anything about it. \nWe are told we can't fix the food stamps. Food stamps don't count like \nother appropriations. One might say: Why is that? They say it is an \nentitlement. What is an entitlement? An entitlement is when there is a \nlaw that says if a person's income is a certain level, they go in to \nthe government and they have to give them money whether the government \nhas any money or not; whether it has been appropriated or not. It is an \nentitlement program.\n  This makes it very hard for those of us in Congress to be able to \nmake the kind of proposals that are appropriate to fix this program, \none of which simply would be, in my opinion, to reduce spending back to \nthe level of the House, which is showing a modest increase this year, \nafter surging the spending level for the SNAP program over the last \ndecade. All of us have to grasp something. I don't think the American \npeople are happy hearing excuses. I don't think they are happy hearing \nus say: We would like to have done something about food stamps, but \nthis is not germane. This somehow, technically, is an entitlement \nprogram, it is part of a legislative act and, therefore, we can't do \nanything about it on an appropriations bill, which we are here to \ndebate. We can't change it. There have been some changes in the food \nstamp program, so we believe this amendment is clearly germane.\n  But I wish to say, as we wrestle with how to bring spending in \nAmerica under control--as the person who is now the ranking Republican \non the Budget Committee--I wish to say we have to quit using excuses. \nEvery program has to be rigorously analyzed, and if there is waste, \nfraud, and abuse, we need to crack down on it. We don't have the money. \nWe don't have the money. We can't do what we would like to do. We can't \nincrease spending on program after program. This one is perhaps one of \nthe most dramatic examples in the government, and it can be improved \nupon if we focus on it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nColorado has the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I welcome this spirited debate \nwe have been having in the Senate on these important appropriations \nbills. Before I begin my remarks, I wish to yield to the chair of the \nAgriculture Committee who has some comments to make in response to the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and, if I might, \ntake a moment to respond.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We have an order that has been established. I can \nunderstand the Senator from Michigan wanting to rebut. How long does \nthe Senator from Michigan wish to talk?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Just 2 minutes to respond to the previous Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate the courtesy very much. I wanted to take a \nbrief moment to indicate to my friend from Alabama I couldn't agree \nmore that we need to make sure the food assistance programs--every farm \nprogram and every program in the Federal Government--have rigorous \nreview and that we are holding taxpayer dollars accountable. We have \nheld accountability hearings in the Senate, in the Agriculture \nCommittee. The good news is, there is only a 4-percent error rate in \nthe entire SNAP program through the supplemental nutrition program \nbeing talked about, but there is more we can do.\n  The case of the lottery winner in Michigan the Senator talked about \nwas outrageous, and it has been fixed. They can't do that anymore. We \nare going to fix it in the next farm bill as well. I could not agree \nmore. We are going to go through and fix those things that don't make \nsense.\n  But I would also say that what the Senator is suggesting is, first of \nall, policy that needs to be done in the context of the farm bill \nnegotiations. We have an extraordinary agreement we have reached \nbetween myself and our ranking member in the Senate and the chair and \nranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, and we are putting \ntogether language to give to the supercommittee that will address \nnutrition as well as other areas. I would ask my colleagues to support \nour effort that we will be putting forward. We will have that language \nby November 1 that will address those egregious areas which, by the \nway, are very small, but we do need to address them and we need to do \nit in a way that also recognizes more people than ever before need food \nhelp.\n  I have people in Michigan who have never needed help in their entire \nlife. They have paid taxes all their lives, and they are mortified they \ncan't keep food on the table for their children throughout the month. \nSo they are getting temporary help, and that is what\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nis it is designed for--people who need temporary help. Because of that, \nwe want every single dollar to go where it ought to go, and we are \ngoing to do everything possible to see that happens. We are going to be \nputting forward policies that I am sure the Senate will support that \nwill guarantee there is not $1 that is going to somebody who doesn't \ndeserve it or to someone who is cheating or where there is fraud or \nabuse. We are going to make sure that happens. But this debate needs to \nbe done in the context, as it always has been, of our farm bill policy \non food and nutrition.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment and to work with us as \nwe put forward policies that will be coming very soon. I thank the \nSenator from Colorado for his graciousness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I appreciate the patience of \nthe Senator from Maryland. This is a spirited debate about an important \nset of amendments being offered, and I wish to rise in opposition to \namendment No. 753, which has been offered by the Senator from New \nHampshire, Ms. Ayotte.\n  While I enjoy working with Senator Ayotte on the Armed Services \nCommittee, and I appreciate her contributions to the committee, I have \nto say I strongly disagree with her amendment. Senator Ayotte's \namendment would prohibit the United States from trying enemy combatants \nin article III civilian courts. These courts refer to article III of \nour U.S. Constitution.\n  Our article III courts, as the Presiding Officer knows, are the envy \nof the world. While there is a role for military tribunals, they are \ncertainly not the only solution. Frankly, by prohibiting the use of \narticle III courts, we may actually hinder our efforts to bring \nterrorists to justice.\n  The Ayotte amendment would put the military smack in the middle of \nour domestic law enforcement efforts in our fight against extremists \nand terrorists. My friend from New Hampshire argues this is a war that \nshould be prosecuted by our military. But the reality is, in many \ncases, the best course of action is for our domestic law enforcement, \nthe FBI, and others, to take the lead. This amendment would prevent the \nDepartment of Justice from questioning or prosecuting terrorists caught \non U.S. soil engaged in the criminal act of terrorism, and it would \nprevent Federal prosecutors from bringing these terrorists to justice \nin so-called article III courts. Federal prosecutors have tried, \nconvicted, and imprisoned hundreds of terrorists in article III courts. \nThe Department of Defense has obtained only six convictions in military \ntribunals.\n  DOD's job is to track down, kill or capture those who would harm \nAmerica or our citizens. They do an incredible job of that. We all \nstand in awe of the work they do to keep us safe. But it is not the job \nof the Department of Defense to try each and every one of those \nindividuals. It is a mission they do not want, and they would have to \nradically change their entire system to accommodate prisoners who are \nalready handled by civilian courts.\n  Article III courts have kept Americans safe for over 200 years. I \nhave to say I don't believe it is prudent to build a new judicial \nsystem from scratch in order to meet objectives that are already being \nmet. For example, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, also known as the \nUnderwear Bomber, was arrested in Detroit after trying to set off an \nexplosive on an airplane. He was read his rights, questioned, \nprosecuted, and he recently pled guilty. Under this amendment, the FBI \nwould have had to call in the military to detain Abdulmutallab without \nany resolution in his case. In fact--and I think this is an extremely \nimportant point--under this amendment, Abdulmutallab would have been \ngiven complete immunity from criminal Federal prosecution.\n  Further, if this amendment passes, our allies may well refuse to \nextradite terror suspects to the United States. If military commissions \nare determined as someday not having jurisdiction over these terrorists \nor invalidated by the Supreme Court--which, by the way, has happened in \nother settings in the Supreme Court--there would be no way ever to \nprosecute these high-value foreign terrorism suspects because of this \namendment. What would that mean? It would mean no conviction of the \nBlind Sheik, who planned the first World Trade Center attack; no \nconviction of Moussaoui, the 20th hijacker on 9/11, and no conviction \nof the east Africa Embassy bombers, all of whom were convicted in \narticle III courts.\n  Again, the Ayotte amendment, however well intended, would provide 100 \npercent immunity from Federal prosecution to suspected terrorists and \neviscerate a very effective tool in our counterterrorism portfolio. \nThat doesn't strike me as being as tough as we possibly could be on \nterrorists.\n  The fact is, the prosecutors at the Department of Justice have \nnumerous Federal criminal laws at their disposal with which to charge \nsuspected terrorists. The Federal courts have more than 200 years of \nprecedent to guide them, while tribunals have almost none. As I have \nsaid, our Federal prosecutors have had great success so far.\n  In summary, I urge my colleagues to vote against amendment 753. It is \nsimply not necessary, and I believe it will do more harm than good, \nwhile subverting the finest justice system in the world in the process.\n  As I yield, let me be clear that I wholeheartedly support the \nunderlying bill, as it has been very ably authored by Senator Mikulski \nand others, but I have to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise in response to the comments by my \nesteemed colleague from Colorado about my amendment No. 753. And I \nwould say this first. My amendment does not provide immunity to \nterrorists. What my amendment does is treat terrorists as they should \nbe treated.\n  We are at war, and under the laws of war, traditionally we have tried \nenemy combatants in military commissions. And those individuals my \ncolleague from Colorado cited, including Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, \ncould be held accountable in a military commission because our priority \nhas to be, when we are at war, to gather intelligence, to protect our \ncountry, and not whether we should prosecute in our article III courts, \nin which I have great confidence. I served as attorney general of our \nState and believe very much in our article III court system. But our \narticle III court system is not where terrorists with whom we are at \nwar should be tried.\n  In light of the recent comments here on the floor, I feel compelled \nto point out some of the facts that I think are important for the \nAmerican people to know about some of the cases that have been cited in \nsupport of saying terrorists should be tried in article III courts.\n  On October 12, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty in the U.S. \ndistrict court in Detroit. That case has been cited not only by the \nSenator from Colorado but by the Senator from Maryland and the Senator \nfrom Illinois, and our Attorney General has cited it as well as the \nultimate and final vindication of the use of our civilian courts for \nthe trial of enemy combatants. The senior Senator from Illinois and the \nObama administration were so confident that the so-called Underwear \nBomber, as he has been named, guilty plea would settle the dispute once \nand for all, that on October 13, the Senator from Illinois came to the \nfloor and essentially declared the controversy over. We have heard \nthose same arguments today.\n  I think we need to review who exactly Abdulmutallab is. He is no \ncommon criminal. We are not talking about people who have robbed liquor \nstores or who are Americans who have committed criminal acts in this \ncountry. He is the Nigerian man who tried to detonate plastic \nexplosives hidden in his underwear while onboard Northwest Airline's \nflight 253 to Detroit on December 25, 2009. Al-Qaida in the Arabian \nPeninsula claimed to have organized the attack with the Underwear \nBomber claiming that AQAP supplied him with the bomb and trained him.\n  He was subsequently charged in Federal court with eight counts, \nincluding the attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and \nattempted murder of 290 Americans. The Underwear Bomber pleaded guilty \nat trial, telling a surprised courtroom on the second day of his trial \nthat the failed attack was in retaliation for the killing of Muslims \nworldwide.\n  This case has been cited as the final vindication for civilian \ntrials, and I\n\n[[Page S6745]]\n\nthink it is important to mention three points about this case.\n  First of all, the presumption seems to be that the civilian court \nsystem should have the primary responsibility for questioning, trying, \nand ultimately detaining foreign enemy combatants with whom the United \nStates is in a declared war. That has not been the rule in prior \nconflicts. We are treating this conflict differently than we have \ntreated other conflicts, where enemy combatants have been tried in \nmilitary commissions.\n  Secondly, in my view, the administration's eagerness to appease the \nACLU by trying enemy combatants in civilian courts misses the whole \npoint about detention in a time of war. When we are at war, we detain \nand interrogate enemy combatants according to the laws of war to glean \nvaluable intelligence that will help prevent future attacks, save \nAmerican lives, and help us capture other enemy combatants.\n  Al-Qaida was at war with the United States long before our country \nrecognized or strongly reacted to this threat. We remain at war with \nal-Qaida. When we put enemy combatants in our civilian court system, we \nare focusing on prosecution, and we potentially miss important \nopportunities to gather information to prevent future attacks by doing \nso.\n  In Abdulmutallab's case, the administration read him his Miranda \nrights after 50 minutes of questioning. In my view, this jeopardized \nvaluable intelligence. And I know my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have said: Well, eventually he spoke, and he gave us lots of \ninformation. But why would we put information in jeopardy? Why would we \nread terrorists Miranda rights? I, as a prosecutor, have never heard a \nlaw enforcement official tell me that Miranda rights are a helpful \ninformation-gathering tool, but that seems to be the position I am \nhearing today.\n  Jeopardizing this intelligence was clearly unnecessary. And in this \ncase, the fact that we didn't have to rely on a confession--this was a \ncase where we caught the Underwear Bomber redhanded. So even if we were \nto have tried him in a military commission and had not given him \nMiranda rights, had gathered intelligence for as long as we could have, \nwe still would have had him redhanded because the passengers on that \nflight saw him. He was caught with the explosives on his body. This was \nnever a case about a guilty plea and whether we got some information \nabout him. The essential question is whether we got the most \ninformation possible from a terrorist who was trying to attack \nAmericans and our allies, to prevent future attacks, not whether we \ngave him Miranda rights.\n  With a case that was as open and shut as Abdulmutallab's, without any \nneed to use confessional evidence or classified information, it doesn't \nprove the civilian court system is superior to military commissions. \nHis conviction was never realistically in doubt.\n  Defenders of bringing our enemy combatants to the U.S. civilian trial \noften cite a number of cases and convictions related to military \ncommissions. Again, I want to reiterate, I am a strong believer in our \ncivilian court system, but I want to point out some of the downsides to \nusing our civilian court system for enemy combatants: the costs of \nsecurity; the cause of civic disruption in the area; the risk of \ncompromising classified information; and the risk of eventual release \nof these combatants not to some other country but into American \nsociety, regardless of whether they are convicted in civilian court. \nAnd these concerns aren't academic.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues cite the case of Zacarias \nMoussaoui, who was a member of al-Qaida who was involved in the 9/11 \nattacks. The civilian proceedings spanned nearly a decade, and his case \nwas finally resolved only last year. These proceedings cost millions of \ndollars and caused substantial civic disruption. For example, the \nFederal courthouse in Alexandria, VA, was described as ``an armed camp, \nwith the courthouse complex and surrounding neighborhood becoming a \nvirtual encampment, with heavily armed guards, rooftop snipers, bomb-\nsniffing dogs, blocked streets and identification checks.'' If we had \ntried him at Guantanamo Bay, in the military commission there, these \nsecurity concerns would have been accounted for, and we wouldn't have \nhad to disrupt Virginia to do that. It is not a problem we would \nconfront in our military commission system.\n  In addition, in the civilian trial of 9/11 terrorist Zacarias \nMoussaoui, sensitive material was inadvertently leaked because our \ncivilian court system, as wonderful as it is, is not set up as well to \ndeal with cases involving sensitive information during a time of war.\n  Moussaoui also mocked 9/11 victims and used the civilian trial as a \nplatform to spew terrorist propaganda.\n  All of these negative side effects of trying a terrorist in a \ncivilian court would have been eliminated or significantly mitigated if \nhe had been detained in military custody and tried before a military \ncommission.\n  In the case of Omar Abdel Rahman, commonly known as the Blind Sheik, \nwhich has also been cited here today, the civilian trial provided \nintelligence to Osama bin Laden. So when I hear that case cited as a \nsuccess, the first thing that comes to my mind is, if intelligence was \nprovided to Osama bin Laden, how is that a success when our No. 1 focus \nshould be on protecting the American people? And that has to be the \ndistinction between trying enemy combatants in a time of war and the \nvery important purpose of our civilian court system.\n  In the case of the Blind Sheik, according to Michael Mukasey, the \nformer Attorney General, ``in the course of prosecuting Omar Abdel \nRahman, the government was compelled--as it is in all cases that charge \na coconspiracy charge--to turn over a list of unindicted coconspirators \nto the defendants. Within 10 days, a copy of that list of unindicted \ncoconspirators reached bin Laden in Khartoum.''\n  The notion that a list--because you had to do it, according to our \ncivilian court system where notice requirements are very important, \nwhere generally our court systems are open--would be provided to Osama \nbin Laden, in my view, is unacceptable, a risk we could have avoided if \nwe treated the Blind Sheik as he should have been treated, which is as \nan enemy combatant and tried in a military commission.\n  Civilian trials of enemy combatants have provided a treasure trove of \ninformation to terrorists, and I think those risks have been very \ndiscounted by my esteemed colleagues who have come to the floor to \noppose my amendment.\n  According to open source reporting, the cost of disclosing \ninformation unwisely became clear after the New York trials of bin \nLaden associates for the 1998 bombings of U.S. Embassies in Africa. \nSome of the evidence indicated that the National Security Agency, the \nU.S. foreign eavesdrop organization, had intercepted cell phone \nconversations. Shortly thereafter, bin Laden's organization stopped \nusing cell phones to discuss sensitive operational details.\n  It is also important to note that the record of trying enemy \ncombatants in civilian courts is not as good as it has been made out to \nbe. Opponents of my amendment don't often speak about Ahmed Ghailani.\n  Ghailani is a Tanzanian who was charged with a total of 284 counts, \nincluding 200-plus counts of murder and 1 count of conspiracy in the \n1998 bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. The bombings \nkilled 224 people, including 12 Americans. He also spent time as Osama \nbin Laden's bodyguard.\n  He was tried in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nNew York. The Department of Justice directed the U.S. attorney not to \nseek the death penalty. At trial, the presiding justice excluded from \nevidence the testimony of a key witness--a Tanzanian, who may have \nissued statements implicating him in the bombings. And on November 17, \n2010, a jury, after this evidence was excluded, found Ghailani only \nguilty of 1 count of a conspiracy and acquitted him of all 284 other \ncharges, including the murder charges. He murdered 284 people--12 \nAmericans--and he was acquitted of murder charges. I think that is a \ncase that shows our civilian court system is not always the best way to \ndeal with enemy combatants and is very contrary to what I have heard on \nthe cases cited from my opponents of this amendment.\n  Proponents of civilian trial, such as Attorney General Holder, want \nto criminalize the war, but they fail to cite these cases where the \ncivilian\n\n[[Page S6746]]\n\ncourt system leaked classified information to terrorists or, because of \nexcluded evidence, where terrorists are not held fully accountable.\n  Military detention for enemy combatants has always been the rule, not \nthe exception. Why are we treating this war any differently? Civilian \ncourts rightly focus on prosecution, but in detaining enemy combatants \nwhen at war, they miss the most important goal we have to have; that \nis, gathering intelligence and protecting the American people against \nfuture attacks.\n  Civilian trials for enemy combatants incur tremendous costs and cause \ncivic disruption. That is why the administration itself has reversed \nits position on trying Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in New York City. They \nwanted to try the mastermind behind 9/11 in the middle of New York \nCity, but the American people were so outraged by trying someone who is \nthe mastermind of 9/11 in the middle of New York City and the millions \nof dollars it would have cost to protect the citizens of New York from \nthis horrible individual, giving him a forum in the middle of New York \nCity.\n  Again, the costs associated with protecting the American people in \nthese civilian trials alone is enough to treat them as they should be--\nin military commissions.\n  We risk compromising classified information, and we risk the eventual \nrelease of these combatants into American society.\n  For these reasons, consistent with a longstanding precedent, we \nshould not be bringing enemy combatants to the United States for \ncivilian trials. If the Obama administration is willing to kill enemy \ncombatants without due process, and I applaud them for doing so, why is \nthe administration so against placing these same enemy combatants in \nmilitary custody and detaining them under the law of war, and when \nappropriate trying them in military commissions?\n  I think the answer is clear. Unfortunately, I am concerned that it is \na political decision rather than putting intelligence gathering first \nin order to protect the American people and treat these enemy \ncombatants as what they are--enemies of our country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment. In my view, beyond the policy \nreasons for not trying enemy combatants in civilian courts, we should \nask ourselves why should we bring foreign terrorists to the United \nStates and give them the legal protections reserved for U.S. citizens \nand secured by those Americans who have fought and died for those \nrights? Why do these people deserve access to our American court \nsystem? They are our enemies. In the civilian court systems there are \nrights guaranteed, such as Miranda rights and speedy presentment, that \nshould not be extended to enemy combatants. We need to prioritize \nprotecting our country. I think the American people will agree with me \nwhen I say that no terrorist should ever hear the words ``you have the \nright to remain silent.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment No. 753.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 792, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment be set aside \nand my previous pending amendment No. 792 be brought up.\n  I have a modification to that amendment that I sent to the desk. I \nthank the Senator from California for giving me this privilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     may not make a payment to any person or entity with respect \n     to a property assisted or insured under a program of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development that--\n        (a) on the date of enactment of this Act, is designated as \n     ``troubled'' on the Online Property Integrated Information \n     System for ``life threatening deficiencies'' or ``poor'' \n     physical condition; and\n       (b) has been designated as ``troubled'' for ``life \n     threatening conditions'' or ``poor'' physical condition on \n     the Online Property Integrated Information System at least \n     once during the 5-year period ending on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee to speak against amendment 753 to this appropriations bill. \nIn sum, this amendment will require members of al-Qaida to be \nprosecuted only by military commissions. It will cripple executive \nauthority and flexibility to go after terrorists. Of all things in this \narea where we should be agreed and the President should have maximum \nflexibility, it is with the disposition of people who commit acts of \nterror in this country. I feel very strongly about this.\n  The military commission system has been in effect since 2006. It has \nhad six convictions. By comparison, terrorists have been tried by \nprevious administrations, including the Bush administration, in article \nIII courts, and more than 400 of them have been convicted and are \nserving time in Federal prisons.\n  One case may be brought up where somebody disagrees with a verdict. \nYou can disagree with a Federal jury, but you cannot disagree with the \nrecord of conviction and the strong sentences imposed. I will go into \nthis in a little more detail in a few minutes.\n  Just to say again, I have never seen a time when Congress has tried \nso much to constrain the power of the president and our professionals \nin law enforcement in their efforts to defeat terrorism.\n  As has been the policy of Republican and Democratic Presidents, the \ndecision about how to prosecute a suspected terrorist should be based \non the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national \nsecurity interests, not politics.\n  Some of the most well-known terrorists of the past decade--``Shoe \nBomber'' Richard Reid, ``Blind Sheik'' Omar Abdel Rahman and the ``20th \nHijacker'' Zacarias Moussaoui--are serving life sentences after being \ntried in Article III criminal courts.\n  Prosecuting terrorists in military commissions makes sense in some \ncases, but requiring it for all AI-Qaeda terrorists in each and every \ncase is not in the national security of the U.S.\n  In fact, that would severely limit our ability to handle some of the \nbiggest threats.\n  To understand why this proposed amendment would be such bad policy, \nconsider the two recent cases where al-Qaida tried to use operatives to \nattack our Homeland, but we captured and arrested the terrorists \ninstead.\n  First, Najibullah Zazi, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., was \narrested in September 2009 as part of an al-Qaida conspiracy to carry \nout suicide bombings on the New York City subway system.\n  Then on Christmas 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to \ndetonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear while on board \nNorthwest Airlines Flight 253 before it landed in Detroit, Michigan. \nAl-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula--AQAP--claimed responsibility for the \nattempted attack and said that Abdulmutallab had trained with and been \ntasked to carry out the plot for AQAP.\n  In both cases, the FBI arrested each Al Qaeda operative in the midst \nof the unfolding terrorist plot, and was able to obtain useful \nintelligence through interrogation.\n  Most recently the DEA and the FBI, through shared intelligence, were \nable to interrupt an Iranian plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador right \nhere in Washington, DC. That man will be tried in Federal court. That \nman was successfully interrogated by the FBI. That man spilled his guts \nto the FBI, as they say in the vernacular.\n  Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab pleaded guilty last week to all counts of \nan eight-count criminal indictment charging him for his role in the \nattempted Christmas Day 2009 bombing of Northwest Airlines flight 253. \nHe cooperated, provided intelligence, and will probably spend the rest \nof his life behind bars when he is sentenced in January.\n  By comparison, two of six of the individuals convicted in military \ncommissions are already out of prison living freely in their home \ncountries of Yemen and Australia. Consider all of the following \nrelatively light sentences handed down by military commissions since 9/\n11:\n  Bin Laden's driver, Salim Hamdan--acquitted of conspiracy and only \nconvicted of material support for terrorism--received a five-month \nsentence\n\n[[Page S6747]]\n\nand was sent back to his home in Yemen to serve the time before being \nreleased in January 2009.\n  Australian David Hicks--the first person convicted in a military \ncommission when he entered into a plea agreement on material support \nfor terrorism charges in March 2007--was given a 9-month sentence, \nwhich he mostly served back at home in Australia.\n  Omar Khadr pleaded guilty in a military commission in exchange for an \n8-year sentence, but he will likely be transferred to a Canadian prison \nafter 1 year.\n  Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al-Qosi pleaded guilty to conspiracy and \nmaterial support to terrorism in July 2010. In August 2010, a jury \ndelivered a 14-year sentence, but the final sentence handed down in \nFebruary 2011 was 2 years pursuant to his plea agreement.\n  Noor Uthman Muhammed pleaded guilty to conspiracy and material \nsupport to terrorism in February 2011. A jury delivered a 14-year \nsentence, but the final sentence will be less than 3 years pursuant to \nhis plea agreement. These are military commission trials.\n  Ali Hamza al-Bahlul received a life sentence after he boycotted the \nentire military commission process and was convicted of soliciting \nmurder and material support for terrorism without mounting a defense.\n  In the Zazi case, what the Senator from New Hampshire was suggesting \nwould actually require the government to split up co-defendants even \nwhere they would otherwise be prosecuted as part of the same \nconspiracy.\n  For example, Zazi's alleged co-conspirators Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis \nMedunjanin would be prosecuted on terrorist charges in criminal court, \nbut Zazi himself would have to be transferred to a military commission.\n  Splitting up co-conspirators into two different detention and \nprosecution systems might prevent prosecutors from achieving the guilty \npleas and likely long prison sentences that will be secured in the Zazi \nconspiracy case. Prosecutors have already obtained convictions against \nsix individuals, including Zazi and Ahmedzay, who face life in Federal \nprison without parole.\n  Importantly, we have heard from intelligence officials and others \nthat a mandatory military commission policy will reduce our allies' \nwillingness to extradite terror suspects to the United States for \ninterrogation or prosecution, or even provide evidence about suspected \nterrorists if they will be shipped off to military commissions in all \ncases.\n  You might say why would our allies do that? I will tell you why: \nBecause our allies--who know about the past five years and know about \nthe opposition to military commissions in their countries--are very \nreluctant to give evidence to a judicial process that does not adhere \nto the rule of law as much as our tried and tested Federal court system \ndoes.\n  Take the 9/11 commission report, which recommends the following on \npage 380:\n\n       [t]he United States should engage its friends to develop a \n     common coalition approach toward the detention and humane \n     treatment of captured terrorists.\n\n  If Congress rejects the views of our allies and mandates military \ncommission prosecutions for al-Qaida terrorists, it will also be a \nrejection of a recommendation from the 9/11 commission. Moreover, we \nwill be undermining international law enforcement cooperation and \ndangerous terrorists could be set free as a result.\n  Every single suspected terrorist captured on American soil, before \nand after September 11, has been taken into custody by law \nenforcement--not the U.S. military. This should never change. If \nsomebody commits an act on our soil, they should be prosecuted in an \narticle III court. This doesn't mean that we are soft on terrorism in \nany way, but it does mean that terrorists should be brought to justice, \nforced to stand trial and given a very serious sentence.\n  As John Brennan, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security \nand Counterterrorism, stated in a March speech:\n\n       Terrorists arrested inside the United States will, as \n     always, be processed exclusively through our criminal justice \n     system. As they should be. The alternative would be \n     inconsistent with our values and our adherence to the rule of \n     law. Our military does not patrol our streets or enforce our \n     law in this country. Nor should it.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  In summary, amendment No. 753, authored by the Senator from New \nHampshire, will severely and seriously undermine our ability to \nincapacitate dangerous individuals and protect the American people. I \nbelieve this is something we cannot afford and I hope this body will do \neverything it can to protect the executive branch's flexibility.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Department of Justice, dated March of 2010 which describes the more \nthan 400 terrorist convictions in article III courts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 26, 2010.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Feinstein and Vice Chairman Bond: I am \n     writing in response to requests by a number of Members of the \n     Committee for information about statistics maintained by the \n     Department of Justice relating to prosecution of terrorism \n     and terrorism-related crimes, as well as the incarceration of \n     terrorists by the Bureau of Prisons.\n       The Counterterrorism Section of the National Security \n     Division (NSD) (and its predecessor section in the Criminal \n     Division) has maintained a chart of international terrorism \n     and terrorism-related prosecutions since September 11, 2001. \n     A copy of that chart, which currently includes just over 400 \n     defendants, and a brief introduction describing its contents, \n     is enclosed with this letter. This chart was initially \n     developed and has since been maintained and regularly updated \n     on a rolling basis by career federal prosecutors. The bulk of \n     the data included in the chart was generated, and relates to \n     prosecutions that occurred, during the prior Administration. \n     In fact, the data was cited publicly by the prior \n     Administration on repeated occasions, including:\n       In a book entitled ``Preserving Life & Liberty: The Record \n     of the U.S. Department of Justice 2001-2005,'' released in \n     February 2005, the Department said, ``Altogether, the \n     Department has brought charges against 375 individuals in \n     terrorism-related investigations, and has convicted 195 to \n     date.''\n       In its February 2008 budget request for Fiscal Year 2009, \n     the Department of Justice said, ``Since 2001, the Department \n     has increased its capacity to investigate terrorism and has \n     identified, disrupted, and dismantled terrorist cells \n     operating in the United States. These efforts have resulted \n     in the securing of 319 convictions or guilty pleas in \n     terrorism or terrorism-related cases arising from \n     investigations conducted primarily after September 11, 2001, \n     and zero terrorist attacks on American soil by foreign \n     nationals from 2003 through 2007.''\n       Please note that the chart includes only convictions from \n     September 11, 2001 to March 18, 2010. It does not include \n     defendants whose convictions remain under seal, nor does it \n     include defendants who have been charged with a terrorism or \n     terrorism-related offense but have not been convicted either \n     at trial or by guilty plea. Finally, it does not include \n     convictions related solely to domestic terrorism.\n       The NSD chart includes the defendant's name, district, \n     charging date, charges brought, classification category, \n     conviction date, and conviction charges, as well as the \n     sentence and the date it was imposed, if the defendant has \n     been sentenced. As the introduction to the NSD chart \n     explains, the data includes convictions resulting from \n     investigations of terrorist acts planned or committed outside \n     the territorial jurisdiction of the United States over which \n     Federal criminal jurisdiction exists and those within the \n     United States involving international terrorists and \n     terrorist groups. NSD further divides these cases into two \n     categories. The first includes violations of federal statutes \n     that are directly related to international terrorism and that \n     are utilized regularly in international terrorism matters, \n     such as terrorist acts abroad against U.S. nationals and \n     providing material support to a foreign terrorist \n     organization. There have been more than 150 defendants \n     classified in this category since September 11, 2001. The \n     second category includes a variety of other statutes (like \n     fraud, firearms offenses, false statements, or obstruction of \n     justice) where the investigation involved an identified link \n     to international terrorism. There have been more than 240 \n     individuals charged in such cases since September 11, 2001. \n     Examples of the international terrorism nexus identified in \n     some of these cases have also been provided for your review.\n       Prosecuting terror-related targets using these latter \n     offenses is often an effective method--and sometimes the only \n     available method--of deterring and disrupting potential \n     terrorist planning and support activities. Indeed, one of the \n     great strengths of the criminal justice system is the broad \n     range of offenses that are available to arrest and convict \n     individuals believed to be linked to terrorism, even if a \n     terrorism offense cannot be established. Of course, an \n     aggressive and\n\n[[Page S6748]]\n\n     wide-ranging terrorism investigation will net individuals \n     with varying degrees of culpability and involvement in \n     terrorist activity, as the NSD chart reflects. Arresting and \n     convicting both major and minor operatives, supporters, and \n     facilitators can have crippling effects on terrorists' \n     ability to carry out their plans.\n       You will also note that the sentences obtained in these \n     cases range from a few months to life. Life sentences have \n     been imposed by our courts in 12 international terrorism or \n     terrorism-related cases since 9/11, and sentences of more \n     than 10 years have been imposed in an additional 59 cases, \n     including 25 cases in which the sentence exceeded 20 years. \n     We believe the long sentences often imposed by our courts in \n     these cases reflect the gravity of the threat posed by these \n     individuals to our nation. However, it is important to note \n     that while a long sentence is an important measure of success \n     in a terrorism-related prosecution, it is not the only \n     measure. Convicting an individual of an available offense and \n     incarcerating him even for a relatively short period of time \n     may be an effective way to disrupt ongoing terrorist \n     activity, deter future activity, collect important \n     intelligence, secure valuable cooperation, or facilitate \n     rapid deportation of an individual.\n       This vital work continues. In the past year, thanks to the \n     hard work of dedicated career professionals--FBI agents, \n     other federal and state law enforcement officials, and career \n     federal prosecutors--we have been able to disrupt terrorist \n     plots, convict and imprison terrorists and their supporters, \n     and collect intelligence we need to protect the country. We \n     detected and disrupted a plot to attack the subway system in \n     Manhattan with explosive bombs that could have killed many \n     Americans. We conducted successful undercover operations to \n     arrest individuals who separately attempted to blow up \n     buildings in Dallas, Texas, and Springfield, Illinois. And we \n     arrested individuals in Chicago who assisted in the deadly \n     November 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai and were plotting \n     other attacks.\n       Finally, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) maintains a separate \n     chart that identifies inmates in BOP custody who have a \n     history of or nexus to international or domestic terrorism. \n     There are currently more than 300 individuals on this chart, \n     which is used to identify those inmates who may warrant \n     increased supervision and monitoring of their communications, \n     among other things. BOP's designation of these inmates may be \n     based upon information from a variety of sources, including \n     sensitive law enforcement or intelligence information that is \n     not publicly available, regarding the inmate's past behavior \n     and associations. BOP does not publicly disclose which \n     inmates have been designated in this fashion. The disclosure \n     of this information could interfere with BOP's monitoring and \n     law enforcement investigative efforts. Moreover, disclosure \n     of the identities of these inmates could pose risks to the \n     security of the inmates and prison staff.\n       Should you or your staff wish to review the BOP chart, BOP \n     is prepared to provide the Committee with access to the chart \n     under conditions designed to protect security and operational \n     equities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ronald Weich,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n       Enclosure.\n\n   Introduction to National Security Division Statistics on Unsealed \n       International Terrorism and Terrorism-Related Convictions\n\n       The National Security Division's International Terrorism \n     and Terrorism-Related Statistics Chart tracks convictions \n     resulting from international terrorism investigations \n     conducted since September 11, 2001, including investigations \n     of terrorist acts planned or committed outside the \n     territorial jurisdiction of the United States over which \n     Federal criminal jurisdiction exists and those within the \n     United States involving international terrorists and \n     terrorist groups. Convictions listed on the chart involve the \n     use of a variety of Federal criminal statutes available to \n     prevent, disrupt, and punish international terrorism and \n     related criminal activity. The convictions are the product of \n     the Department's aggressive, consistent, and coordinated \n     national enforcement effort with respect to international \n     terrorism that was undertaken after the September 11, 2001 \n     terrorist attacks.\n       Criminal cases arising from international terrorism \n     investigations are divided into two categories, according to \n     the requisite level of coordination and monitoring required \n     by the Counterterrorism Section of the National Security \n     Division (or its predecessor section in the Criminal \n     Division). This coordination and monitoring exists in \n     response to the expanded Federal criminal jurisdiction over \n     and importance of international terrorism matters and the \n     need to ensure coherent, consistent, and effective Federal \n     prosecutions related to such matters. Typically, multiple \n     defendants in a case are classified in the same category.\n       Category I cases involve violations of federal statutes \n     that are directly related to international terrorism and that \n     are utilized regularly in international terrorism matters. \n     These statutes prohibit, for example, terrorist acts abroad \n     against United States nationals, the use of weapons of mass \n     destruction, conspiracy to murder persons overseas, providing \n     material support to terrorists or foreign terrorist \n     organizations, receiving military style training from foreign \n     terrorist organizations, and bombings of public places or \n     government facilities. A complete list of Category I offenses \n     is found in Appendix A.\n       Category II cases include defendants charged with violating \n     a variety of other statutes where the investigation involved \n     an identified link to international terrorism. These Category \n     II cases include offenses such as those involving fraud, \n     immigration, firearms, drugs, false statements, perjury, and \n     obstruction of justice, as well as general conspiracy charges \n     under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371. Prosecuting terror-related targets \n     using Category II offenses and others is often an effective \n     method--and sometimes the only available method--of deterring \n     and disrupting potential terrorist planning and support \n     activities. This approach underscores the wide variety of \n     tools available in the U.S. criminal justice system for \n     disrupting terror activity. Examples of Category II offenses \n     are listed in Appendix B, and examples of Category II cases \n     are described in Appendix C to illustrate the kinds of \n     connections to international terrorism that are not apparent \n     from the nature of the offenses of conviction themselves.\n       The chart includes the defendant's name, district, charging \n     date, charges brought, classification category, conviction \n     date and conviction charges. If a convicted defendant has \n     been sentenced, the relevant date and sentence imposed is \n     included. The chart is constantly being updated with new \n     convictions, but currently includes only unsealed convictions \n     from September 11, 2001 to March 18, 2010. The chart does not \n     include defendants whose convictions remain under seal, nor \n     does it include defendants who have been charged with a \n     terrorism or terrorism-related offense but have not been \n     convicted either at trial or by guilty plea. This chart does \n     not include convictions related solely to domestic terrorism. \n     Note that the chart maintained by the National Security \n     Division is distinct from statistics maintained by the Bureau \n     of Prisons to track inmates with terrorist connections. The \n     chart lists more than 150 defendants classified in Category I \n     and more than 240 defendants classified in Category II.\n       The chart is organized by conviction date, with the most \n     recent convictions first. The earliest defendants included on \n     the chart were identified and detained in the course of the \n     nationwide investigation conducted after September 11, 2001, \n     and were subsequently charged with a criminal offense. Since \n     then, additional defendants have been added who, at the time \n     of charging, appeared to have a connection to international \n     terrorism, even if they were not charged with a terrorism \n     offense. The decision to add defendants to the chart is made \n     on a case-by-case basis by career prosecutors in the National \n     Security Division's Counterterrorism Section, whose primary \n     responsibility is investigating and prosecuting international \n     and domestic terrorism cases to prevent and disrupt acts of \n     terrorism anywhere in the world that impact on significant \n     United States interests and persons.\n\n\n                               Appendix A\n\n     Category I Offenses\n     Aircraft Sabotage (18 U.S.C.

In 2008, following a jury trial in the United \n     States District Court for the District of New Jersey, Ibrahim \n     Shnewer, Dritan Duka, Shain Duka, Eljvir Duka and Serdar \n     Tatar were convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1117, in \n     connection with a plot to kill members of the U.S. military \n     in an armed attack on the military base at Fort Dix, New \n     Jersey. The defendants were also convicted of various weapons \n     charges. The government's evidence revealed that one member \n     of the group conducted surveillance at Fort Dix and Fort \n     Monmouth in New Jersey, Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, and \n     the U.S. Coast Guard in Philadelphia. The group obtained a \n     detailed map of Fort Dix, where they hoped to use assault \n     rifles to kill as many soldiers as possible. During the \n     trial, the jury viewed secretly recorded videotapes of the \n     defendants performing small-arms training at a shooting range \n     in the Poconos Mountains in Pennsylvania and of the \n     defendants watching training videos that included depictions \n     of American soldiers being killed and of known Islamic \n     radicals urging jihad against the United States.\n       Fawaz Damrah (citizenship fraud). In 2004, following a jury \n     trial in the United States District Court for the Northern \n     District of Ohio, Fawaz Damrah was convicted of violating 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1425 for concealing material facts in his \n     citizenship application. The government's evidence showed \n     that in his citizenship application, Damrah concealed from \n     the U.S. government his membership in or affiliation with the \n     Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a.k.a. the Islamic Jihad \n     Movement in Palestine; the Afghan Refugees Services, Inc., \n     a.k.a. Al-Kifah Refugee Center; and the Islamic Committee for \n     Palestine. Damrah further concealed the fact that he had, \n     prior to his application for U.S. citizenship, ``incited, \n     assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution'' of \n     Jews and others by advocating violent terrorist attacks \n     against Jews and others. During the trial, the government's \n     evidence included footage of a 1991 speech in which Damrah \n     called Jews ``the sons of monkeys and pigs,'' and a 1989 \n     speech in which he declared that ``terrorism and terrorism \n     alone is the path to liberation.''\n       Soliman Biheiri (false statements and passport fraud). In \n     2003 and 2004, following two jury trials in the United States \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Soliman \n     Biheiri was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1425 \n     and 1546 for fraudulently procuring a passport, as well as 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1001 and 1015 for making false statements to \n     federal agents. Biheiri was the president of BMI, Inc., a New \n     Jersey-based investment firm. The government's evidence \n     showed that Biheiri had deliberately deceived federal agents \n     during a June 2003 interview in which he denied having \n     business or personal ties to Mousa Abu Marzook, a Specially \n     Designated Global Terrorist and a leader of Hamas. In fact, \n     the government's evidence showed that Biheiri had managed \n     funds for Marzook both before and after Marzook was \n     designated as a terrorist by the U.S. government in 1995. \n     Specifically, the government presented files seized from \n     Biheiri's computer showing that Marzook had invested $1 \n     million in U.S. business ventures managed by Biheiri and his \n     investment firm.\n       Mohammad Salman Farooq Qureshi (false statements). In 2005, \n     following the entry of a guilty plea in the United States \n     District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Qureshi \n     was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 for making \n     false statements to the FBI regarding the nature and extent \n     of his involvement with al-Qaeda member Wadih El Hage, and \n     the non-governmental organization Help Africa People. Qureshi \n     was interviewed by the FBI in 1997, 1998, 2000, and 2004 in \n     relation to terrorism crimes and during those interviews lied \n     about his knowledge of El Hage, Help Africa People, and other \n     al Qaeda members. The proffer filed in support of the plea \n     agreement established Qureshi's connections to and contacts \n     with El Hage, his contact with a subject under investigation \n     in Oregon, and his activities and financial support of Help \n     Africa People, a non-governmental organization believed to \n     have been used by El Hage and others to provide cover \n     identities and funds in connection with the 1998 attacks on \n     the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. By \n     Qureshi's admissions, at least $30,000 in Qureshi's funds \n     were given to El Hage in Nairobi, Kenya. El Hage is serving a \n     life sentence for his role in the East Africa Embassy \n     bombings.\n       Sabri Benkahla (perjury, obstruction, false statements). In \n     2007, following a jury trial in the United States District \n     Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Sabri Benkahla \n     was convicted on two counts of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623, \n     for perjury, one count of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503 for \n     obstructing justice, and one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1001 for making false statements to the FBI. These false \n     statements included denial of his involvement with an \n     overseas jihad training camp in 1999, as well as his asserted \n     lack of knowledge about individuals with whom he was in \n     contact. The government's evidence revealed that the grand \n     jury and FBI in 2004 sought to question Benkahla about his \n     contacts with Ibrahim Buisir of Ireland, and Manaf Kasmuri of \n     Malaysia, both of whom are Specially Designated Global \n     Terrorists, as well as those with Ahmed Abu Ali, his friend \n     and fellow student at the University of Medina, until both \n     were arrested by Saudi authorities in June 2003. Further, the \n     government's evidence revealed that the grand jury and FBI \n     sought to question Benkahla about his contacts with an \n     individual suspected of being Malik al-Tunisi, a facilitator \n     for the al-Zarqawi terrorist network in Iraq.\n       Akram Musa Abdallah (false statements). In 2009, following \n     the entry of a guilty plea in the United States District \n     Court for the District of Arizona, Akram Musa Abdallah was \n     convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 for making false \n     statements to the FBI. In January 2007, Abdallah knowingly \n     made a false material statement to special agents of the FBI \n     during an interview in connection with the federal \n     investigation and prosecution of the Holy Land Foundation for \n     Relief & Development (HLF) and its officers. At the time of \n     the interviews, Abdallah knew the HLF was a Specially \n     Designated Global Terrorist organization. Abdallah also knew \n     that when he was interviewed, the HLF and its officers were \n     pending trial in the United States District Court for the \n     Northern District of Texas, for crimes including providing \n     material support to a foreign terrorist organization. During \n     the interviews, Abdallah told FBI agents he was not involved \n     in fundraising activities for the HLF, when, in fact, between \n     approximately 1994 and 1997, Abdallah was involved in \n     numerous fundraising activities, including collecting \n     donations, organizing, facilitating and coordinating fund \n     raising events on behalf of the HLF in the Phoenix \n     metropolitan area. In July 2004, the HLF and seven of its \n     principals were indicted on a variety of charges stemming \n     from its financial support of Hamas, and in November 2008, \n     after a two-month trial, those defendants were convicted on \n     all charges.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 769\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise to raise significant concerns with \nthe pending modified amendment offered by my good friend and colleague, \nSenator David Vitter. His amendment allows for the importation of \nprescription drugs from Canada. I am going to reiterate some of the \nsame concerns that are voiced every time we discuss drug importation.\n  Let me also say that I think we all want more inexpensive drugs for \nour constituents. We all want broader access to drugs and therapies. \nThat is a given. I know that is precisely the intent of my colleague. \nHowever, we want to ensure our constituents are safe when they are \ntaking these drugs no matter what the expense--not only that, but \nAmericans expect to be kept safe.\n  I must raise concerns that nothing in the Vitter amendment ensures \nthe safety of drugs that would be imported from Canada. That is the \nlone country that is involved in regard to his pending amendment. Some \nsay only the FDA-approved drugs would be imported and only safe drugs \nwill be imported. But the reality is that the last four Secretaries of \nHealth and Human Services--from Shalala, to Thompson, to Leavitt, and \nnow Sebelius--have been unable to guarantee that these imported drugs \nare safe, not from Canada and not from any other country.\n  While my friend from Louisiana claims he has narrowed the scope of \nhis\n\n[[Page S6750]]\n\namendment, the modified Vitter amendment remains so broad in scope that \nit could potentially tie the hands of the FDA in limiting counterfeit \ndrugs reaching the United States, which is something we desperately do \nnot want. The FDA has found on several occasions that drugs promoted \nand sold as Canadian actually come from many other countries with very \nlittle oversight on safety and efficacy.\n  Finally, a New York Times investigation found that counterfeit drugs \nwere sold through Canadian Internet pharmacies. It is easy to conclude \nthat because these drugs were sourced from many other countries, it \nwould be impossible to guarantee their safety.\n  The bottom line is the FDA cannot--not a little, not a lot; \nabsolutely cannot--ensure that any drug coming from outside the United \nStates is safe or effective. Until we can ensure that the drugs our \nconstituents are taking are effective and, most importantly, safe, I \nmust oppose the Vitter amendment today or whenever it is brought up and \nwould encourage my colleagues to join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 814 and 815\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is a very interesting bill on the \nfloor. It is really three bills. It is the Agriculture appropriations, \nCommerce-Justice-Science, and the Transportation-Housing bill.\n  Our colleague, Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, spent a good part of \nyesterday managing the bill. He chairs the agriculture subcommittee. I \nam doing it today. Senator Kohl is tied up on other matters.\n  He is adamant in his opposition to the Moran amendment providing $8 \nmillion for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program. While he is not \nopposed to the Watershed Rehabilitation Program, he wanted to make it \nclear that we had to make very difficult decisions. He does not support \nSenator Moran's amendment as it would offset funding in the \ndepartmental administration providing numerous essential services to \nUSDA. These cuts would force USDA to impose a reduction in force and \nwould have a detrimental effect on the Department and its operation.\n  USDA has initiated buyouts to several thousand employees across many \nagricultural agencies. The level for the Department administration is \nover $13 million and $7 million below the request. Secretary Vilsack \nhas reached out to the agricultural subcommittee and has concerns with \noverall staff reductions at the Department. Senator Kohl echoes \nSecretary Vilsack's concern.\n  Senator Kohl opposes this amendment, and on his behalf, I urge other \nSenators to oppose it as well.\n  He also opposed the Crapo amendment because, in a nutshell, says that \ndictating that funds cannot be used unless the rulemaking agenda and \nimplementation schedule meet with congressional approval or \nconstraining the regulatory process of defining terms just goes too far \nand is a veiled attempt to roll back critical Dodd-Frank reforms, \nparticularly in the derivative area.\n  Again, on behalf of Senator Kohl, he urges all Senators to reject \nCrapo amendment No. 814.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 791\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nCoburn amendment No. 791, and I am pleased to be joined on the floor by \nmy good friend and colleague and ranking member, Senator Roberts.\n  Let me start by saying that in the context of addressing a very large \ndeficit we know needs to be addressed and in the context of the work \nbeing done by colleagues in what has been called the supercommittee, I \nam very proud of the fact that Senator Roberts and I and our \ncolleagues, the chair and ranking member of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, have come together and worked very hard, for different \nregions of the country, on different issues that we bring to the table. \nWe have agreed on an overall reduction number that we have recommended \nas agriculture's portion of the deficit reduction.\n  We have already done deficit reduction, I have to say. We have \nalready seen cuts in crop insurance, we have already seen cuts in the \ncurrent year's budget that were substantial. But we know we need to do \nour part, and we are doing that. We are recommending $23 billion in \ndeficit reduction.\n  Part of that, though, the critical part of that is we have asked the \ncommittee to allow us, as the leadership in the House and Senate, to \npropose the policy that goes with the cuts. We are working with all of \nthose who are affected, from production agriculture, to conservation \ngroups, the nutrition community, rural development, everyone who is \ninvolved and impacted by the 16 million jobs in agriculture. There are \n16 million jobs. That is one out of four jobs in Michigan. This is \nincredibly important to our economy.\n  We are taking very seriously the need for us to come together and \ncreate changes, reforms in agricultural policy that streamline the \nsystem and the bureaucracy, do a better job with dollars, \naccountability, and reform what we are doing as it relates to the \nagricultural payment structure. It is in the context of that that I \nrise to oppose Senator Coburn's amendment. I appreciate his well-\nintended amendment, but I would say two things.\n  First of all, I understand he is proposing caps of $1 million on \ndirect payments. We are in the process of changing that and \nrecommending positive reforms in that whole system.\n  So we would ask that the Senate, our colleagues, to support us and \nthe recommendations that we have been asked to put together by November \n1, which is extremely fast-tracked, but we are working diligently, and \nour staffs are working diligently. There is not a lot of sleep right \nnow so we can get this all done and put forward this new policy. So it \nis the wrong time and place to be suggesting this change, first of all, \non an appropriations bill and, secondly in the context of this \nbipartisan, bicameral, good-faith effort to put forward changes in our \nsystem, which we are committed to doing, which will, frankly, usurp \nwhat this amendment is really all about.\n  Let me also say that it is important to talk about the fact that we \nhave made changes in the last two farm bills. In 2002, there was a cap \nput on payments of $2.5 million, and we then lowered that in the 2008 \nfarm bill to $500,000 for nonfarm income and $750,000 for farm income. \nWe made a number of changes and a number of reforms in the last farm \nbill that moved us in the right direction, listening to the criticisms \nand concerns of the public and of colleagues. I think there were some \nvery important steps that were made and positive changes in the last \nfarm bill.\n  Understanding the world we are in now and the dynamics around deficit \nreduction and the economy and all of the other issues we are involved \nin, we are taking another major step, and I think it is a step being \ndone in a way that says to colleagues and says to the public that we \ncan work together. These are challenging policies, economic issues.\n  We have come together and worked very hard on a bipartisan basis with \nthe House and the Senate, and I think this speaks well to the fact that \nif we sit down together and listen to each other and are willing to \ncompromise, we can come together on something that is good for the \ncountry. We are in the process of doing that right now. I would ask our \ncolleagues to allow us and support us in that effort.\n  We have put forward a proposal for $23 billion in deficit reduction, \nwhich is, frankly, more than would be required under sequestration for \nagriculture. We have gone above and beyond what the Bowles-Simpson \nproposal said. We know agriculture will want to do its part. We are \nasking colleagues to allow us to put together that policy to get there.\n  We will address the concerns that have been raised. We hear you. We \nunderstand. We will be proposing substantial changes that will, in \nfact, both create new tools for agriculture for our farmers and our \nranchers but also address concerns that have been raised. I\n\n[[Page S6751]]\n\nask my colleagues, rather than supporting this amendment, to support \nwhat is a good-faith effort that is going on right now in the House and \nSenate Agriculture Committees and allow us the time in the next week to \nput together the proposals to be able to make a change.\n  With that, I yield to my friend--and I do mean my friend--we have \nbecome good friends as well as colleagues on the Agriculture Committee. \nI have to say I loved being in Kansas and having the opportunity to be \nwith Senator Roberts and experience the high esteem with which he is \nheld there. At the same time, I saw tremendous devastation as a result \nof what has happened with the droughts. I understand that when there is \nbad weather, when there are bad conditions, we need to have support for \nAmerican agriculture. Food security, national security depends on it. I \ncertainly saw in Kansas what happens when the weather is bad and it has \nreinforced for me--as well as what happened in Michigan--certainly the \nimportance of having a strong set of tools to manage risk and a safety \nnet that is there when farmers need it.\n  I yield to my friend, the distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank very much the distinguished \nchairwoman for yielding. We are talking about amendment No. 791, the \npending amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Oklahoma, \nSenator Coburn.\n  I must oppose the Coburn amendment which will severely diminish the \nfarm safety net for America's farmers and ranchers. I know that is not \nthe intent of his amendment as he sees it but, unfortunately, that \nwould be the practical effect, as the chairwoman has indicated.\n  The setting of adjusted gross income caps or what we call AGI caps is \na policy issue that should be handled by the authorizing committee, not \nduring the appropriations process. More specifically, this issue is a \nfarm bill issue, if you will, and it is currently being considered in \nthe context of the Joint Debt Committee process--the supercommittee. \nThe chairwoman has described in detail our efforts, both the House \nprincipals and the chairwoman and myself, in submitting to the Joint \nDebt Committee our suggestions on how we can meet our deficit reduction \nresponsibilities.\n  As people consider this amendment, I think it is important to \nremember that the 2008 farm bill, as the chairwoman has indicated, \nincluded the most comprehensive and far-reaching reform to farm program \neligibility requirements in 20 years. That included reform to the AGI \ncaps to which the Coburn amendment refers.\n  It is also important for my colleagues to understand that the \nadjusted gross income for a farmer is not pure profit. Personal \nexpenses and the servicing of debt must still be covered. Given the \ncapital-intensive nature of farming and the cost of inputs such as land \nand machinery, servicing debt alone can cost hundreds of thousands of \ndollars.\n  Supporters of these limits also tend to talk about how few farmers \nwould be impacted by these caps. However, the advocates also only tend \nto look at those farmers who file Schedule F tax forms. This rather \nsimplistic approach fails to reflect the fact that most operations that \ncould be directly impacted by the AGI caps that they are recommending \ndo not file Schedule F tax returns because of how they have chosen to \norganize their farming operation. Therefore, most advocates of these \ncaps seriously underestimate the number of producers and the share of \nacres or production that would be left without a safety net.\n  To make matters worse, because this limit would be implemented using \nthe appropriations legislation instead of authorizing legislation, it \nwould not repeal the already existing AGI limits of $750,000 per on-\nfarm income and $500,000 for off-farm income. In other words, this \namendment would simply add another layer--another cap--another layer of \nbureaucracy to the already existing structure, further complicating \nUSDA's work on this issue at a time when resources are extremely \nlimited and when we are going to be in the process of writing a new \nfarm bill, not to mention meeting our deficit obligations to the \nsupercommittee.\n  Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to oppose the Coburn amendment \nand allow the agriculture committees the opportunity to address this \nissue in the appropriate venue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Careful observation by this Member would indicate that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 741 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BLUNT.

With that, it appears that there is not a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to speak to amendment No. 753 to \nH.R. 2112 by the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Senator \nAyotte. This amendment would tie the hands of our national security and \nlaw enforcement officers in their efforts to secure our national \nsecurity.\n  I am surprised that this amendment is being offered at this time. \nJust a week ago, we learned of the foiled assassination attempt in the \nUnited States of the Saudi Ambassador to the United States. This case \ninvolved the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the DEA in a \ncoordinated effort to prevent an act of terrorism on U.S. soil. I \ncommend the agencies involved in the investigation. I was also pleased \nto see that, in this instance, members of Congress did not re-engage in \narmchair quarterbacking over whether the suspect should be transferred \nto military custody or sent to Guantanamo.\n  Nearly two years ago, when a terrorist attempted to blow up an \nairplane on Christmas Day, some politicians used the occasion to \ncriticize the Attorney General after the suspect was arrested. They \nmade all kinds of claims about the risks of trying him in a Federal \ncourt, none of which came true. In fact, after obtaining useful \nintelligence from the suspect, that case proceeded without incident in \nFederal court where, last Wednesday, the defendant pleaded guilty. He \nnow faces a potential life sentence. That successful prosecution adds \nto the more than 440 terrorism-related convictions since September 11, \n2001.\n\n[[Page S6752]]\n\n  Over the last two and one half years, the President and his national \nsecurity team have done a tremendous job protecting America and taking \nthe fight to our enemies. Earlier this year, the President ordered a \nsuccessful strike against Osama bin Laden and has stayed focused on \ndestroying al Qaeda from his first days in office. Last month, the \nadministration was also able to locate Anwar al Awlaki, a terrorist \noperative in Yemen who was recruiting Americans to attack within the \nUnited States. During the past two and one half years, the President \nand his national security team have developed a counterterrorism \nframework that has protected the American people while taking on al \nQaeda and its affiliates. As the President's assistant for Homeland \nSecurity and Counterterrorism John Brennan noted last month: ``[T]he \nresults . . . under this approach are undeniable.'' Al Qaeda has been \n``severely crippled'' and the death of Osama bin Laden was a \n``strategic milestone'' in that effort.\n  We must remain vigilant, but no one can deny the progress that has \nbeen made. As Mr. Brennan emphasized, the approach is ``a practical, \nflexible, result-driven approach to counter terrorism that is \nconsistent with our laws, and in line with the very values upon which \nthis nation was founded.'' He noted: ``Where terrorists offer \ninjustice, disorder, and destruction, the United States and its allies \nstand for freedom, fairness, equality, and hope.''\n  The Judiciary Committee has held several hearings on the issue of how \nto best handle terrorism suspects. Experts and judges from across the \npolitical spectrum have agreed that our courts and our criminal justice \nsystem can play a role in this challenge, and indeed has been \neffectively involved many times already.\n  As a former prosecutor, I have absolute faith in the abilities of our \nFederal courts, prosecutors, and law enforcement to bring terrorists to \njustice. The Executive Branch must have all options available in \nhandling terrorism cases, including the ability to prosecute terrorists \nin Federal criminal courts.\n  I find it deeply troubling that the Senate would prohibit the \nadministration from trying terrorists in our Federal courts. While \nthere may be a place for military commissions in our overall approach \nto dealing with terrorism suspects, they remain mostly an unproven \ntool. The federal courts have dramatically more experience with \nhandling these types of cases and have a proven track record of \nsuccess.\n  There have been only six convictions in military commissions since \nSeptember 11. Of the six convictions, five resulted from plea bargains. \nOn average, the sentences given to those six defendants convicted in \nmilitary commissions have been far shorter than the sentences handed \ndown in Federal criminal courts. There have been more than 443 \nterrorism-related convictions in Federal courts since September 11, \n2001, including at least 78 convictions during the Obama \nadministration.\n  This amendment would deprive Federal law enforcement of a critical \ntool in bringing terrorists to justice. It usurps the Attorney \nGeneral's constitutional responsibilities.\n  This body does not hold the responsibility of prosecuting any one. We \nare not the ones who go to court. We are not the ones who bring cases \nbefore a jury. The executive branch should make those choices, and it \nhas done a very good job in winning convictions.\n  It would not be responsible for us to try to second-guess the system \nand tell a prosecutor what they should do in future cases. We would \nnever do this to a State prosecutor. Why would we do this to our \nFederal prosecutors who are so well equipped to handle these cases?\n  We have spent over 200 years developing our criminal justice system, \nand we have spent over 200 years developing our courts and our Federal \nprosecution processes. No one should try to pass an amendment that will \noverturn that. This is not the path forward. I urge all Senators to \noppose this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 836 to Amendment No. 738\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily \nset aside the pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 836.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Mr. Sanders, Mr. Menendez, and Mrs. Gillibrand, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 836 to amendment No. 738.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide adequate funding for Economic Development \n  Administration disaster relief grants pursuant to the agreement on \n  disaster relief funding included in the Budget Control Act of 2011)\n\n       On page 88, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     For an additional amount for ``Economic Development \n     Assistance Programs'' for expenses related to disaster \n     relief, long-term recovery, and restoration of infrastructure \n     in areas that received a major disaster designation in 2011 \n     pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122(2)), $365,000,000, \n     to remain available until expended: Provided, That such \n     amount is designated by Congress as being for disaster relief \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-177), as \n     amended.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment would increase funding \nfor disaster relief grants at the Economic Development Administration.\n  We all know that this has been a record year for natural disasters. \nOur country has already experienced a record 10 natural disasters that \ncost more than $1 billion each time. Hurricane Irene alone caused more \nthan $7 billion in damages on the East Coast. In my home State of New \nJersey, 11 people lost their lives as a result of the hurricane.\n  While President Obama came to my hometown of Paterson, NJ, to see the \ndamage firsthand, I must point out that we are still, almost across the \ncountry, in the wake of huge storms that demand attention and will \nrequire substantial funding.\n  In my hometown of Paterson, NJ, we witnessed unforgettable images. \nThe streets and sidewalks were covered in mud. In some homes, the \nsecond floor was also covered with mud.\n  But New Jersey is not alone. As I said, there have been extremely \nsevere storms across the country, and flooding and tornadoes have \ndevastated the Midwest and the South. As a result, FEMA has declared \nFederal disasters in all but two States this year. In the wake of these \ndisasters, we have seen the American people pulling together, neighbor \nhelping neighbor to put their lives back together; furniture out on the \nlawn; memorabilia that was so water soaked that it is valueless in \nterms of recalling memories.\n  It is painful to witness. When you see families standing together \nholding hands, wondering what is going to happen to them, we look to \nour country and they say help us recover from this disaster. Perhaps we \nwill never quite get over it, but we can use the help desperately.\n  The Federal Government has to do its part, and I am pleased the \nCommerce, Justice, and Science bill we are considering includes \nemergency funding for disaster relief grants at the Economic \nDevelopment Administration. I thank Senator Mikulski for her good work \nas chairman on this bill, but the needs all across the country are \noverwhelming and more disaster assistance is needed.\n  This amendment increases the funding for EDA disaster relief grants \nby $365 million to a total of $500 million of availability. I point out \nthat many of these disasters themselves have $1 billion worth of \ndamage. My amendment is cosponsored by Senator Sanders, Menendez, \nGillibrand, Blumenthal, and Leahy, and I thank them for their support. \nAny area that received a Federal disaster declaration this year would \nbe eligible to compete for this disaster relief, including areas in 48 \nStates so far this year. I want to be clear. Natural disasters \ndevastate local economies, causing damages that can linger for years. \nFEMA reimburses local governments' homeowners for repairs in the \nimmediate aftermath of a storm, but EDA grants are needed to\n\n[[Page S6753]]\n\nhelp communities get back on track for recovery and economic \nrevitalization in the wake of a major disaster. Communities use these \ndisaster relief funds to repair damaged public infrastructure, such as \nsewer and drinking water systems, and States use the EDA grants to \ncreate and coordinate efficient disaster response and recovery plans.\n  Additionally, local governments and nonprofits can lend EDA disaster \nrelief funds to businesses to help our private sector to rebuild and to \ngrow. Congress has recognized the value of this program in the past. \nDuring the past 5 years, we have provided more than $550 million in EDA \nemergency disaster relief funds. This includes $500 million in \nemergency supplemental funding for EDA in 2008 to respond to the \nhurricanes that devastated the South and the heavy rains that caused \nmassive flooding throughout the Midwest.\n  When these areas were in need, Congress came together and extended a \nhelping hand. Unfortunately, we have to do so again now. The funding in \nmy amendment complies with the disaster relief provisions included in \nthe Budget Control Act and is not offset with cuts from other programs \nin the bill. When disaster strikes, victims don't want us to reach for \nthe budget ax, they want us to help them rebuild and recover.\n  We all recognize our country faces serious fiscal challenges, but we \ncannot put a price on human lives. Nothing is more important than \nprotecting our communities, our families, and our economy. Hurricane \nIrene and many other natural disasters hit our country this year, \ncausing widespread damage that is going to require a massive rebuilding \neffort. The American people are looking to us, to the Federal \nGovernment, to lend a helping hand.\n  I point again to the picture of what a disaster such as this can do, \nwhere water is virtually up to the second floors, and this was repeated \nacross the State of New Jersey and in many other States as a result of \nhurricane Irene.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Although \nthere are squabbles about funding for various programs, at no time is \nthe help more urgently needed than now--again, right after these storms \nhave hit, leaving terrible devastation and people urging and pleading \nwith us to give them the help. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have worked long and hard this whole week \ntrying to move forward on the legislation dealing with our \nappropriations bills. It has been difficult, and one reason it has been \ndifficult is this is kind of a new area we are working in; that is, \nlegislating. I was very impressed to see Senator Mikulski talk with \ngreat clarity about how nice it was for her to again be legislating.\n  But we are not there yet. We were hoping to have a number of votes \ntoday--tonight--but we haven't been able to do that. We are getting \nclose. Our staffs are working very hard to come up with an agreement we \nhope we can do tonight, to set up a series of four to six votes in the \nmorning and then, hopefully, a pathway to completing this legislation.\n  We have other issues. Always we have to do more than one thing at a \ntime. So we will move forward, the Republican leader and I, on filing a \ncouple of cloture motions that we are going to set up for votes either \nFriday or hopefully we can get them done tomorrow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I can make just a couple remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We do have a number of amendments pending, and we are \nworking our way in the direction of getting back to a normal process. I \nshare the majority leader's hope and his view that we will have a \nnumber of votes, hopefully tomorrow, as a result of an agreement we are \nworking on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6753-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TEACHERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS BACK TO WORK ACT OF 2011--MOTION TO \n                                PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

As you know, Mr. President, Hurricane Irene and\n\n[[Page S6754]]\n\nTropical Storm Lee left a trail of devastation all across New York. I \nsaw firsthand the impact that they left on our communities: complete \nhomes ruined, entire streets 7 feet of water, all people's belongings \non their front yard, small businesses basically uncertain as to whether \nthey could rebuild, whether they could rehire employees, crumbling \nbridges, washed-out roads, heating oil soaking into buildings and into \nthe ground, farms with no feed for livestock, crops and livelihoods \nvanishing in a single day.\n  This farm in Middleburgh is just a snapshot of what our farmers are \nfacing. Debris covers the land, most crops washed away. Whatever was \nleft, contaminated. The Van Allers, who own this farm, told me that the \nworst sound they had ever heard was their cows suffering as the water \nrose.\n  This year has been unprecedented disasters striking agricultural \nregions all across the United States, not just in New York. In order to \nhelp these rural agricultural communities rebuild in my State and \nacross the country, I am offering an amendment No. 869 to fund the \nbacklog of State applications for the Emergency Conservation Program \nand the Emergency Watershed Program.\n  I call up this amendment now. This funding will help more than half \nthe States in this Nation with the disasters they have experienced so \nfar this year, from the flooding in the Midwest to the droughts in \nTexas to the devastation that happened all across New York State. This \nis emergency funding that will help our farmers and our businesses \nsurvive. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to reduce the \nbacklog of eligible projects that are needed desperately right now by \nthese families and these farms to rebuild.\n  We wish to bring up amendment No. 869.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act--\n       (1) the amount provided under section 732 for the emergency \n     conservation program for expenses resulting from a major \n     disaster designation pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n     5122(2)) is increased by $48,700,000; and\n       (2) the amount provided under section 732 for the emergency \n     watershed protection program for expenses resulting from a \n     major disaster designation pursuant to the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. \n     5122(2)) is increased by $61,200,000.\n       (b) The additional amounts provided under subsection (a)--\n       (1) are designated by Congress as being for disaster relief \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. \n     901(b)(2)(D));\n       (2) are subject to the same terms and conditions as any \n     other amounts provided under section 732 for the same \n     purposes; and\n       (3) shall remain available until expended.\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I wish to add Senators Leahy, Casey, and Sanders as \ncosponsors to this amendment, along with Senator Schumer and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 2112, the Department of \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2012, as reported.\n  The bill, as considered by the Senate, includes the text of two other \ncommittee-reported appropriations bills: S. 1572, the Departments of \nCommerce, Justice, and Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act \nfor fiscal year 2012; and S. 1596, the Departments of Transportation, \nHousing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act \nfor fiscal year 2012.\n  The bill is divided into three divisions, each representing the \nreported legislative text from a subcommittee. Each division, \ntherefore, will be considered separately for budget enforcement \npurposes.\n  Division A of the bill--Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and related agencies appropriations--provides $1.8 \nbillion in security discretionary budget authority and $18.3 billion in \nnonsecurity discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2012, which \nwill result in new outlays of $14.7 billion. When outlays from prior-\nyear budget authority are taken into account, discretionary outlays for \ndivision A will total $23 billion.\n  Division A of the bill includes a total of $266 million in budget \nauthority designated as being for disaster relief for the Emergency \nConservation Program, the Emergency Forest Restoration Program, and the \nEmergency Watershed Protection Program. Pursuant to section 106(d) of \nthe Budget Control Act, an adjustment to the Appropriations Committee's \n302(a) allocation has been made for this amount in budget authority and \nfor the outlays flowing therefrom.\n  Funding in division A of the bill matches the subcommittee's section \n302(b) allocation for security and nonsecurity budget authority and for \noverall outlays. No budget points of order lie against division A of \nthe bill.\n  Division B of the bill--Commerce, Justice, Science and related \nagencies appropriations--provides $78 million in security discretionary \nbudget authority and $52.8 billion in nonsecurity discretionary budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2012, which will result in new outlays of \n$37.7 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken \ninto account, discretionary outlays for division B will total $63.5 \nbillion.\n  Division B of the bill includes a total of $135 million in budget \nauthority designated as being for disaster relief for the Economic \nDevelopment Administration. Pursuant to section 106(d) of the Budget \nControl Act, an adjustment to the Appropriations Committee's 302(a) \nallocation has been made for this amount in budget authority and for \nthe outlays flowing therefrom.\n  Funding in division B of the bill is $6 million below the \nsubcommittee's section 302(b) allocation for security budget authority \nbut matches the allocation for nonsecurity budget authority and for \noverall outlays. No budget points of order lie against division B of \nthe bill.\n  Division C of the bill--Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and related agencies appropriations--provides $57.6 \nbillion in nonsecurity discretionary budget authority for fiscal year \n2012, which, when combined with transportation obligation limitations \nin the bill, will result in new outlays of $46.4 billion. When outlays \nfrom prior-year budget authority and transportation obligation \nlimitations are taken into account, discretionary outlays for the \ndivision C will total $122.7 billion.\n  Division C of the bill includes a total of $2.3 billion in budget \nauthority designated as being for disaster relief including $1.9 \nbillion for the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief \nProgram and $400 million for the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram. Pursuant to section 106(d) of the Budget Control Act, an \nadjustment to the Appropriations Committee's 302(a) allocation has been \nmade for this amount in budget authority and for the outlays flowing \ntherefrom.\n  Funding in Division C of the bill matches the subcommittee's section \n302(b) allocation for nonsecurity budget authority and is $196 million \nbelow the subcommittee's allocation for overall outlays. No budget \npoints of order lie against division C of the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       H.R. 2112, 2012--AGRICULTURE, COMMERCE-JUSTICE-SCIENCE, AND\n                   TRANSPORTATION-HUD APPROPRIATIONS 1\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Non-\n                                           Security  Security-    Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDivision A: Department of Agriculture,\n and Rural Development, Food and Drug\n Administration, and Related Agencies\n Act, 2012\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority.....................     1,750     18,296    20,046\n\n[[Page S6755]]\n\n \n    Outlays..............................        --         --    23,038\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority.....................     1,750     18,296        --\n    Outlays..............................        --         --    23,038\nDivision A Compared To:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority.....................         0          0        --\n    Outlays..............................        --         --         0\nDivision B: Departments of Commerce and\n Justice, and Science and Related\n Agencies Appropriations Act, 2012\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority.....................        78     52,752    52,830\n    Outlays..............................        --         --    63,517\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority.....................        84     52,752        --\n    Outlays..............................        --         --    63,517\nDivision B Compared To:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority.....................        -6          0        --\n    Outlays..............................        --         --         0\nDivision C: Departments of\n Transportation, Housing and Urban\n Development and Related Agencies\n Appropriations Act, 2012\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority.....................        --     57,550    57,550\n    Outlays..............................        --         --   122,721\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority.....................        --     57,550        --\n    Outlays..............................        --         --   122,917\nDivision C Compared To: Senate 302(b)\n allocation:\n    Budget Authority.....................        --          0        --\n    Outlays..............................        --         --      -196\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 Divisions A, B, and C of Senate amendment 738 to H.R. 2122 include the\n  Senate-reported legislative text of the respective Appropriations\n  bills listed above.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 812\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak on amendment \nnumber 812, which would prohibit the Patent and Trademark Office from \nusing funds to implement Section 37 of the America Invents Act, more \ncommonly known as the ``Medco Fix.''\n  The Medco fix was a bailout for a well-connected law firm--\nWilmerHale--and its malpractice insurer to the tune of $214 million, \nand the essence of special interest legislation that will result in \nincreased costs for the government, hospitals and consumers. I offered \nan amendment to the America Invents Act to strike this special interest \nfix and it was narrowly defeated by a vote of 51 to 47.\n  This saga began in 2001, when WilmerHale apparently missed a routine \ndeadline for submitting to the PTO a patent term extension (PTE) \napplication on behalf of its client Medco. The PTO denied the \napplication, concluding it was not filed in a timely manner. Legal \ndeadlines like this exist for a reason. They provide certainty not only \nto the litigants in a particular matter but also to the public. Every \nday in courts across America where a deadline is missed the result is \nthe same. Claim is dismissed the remedy available to the harmed party \nis a malpractice claim against the offending attorney.\n  Yet, in the 10 years since WilmerHale's malpractice, Medco never sued \nthe law firm. Instead, in February 2011, the parties agreed to a \nsettlement whereby the firm would pay Medco $214 million, of which $99 \nmillion will be paid by the firm's malpractice insurer.\n\n  WilmerHale also immediately paid $18 million up front to cover \nMedco's litigation and lobbying expenses over the past decade. The \nsettlement was tied to their success in getting either the PTO or \nCongress to grant an extension of Medco's patent term before June 2015, \nwhen the extension period overturning the PTO decision would otherwise \nexpire.\n  Both the company and its law firm have spent millions of dollars and \nmany years lobbying Congress to change the rules and to politically fix \ntheir legal mistake. Unfortunately--in my view--they succeeded.\n  One of the many reasons I oppose this special interest fix is because \nI believe it is unnecessary, unwise and dangerous for Congress to \ninterfere with ongoing litigation, which is what happened here. It goes \nagainst historical precedent and sound policy for Congress to directly \ninterfere with active judicial proceedings on behalf of one party over \nanother. Here, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nVirginia had already ordered the PTO to ``consider'' \nMedco's application timely filed and adopt an interpretation of the \nword ``date'' in the statute that includes a ``next business day'' \nconstruction rather than ``calendar day'' as the PTO argued. Although \nthe PTO did not appeal the decision, a generic company, APP \nPharmaceuticals, intervened in the case with an appeal to the Federal \nCircuit Court of Appeals. At the time that Congress was considering the \nAmerica Invents Act, oral arguments before the appeals court already \nhad been scheduled for just a few weeks later. The court had not even \nhad the chance to hear arguments when some of my colleagues were \narguing that the Medco fix merely enshrined in statute the holdings of \nthe courts.\n\n  However, it is my understanding that APP--the intervening party--\npointed out to the appeals court that even if the Medco fix applied to \nthis appeal, according to the language of the America Invents Act, it \nwould not take effect for one year from the date of enactment. Indeed, \nthe America Invents Act provides that, unless otherwise specified, all \nprovisions are to take effect one year after the date of enactment and \nno special effective date is provided for the Medco fix. Should we now \nexpect them to come to Congress for a fix for lobbying malpractice?\n\n  Given this, the Federal Circuit postponed oral argument, ordered the \nparties to file briefs regarding the impact of the effective date, and \nthen rescheduled the argument for November 15th. I would point out to \nmy colleagues who so forcefully insisted on this fix that the Federal \nCircuit's actions demonstrate that this is by no means merely \ntechnical. The court is reviewing this very question of law, both for \neffectiveness and to determine whether Congress has the power to revive \na patent once it has expired and entered the public domain.\n  As I have said many times before, this body should not be intruding \non the jurisdiction of the judicial branch. Today, I am offering an \namendment to right this wrong and to allow the Federal Circuit, without \ninterruption, to fulfill its constitutional role in deciding a pure \nquestion of law.\n  Mr. President, there is no unanimous consent, I know, to bring up \namendment No. 812, which I have submitted. It is a very important \namendment. It is something I will insist on through every appropriate \npower an individual Senator has to get an amendment to be voted on. \nHopefully it will be coming up tomorrow or the next day. Let me again \nsummarize it briefly.\n  Amendment 812 would prohibit the Patent and Trademark Office from \nusing funds to implement section 37 of the America Invents Act, more \ncommonly known as the Medco fix. When the patent bill moved through the \nSenate and the House--that took a decade--efforts were made to reverse \na decision by the Patent and Trademark Office that had declared a major \nBoston law firm had failed to file a document in time to preserve a \npatent for their client Medco and, as a result of that, Medco was to \nlose its patent sooner than otherwise would be the case. Generic \nmanufacturers would be able to manufacture the drug and it was asserted \nthat it would cost $214 million as a result of this error.\n  If a doctor makes an error, the doctor gets sued for malpractice. If \nlawyers make errors, they get sued for malpractice. They have \nmalpractice insurance. Apparently they had some insurance.\n  At any rate, it appears millions of dollars, or hundreds of millions \nof dollars, were set aside for lobbying and other efforts to \npolitically reverse the patent office during a time while the matter \nwas litigated in court. When the patent bill came up a few months ago \nit was contended that this is the only vehicle to fix this problem and \nwe needed to fix it. The House voted not to put it in their bill. Then \nsomehow a new vote was obtained, and by the narrowest of margins the \nHouse put it in and it came to the Senate.\n  I had been objecting for a decade, and I objected and others \nobjected, and we had a vote and by the margin of 51 to 47 it was \ndecided not to amend the patent bill that the House had passed and to \npass it just as the House did, although many people told me they agreed \nwith me that this Medco fix intervening in ongoing litigation should \nnot occur, but changing the patent bill would send it back to the House \nand endanger the passage of the bill.\n  I was disappointed then. But what we discovered is that the \nlitigation continues. It is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals. The \nCourt of Appeals is taking arguments on a number of issues that relate \nto this. It is a very real problem. It is a matter that ought\n\n[[Page S6756]]\n\nto be decided by the courts, not politicians. If some special relief \nact is to be utilized--and sometimes those can be--it can't be utilized \nwhile a party still has litigation ongoing. Only after the litigation \nis exhausted can someone appeal for a special relief act. In essence, \nthat is what Medco is asking for.\n  I do not think it is right. I practiced law for a long time. I know \nhow the system works. I know at this fine law firm in Boston, every day \nthe first thing they look at when somebody sues one of their clients \nis: Did the person file a lawsuit too late? If they did, they will \ndismiss it. Every judge who sees a motion to dismiss for lack of timely \nfiling objectively looks at it. If it is 1 day, 1 hour, 1 minute late, \nyou are out. That is the rule of law in America. It doesn't make any \ndifference if you are the widow lady or if you are the head of some \ncompany or if you are a big drug company or a big law firm. That is \njustice in America.\n  I do not think this is a good thing for us to do. Now that we have \nthis legislation before us, it is germane and appropriate, because it \nhas patent language in it, for us to fix this decision we sort of got \nforced into making and to have a vote on it as part of this bill. What \nwe know is that the language of the patent act that we passed, the \nAmerica Invents Act, would not take effect for 1 year from the date of \nenactment. During that time the litigation continues. Congress ought \nnot intervene. Congress ought to let the courts decide. Then if the \nonly remedy in Congress would be to file for a special relief act, \nCongress could consider it or not based on the circumstances of the \ncase.\n  I do believe it is a very important issue. I truly believe Congress \nis unwise, very unwise, to begin to step into ongoing litigation \ninvolving highly competent parties with large amounts of money and \nstart taking sides in that litigation. I believe it would be wrong.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Nomination of Heather Higginbottom\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, time has been set aside for the Heather \nHigginbottom nomination. I hadn't intended to speak tonight, but it has \nbeen suggested that we might get started on that to provide more time \ntomorrow for other business in the Senate. So I will share my remarks \ntonight for the record, and hopefully we can have more of a good \ndiscussion tomorrow.\n  The Constitution makes it very clear that it is the President who \nnominates. Confirmation does not occur, however, without the consent of \nthe Senate. In Federalist No. 76, Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n       To what purpose then require the cooperation of the Senate? \n     I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have \n     a powerful, though, in general, silent operation. It would be \n     an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the \n     President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment \n     of unfit characters from State prejudice, from family \n     connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to \n     popularity.\n\n  In other words, the Senate does have a duty to evaluate the \nPresident's nominees.\n  Unfortunately, the situation we face today with the nomination of \nHeather Higginbottom to be the Deputy Director for the Office of \nManagement and Budget is one of those cases. I do not know her \npersonally, but let me state from the outset that I have no questions \nabout her character. She has many admirers. Senator Kerry, for whom she \nworked, is an admirer, and I respect that. The President certainly \nseeks her appointment and has asked me to try to see that the \nappointment moves along. I respect his desire to have an up-or-down \nvote and have agreed that we would have this vote and have so agreed \nfor some time. But my concern is with the nominee's budgetary \nexperience. It is the lack of experience that causes me to voice my \nopposition.\n  Let me first mention that the Office of Management and Budget has the \nprimary responsibility to assist the President in overseeing the \npreparation of the Federal budget. This is a huge responsibility. In \nhelping the President formulate his spending plan, OMB must evaluate \nthe effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures, assess \ncompeting funding demands among all of these agencies, and set the \npriorities and help the President.\n  OMB is not in charge--the President is--but in reality OMB is the \nagency that raises the concerns with overspending with the various \nFederal agencies. They submit their requests, and then the OMB says yea \nor nay. It is a very serious matter because very important people are \nasking for money. Sometimes you just have to say no to very prominent \nCabinet people. The Cabinet people can appeal to the President, but \nthey don't do it often. They recognize that OMB is the place where most \nof these matters have to be decided. OMB speaks on behalf of the \nPresident.\n  Ms. Higginbottom's experience points to someone who has been on the \nwrong side, however, of fiscal restraint. Instead of crafting policies \nto decrease spending, she has been focused on new programs to increase \nspending.\n  In her Budget Committee questionnaire, she was asked about her \nqualifications for the job. She cited her legislative and political \nexperience. I believe she worked in a Presidential campaign at one \npoint but cited no direct budgetary knowledge and provided no examples \nof developing a budget.\n  In one prehearing question, I asked Ms. Higginbottom:\n\n       Your background is in education and public policy. Outside \n     of your legislative and political experience, have you \n     acquired any budget training, including classes or continuing \n     education?\n\n  She responded with one sentence:\n\n       I have not taken any formal continuing education classes on \n     the budget.\n\n  I asked her whether she was the primary budget staffer during her \ntenure in the Senate. She essentially gave a nonanswer to that. It \ndoesn't appear that she was deeply involved as a general office Senate \nstaffer in budgetary matters, not the primary staffer and not a staffer \nwhose Senator served on the Budget Committee.\n  In another prehearing question, she was asked whether, as a nation, \nwe needed to focus on deficit reduction rather than new spending. She \nresponded by deferring to the President's fiscal year 2012 budget, \nstating that it ``begins the challenging but essential process of \nadjusting spending to achieve fiscal sustainability immediately with a \n5-year freeze of nonsecurity discretionary spending.'' Now, this is the \nsame budget that adds to the debt every single year and has substantial \ndeficits every single year.\n  During her confirmation hearing before the Budget Committee, on which \nI was the ranking Republican, she continued to use President Obama's \nincorrect formulations. I use that phrase kindly. She testified that \nPresident Obama's fiscal year 2012 budget--the one he submitted in \nJanuary--would pay down the debt and ``puts us on a path to stabilize \nour debt.'' But this is the same budget proposal that, by OMB's own \nestimate, has a deficit of approximately $800 billion in year 10 of the \n10-year budget, and not a single deficit in the 10 years of this budget \nthat was submitted to us falls below $600 billion. I would just note \nthat, for example, $600 billion is larger than any deficit President \nBush ever had. So in the 10 years, the lowest budget deficit projected \nby President Obama's own Office of Management and Budget is $600 \nbillion--the lowest.\n  Surely a more experienced, skilled, and serious nominee, one who is \nacquainted with the great debt threat we have in America, would \nrecognize that these deficits are irresponsible, and one can't say we \nare living within our means or we are on a path to stabilize our debt.\n  You cannot say that. Even Treasury Secretary Geithner, when he \ntestified before the Budget Committee, said the President's budget \nwould be ``unsustainable'' if Congress passed it as written.\n  But the Senate Budget Committee was not the only forum in which Ms. \nHigginbottom was given an opportunity to highlight her experience. She \nhad a hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. They asked about her qualifications also, which they \nindicated were lacking.\n  Senator Collins said in her opening statement:\n\n       The nominee's background, while impressive in many \n     respects, does not include a\n\n[[Page S6757]]\n\n     great deal of experience in budget process or financial \n     analysis.\n\n  Senator Scott Brown used his first question to deal with her \nexperience. He said:\n\n       I notice from your resume you have some great political \n     experience and some really good policy experience. I was \n     wondering if you'd share with the committee, you know, what \n     type of accounting and budgetary experience you have.\n\n  Well, she first attempted to avoid the question, talking about her \ngeneral legislative and policy experience. Senator Brown interrupted \nher and got to the heart of the matter:\n\n       So I guess my original question is, what type of budgetary \n     and accounting experience do you have?\n\n  Ms. Higginbottom responded that she was not an accountant and that \nher goal was to implement the President's policy agenda through the \nbudgetary process. I would note that the President's policy agenda \nseems to be primarily to continue extraordinary new and expanded \n``investments''--spending--in many, many areas of our government.\n  After opportunities to prove she was qualified through prehearing \nquestions and through testimony at two confirmation hearings, she was \nreported out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and the Budget Committee on a party-line vote. Our Democratic \ncolleagues in both committees voted her out with the majorities they \nhad. Because of her lack of experience, not one Republican voted for \nher.\n  So now a number of my colleagues have argued that the criticism is \nbased not on a lack of experience but on her age, that somehow she is \nbeing unfairly treated because of that. She is young--young for this \njob--but the age allegation is not correct.\n  After her confirmation hearing in the Budget hearing, I sent her a \nfollowup question:\n\n       Some of my Democratic colleagues, during your confirmation \n     hearing before the Budget Committee, indicated that when some \n     of us questioned your experience, that we were using \n     ``experience'' as a code word for age. The experience I am \n     concerned about is actual budget experience. In a prehearing \n     question, I asked you the following:\n       ``Your background is in education and public policy. . . . \n     have you acquired any budget training, including classes or \n     continuing education?''\n       You responded in this way:\n       ``I have not taken any formal continuing education classes \n     on the budget.''\n\n  I asked if these facts had changed, and she basically said no. She \nsaid:\n\n       ``For over a decade, I have worked at the highest levels of \n     policymaking in the United States Senate and the White House. \n     This work has included, but was not limited to, the budgetary \n     implications of those policies.''\n\n  Not budget but policy issues and budgetary implications of those \npolicies.\n  So the answer to the question I asked is no, clearly. She simply does \nnot have the kind of serious budgetary experience to be the Deputy \nDirector at an office that manages a government that is spending $3,700 \nbillion this year and taking in about $2.3 trillion--borrowing 40 cents \nof every $1 we spend.\n  This is a most august position, and it requires a person who can have \nthe confidence and judgment to say no to people who always want to \nspend more.\n  Arguably, she would be the least qualified Deputy Director in \ndecades. The last two nominees in this position had a combined 21 years \nof budget and finance experience. For example, Rob Nabors, the most \nrecent nominee before her, served 8 years on the House Appropriations \nCommittee and 6 years at the Office of Management and Budget. Steve \nMcMillin, the nominee before him, served 3 years on the Senate Banking \nCommittee and 4 years at the Office of Management and Budget. You learn \nsomething operating out of the Office of Management and Budget. That \nprepares you to have a leadership role there. Combined, Ms. \nHigginbottom does not have 1 year of budget or finance experience. Over \nthe last 20 years, nominees for this position have had an average of \n6.5 years of experience. Well, in certain circumstances, in certain \ntimes, maybe less experience is OK. But at a time when this Nation has \nnever faced a more serious debt threat, we need real, august, serious \nleadership.\n  Mr. Erskine Bowles, who cochaired President Obama's fiscal \ncommission, which issued a most serious report to us, warned that if \nthe United States fails to take significant action on debt reduction, \nthe country would face ``the most predictable economic crisis in its \nhistory.''\n  We are borrowing 40 cents of every $1 we spend. Our Nation's gross \ndebt is larger than our entire economy. The last thing we need now is \nsomeone who does not have the gravitas to say no to those who always \ntend to want to spend more. That is just one of the jobs OMB has--to \nsay no.\n  When the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Energy comes \nbefore the department, asking for approval of their budget which calls \nfor more spending, a responsible OMB Director or his Deputy must be \nable to say no. Looking at President Obama's fiscal year 2012 budget, I \nam sorry to say this duty has not been met by Mr. Lew, the Director. \nAnd I cannot see he is going to get much strength and support for doing \nthe right thing from this nominee.\n  I supported Director Lew, but I have been disappointed in his \nleadership. When the President submitted his budget to Congress, \nDirector Lew came before the Budget Committee and made some of the most \nindefensible claims I have heard in public life. He did. Director Lew \nsaid the President's budget would allow us to live within our means, \nbegin to pay down our debts, and spend only money we are taking in each \nyear. Not one of those claims was true. Multiple fact-check \norganizations checked them and found them to be false. Even by OMB's \nown reckoning, the deficit would never be smaller than $600 billion at \nany point in the 10-year budget window. We would not be paying down our \ndebt. We are not going to be spending only money we are taking in each \nyear under the President's budget.\n\n  What would happen to a CEO of a corporation if they told potential \ninvestors: Well, we are living within our means. We will begin to pay \ndown our debt. We are going to only spend money we are taking in each \nyear. Invest in our company. And people invested in the company, and \nthey found out that there was no budget plan in place that showed \nanything less than huge deficits for the entire next decade and that \nthe company was borrowing 40 cents of every $1 that it was spending? \nWhat would happen then? I am telling you, he would be sued, if not \nprosecuted for fraud.\n  So this is the kind of leadership we have. I am not happy with it. \nThe American people should not be happy with it. They came in to spend, \nnot look the American people in the eye and tell them of the grave \nfinancial crisis we are facing in America.\n  Erskine Bowles, heading the commission appointed by President Obama, \ntold us. He told us we are on an unsustainable path. It threatens our \neconomic future; that we are facing the most predictable financial \ncrisis in our history. When asked when that crisis might occur, when \nmight we have economic damage arising from our debt, he said 2 years, \nmaybe a little less, maybe a little more. Alan Simpson, his Cochairman, \nsaid: I think it could be less--less than 1 year.\n  This is not a game we are playing here. We do not need government \nofficials spinning that we are living within our means and paying down \nour debt. We are running up debt in a fashion never, ever, ever before \ndone in this Nation. It is unsustainable, and it is so dangerous \nbecause it is systemic, and it is hard to get off this trend. It is \ndemographics. It is a lot of different reasons. But it is very serious, \nand we need leaders in OMB who are watching every single dime that is \nbeing spent, looking for every effort and place that savings can be \neffected. That is what we need, and I just do not feel as though this \nnominee fits that bill. She is a good person. She is, apparently, a \ngood staffer, has a lot of friends. But the position of Deputy Director \nof OMB is a grave position. It has august responsibilities. It requires \na most serious person who is willing to take strong stands and say no \nto people who, all too often, want to spend more and more.\n  When asked about our financial situation, in one of her answers she \nmade reference to the first stimulus bill, the Recovery Act, so-called. \nThis is what the nominee said:\n  Fortunately, Recovery Act spending has been extraordinarily \ntransparent,\n\n[[Page S6758]]\n\nenabling the public to assess the job impacts of the various programs \nfunded. Overall, the data demonstrate that the Recovery Act has \ndelivered as promised by creating and saving millions of jobs across \nthe country, and has been an essential factor in rescuing the American \neconomy.\n  Well, I know the nominee is a friend and ally of the President, and I \nam willing to give her a vote, and I suppose she will be confirmed. But \nI just want to say that I think that is a bit of a Pollyannaish \ndescription of the success of the stimulus bill. It just did not meet \nthose standards, and I do feel as though she has been less than \nrigorous in her understanding of these difficult financial issues that \nour Nation faces. So I encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing \nthe nomination.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

LINDNER JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to mourn the passing of a great \nAmerican and a man who did much to benefit the people of Kentucky as \nwell as his native Ohioans, Mr. Carl Henry Lindner Jr. Carl Lindner was \ngreater Cincinnati's most successful entrepreneur and a self-made \nbillionaire. He passed away this October 17. He was 92 years old.\n  Carl Lindner was born in Dayton, OH, in 1919, the son of a dairyman. \nHe quit high school to help out in his father's dairy store. That store \ngrew into United Dairy Farmers, a chain of dairy and convenience stores \nthat many northern Kentuckians frequent to this day to buy their famous \nice cream.\n  Mr. Lindner made much of his fortune in the banking and insurance \nbusiness. His name became famous across northern Kentucky and Ohio and \nnationwide as the owner of the Cincinnati Reds from 1999 to 2005, when \nhe also served as that organization's CEO. Carl Lindner also in the \npast bought and sold Kings Island amusement park, Provident Bank, and \nthe Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper.\n  Always the optimist, Carl was famous for carrying with him cards that \nhe would hand out to anyone he met, with motivational sayings printed \non them. One frequent version of this card would read, ``Only in \nAmerica! Gee, am I lucky!''\n  Carl put his great wealth to use benefitting his community, bringing \nthousands of high-paying jobs to Cincinnati and northern Kentucky. He \nhas been called a ``one-man chamber of commerce.''\n  He also generously gave millions of dollars a year to various \ncharitable causes, including, but certainly not limited to, the Lindner \nCenter of HOPE behavioral health center, the University of Cincinnati \nCollege of Law, the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal, the \nCincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati Reds, the Western & \nSouthern Open, Fort Washington Way, the Bond Hill/Roselawn library, the \nWest End YMCA, and the necklace lights on the cables of the Roebling \nSuspension Bridge.\n  I had the benefit of knowing Carl quite well. He was an amazing man, \nand his loss will be deeply felt by many. Elaine and I send our \ncondolences to his wife Edyth, his sons Carl III, Craig, and Keith, his \n12 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren, and many other beloved \nfamily members and friends.\n  The passing of Mr. Carl Henry Lindner Jr. is a true loss for the \npeople of northern Kentucky, Ohio, and the Nation. I know my Senate \ncolleagues join me in remembering and honoring Carl for his very \nAmerican success story, his service to his community, and the example \nhe leaves behind for others of a full life well lived.\n\n[[Page S6759]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Cincinnati Enquirer published recently an obituary \nfor Mr. Carl Lindner. I ask unanimous consent that said article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Cincinnati Enquirer, Oct. 18, 2011]\n\n                     Carl Henry Lindner: 1919-2011\n\n Billionaire Investor, Dead at 92, Was Cincinnati's Biggest Benefactor\n\n                            (By Cliff Peale)\n\n       From humble beginnings running his father's dairy store in \n     Norwood, Carl Henry Lindner Jr. grew into a billionaire, a \n     friend of U.S. presidents and Greater Cincinnati's most \n     successful entrepreneur.\n       For nearly a century until he died late Monday at age 92, \n     the former Reds owner never shed the fierce competitiveness \n     and loyalty that made him a hometown icon.\n       His influence ran to every corner of Greater Cincinnati. \n     The high-school dropout bought and sold Kings Island, the \n     Reds, Provident Bank and the Enquirer. His name is on \n     buildings from the University of Cincinnati's business school \n     to the tennis center at Lunken Playfield.\n       But it was the banking and insurance business that made him \n     a billionaire. At his death, his American Financial Group \n     Inc. controlled assets of nearly $32 billion and he was \n     routinely listed as one of the richest men in America.\n       Ever the optimist, Lindner often carried an inch-thick \n     stack of cards with motivational sayings--one was ``Only in \n     America! Gee, am I lucky!''--that he handed out to anyone he \n     would meet.\n       He was a teetotaler, physically unimposing yet with a \n     prominent shock of white hair and a penchant for wearing \n     flashy neckties.\n       Even to his closest friends and colleagues, he was soft-\n     spoken and rarely confrontational. Yet some business partners \n     complained about unfair treatment and he flashed a harsh \n     temper when confronting reporters who wrote what he perceived \n     as unfriendly stories or criticism of his business dealings.\n       A devout Baptist and a longtime member of Kenwood Baptist \n     Church, Lindner used his wealth and influence behind the \n     scenes to become Greater Cincinnati's largest benefactor and \n     economic development force. At the height of his personal \n     giving he contributed millions of dollars a year to \n     charitable causes, and brought thousands of high-paying jobs \n     to downtown Cincinnati.\n       His companies brought thousands of employees to the region, \n     and the annual Christmas party that he threw at Music Hall \n     attracted some of the nation's biggest acts, including Bill \n     Cosby and Frank Sinatra.\n\n\n                      Considered himself outsider\n\n       At the same time, Lindner thought of himself as an \n     outsider, building his business career outside of \n     Cincinnati's old-money elite. He was never a member of many \n     of the most exclusive business and country clubs and his bar-\n     the-doors business style, starting with a hostile takeover of \n     Provident Bank in the mid-1960s, was out of place in always \n     polite Cincinnati.\n       Perhaps the most public role of his career was his \n     ownership of the Cincinnati Reds from 1999 to 2005. Lindner \n     owned a minority stake both before and after that period but \n     was the Reds' CEO for six seasons, and each of those years \n     the team lost more games than it won.\n       He approved the trade for Ken Griffey Jr. in 2000, even \n     sending his private jet to bring Griffey to Cincinnati and \n     then personally driving the hometown star back to Cinergy \n     Field from Lunken Airport in his Rolls-Royce.\n       But as the Reds' losses mounted, Lindner never spoke \n     publicly to fans and privately bristled at talk-radio \n     criticism.\n       That period ended in late 2005 when Lindner sold a \n     controlling stake in the Reds to a group headed by Bob \n     Castellini.\n       Shy and scornful of reporters, Lindner nevertheless became \n     a focus of media attention because of his substantial wealth \n     and his far-flung business dealings.\n       The controversies included millions of dollars in political \n     contributions as his Chiquita Brands International Inc. was \n     waging a trade war with European countries, a bevy of \n     lawsuits and federal charges over business deals that \n     benefited Lindner and his company more than other \n     shareholders, and a high-profile battle with the Enquirer in \n     1998 over a series of critical stories on Chiquita.\n       Lindner built a national reputation in the 1980s as a high-\n     risk trader, becoming a business partner of symbols of the \n     decade's excess such as junk-bond king Michael Milken and \n     Cincinnati's own Charles Keating.\n       He was the classic ``value investor,'' buying properties \n     few other investors wanted and waiting years, or even \n     decades, to reap the benefits.\n       That gave him a portfolio including the old Penn Central \n     railroad, Circle K convenience stores and New York City \n     landmark Grand Central Station.\n       But Lindner spent the two decades before his death shedding \n     assets that didn't deal with insurance and transferring \n     others to his three sons. That left American Financial as \n     mostly an insurance and financial services company.\n       He lost his stake in Chiquita in 2002 when that company \n     emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2004, Lindner, his \n     family and American Financial reaped nearly $1 billion in \n     stock when they sold Cincinnati's Provident Financial Group \n     Inc. to Cleveland-based National City Corp.\n       The moves consolidated the business around safer insurance \n     businesses. Lindner also transferred tens of millions of \n     dollars to his three sons and their families, solidifying for \n     generations a wealth that he never enjoyed growing up.\n\n\n                         Starting from scratch\n\n       Born April 22, 1919, in Dayton, Ohio, Carl Henry Lindner \n     Jr. was the firstborn of a modest dairyman and his wife, \n     Clara.\n       Lindner quit high school to help in his father's Norwood \n     dairy store. Along with his father, he and his brothers \n     Robert and Richard, and sister Dorothy, built it into United \n     Dairy Farmers, a chain of dairy and convenience stores.\n       When the family founded what now is UDF on Montgomery Road \n     in Norwood in 1940, the first day's sales amounted to $8.28.\n       Lindner often talked about the modest surroundings of his \n     childhood, noting more than once that he picked up dates in \n     an ice-cream truck.\n       Robert Lindner's family eventually took control of UDF, and \n     Richard Lindner became sole owner of the Thriftway \n     supermarket chain before selling it to Winn-Dixie Stores.\n       Lindner married the former Ruth Wiggeringloh of Norwood in \n     1942. They divorced seven years later with no children. He \n     then married the former Edyth Bailey in 1951, and they have \n     three sons who all went into the family business: Carl III, \n     Craig and Keith.\n       Lindner cautiously entered the savings-and-loan and \n     insurance business, founding his flagship company American \n     Financial Corp. in 1959. In the early 1970s the company \n     gained control of Great American Insurance, which would \n     become its chief operating business.\n       Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the company bought and sold \n     companies in a variety of industries. Lindner took the \n     company private in 1981 and released little financial \n     information to the public, but in 1995 the company sold stock \n     to public shareholders under the new umbrella of American \n     Financial Group Inc.\n       In 2003, Keith Lindner left American Financial to \n     concentrate on the family's charitable pursuits. In 2004 Carl \n     and Craig Lindner were named co-CEOs of the company while \n     Carl Lindner Jr. remained chairman.\n       Lindner was a conservative icon, lobbying against Robert \n     Mapplethorpe's 1990 exhibit at the Contemporary Arts Center \n     here and funding the Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy.\n       But he was pragmatic as well, contributing more than $1 \n     million to Democratic President Bill Clinton during Chiquita \n     Brands' battle over European banana quotas. He was well known \n     as one of the biggest givers in the country to both political \n     parties.\n\n\n                             The good life\n\n       Lindner developed a taste for the good life, including a \n     sprawling home in Indian Hill and nearly a dozen Rolls-Royce \n     automobiles--with the trademark ``CHL'' license plate--that \n     he drove himself well into his 80s.\n       He also owned a home in the exclusive Ocean Reef community \n     of North Key Largo, Fla. There, he entertained lavishly, \n     including hosting former President George Bush in the early \n     1990s.\n       Lindner traveled around the country in his own private jet. \n     He dined often at exclusive restaurants like the Maisonette \n     or the Waterfront--where he was an investor --and also became \n     a regular at Trio in Kenwood.\n       Lindner received nearly every award Cincinnati has to \n     offer, including induction into Junior Achievement's Greater \n     Cincinnati Business Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Great Living \n     Cincinnatian award in 1994.\n       He was also on the board of directors of Citizens for \n     Decency through Law, an anti-pornography group headed by \n     American Financial co-founder and one-time Executive Vice \n     President Charles Keating.\n       Among numerous awards and honors throughout his career, \n     Lindner was named Man of the Year of the United Jewish Appeal \n     in 1978 and received the Friars Club Centennial Award in \n     1985. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by UC in 1985 and \n     by Xavier University in 1991.\n\n\n                       Services not scheduled yet\n\n       Lindner's family has not yet scheduled memorial or funeral \n     services.\n       American Financial Group, where Lindner was chairman, said \n     Tuesday that the family had requested memorial gifts be made \n     to Kenwood Baptist Church.\n       Lindner is survived by wife Edyth, sons Carl III, Craig and \n     Keith, 12 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6759-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6759-S6760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR.

Dr. Roberts is the Mahurin Professor of Gifted Studies at \nWestern Kentucky University and the executive director of the Center \nfor Gifted Studies, a leading Kentucky institution devoted to providing \nopportunities to gifted students for over 30 years.\n\n[[Page S6760]]\n\n  Dr. Roberts's stature in her field was recognized recently when she \nwas presented with the Acorn Award by the Kentucky Council on \nPostsecondary Education. She is the only professor this year from a 4-\nyear institution to be so honored.\n  Dr. Roberts has been recognized for her excellence before. In 2001, \nshe received the very first David W. Belin Advocacy Award from the \nNational Association for Gifted Children. She was named as one of the \n55 most influential people in the field of gifted education by Profiles \nof Influence in Gifted Education in 2004.\n  In addition to her work at WKU and with the Center for Gifted \nStudies, Dr. Roberts was the driving force behind the creation of the \nCarol Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky, an \noutstanding school that provides the opportunity for gifted students \nfrom across the State to spend their junior and senior years at WKU \ntaking college-level courses. Newsweek magazine recently named the \nGatton Academy one of America's top five high schools.\n  Thousands of Kentucky's brightest, most promising students have come \ncloser to realizing their full potential thanks to the guidance and \ndirection of Dr. Roberts. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of \nthem and can truly say they are among the finest Kentucky has to offer.\n  I want to offer her my sincerest congratulations on the well-deserved \nhonor of winning the Acorn Award. It is only the most recent \naffirmation of the great contribution she has made to the Commonwealth, \nher students, and the field of education. I am sure her husband, Dr. \nRichard Roberts, and their children and grandchildren and extended \nfamily are very proud of her and all she has achieved.\n  The Bowling Green Daily News recently published an article \nrecognizing Dr. Julia L.

Mr. President, with nearly 17.7 million acres of \nforest, my home State of Maine has the key distinction of being the \nmost heavily forested State in this great country. Trees from these \nplentiful forests are converted into some of the finest hardwood \nflooring and custom wood products in the world. Today I wish to \nrecognize Maine Wood Concepts, a small business that utilizes Maine's \nbountiful resources to create quality wooden products and which \nrecently celebrated its 40th anniversary.\n  Maine Wood Concepts, located in the western Maine town of New \nVineyard, specializes in turning, finishing, and manufacturing a \nvariety of custom wood products, all designed to the highest standards. \nWith an outstanding array of products including folding rules, file \ncleaners, drumsticks, pepper mills, industrial pieces, file handles, \nand even wooden nickels, this small business certainly lives up to its \nmotto of ``turning wood into what you need.'' As one of the last wood \nturning companies in the country, the firm's endurance can be \nattributed to its elite craftsmanship and superior quality products.\n  Forty years ago Wayne Fletcher and Earl E. Fletcher purchased the \npreviously closed Percy Webber Wood Turning Mill and opened the Maine \nWood Turning Mill. Now run by the second generation of the Fletcher \nfamily and known as Maine Wood Concepts, this small business has \nexpanded to include Maine Wood Turning, American Pride Company, and the \nLutz File and Tool Company. From humble beginnings of producing wooden \ntoy parts and simple wood products, the firm now employs approximately \n80 individuals and makes several complex wooden products.\n  Maine Wood Concepts also seeks to ensure that Maine's abundant forest \nis cared for through responsible production and consumption of forest \nproducts. As a certified member of the Forest Stewardship Council, \nMaine Wood Concepts has met strict standards for promoting forest \nconservation through its chain of product distribution.\n  Over the past 40 years, Maine Woods Concepts has continually expanded \nand created quality jobs for Maine residents. Their ingenuity and \ngrowth throughout the years is a tribute to the strong work ethic found \nin every corner of Maine. I am proud to extend my congratulations to \neveryone at Maine Wood Concepts on the occasion of the company's 40th \nanniversary and offer my best wishes for their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6761-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6761-S6762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO OREM MAYOR JERRY C. WASHBURN\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the \npassing last month of Orem Mayor Jerry C. Washburn, one of Utah's \nfinest public servants and a man who was beloved by those who had the \npleasure of knowing and serving with him.\n  Mayor Washburn passed away September 26, 2011, after a long and \ncourageous battle with cancer. Of Utah's many great public servants, it \nis difficult to find one finer than Jerry. His legacy of compassionate \ncare and service to others will endure forever in the heads and hearts \nof his family, friends, and many constituents and admirers.\n  Jerry Washburn lived in his city of Orem for over half a century and \nserved as its mayor for 11 years. He was elected to four terms and was \nthe longest serving mayor in Orem's history. The reason for his \npolitical success is the same as it was for his success in all his \nendeavors. He was unfailingly kind and friendly to everyone he met, and \nhe had a wonderful ability to put people at ease. He listened \nrespectfully to all opinions and appreciated a thoughtful exchange of \nideas. Mayor Washburn also was a natural leader, and he was highly \nrespected by national, State, and local officials. He had an excellent \nrelationship with the Orem City Council and city staff.\n  During his time in office, Mayor Washburn presided over Orem with a \nsteady hand and a gentle touch. He continually worked to build others \nand to strengthen the community by supporting a diverse array of \nprojects and programs. His focus as mayor was preserving and enhancing \nthe quality of life in Orem. In this endeavor, he helped keep Orem as \none of the safest cities in America and ensured that it remained \n``Family City USA.'' Mayor Washburn also worked hard to support Orem's \nmany businesses and a strong economic base.\n  But Jerry Washburn's service and influence were not limited to Orem. \nHe enjoyed his association with other leaders and organizations. He \nserved as chairman of the Utah County Transportation Planning \nOrganization and as chairman of the Utah County Board of Health. The \nmayor also was a founding board member of the Utah Lake Commission, \nserved as president of the Orem Chamber of Commerce, and was a founding \nmember of the Commission for Economic Development in Orem. He was also \na successful businessman, owning a car dealership in Orem and serving \non the regional board of a Utah bank and as director of a local credit \nunion. He was accomplished both politically and professionally.\n  Jerry Washburn's motive for serving was simple. He wanted to help \nothers and the community and State that he\n\n[[Page S6762]]\n\nso dearly loved. His credo was: ``If not me, who? If not now, when?'' \nHe never sought rewards or recognition, but his service was so stellar \nthat it did not go unrecognized. In fact, he received the Boy Scouts \nSilver Beaver Award, the Arthur V. Watkins Outstanding Citizen Award, \nand the Brigham Young University Emeriti Alumni Award.\n  Jerry Washburn was also an active member of the Church and Jesus \nChrist of Latter-day Saints. Demonstrating his faith and commitment to \nGod, he served his fellow church members--without financial \nremuneration--in a variety of leadership positions. His was a life \nbased on an abiding love of his family, his church, and his fellow man. \nPerhaps that is why in the political arena--known more for discord than \nharmony--Jerry Washburn had few, if any, enemies and so many friends. \nHe loved and respected people, and they loved and respected him in \nreturn.\n  In one of his last discussions with trusted colleague and confidant, \nOrem City Manager Bruce Chesnut, Mayor Washburn said, ``No matter what \nhappens, I'm ready.'' Well, Mr. Mayor, the City of Orem, the State of \nUtah, and the Nation were not ready to see you go.\n  Our thoughts and prayers at this time are with his cherished family, \nincluding his wife, Betty, his 6 children and 19 grandchildren.\n  Mayor Jerry Washburn will be greatly missed, but his legacy will live \non through his wife, children, grandchildren, beloved community, and in \nthe countless lives he has blessed and touched during his remarkable \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6762-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SISTERS OF CHARITY\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in 1737, Marguerite D'Youville, a \nyoung widow and mother of three, founded the Sister of Charity in \nQuebec, Canada. Despite her own misfortune and poverty, she devoted her \nlife to caring for those less fortunate--the poor, the sick, and the \norphaned.\n  Since that time, the Grey Nuns, as the sisters are known, have \nexpanded their work of compassion throughout Canada, the United States, \nSouth America, and the Caribbean with schools, hospitals, and \norphanages. St. Marguerite D'Youville, whom Pope John XXIII called the \n``Mother of Universal Charity,'' was canonized in 1990, the first \nnative-born Canadian saint.\n  My home State has been blessed by the works of St. Marguerite and her \nfollowers. On November 20, 1878, three Grey Nuns stepped off a train in \nLewiston, ME, equipped with little more than caring hearts and \ndetermination. Within 2 weeks, they opened the first bilingual school \nin that largely Franco-American city, with 200 children arriving for \nthe first day of class. Within 6 months, they opened an orphanage.\n  The Hospital of the Sisters of Charity they founded was often \nreferred to as the ``Sisters' Hospital'' or the ``French Hospital,'' \nbut the Grey Nuns welcomed all. It was the first hospital in the twin \ncities of Lewiston-Auburn and the first Catholic hospital in Maine. \nFees for care in the hard-working mill community were low and were \noften paid in loaves of bread, bolts of cloth, or bushels of apples, \nwhich the sisters gladly accepted.\n  A major expansion of the hospital in 1902 gave Lewiston the two \nmagnificent domes that grace the city's skyline. In 1910, the name was \nchanged to St. Mary's General Hospital. The growth of the hospital was \nwell underway, with the latest medical innovations and a bilingual \nSchool of Nursing.\n  Today, St. Mary's Health System includes a 233-bed acute care \nfacility; a strong physician network, an independent living center, and \noccupational health services that reach out to businesses throughout \nthe region. St. Mary's D'Youville Pavilion is one of the largest \nnursing homes in New England and a national model for elder care.\n  On October 24, St. Mary's General Hospital will honor the Sisters of \nCharity, past and present, for more than 130 years of healing for the \nbody and the soul. I rise today to join in that tribute. Through the \ntender care and willing sacrifice of the Grey Nuns, the words of St. \nMarguerite d'Youville, ``We shall continue to love and to serve,'' \nstill resonate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6762-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6762-S6763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                FOOD DAY\n\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to submit for the \nRecord an article written by Ann Wittman, executive director of the \nWyoming Beef Council and published October 8, 2011, in the Wyoming \nLivestock Journal. The article's title is ``Food Day Includes Gravy.''\n  As Ann correctly points out, Monday, October 24, 2011, is being \nbilled as Food Day with events planned across the Nation. Here in \nWashington, DC, the National Archives will be hosting a Food Day open \nhouse in conjunction with their ``What's Cooking, Uncle Sam?'' exhibit. \nOf note, the open house is being supported by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture and U.S. Food and Drug Administration along with the \nprimary Food Day sponsor, the Center for Science in the Public \nInterest.\n  It is the Center for Science in the Public Interest's agenda Ann \ncalls into question. As she writes, the group's goal is to ``encourage \npeople around the country to sponsor or participate in activities that \nencourage Americans to `eat real' and support healthy, affordable food \ngrown in a sustainable, humane way.''\n  The question must be asked, who is defining what is or what is not \nsustainable, healthy, and humane? In the article she points out behind \nthe innocent name of the ``Center for Science in the Public Interest'' \nare groups with very extreme positions such as the Humane Society of \nthe United States, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Farm \nAnimal Rights Movement, and FBI-designated terrorist groups, including \nthe Animal Liberation Front. These groups push radical environmental, \nanimal rights, and vegan positions and lifestyles that have very little \nto do with either science or public interest.\n  The USDA and FDA should not align themselves with fringe groups who \npush ideology over science. I commend Ann for her research and wise \njudgment in exposing special interest masquerading as public interest.\n  The material follows.\n\n                        Food Day Includes Gravy\n\n      (By Ann Wittmann, Executive Director, Wyoming Beef Council)\n\n       When I started working at the Wyoming Beef Council more \n     than a decade ago, I had fewer gray hairs, fewer wrinkles and \n     enthusiasm that might have been referred to as effervescent. \n     My ideals were grand, my trust was large and I had great \n     faith in the public to seek and gravitate toward the truth. \n     Don't get me wrong, my enthusiasm has not waned, anyone who \n     works with me or in the continental vicinity of me knows that \n     I am passionate about my work, but the direction and means of \n     expressing my enthusiasm has become more focused over the \n     years. It's become less like an exploding soda pop and more \n     like simmering gravy.\n       Several weeks ago I read with great interest an invitation \n     to work with an organization called Center for Science in the \n     Public Interest (CSPI) to participate in and facilitate \n     ``Food Day'' activities throughout Wyoming. The invite billed \n     ``Food Day'' as a national event on Oct. 24, 2011 to \n     ``encourage people around the country to sponsor or \n     participate in activities that encourage Americans to `eat \n     real' and support healthy, affordable food grown in a \n     sustainable, humane way.''\n       Had I received that offer 10 years ago, I would have been \n     shocked to discover the true message and motive behind the \n     effort. After all, the event was created by the Center for \n     Science in the Public Interest, and who among us doesn't \n     believe that science should be in the public interest? My \n     older, wiser simmering brain prevailed, however, and held \n     back enthusiasm pending further investigation.\n       Research into the event listed partner organizations as \n     Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, Farm Animal \n     Rights Movement and the notorious Humane Society of the \n     United States. Similar to the CSPI group, these organizations \n     have feel-good names that serve to mislead the public. Most \n     of us are aware that the Humane Society of the United States \n     (HSUS) is a national nonprofit organization with a $200 \n     million budget raised under the guise of funding pet \n     shelters, but that spends all but one percent of that budget \n     on efforts to eliminate animal agriculture. The other two \n     groups, Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) \n     and Farm Animals Rights Movement (FARM) may not be as \n     familiar. PCRM, in spite of its name, has a very small number \n     of physicians as members and has direct ties to PETA, as well \n     as several FBI-designated terrorist groups including Animal \n     Liberation Front (ALF) and Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty \n     (SHAC). FARM is a national nonprofit organization promoting a \n     vegan lifestyle through public education and grassroots \n     activism to end the use of animals for food.\n       As cautious as I am about jumping to conclusions, less than \n     60 seconds into my research I began to think ``Food Day'' was \n     not\n\n[[Page S6763]]\n\n     a beef-friendly event! Sadly, other organizations that have \n     been, and often continue to be, beef-friendly did not come to \n     the same conclusion. Specifically, the American Dietetic \n     Association, the American Culinary Federation and the \n     National Association of City and County Health Officials \n     signed on as partners to this campaign.\n       The five central goals of CSPI Food Day are: reduce diet-\n     related disease by promoting safe, healthy foods; support \n     sustainable farms and limit subsidies to big agribusiness; \n     expand access to food and alleviate hunger; protect the \n     environment and animals by reforming factory farms; promote \n     health by curbing junk-food marketing to kids; and support \n     fair conditions for food and farm workers. This campaign \n     recommends a nearly-vegetarian diet to meet these goals.\n       The fourth goal of protecting the environment and animals \n     by reforming factory farms continues to bring up false \n     claims, such as the fat content of grain-finished beef or the \n     greenhouse gas emissions from cattle. This alone is enough to \n     make a simmering brain steam up and boil over. However, one \n     of the most valuable lessons I have learned in my conversion \n     from carbonation to stove top is to ensure that actions and \n     reactions don't provide unintended publicity to the event or \n     issue. After all, do these folks really need help giving \n     their events more attention? Careful behind-the-scenes work \n     is most often the best way to navigate these waters.\n       Two Wyoming events were posted on the CSPI Food Day \n     website. The first was a mailing to Women, Infants and \n     Children (WIC) clinics throughout the state. After discussing \n     my concerns with a long-time beef-friendly contact at Wyoming \n     WIC, she and I decided that sending out checkoff-funded \n     information detailing the true story of beef production was \n     in order. This effort is currently underway. Second, the \n     University of Wyoming posted plans to host their own version \n     of Food Days on Oct. 24-26 to includes a food drive and \n     resource fair along with a harvest dinner made with locally \n     sourced foods. UW Food Days will wrap up on Oct. 26 with a \n     day of trayless dining and cooking demonstrations showcasing \n     local foods. Wyoming Collegiate CattleWomen and other \n     university contacts have been alerted and asked to ensure the \n     events are balanced and the truth about beef production is \n     also available.\n       Nationally, proactive checkoff-funded programs such as \n     panel discussions and national town hall conversations about \n     America's food system are taking place, seeding the \n     environment with positive messages about agriculture. \n     Additionally, national beef checkoff staff has been meeting \n     with several of the afore-mentioned beef-friendly \n     organizations and advisory board members to try and educate \n     them about the beef industry and understand why they are \n     supporting this campaign. State beef councils across the \n     country are meeting with state/local chapters of the \n     organizations on the advisory board for Food Day, as well \n     explaining that, while on the surface Food Day appears to be \n     an initiative to promote healthy foods versus fast-food and \n     junk-food, it is actually a cleverly disguised event by \n     groups opposed to modern food production practices.\n       Ultimately, I believe the true story of beef production and \n     the opportunity to share the reality of the wholesomeness of \n     our product and production methods are enthusiasm worthy and \n     the checkoff will continue to roll along, working \n     proactively, reactively and frequently behind the scenes, \n     like a savory gravy on the back burner, to tell the positive \n     story about our product.\n       For more information about the beef checkoff program visit \n     mybeefcheckoff.com, wybeef.com or contact me at \n     ann.wittmann@wyo.gov.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6763-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n     WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS CENTERED IN \n                            COLOMBIA--PM 29\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Rubio, Mrs. Hutchison, \n        and Mr. Burr):\n  S. 1738. A bill to rescind the 3.8 percent tax on the investment \nincome of the American people and to promote job creation and small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Economic Growth \nand Jobs Protection Act of 2011. This legislation would repeal the 3.8 \npercent surtax on investment income that was included in the Health \nCare Reconciliation Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152, signed into law by the \nPresident last year. I am pleased that Senators Crapo, Rubio, \nHutchison, and Burr are cosponsors of this legislation.\n  We know that taxpayers will likely face the largest tax increase in \nhistory when the 2001 and 2003 tax relief acts expire at the end of \n2013. If Congress does nothing, the highest tax rate for individuals \nwill rise from 35 percent to just under 40 percent; taxpayers in the \nlowest bracket will see a 50 percent tax increase, from 10 percent to \n15 percent; the marriage penalty will increase; the child credit will \nbe cut in half; and taxes on capital gains and dividends will increase. \nIn other words, every taxpayer will pay higher taxes to Washington.\n  But while taxpayers may be aware of these expiring provisions, many \nare likely not fully aware of another unpleasant surprise that will \narrive on the first day of 2013. The Health Care Reconciliation Act \nthat was jammed through the Senate along partisan lines includes a 3.8 \npercent surtax on the dividends, rents, and interest earned by certain \ntaxpayers. Enacting this permanent tax hike was a mistake then and is a \nmistake now.\n  The Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation--a nonprofit \neconomic policy research and educational organization recently told the \nSenate Finance Committee that the 3.8 percent surtax would reduce \ncapital formation, which would lower productivity and wages and that a \n3.8 percent surtax would lower GDP by about 0.9 percent and would \nactually result in lower revenue coming into the government's coffers.\n  Simply put, increasing taxes on investment income is a job killer and \nincreases uncertainty at a time that the national unemployment is more \nthan 9 percent. In fact, the top tax rate on capital gains will \neventually be 23.8 percent as the rate bounces back to 20 percent from \n15 percent in 2013. And dividends taxes would more than double to more \nthan 43 percent.\n  We should not pile more taxes on the backs of working families and \njob creators. This will not help create jobs and will not make the tax \ncode more pro-growth. We know the key to job creation is to grow the \neconomy and allow small businesses to flourish, invest and create jobs.\n  In fact, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, we will \nneed several years of very strong growth to reach 5 percent \nunemployment. For example, to reach 5 percent unemployment by 2015 the \neconomy will need to grow 4.2 percent a year. This is just one reason \nthat during the health care debate I offered a motion that would have \ndirected the Senate Finance Committee to report the bill back without \nthe 3.8 percent tax on the investment income. Although my attempt to \nstrip out this job-killing tax fell short, I want to take this \nopportunity to note that six of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle supported my motion.\n  Not only will the Economic Growth and Jobs Protection Act of 2011 \nprotect jobs and the investment security of taxpayers, it will also \nmake sure that Congress restores one of the President's campaign \npromises. On September 12, 2008, then-candidate Obama promised the \nAmerican people that, ``Everyone in America--everyone--will pay lower \ntaxes than they would under the rates Bill Clinton had in the 1990s.'' \nBut when combined with the President's budget proposal, this additional \ntax on investment will raise taxes on many Americans higher than they \nwere under the rates President Clinton had in the 1990s.\n  I ask that my colleagues support this legislation that will repeal \nthis job-killing tax on small business investment and will protect \neconomic growth, jobs and the retirement savings of taxpayers. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a \nletter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1738\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Economic Growth and Jobs \n     Protection Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF UNEARNED INCOME MEDICARE CONTRIBUTION.\n\n       Subsection (a) of section 1402 of the Health Care and \n     Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152) and \n     the amendments made by such subsection are repealed.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                                 October 18, 2011.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Manufacturers (NAM)--the nation's largest industrial trade \n     association--thank you for your leadership in introducing \n     ``The Economic Growth and Jobs Protection Act of 2011,'' to \n     repeal the 3.8 percent surtax on ``investment income'' \n     currently scheduled to go into effect beginning in 2013. The \n     NAM strongly supports the passage of this legislation.\n       As you know, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation \n     Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-152) imposes a new 3.8 percent surtax \n     on the dividends, rents and interest income earned by certain \n     taxpayers. This new surtax, if implemented, will discourage \n     savings and investment. If not repealed, this surtax will \n     come on top of increases on dividend taxes that are scheduled \n     to accelerate from today's current rate of 15 percent to a \n     top rate of 39.6 percent at the beginning of 2013. Combined \n     with this surtax, dividends taxes could more than double to a \n     total of 43.9 percent.\n       Manufacturers strongly support the repeal of this \n     burdensome tax that would increase the tax on savings and \n     investment and reduce the amount of capital business owners \n     have available to invest in their companies. Such a tax will \n     ultimately result in the loss of vital funds needed for \n     business operations and job creation.\n       Thank you for introducing this legislation. At this time \n     while our nation is working to emerge from recent economic \n     challenges,\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\n     further increasing taxes on investment income is the wrong \n     approach and simply adds to a tax system that is already \n     anti-growth. We look forward to working with you and your \n     staff to advance this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                  Dorothy Coleman, Vice President,\n                                Tax, Technology & Domestic Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 1739. A bill to provide for the use and distribution of judgment \nfunds awarded to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe by the United States \nCourt of Federal Claims in Docket Numbers 19 and 188, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Minnesota \nChippewa Tribe Judgment Fund Distribution Act with my friend and \ncolleague from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar. This legislation will \nfinally allow for the distribution of funds owed to the Minnesota \nChippewa Tribe. Before I talk about our legislation, I want to first \nthank my colleague in the House, Representative Peterson of Minnesota, \nfor his leadership on this issue and for the tremendous work he put \ninto crafting this bill.\n  It has been a long road to get to this point. The Minnesota Chippewa \nTribe first filed complaints before the Indian Claims Commission in \n1948. It took all the way until 1999 before their claims were settled. \nFor over 60 years, members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe have been \nwaiting for these funds. It's time to get this done.\n  In 1999, the United States Court of Federal Claims awarded $20 \nmillion to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. This money is to compensate \ntribal members for the improper taking and sale of land and timber \nunder the Nelson Act of 1889. The Federal Government owes the Minnesota \nChippewa Tribe this money. In fact, in 1999, the $20 million owed to \nthe tribe was transferred to the Department of the Interior and \ndeposited in a trust fund account, where it has been collecting one \npercent interest. But tribal members in my home State of Minnesota have \nnever received a dime. That is because, before any money can go to the \ntribe, Congress must pass legislation detailing how to allocate the \nfunds between the 6 bands that make up the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.\n  Today, Senator Klobuchar and I are introducing legislation to do just \nthat. Our bill will provide $300 to every tribal member. While this \nmight not seem like a lot of money, I want to remind my colleagues that \nNative Americans represent one of the poorest segments of Minnesota's \npopulation. On the White Earth reservation, where one in five members \nlive under the poverty line, a check for $1,200 for a family of four \nwould make a real difference. This is money that the 40,000 enrolled \nmembers of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe could be using right now to put \ntires on their car or fix a leaking roof or buy new shoes for their \nchildren.\n  Our bill allocates the remaining funds equally to each of the six \nbands that make up the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. That is approximately \n$15 million or $2.5 million per band. This funding is desperately \nneeded. It will allow the bands to provide for the basic needs for \ntheir people by investing in economic development, health care, \nhousing, and education.\n  There is one band, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, that does not agree \nwith this distribution plan. I am sympathetic to their concerns, and I \nsincerely hoped that a consensus agreement could have been reached that \nwould have satisfied all those involved. But, in the end, I believe we \nmust respect the decision of the tribe.\n  The bill we are introducing today reflects the distribution agreed \nupon by the Minnesota Chippewa Tribal Executive Committee. This is a \ndemocratic body comprised of two elected officials from each of the six \nbands. Under the tribal constitution, the Executive Committee is the \ngoverning body of the tribe. After years of disagreement, the Tribal \nExcusive Committee has agreed on an allocation formula. I deeply \nrespect tribal sovereignty and therefore believe we must respect their \ndecision.\n  I also worry that any further delay will only cause hardship for \nindividual tribal members. The thousands of tribal members across \nMinnesota cannot afford to wait another decade. It is time for Congress \nto act to allow for the distribution of the funds owed to the Minnesota \nChippewa Tribe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and send it to the \nPresident's desk to be signed into law as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998 to \nprovide for the reauthorization of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \nWatertrails Network; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, authorized under P.L. 105-312 in 1998 and \nreauthorized by P.L. 107-308 in 2002, the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \nWatertrails Network helps several million visitors and residents find, \nenjoy, and learn about the special places and stories of the Chesapeake \nand its watershed. Today I am introducing legislation to reauthorize \nthis successful program.\n  For visitors and residents, the Gateways are the ``Chesapeake \nconnection.'' The Network members provide an experience of such high \nquality that their visitors will indeed connect to the Chesapeake \nemotionally as well as intellectually, and thus to its conservation.\n  The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. The Chesapeake ranks as \nthe largest of America's 130 estuaries and one of the Nation's largest \nand longest fresh water and estuarine systems. The Atlantic Ocean \ndelivers half the bay's 18 trillion gallons of water and the other half \nflows through over 150 major rivers and streams draining 64,000 square \nmiles within 6 States and the District of Columbia. The Chesapeake \nwatershed is among the most significant cultural, natural and historic \nassets of our Nation.\n  The Chesapeake is enormous and vastly diverse--how could you possibly \nexperience the whole story in any one place? Better to connect and use \nthe scores of existing public places to collaborate on presenting the \nmany chapters and tales of the bay story. Visitors and residents go to \nmore places for more experiences, all through a coordinated Gateways \nNetwork.\n  Beyond simply coordinating the Network, publishing a map and guides, \nand providing standard exhibits at all Gateways, the National Park \nService has helped Gateways with matching grants and expertise for 200 \nprojects with a total value of more than $12 million. This is a great \ndeal for the bay--it helps network members tell the Chesapeake story \nbetter and inspires people to care for this National Treasure--and it \nis a good deal for the Park Service. In this legislation, we cap the \nGateways authorization at just $2 million annually. It serves all 150+ \nGateways and their 10 million visitors. No other National Park can \nprovide such a dramatic ratio of public dollars spent to number of \nvisitors served.\n  With the National Park Service's expertise and support, Gateways have \nmade significant progress in their mission to tell the bay's stories to \ntheir millions of members and visitors, extend access to the bay and \nits watershed, and develop a conservation awareness and ethic. It is \ntime to reauthorize the Chesapeake Gateways and Watertrails program. It \nis my hope that the Congress will act quickly to adopt this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1740\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Chesapeake Bay Gateways and \n     Watertrails Network Reauthorization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 299\n\n       Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit \n     professional association with expertise in attracting, \n     motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of workers' \n     jobs and the supportiveness of the workplace of the workers \n     are key predictors of the job productivity, job satisfaction, \n     and commitment to the employer of those workers, as well as \n     of the ability of the employer to retain those workers;\n       Whereas ``work-life balance'' refers to specific \n     organizational practices, policies, and programs that are \n     guided by a philosophy of active support for the efforts of \n     employees to achieve success within and outside the \n     workplace, such as caring for dependents, health and \n     wellness, paid and unpaid time off, financial support, \n     community involvement, and workplace culture;\n       Whereas numerous studies show that employers that offer \n     effective work-life balance programs are better able to \n     recruit more talented employees, maintain a happier, \n     healthier, and less stressed workforce, and retain \n     experienced employees, which produces a more productive and \n     stable workforce with less voluntary turnover;\n       Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more \n     involved in the lives of their children, and research \n     demonstrates that parental involvement is associated with \n     higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved \n     behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout \n     rates in children;\n       Whereas military families have special work-family needs \n     that often require robust policies and programs that provide \n     flexibility to employees in unique circumstances;\n       Whereas studies report that family rituals, such as sitting \n     down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends \n     and holidays, positively influence the health and development \n     of children and that children who eat dinner with their \n     families every day consume nearly a full serving more of \n     fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner \n     with their families or do so only occasionally; and\n       Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to \n     designate as National Work and Family Month: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2011 as ``National Work and Family \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of work schedules that allow \n     employees to spend time with their families to job \n     productivity and healthy families;\n       (3) urges public officials, employers, employees, and the \n     general public to work together to achieve more balance \n     between work and family; and\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Work and Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6769-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 300--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF RED RIBBON \n                               WEEK, 2011\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Crapo, \nMr. Chambliss, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Thune) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 300\n\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established to \n     commemorate the service of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena, a \n     special agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration for 11 \n     years who was murdered in the line of duty in 1985 while \n     engaged in the battle against illicit drugs;\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign was established by the \n     National Family Partnership to preserve the memory of Special \n     Agent Camarena and further the cause for which he gave his \n     life;\n       Whereas the Red Ribbon Campaign has been nationally \n     recognized since 1988 and is now the oldest and largest drug \n     prevention program in the United States, reaching millions of \n     young people each year during Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration, established in \n     1973, aggressively targets organizations involved in the \n     growing, manufacturing, and distribution of controlled \n     substances and has been a steadfast partner in commemorating \n     Red Ribbon Week;\n       Whereas the Governors and attorneys general of the States, \n     the National Family Partnership, Parent Teacher Associations, \n     Boys and Girls Clubs of America, PRIDE Youth Programs, the \n     Drug Enforcement Administration, and hundreds of other \n     organizations throughout the United States annually celebrate \n     Red Ribbon Week during the period of October 23 through \n     October 31;\n       Whereas the objective of Red Ribbon Week is to promote the \n     creation of drug-free communities through drug prevention \n     efforts, education, parental involvement, and community-wide \n     support;\n       Whereas drug abuse is one of the major challenges that the \n     United States faces in securing a safe and healthy future for \n     families in the United States;\n       Whereas drug abuse and alcohol abuse contribute to domestic \n     violence and sexual assault and place the lives of children \n     at risk;\n       Whereas, between 1998 and 2008, the percentages of \n     admissions to substance abuse treatment programs as a result \n     of the abuse of marijuana and methamphetamines rose \n     significantly;\n       Whereas drug dealers specifically target children by \n     marketing illicit drugs that mimic the appearance and names \n     of well-known brand-name candies and foods;\n       Whereas emerging drug threats and growing epidemics demand \n     attention, with particular focus on the abuse of prescription \n     medications, the second most abused drug by young people in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas since the majority of teenagers abusing \n     prescription drugs get the prescription drugs from family, \n     friends, and home medicine cabinets, the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration will host a National Take Back Day on October \n     29, 2011, for the public to safely dispose of unused or \n     expired prescription medications that can lead to accidental \n     poisoning, overdose, and abuse; and\n       Whereas parents, young people, schools, businesses, law \n     enforcement agencies, religious institutions, service \n     organizations, senior citizens, medical and military \n     personnel, sports teams, and individuals throughout the \n     United States will demonstrate their commitment to healthy, \n     productive, and drug-free lifestyles by wearing and \n     displaying red ribbons during the week-long celebration of \n     Red Ribbon Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Red Ribbon Week, 2011;\n       (2) encourages children and teens to choose to live drug-\n     free lives; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to promote the creation of drug-free communities; and\n       (B) to participate in drug prevention activities to show \n     support for healthy, productive, and drug-free lifestyles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6769-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6769-S6770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 858.

(a) Tracing studies conducted by the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are released \n     without adequate disclaimers regarding the limitations of the \n     data.\n       (b) For fiscal year 2012 and thereafter, the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shall include in \n     all such data releases, language similar to the following\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\n     that would make clear that trace data cannot be used to draw \n     broad conclusions about firearms-related crime:\n       (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement \n     authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale \n     and possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies \n     may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons \n     are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not \n     all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms \n     traced are used in crime.\n       (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for \n     purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of \n     firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected \n     do not constitute a random sample and should not be \n     considered representative of the larger universe of all \n     firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe. \n     Firearms are normally traced to the first retail seller, and \n     sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily \n     represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general \n     are acquired for use in crime.\n       Sec. 517. (a) The Inspectors General of the Department of \n     Commerce, the Department of Justice, the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, \n     and the Legal Services Corporation shall conduct audits, \n     pursuant to the Inspector General Act (5 U.S.C. App.), of \n     grants or contracts for which funds are appropriated by this \n     Act, and shall submit reports to Congress on the progress of \n     such audits, which may include preliminary findings and a \n     description of areas of particular interest, within 180 days \n     after initiating such an audit and every 180 days thereafter \n     until any such audit is completed.\n       (b) Within 60 days after the date on which an audit \n     described in subsection (a) by an Inspector General is \n     completed, the Secretary, Attorney General, Administrator, \n     Director, or President, as appropriate, shall make the \n     results of the audit available to the public on the Internet \n     website maintained by the Department, Administration, \n     Foundation, or Corporation, respectively. The results shall \n     be made available in redacted form to exclude--\n       (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, \n     United States Code; and\n       (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the \n     public access to which could be used to commit identity theft \n     or for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.\n       (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by \n     this Act may not be used for the purpose of defraying the \n     costs of a banquet or conference that is not directly and \n     programmatically related to the purpose for which the grant \n     or contract was awarded, such as a banquet or conference held \n     in connection with planning, training, assessment, review, or \n     other routine purposes related to a project funded by the \n     grant or contract.\n       (d) Any person awarded a grant or contract funded by \n     amounts appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to \n     the Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the \n     Administrator, Director, or President, as appropriate, \n     certifying that no funds derived from the grant or contract \n     will be made available through a subcontract or in any other \n     manner to another person who has a financial interest in the \n     person awarded the grant or contract.\n       (e) The provisions of the preceding subsections of this \n     section shall take effect 30 days after the date on which the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Government \n     Ethics, determines that a uniform set of rules and \n     requirements, substantially similar to the requirements in \n     such subsections, consistently apply under the executive \n     branch ethics program to all Federal departments, agencies, \n     and entities.\n       Sec. 518.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act may be used to issue patents on \n     claims directed to or encompassing a human organism.\n       Sec. 519.  None of the funds made available in this Act \n     shall be used in any way whatsoever to support or justify the \n     use of torture by any official or contract employee of the \n     United States Government.\n       Sec. 520. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or \n     treaty, hereafter, none of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available under this Act or any other Act may \n     be expended or obligated by a department, agency, or \n     instrumentality of the United States to pay administrative \n     expenses or to compensate an officer or employee of the \n     United States in connection with requiring an export license \n     for the export to Canada of components, parts, accessories or \n     attachments for firearms listed in Category I, section 121.1 \n     of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations (International \n     Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR), part 121, as it \n     existed on April 1, 2005) with a total value not exceeding \n     $500 wholesale in any transaction, provided that the \n     conditions of subsection (b) of this section are met by the \n     exporting party for such articles.\n       (b) The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export \n     license--\n       (1) does not exempt an exporter from filing any Shipper's \n     Export Declaration or notification letter required by law, or \n     from being otherwise eligible under the laws of the United \n     States to possess, ship, transport, or export the articles \n     enumerated in subsection (a); and\n       (2) does not permit the export without a license of--\n       (A) fully automatic firearms and components and parts for \n     such firearms, other than for end use by the Federal \n     Government, or a Provincial or Municipal Government of \n     Canada;\n       (B) barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or complete \n     breech mechanisms for any firearm listed in Category I, other \n     than for end use by the Federal Government, or a Provincial \n     or Municipal Government of Canada; or\n       (C) articles for export from Canada to another foreign \n     destination.\n       (c) In accordance with this section, the District Directors \n     of Customs and postmasters shall permit the permanent or \n     temporary export without a license of any unclassified \n     articles specified in subsection (a) to Canada for end use in \n     Canada or return to the United States, or temporary import of \n     Canadian-origin items from Canada for end use in the United \n     States or return to Canada for a Canadian citizen.\n       (d) The President may require export licenses under this \n     section on a temporary basis if the President determines, \n     upon publication first in the Federal Register, that the \n     Government of Canada has implemented or maintained inadequate \n     import controls for the articles specified in subsection (a), \n     such that a significant diversion of such articles has and \n     continues to take place for use in international terrorism or \n     in the escalation of a conflict in another nation. The \n     President shall terminate the requirements of a license when \n     reasons for the temporary requirements have ceased.\n       Sec. 521.

Res. 299\n\n       Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit \n     professional association with expertise in attracting, \n     motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of workers' \n     jobs and the supportiveness of the workplace of the workers \n     are key predictors of the job productivity, job satisfaction, \n     and commitment to the employer of those workers, as well as \n     of the ability of the employer to retain those workers;\n       Whereas ``work-life balance'' refers to specific \n     organizational practices, policies, and programs that are \n     guided by a philosophy of active support for the efforts of \n     employees to achieve success within and outside the \n     workplace, such as caring for dependents, health and \n     wellness, paid and unpaid time off, financial support, \n     community involvement, and workplace culture;\n       Whereas numerous studies show that employers that offer \n     effective work-life balance programs are better able to \n     recruit more talented employees, maintain a happier, \n     healthier, and less stressed workforce, and retain \n     experienced employees, which produces a more productive and \n     stable workforce with less voluntary turnover;\n       Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more \n     involved in the lives of their children, and research \n     demonstrates that parental involvement is associated with \n     higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved \n     behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout \n     rates in children;\n       Whereas military families have special work-family needs \n     that often require robust policies and programs that provide \n     flexibility to employees in unique circumstances;\n       Whereas studies report that family rituals, such as sitting \n     down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends \n     and holidays, positively influence the health and development \n     of children and that children who eat dinner with their \n     families every day consume nearly a full serving more of \n     fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner \n     with their families or do so only occasionally; and\n       Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to \n     designate as National Work and Family Month: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2011 as ``National Work and Family \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of work schedules that allow \n     employees to spend time with their families to job \n     productivity and healthy families;\n       (3) urges public officials, employers, employees, and the \n     general public to work together to achieve more balance \n     between work and family; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Work and Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/19/senate-section/article/S6787-5", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6787-S6788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            RED RIBBON WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., tomorrow, \nThursday, October 20. I would note there is a unique reason we are \ncoming in late tomorrow. I would like to come in very early, but \nSenator Harkin and Senator Enzi are working very hard in the Labor \nCommittee, Labor and Education Committee, to come up with a rewrite of \nLeave No Child Behind. They have worked very hard.\n  There are 140 amendments pending. More than 70 of them have been \noffered by one Senator and that Senator has objected to the committee \nmeeting so it is a little hard when you file all those amendments to \nhave them all considered when they object to the committee meeting. \nUnder the rules of the Senate, you have a right to object if the \nmeeting takes more than 2 hours after the Senate comes into session. \nAnyway, that is where we are. I think it is absolutely hard to \ncomprehend how anyone could rationally do that, but that is what we \nhave.\n  I would add, because of that, the committee is meeting very early so \nthey can continue 2 hours after we come in. Anyway, we are coming in at \n10 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and pledge, the \nJournal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed \nexpired, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use \nlater in the day; that following any leader remarks, the Senate resume \nconsideration of H.R. 2112, the Agriculture, CJS, and Transportation \nappropriations bill, until 12 p.m., and that at 12 p.m. the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 78, with 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form \nprior to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, and all other \nprovisions of the previous order remain in effect; further, that when \nthe Senate resumes legislative session, the Senate resume consideration \nof H.R. 2112, and the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Vitter \namendment No. 769, as modified, and the Webb amendment, No. 750; and \nthat at 2 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Merkley \namendment No. 879, as modified; the Brown of Ohio amendment No. 874, as \nmodified; the Moran amendment No. 815; and the Grassley amendment No. \n860; with all other provisions of the previous order remaining in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
