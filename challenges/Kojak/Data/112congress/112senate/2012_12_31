Mr. President, I was disturbed to read in the Washington \nPost this morning that some agreements were being made, that Democrats \nhave agreed to raise the level from $250,000 to $450,000 and we would \nkeep the estate taxes at the $5 million level at 35 percent.\n  All I can say is this is one Democrat who does not agree with that at \nall. What it looks like is all the taxes are going to be made \npermanent, but those items that the middle-class in America truly \ndepend on are extended for 1 year--maybe 2 years at the most. I think \nthat is grossly unfair.\n  We are going to lock in forever the idea that $450,000 a year is \nmiddle class in America? Need I remind people that those making \n$250,000 are the top 2 percent income earners in America? I know the \nPresident keeps saying he wants to protect tax cuts for the middle \nclass, which is fine. I am all for that. If we go up to $250,000, that \nis a pill we can swallow because that covers everyone except the top 2 \npercent. Those who make $250,000 a year are not middle class. They are \nthe top 2 percent of income earners in America.\n  What have we forgotten? Have we forgotten that the average income \nearners in America are making $25,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, \n$60,000 a year? That is the real middle class in America, and they are \nthe ones who are getting hammered right now. They are getting hammered \nwith housing and rental costs, heating bills, kids going to school, and \nthey have no retirement. Now there is talk about raising the retirement \nage on people who work hard every day. There are women who have been \nstanding on their feet every day for 30 or 40 years. Are they going to \nraise the retirement age on them again?\n  If we are going to have some kind of deal, the deal must be one that \ntruly does favor the real middle class. Those who are making $30,000, \n$40,000, $50,000, 60,000, $70,000 a year are the real middle\n\n[[Page S8558]]\n\nclass in America. Quite frankly, as I see this develop--and as I have \nsaid before--no deal is better than a bad deal and this looks like a \nvery bad deal the way this is shaping up. I wish to make it clear I am \nall in favor of compromise. I have been here a long time, and I have \nmade a lot of compromises. I am willing to make more compromises, but \nthis is one point in time where decisions which are made on this so-\ncalled deal will potentially lock in what kind of country and society \nwe are going to be for the next 10 years. So we better be darned \ncareful.\n  If no deal is reached, then on the tax side we go back to the taxes \nthat were enacted under President Clinton. All the Democrats who were \nhere then voted for the Clinton tax bill in 1993. We heard all kinds of \ntalk from the other side of the aisle of how this was going to be \ndisastrous, kill the economy, and it was going to be awful. Not one \nRepublican supported it, but we passed it. President Clinton signed it \ninto law, and guess what happened. The economy took off. Unemployment \ncame down, the economy started going, and we were paying down the \ndeficit. We had 3 or 4 straight years of surpluses. CBO said if we \ncontinued down that path, we would pay off the national debt by 2010.\n  Then George Bush came into office. They looked at all the surpluses \nout there and said: Guess what. We have to take some of that and give \nit back in tax cuts, and that is what they did. That is what will end \ntonight. Those Bush tax cuts will end, and we will go back to the tax \nsystem we had under Bill Clinton. What is so bad about that? It worked \npretty darned well. The economy was going well, and we were paying down \nthe deficit. Things were going well under Bill Clinton and that tax \nsystem and that is what we will go back to tomorrow. What is so bad \nabout that?\n  What has happened in the last 10 years is a lot of people have gotten \nvery rich in this country and now they want to protect their wealth. \nThat is what they want to do. They want to lock in this system on \nestate taxes and lower tax rates up to $450,000, $500,000, $1 million \nor whatever they want and they want to lock that in. I think it is time \nfor them to start paying their fair share, as they did under the \nClinton tax provisions we had in place at that time.\n  To go back to the tax provisions we had under Bill Clinton does not \nfrighten me one bit, but now we hear the same song and dance from the \nRepublicans: Oh, if we do that, the sky is going to fall, the world \nwill end tomorrow, and the markets will go all to heck. We heard that \nin 1993, and they were wrong. We are hearing it again today about what \nwill happen if we go back to the Clinton-era tax provisions. They say \nthe sky is going to fall, and they are wrong again. They are just wrong \nagain.\n  I, for one, do not fear going back to a system of taxation that \nbasically worked very well for our country. It was the Bush tax cuts \nthat messed everything up for 10 years and allowed a few people to get \nvery rich but kept the middle class from advancing at all.\n  Again, this idea that somehow a deal is going to be cooked up and all \nthese tax advantages people had over the last 10 years and have now in \nestate taxes will be permanent does not sit well with this Senator. Yet \nwhen we are talking about unemployment insurance, investments in other \nparts of our economy, the sustainable growth rate for our hospitals, \ndoctors, and Medicare, that is only good for 1 or 2 years. But the tax \nside that lets those most privileged in our society continue to not pay \nthe share that I think they should be paying is not a good deal. That \nis not fair, that is not equitable, and that is not just.\n  I hope those who are negotiating continue to negotiate. If there is a \ndeal that could be made which truly does focus on the middle class and \ngets our estate taxes back where they were before--at some reasonable \nlevel and not at the level they are right now--then maybe we could live \nwith something such as that. But from what I read this morning, the \ndirection they are headed is absolutely the wrong direction for our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are all here and hopeful there will be \na deal so we can avert going over the fiscal cliff. I listened \ncarefully to the remarks of my friend Senator Harkin, which I would \nhave to describe as fairly negative. I wish to project a bit more of a \npositive view.\n  We all know that no side, if there is a deal, is going to get 100 \npercent of what they want. We know that because one party doesn't \ncontrol everything, so we are going to have to meet somewhere in the \nmiddle of where both parties stand. We also know if we don't act, 100 \npercent of the American people are going to start feeling an impact of \nhigher taxes.\n  I honestly do not worry about the millionaires and the billionaires \nat all. I don't worry about the people who are fine, who don't even \nknow or care that much about a tax hike that takes them back to the \nClinton years when they did very well. I don't worry about those folks. \nI worry about the folks in the middle. There are always arguments about \nwhat that line is. Some say the middle class is at $75,000, some say \n$150,000, and some go even higher because their States, as is my State, \nare very high cost-of-living States. So we know if we are going to get \na deal, we are going to have to meet somewhere in the middle. To me, if \nwe fail, it will be a very sad moment in history.\n  I hear a lot of talk about the sequester. I don't know exactly how \nthe President pro tempore voted, but I voted for a sequester if we \ncouldn't find savings as part of a debt limit deal. I am not about to \nstand here and say we should throw it out. I don't like it; it will \nbite. But if we said we are going to make savings, and if we couldn't \ndo it one way we would do it through the sequester, then I think we \nhave to step to the plate and admit that is the policy we voted for.\n  I would much prefer to ease it, and I think there are ways to do \nthat. One way is to bring the money home from the overseas spending \naccount and use that money because we are getting out of Afghanistan, \nthank God, and the war in Iraq is over. So we could bring home that \noverseas war account money and use that to soften the sequester or even \nto stop it completely. My understanding is my Republican colleagues \ndon't view that as real, but the Congressional Budget Office says it is \nreal. So that is a way we can stop the sequester.\n  Other than that, I think we have to own up to the fact that in the \ndebt ceiling made-up crisis--this is a made-up crisis and that was a \nmade-up crisis--we said if there were not cuts coming forward, we could \ngo to an automatic spending cut regime. We can't run away from things \nwe did, it seems to me.\n  So I think there are the elements of putting something together. I \nknow the Vice President is working hard with Senator McConnell and \nSenator Reid as an honest broker to bring us together. I know Senator \nHarkin is not very optimistic at this point based on what he is \nhearing. I believe, from what I am hearing, there may be something, \nmaybe--there may not be; we don't know, we haven't seen it. It may be \nsomething that extends unemployment benefits, which is very important. \nIt is critical. If we want to talk about the real cliff, it is for the \npeople who are about to lose their unemployment compensation.\n  The economists tell us that is the best bang for the buck. When we \ngive someone who is unemployed a dollar, he goes out, she goes out, \nthey spend in the community, and it has a multiplier effect that \nactually spurs economic growth in the community because 70 percent of \nour economy is based on consumers. If they have nothing, then the \ncommunities have nothing, the local businesses have nothing, let alone \nthey would suffer and some, perhaps, lose their houses and such. So we \nneed to do that. That is critical.\n  If that is not in the deal, that deal is a real problem. So if that \nis in there, and we do the tax extenders even for a shorter period of \ntime, and we stop raising taxes on 98 percent, 97 percent of the \npeople, I don't think we should\n\n[[Page S8559]]\n\nprejudge that at this point. The devil is always in the details. \nSomething could come out that is just a nonstarter.\n  Senator Reid went down to that microphone yesterday and said to the \nRepublicans: We are not cutting Social Security benefits; that is not \npart of this package: Don't even put it on the table; stop. After the \nRepublicans had their luncheon meeting, they came out and actually took \nit off the table. That was positive. Don't try to slip things in here \nthat could hurt the people, that will balance the budget on the backs \nof those who can't do it. Don't bring up Social Security when we are \ndoing a very short term deal to get us over this cliff.\n  So none of us, except for a couple of people, really know what is in \nthis deal. We are hearing leaks about it, we are hearing rumors about \nit, but we don't know if we will have the deal. Personally, I hope we \nhave something we can look at and decide whether it is something we can \nsupport and not prejudge it at this stage because we have to remember \nsomething: This is a compromise. We don't have a parliamentary system \nof government. One party doesn't run the show. It is shared \nresponsibility. It is frustrating, and it is difficult.\n  I was able to bring a highway bill to the floor as the chairman of \nthe Environmental and Public Works Committee, doing it with Senator \nInhofe, and a person couldn't find two people more philosophically \napart than we are. I have seen the President pro tempore do the same in \nhis committee, working with the other side, and he brought out of his \ncommittee an incredible bill called the Violence Against Women Act. He \ndid it with the Republicans.\n  I watched Senator Stabenow and Pat Roberts come forward with a farm \nbill. I have watched Senator Feinstein in intelligence, and I have \nwatched Senator Levin and Senator McCain. We can make it happen. It can \nhappen. We have to make it happen.\n  I will close with this: I served in the House for 10 years. I served \nwith incredible Members. One of them was Tip O'Neill, and he was the \nSpeaker. Tip O'Neill had a certain magic about him. The magic was he \nunderstood how to get things done because he didn't consider himself \nSpeaker of the Democrats; he considered himself Speaker of the House. \nHe knew the magic number was 218. That was the number. He would come \nover to me and every Member when there was a tough vote, and he would \nsay: Well, Barbara, can you be with me on this one?\n  I would say: Gee, Mr. Speaker, I don't think so. It is not good for \nmy district. I really don't think I can.\n  He would say to me: Well, you know what. If that is how you feel \nabout it, I understand. If I need you, I will come back to you.\n  Then he would go do the same thing and pick up some Republicans on \nthe other side, and he would get the magic 218 and it would be done.\n  Right now we have Speaker Boehner, whom I know and like personally, \nbut it seems as though he doesn't want to talk to the Democrats. \nNothing is going to get done for our country if we don't talk to each \nother. We don't have a parliamentary system. We have to work together.\n  So I wanted to add at least a cautiously optimistic note. I am \nhopeful we will get something done, and I think if we do, and if it is \nfair--fair enough--we should get our country off this cliff.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I guess one of the advantages of being \nPresident pro tempore is I actually get to preside more than I had for \na while and hear some of the speeches of my colleagues, which I \nappreciate. The Senate is a place I love, as I know the distinguished \nPresiding Officer does. It is, as I have often said, a place that \nshould be considered the conscience of the Nation. There are only 100 \nof us representing over 300 million Americans. We should be able to \nstand and be their conscience.\n  I worry, though--as I hear the debate on this so-called fiscal cliff \nand I hear some on the other side say, well, we are not prepared to \nvote or we don't want to vote--because that means they want to vote \nmaybe. None of us were elected on a promise to vote maybe.\n  If the other side wants to vote and give huge tax cuts to longtime \nmillionaires, fine, then vote. Vote yes for that if they want. But \ndon't say: We will not have any vote one way or the other; we will vote \nmaybe.\n  We are supposed to be willing to take the consequences of how we \nvote. Vote yes or vote no. If a Member wants to vote for keeping taxes \nlower for the middle class, for those who have hourly wages, for those \nwho work hard in our economy, then stand and vote yes, we want to give \nthem a tax break. If a Member doesn't want to give them a tax break, \nthen vote no. But what is happening, by refusing to vote at all, \nwhether it is the Republicans in the House of Representatives or in the \nSenate, what they are doing with their ``maybe'' vote is they are going \nto dramatically increase taxes on the middle class. Then, in an effort \nto justify that, they say: We wanted to vote maybe because we wanted in \nthe end run to protect millionaires.\n  Well, millionaires do all right. I know a lot of millionaires. They \nhave told me, as the Senator from Iowa said earlier this morning, they \ncould afford the taxes they paid during the Clinton era because during \nthat era, they made more money than they had ever made. So they paid \nsome of the higher taxes. So what. The amount of money they had at the \nend of the year was greater than it ever had been.\n  But we know what happened during that Clinton era. We balanced the \nbudget--incidentally, not a single Republican voted for the plan. In \nfact, they gave speeches on the floor that the plan would bring about \nrecession, even a depression. Instead, the economy grew faster than it \never had before. People had more money in their pockets than they ever \nhad before. We balanced the budget, and we started paying down the \nnational debt.\n  When the next administration came in, they gave everybody, including \nmillionaires, a big tax cut. But worse than that, they began a war in \nIraq that never should have begun, against Iraq, which had nothing to \ndo with 9/11, even though we had the Vice President of the United \nStates suggesting in his speeches it was connected with 9/11, claiming \nthere were weapons of mass destruction, even though those who actually \nread the intelligence--as the former vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, Senator Graham of Florida, did, and I did--realized there \nwere no weapons of mass destruction. But they voted for this war.\n  One of the bad mistakes they made--other than the tragic mistake of \ngoing to a war we had no reason to go to; one that cost us thousands of \nAmerican lives and countless thousands of other lives and $1 trillion--\nthey did something we had never done before in the history of this \ncountry, they said: We will go to that war on a credit card. We will \njust borrow the money.\n  Vietnam was an unpopular war, but we had a surtax to pay for it. \nKorea was an unpopular war. We paid for it. World War II--we knew it \nwas the survival of our Nation, and we paid for it. In Iraq, we have \nspent $1 trillion and we will be spending for longer than any of us in \nthis body will probably live, as we pay for the damage to so many of \nour brave men and women, and we borrowed the money. We took the \nsurpluses built up over the Clinton era and wasted them.\n  We are doing the same thing in Afghanistan. This is a country where \nour reason for going in there was to get Osama bin Laden. When the \ndecision was made to go into Iraq, it allowed Osama bin Laden to \nescape. We go into a nation-building war, which seems to have no end, \nagain, on a credit card. Osama bin Laden has been dead now for some \ntime. We ought to--to use a phrase of a former Senator from Vermont--we \nought to declare victory and get out. But, again, we are doing it on a \ncredit card.\n  So what do we say? We have two wars we should not be in, and we say: \nBut we have to pay for it. We ought to take some money away from senior \ncitizens. We ought to take money away from education. We ought to take \nmoney away from medical research. We ought to take money away from \nrebuilding what needs to be done in our country to pay for two wars we \nput on our credit card.\n  Come on. As one Vermonter said to me: You spend all this money to \nbuild these roads and bridges in Iraq and Afghanistan and then they \nblow them up.\n\n[[Page S8560]]\n\nWhy don't you rebuild our roads and bridges in America? We Americans \nwill take care of them.\n  So with all the talk of where we are, let's not forget the big \nelephant in the room; that is, two wars on a credit card--one going far \nlonger than it had any reason to, the other one totally unnecessary in \nthe first place--as much as a couple trillion dollars between the two \nof them. That was money that could have been spent in America for \nAmericans to make America better. We have wasted it there. Now we say: \nHow can we punish Americans--the average American. How can we punish \nthem for the mistakes we made in going into two wars. We will punish \nthem to pay for it.\n  Come on. Let's face up to reality.\n  I suspect I may have more to say on this in the future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are at the last hour, if you will, the \nlast day for sure, in dealing with what has become probably the biggest \nfiscal crisis our country has dealt with in some time. I have heard a \nnumber of my colleagues from the other side come down and talk about \nthe importance of getting a solution. We all want to get a solution. We \ndo not want to have a situation tomorrow where tax rates go up on \neverybody across this country who has an income tax liability. We \nobviously do not want to see our defense have to deal with what would \nbe deep cuts in our national security budget. Those are two things that \nwill happen tomorrow unless Congress can act to prevent that.\n  So count me among those who want to see a solution. I certainly hope \nthe negotiations that are occurring right now can conclude in a way \nthat will give us an outcome that prevents those tax rates from \nincreasing on Americans across this country and also put in place some \nthings that would actually deal with the real problem. The real problem \nis our country spends too much.\n  We are where we are because we have not done our work when we should \nhave previously. Think about the fact that for 3 consecutive years--3 \nyears in a row--in the Senate, we have not passed a budget. We spend \n$3.5 trillion of American taxpayer money every single year, and for 3 \nconsecutive years we have not had a budget. The majority leader and the \nchairman of the Budget Committee and others on the other side have \nsaid: We passed a budget control act in August of 2011 and that sort of \nserves as our budget.\n  Frankly, that is not the case. The law requires us to pass a budget. \nWe have a budget act, enacted back in the 1970s, that requires the \nCongress, on an annual basis, to lay out a plan for how we are going to \nspend the American taxpayers' money. The reason we ended up with a \nbudget control act back in August of 2011 is because we failed to pass \na budget earlier in the year.\n  For 3 consecutive years in the Senate we have not passed a budget. \nThat is not to say our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol--the \nHouse of Representatives--have not acted responsibly. You may disagree \nwith how they did it, but at least they did it. They passed a budget. \nThe Senate, of course, has not for now 3 consecutive years.\n  So we went through this entire year. Everybody knew this was coming. \nThis is not a surprise. This is the most forecast and foretold disaster \nwe have ever seen. As we approached December 31 and the deadline we are \ndealing with today, we knew that starting January 1 taxes were going to \ngo up on all Americans, at least all Americans who have an income tax \nliability, and we knew these cuts that were put in place in the Budget \nControl Act in August of 2011 were going to occur.\n  There should not be any element of surprise. We have known about this \nfor a long time. Yet for month after month after month after month this \nyear, nothing was done about it. I say nothing in the Senate; again, \nthe House of Representatives, early this year--last summer--passed \nlegislation that would extend the tax rates for everybody for 1 year. \nThey passed legislation that would replace the across-the-board cuts \nthat will start to take effect on January 2 with responsible spending \nreductions that actually do something to bend the curve of all these \nrunaway programs, entitlement costs that are going to bankrupt this \ncountry in future years. They made some necessary reforms. Again, \npeople may not agree with them. Obviously, there should be a process \nwhere in the Senate we have an opportunity to vote on a budget and make \namendments. Perhaps we would do it a different way. I might have voted \nfor something entirely different. But the point is, I did not have \nanything to vote for. Nobody over here did.\n  We have been here for a whole year, and now we have people coming up \nand saying: Gee, I hope, I truly wish these negotiations will get us to \nan outcome. It is December 31. January 1 is tomorrow. It will be 2013. \nTaxes will go up. Everybody agrees it will be a disaster for the \neconomy. We cannot allow that to happen. It will ruin the economy.\n  Where were we? Where were we for the past month and the month before \nthat and the month before that, dealing with what we knew was going to \nbe this very set of circumstances we face today?\n  I find it very hard to sit and listen to people come up now and wring \ntheir hands and talk about: Gee whiz, I hope we can get something done \nin the last day--as we put two people together basically to resolve \nthis.\n  There was a discussion--in fact, everybody says: Well, you know, the \npeople who are getting together--it was the President and the Speaker \nat one time; it was Senator McConnell and Senator Reid at one time; now \nit is Senator McConnell and Vice President Biden--but up until Friday, \nSenator McConnell, the Republican leader, had not been consulted, had \nnot been advised, had not been involved in any of this. So he gets the \ncall at the last minute to try and come in and sort of rescue this, \nstarts a negotiation that goes over the weekend, and then Saturday \nnight makes a proposal to the Senate Democrats, and was told: We will \nreact to your proposal by 10 o'clock Sunday morning. Ten o'clock Sunday \nmorning passes, 11 o'clock, noon, 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock. He comes to the \nfloor and says: We have not heard back. Then the majority leader comes \nup and says: Look, we do not have a counteroffer. We do not have a \nproposal.\n  So Senator McConnell then gets on the phone with Vice President \nBiden, and that is now where those discussions are occurring. They are \noccurring between Vice President Biden and Senator McConnell.\n  But my point is this: There are two people in a room deciding \nincredibly consequential issues for this country, while 99 other \nSenators and 435 Members of the House of Representatives--elected by \ntheir constituencies to come to Washington and to represent them--are \non the sidelines.\n  Why didn't we have a bill on the floor of the Senate we could \nactually debate? Why didn't we put something out here under regular \norder, open it, allow Senators to offer amendments, allow them to have \namendments voted on? I might not have liked that outcome. Maybe I would \nnot have. Maybe I could not have voted for the final product. But at \nleast we would have had an opportunity to debate this, instead of \nwaiting now until the eleventh hour, where two people are gathered in a \nprivate room, trying to negotiate something that has enormous \nconsequences for this country and for our economy.\n  We are where we are because this process was grossly mismanaged up \nuntil this point. So now we are faced with a crisis. There is great \ndrama. If we listen to all the TV stations--at least those that cover \nwhat is going on here--they are all talking about the fiscal cliff. \nInstead of a countdown to the new year, we have a countdown to when we \nhit the fiscal cliff.\n  What does that say? It is the most predictable financial crisis we \nhave ever known about. We have known about it for months. We have known \nabout it since the temporary tax provisions were put in place 2 years \nago. Yet here we are in the eleventh hour on the final day trying to \nnegotiate with two people in a room making decisions that will have a \nprofound impact on the future of this country.\n  I have to say that as I think about those negotiations that are going \non,\n\n[[Page S8561]]\n\nmost of what is being talked about is who will pay more in taxes. It is \nnot a question of if, it is who is going to pay more in taxes. The \nironic thing about it is that in those discussions--at least to my \nknowledge of them--there is very little being discussed, if anything, \nthat deals with how this country is going to figure out a way to spend \nless, which is the problem.\n  OK, I mean, let's face it, Washington, DC, does not have a taxing \nproblem, we have a spending problem. Now, Republicans have said and we \nare willing to consider, contemplate this idea of having more revenues \nin the equation. Granted, the President won an election and there is a \nmajority of Democrats here in the Senate. That is their view. \nObviously, we have a Republican House of Representatives that has a \ndifferent point of view about how to solve this and is trying to do it \nby extending the rates for everybody so that nobody has their rates go \nup in the middle of a weak economy. There is a big difference of \nopinion about how to resolve this.\n  But I would argue to my colleagues on both sides that if what comes \nout of these discussions is something that raises additional revenue, \nthat raises taxes on people in this country, it will not do anything to \nsolve the problem. In fact, if you give the President of the United \nStates everything he wants in terms of tax increases, you will raise \nenough revenue next year to fund the Federal Government for less than a \nsingle week. So what do we do for the other 358 days of the year? A \nsingle week--that is what all of these tax increases would amount to in \nterms of additional revenue.\n  This is not a revenue problem. This is a spending problem that can \nonly be solved by having the political courage to confront the \nchallenges that face this country, not just in the near term but in the \nlong term, and get us on a sustainable fiscal path. That means we have \nto confront runaway spending and programs that, if not reformed, are \ngoing to bankrupt this country and saddle our children and \ngrandchildren with an unbelievable burden of debt and a lower standard, \na lower quality of life than anything we or any previous generation--\nwell, not any previous generation but certainly our generation has \nexperienced.\n  That is where we are today. We are talking about how much taxes are \ngoing to go up. And those taxes are going to hit people who create \njobs. If you use the $250,000 level, there are about 1 million small \nbusinesses that will be impacted by these tax increases, and they \nemploy 25 percent of the American workforce. So we have a lot of \nmiddle-class Americans whose jobs depend on the very small businesses \nthat are going to see their taxes go up. This will impact middle-\nincome, middle-class families in this country if taxes go up on small \nbusinesses.\n  If that level is raised to $400,000, it will affect fewer, obviously. \nIf it is raised to 500,000, it will affect even fewer small businesses. \nBut the point simply is this: You are hitting literally hundreds of \nthousands of small businesses that create millions of jobs for middle-\nclass Americans with new taxes they will be paying, and that can't do \nanything but hurt the very economy we all say we want to get back on \nits feet.\n  So we are talking about tax increases at a time we ought to be \ntalking about spending. Why do I say that? Well, if we go back to 2007, \nbefore the recession, the revenues coming into the Federal Government \nwere about $2\\1/2\\ trillion give or take, round numbers, about $2\\1/2\\ \ntrillion. Well, this year revenues coming into the Federal Government \nare going to be back to about $2\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  We went through a terrible recession. People call it the great \nrecession. It had a profound impact on the economy--obviously a lot \nless economic growth, and a recession leads to lower government \nrevenues. So we had a period where government revenues dropped. Well, \ngovernment revenues are now back to where they were in 2007.\n  Spending in 2007 was about $2.7 trillion. Today it is more than $3\\1/\n2\\ trillion. So spending has increased by almost $1 trillion--almost $1 \ntrillion in the last 5 years, at a time when the revenues have stayed \nrelatively flat. But the point simply is this: The reason we are \nrunning a trillion-dollar deficit this year and the year after that and \nthe year after that is because the spending of the Federal Government \nhas exploded in the last 5 years. So this is not a revenue problem. The \nrevenues are essentially the same as they were 5 years ago.\n  Arguably, people would say that if we have a growing economy, we \nought to get more revenue. And we would if we had a growing economy. \nThe goal ought to be to get the economy growing again in a more robust \nfashion so that we are generating additional revenues coming into the \nFederal Government that would make these problems, the dimensions of \nthose problems look smaller by comparison. That is why policies that \nhurt the economy, that slow economic growth--and everybody concludes \nthat raising taxes in the middle of a weak economy is a bad idea if you \nare interested in generating more economic growth and creating jobs. \nThat, to me, seems to be just intuitive. I think everybody would agree \nwith that, but certainly it is a well-known, documented fact among \neconomists that if you raise taxes, you are going to have lower \neconomic growth, you are going to reduce the rate at which the economy \ngrows and expands and therefore allows for job creation in this \ncountry.\n  The best thing we can go to is to get the economy growing and \nexpanding again, and then all of these problems look much smaller by \ncomparison. That means having policies in place that allow small \nbusinesses to do what they do best, and that is to create jobs, that \nprovide incentives to invest and to hire people. When you operate in a \nperiod of economic uncertainty like we have today with these uncertain \ntax rates, where you have tax rates that are going to go up, regulatory \nburdens that continue to go up, you constantly make it more expensive \nand more difficult for small businesses to create jobs. Creating jobs \nand growing the economy ought to be our goal. That is so \ncounterintuitive, to think that raising taxes would somehow accomplish \nthat goal.\n  So as we sit here on the last day before these tax rates go up, as we \ntry to scramble now at the last minute to find a resolution, I would \nsimply say and urge my colleagues that we not let this happen again, \nthat we not be here next year or the year after waiting while two \npeople sit in a room and try to cut a deal that most of us have not \nbeen privy to or consulted about.\n\n  The American people obviously are the ones who are ultimately \nimpacted by that, but they have not had an opportunity to have a role \nin this, to observe what their elected leaders are doing to solve the \nbig problems that face this country. We ought to be functioning the way \nthe Senate used to function; that is, put bills on the floor, allow \namendments to be offered and voted on, and then whatever that outcome \nis, ultimately the House of Representative will pass their version of \nit, perhaps we will have a conference committee, and hopefully we can \nget something we can put on the President's desk. That is the way it \nused to work.\n  But now we are sitting here because we have twiddled our thumbs for \nmonth after month after month in the Senate and not passed a budget, \nnot dealt with this issue in any substantial or meaningful way, and now \nwe are sitting here on New Year's Eve--on New Year's Eve. The countdown \non the television is not how many hours and minutes are left until we \nhit the new year, the countdown on the television is the number of \nhours and minutes that are left until the country goes over the fiscal \ncliff.\n  Think about what that says about this process, about the Senate--100 \npeople elected to make big decisions to advance the interests of and \nput this country on a better path to a better future that is more \nsecure, more safe, and more prosperous for our children and \ngrandchildren. That is what should happen, but it should have happened \nmonths ago.\n  So I hope we get a result here today that addresses some of these \nissues--certainly, hopefully, something that will address the tax \nissue. But that does not solve the problem. If the President gets \neverything he wants in new taxes, it will fund the government for less \nthan a week. This is not a revenue problem. Washington does not tax \npeople too little, it spends too much. Until we recognize that and deal \nwith\n\n[[Page S8562]]\n\nwhat is driving Federal spending, we are going to continue to saddle \nfuture generations with more debt, with more liabilities, and with a \nlower standard of living and lower quality of life than we have \nexperienced. That is not fair to them.\n  It is time for us to demonstrate the political courage that is \nnecessary to take on the big issues and to have the votes. Let's have a \nbudget. Let's put it on the floor. Let's vote on it. Let's do something \naround here that matters, that is meaningful to the future of this \ncountry, rather than wait until the last day and the last hour and \nallow two people to sit in a room and decide the fate and the future of \nthis great country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, some of you may have heard that there is \nsomething called the fiscal cliff approaching and that we must do \nsomething about it or we will go over that cliff. But if you want to \nfix and do something about going over a cliff, you have to know what is \nthe fiscal cliff. Well, the fiscal cliff, apparently, is taxes going \nup. So it must be a bad thing if your taxes go up.\n  People have said: Well, it is kind of like having people drowning. \nAnd people are drowning. What does that mean? That is a bad thing. \nTaxes going up is a bad thing. So what are they telling us? Let's save \n98 out of 100 of them. Well, that sounds pretty good. I am for saving \nas many as we can. But that sort of implies that our policy is that \ndrowning is a good thing; that we are going to let 2 percent drown; \nthat raising taxes is bad if it happens to everyone--it is a cliff--but \nit is OK if it only happens to one or two people, and maybe you do not \nknow them, and maybe they are rich people and we don't care.\n  Does anybody work for rich people? Does anybody know somebody who \nworks at a car lot selling expensive cars but that person only makes \n$40,000 a year but he sells cars that are purchased by rich people? \nDoes anybody remember the yacht tax? We were going to go get those rich \npeople--had a special tax on yachts. Guess who lost their jobs. The \nworking guy making $50,000 and $60,000 a year, because the rich people \nwent to the Bahamas to buy their yachts. This is not about getting rich \npeople. This is about what it will do to the economy, what it is going \nto do to the average middle-class person who works for a rich person.\n  But you have to understand what the fiscal cliff is. You have to \nunderstand that the President is telling you that it is a cliff and it \nis bad, and everybody on television thinks it is terrible to go over \nthe cliff. What is the cliff? Taxes going up. But if it is bad for \ntaxes to go up for a bunch of people, why it is good for taxes to go up \non a small portion of people?\n  You say: Well they are rich. They can afford it.\n  Here is the problem. The rich pay most of the taxes in our country. \nThe top 2 percent pay half of the taxes. What you are saying is that \nthey are rich and they can afford it. But that is half of the Nation's \nincome that will have increased taxes. You will take money from the \nproductive sector, which is the private sector, and you will put it \ninto the nonproductive sector, which is Washington.\n  So if you want ditches to be dug and then to be filled again, send \nmore money to Washington. But if you want jobs to be created, if you \nwant the economy to thrive, you should want to leave that money in your \ncommunity. It should not matter to you whose money it is or who has it, \nyou want that money--in my case, we want that money in Kentucky. We do \nnot want to send it to Washington because there is no objective \nevidence that the money is well spent up here. There is no objective \nevidence that we are good with money up here. We should not send more \nmoney up here. We should leave more money in the private sector.\n  Now, Milton Friedman recognized this when he said: Nobody spends \nsomeone else's money as wisely as you spend your own. That in a \nnutshell, that in one sentence explains to you why the private sector \nis more efficient than the public sector. The public sector--it is not \nour money. So those of us up here who will spend it--that is why they \nspend $1 trillion more than they have each year. That is why they break \ntheir own budgetary rules. That is why there is no budget. That is why \nwe live in an era of runaway spending. That is why your government is \ninsolvent, your government is bankrupt.\n  Guess what. When you raise taxes on 2 percent of the people, there is \na chance you will not get any more tax revenue because when you raise \ntax rates, you sometimes get less revenue. And the converse is true--\nsometimes you lower rates and you actually get more revenue. In the \n1920s we lowered tax rates, and we got more revenue. Guess what. The \nrich paid a higher percentage of the revenue when we lowered rates.\n  We did it again in the 1960s under Kennedy. We did it again under \nReagan. We grew at 7 percent one year under Reagan because we lowered \nrates and we unleashed an economic boom. That is what we want.\n  Do we want a government that is just envious, jealous, and wants to \npunish people or do we want a government that has sane and rational \npolicies that will allow the economy to grow? That is what happened in \nthe 1980s. We had 7 percent growth one year. We had millions of jobs \ncreated.\n  Mark my words. You will raise tax rates, and you will feel good \nbecause you went after and got those rich people because you said you \nwere. You campaigned against rich people, you have enough envy whipped \nup in the country, you are going to get them, and you are going to \nstick it to those rich people. But guess what. You may not get any more \nrevenue, you may not get any more economic growth, but you can say: I \nstuck it to the rich people.\n  That is what we are talking about. Some of you may say, well, we are \ngoing to do this, but maybe we will do something about spending at the \nsame time. The one thing they are taking off the table is spending \nrestraint. There will be no spending restraint. In fact, whatever deal \ncomes out of here will increase spending. That is part of the deal. We \nare going to raise taxes, and we are going to raise spending. Tell me \nwhat is good about that.\n  There is a cliff approaching. It is not the cliff we hear about on \nTV. The cliff is a debt cliff. There is a debt crisis in our country. \nWe now have a debt that equals our GDP. Our debt equals our economy. We \nare borrowing--while we are today dithering over a deal that will do \nnothing--we will borrow $4 billion today. We are borrowing $50,000 \nevery second. Each man, woman, and child in this country owes more per \ncapita in debt than they do in Greece.\n  So, by all means, let's complete a deal today so we can go home. \nLet's complete a deal. Let's raise taxes. Let's stick it to those rich \npeople. Let's not touch spending, and let's pretend as if we have done \nsomething. The deal will do absolutely nothing to save this country.\n  Two-thirds of our spending is entitlements. The President has taken \nentitlements off the table. We will not reform the entitlement \nprograms. Why are the entitlement programs broken? Is it Republicans' \nfault or Democrats' fault? No, it is your great-grandparents' fault. \nThey had too many kids. It has nothing to do with partisan politics. \nThere were a whole bunch of babies born after the war, and then there \nhave been less babies born with each generation. It is nobody's fault, \nbut it is not working. We spend more on Social Security than comes in \nin taxes. That is a problem.\n  On Medicare, it is even worse. We spend $3 for every dollar we \ncollect in Medicare. Does anybody think that is going to work? It has \nbeen going on for a long time now and it is getting worse. We owe $35 \nto $40 trillion on Medicare, and it is not getting any better.\n  So what do the retirement groups say? AARP says: Absolutely, don't \ntouch it. Oh, that is great. That is part of the solution. Don't touch \nit.\n  What does the President say? Entitlements are off the table.\n  What does the majority leader say? We will not do anything about \nentitlements. Oh, well, great. This is going to be a real great \nsolution. We are really going to do a lot--but we are going to stick it \nto rich people.\n  I hope nobody works for any of these rich people. I hope nobody sells \nany of this stuff to rich people.\n  So the thing is, look at what is going on up here, and when you ask \nfor action, don't ask for any action. We have\n\n[[Page S8563]]\n\nto figure out what the problem is before we can get to what we need to \ndo.\n  People say, well, we have raised taxes; we just need more revenue. \nSpending, as measured as a percentage of the economy, 4 years ago we \nwere spending 20 percent of our GDP. We are now spending 25 percent of \nour GDP. When we say on our side that it is a spending problem, it \nabsolutely is, it absolutely is, and it is out of control.\n  Guess what. Most of it is called mandatory spending. That means \nentitlements. We can't do anything about it. They are now taken off the \ntable.\n  Now, about a year ago, you may remember there was this big debate, \nthe Budget Control Act. There was a big debate over raising the debt \nceiling, and they attached to it some slowdown in spending. Now, these \nwere not cuts; the sequester is not a cut in spending. It is repeated \nall the time on TV that the sequester is a cut, but it is not a cut; it \nis a slowdown in the rate of growth. But it is at least going in the \nright direction.\n  So what is the one thing we hear now that is going to be part of this \ndeal? We are going to get rid of the sequester. So the one even \npretend, make-believe attempt to try to slow down spending, they are \ngoing to jettison it. They are going to kick the can down the road--but \nwe are going to get those rich people. We are going to attack those \nrich people.\n  We have to wake up soon as a country. We are literally insolvent. \nSome say, well, we are a great and powerful country. Bad things could \nnever happen to us. It can, and it has happened to great civilized \ncountries. Do you know what they do. Great and civilized countries can \ndestroy their currency. We have printed trillions upon trillions of \ndollars, and we are in danger of destroying the very value of our \ncurrency.\n  So instead of having a President who runs around saying he is going \nto stick it to rich people, what we really need are honest people to go \naround the country and say to people: If you are working class or you \nare retired, the government is stealing from you. The government is \nstealing your savings through big government. On the one hand, they \noffer you something. They offer you baubles. They offer you something \nfor free: Here is a cell phone. Just take the cell phone and vote for \nme. It will be OK.\n  The problem is, it is not free. On the one hand, you get the free \ncell phone. On the other hand, you get $4 gas. On the other hand, you \nget food costs rising.\n  Why do prices go up? Because we run a deficit giving you free stuff, \nand then we print money to pay for it, and that steals value from what \nyou have. It is not that gas is more precious; gas is rising because \nthe value of the dollar is shrinking. Food is rising because the value \nof the dollar is shrinking.\n  So big government isn't your friend, and deficits are not your \nfriend. We hang in the balance up here and nobody is serious about it.\n  What is the one thing that has been taken off the table? Spending. We \nwill not cut any spending. So we are looking for a deal that will raise \ntaxes, which everybody seems to equate with drowning--except we are \nonly going to make a few people drown, and they are rich anyway. But I \nthink drowning is a policy. Drowning, even if it is selective drowning, \nbeing in favor of selective drowning is not a good policy.\n  What I have said and what I tell people is let your representatives \nknow. Let your Senators know that you would rather have some kind of \nserious fix to the problem rather than kicking the can down the road; \nthat you would rather have them actually do something that would allow \nthe economy to grow, would allow jobs to be created, and, as a \nconsequence, government would bring in more revenue.\n  The only thing proven to ever bring in more revenue is economic \ngrowth. What is going on right now? We are growing at a little under 2 \npercent. When the President, 2 years ago, extended all the tax rates \nand chose not to raise tax rates, we were growing faster. He said we \ndon't want to rock the economy, and he agreed to extend all tax breaks. \nBut now I think he is hell bent on raising taxes.\n  Realize that what you are going to get is raising taxes, more money \ntaken out of the private sector and given to the government, the \ninefficient sector. Don't count on that new money coming in going to \nmake the debt smaller; count on it funding more programs.\n  You will notice, if you look carefully at whatever this fiscal cliff \ndeal is, there will not be spending cuts, but there will be spending \nproposals. So we are going to try to tax rich people more and get more \nmoney. It may not work because often you raise rates and get less \nrevenue. We are going to try that, but we take the money that we get \nfrom rich people, and we are going to immediately spend it on more \nfoolhardy programs, which is what we have been doing up here. We are \nnot going to fix the problem, we are going to perpetuate the problem.\n  What I would argue for is we should be doing the opposite. We, the \nRepublican Party, the party of limited government and low taxation, \nshould have no part in this. We should have no fingerprints on this, \nand we should in no way support anything that raises taxes because it \nis bad economic policy.\n  So I, for one, will not support any proposal that comes out that does \nnot cut spending and raises taxes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8563-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8563-S8565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

That is a huge turnoff because ideological rigidity and \nexcessive partisanship are impediments to getting people to come \ntogether with commonsense decisions for solutions.\n  Obviously, there is an easy way. Hopefully that is what is being \ntweaked at the moment in a final solution, with the President to speak \nin about 30 minutes. I hope so.\n  Mr. President, I am going to leave you with this thought. My \ncolleagues know that a little over a quarter century ago, I had the \nprivilege of seeing our home planet from the perspective of looking \nthrough the window of a spacecraft. It was the 24th flight of the space \nshuttle. It was early in the space shuttle program. It is indelibly \netched in my mind's eye, as I looked back at Earth, what I saw. I did \nnot see political divisions. I did not see religious divisions. I did \nnot see ethnic divisions. What I saw is that we were all in this \ntogether, all a part of planet Earth. If we could remember that in our \npolitics, we would all get along so much better. I hope that stays \nindelibly etched in my mind's eye and that we ultimately prevail in \nthis momentous decision of avoiding the fiscal cliff.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8564]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, there is a lot of buzzing going on \naround the Capitol today. Here we are on New Year's Eve, and so many of \nus had hoped we would have an agreement that would be really a big \nagreement, a long-term agreement that we would have liked to have had \nfinished maybe by September, certainly by October, but that was not to \nbe. In fact, as we saw in the elections of this year, our country is \ndivided and our House here is divided as well. So it has been hard to \ncome to terms.\n  It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government, \nexcept for all the rest, because when we have opinions, when we have \nfree speech, when we have elections that put a Democratic majority in \nthe Senate and a Republican majority in the House, we know there is not \ngoing to be a clear and precise path. But in the end, it is the best \nbecause we have all expressed our opinions and everyone has been heard.\n  We have had countless meetings in the last few weeks trying to see \nwhere people could give and where they couldn't. I have said from the \nbeginning that I am optimistic because I think our democracy will work \nin the end. From what I am hearing from the different leaders, we are \nclose to an agreement. We are not there, but it is a starting point and \ncertainly a point at which there is already some agreement.\n  It may not seem as though it should be so hard, but once we do have \nthe framework of an agreement, there are a lot of decisions that have \nto be made. We have to talk among Senate Democrats and Republicans, and \nthen we have to go to the House and talk to Republicans and Democrats. \nI think one thing that is clear is there has to be a substantial number \nof votes on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Rotunda. We \nwill not pass something with all Democratic votes or all Republican \nvotes because it will not pass in the other House. So I think there is \na lot of refining of what is a pretty good agreement in the making, but \nthe refining has not yet been finished. I have abiding hope that we \nwill get there.\n\n\n                            Time to Reflect\n\n  Since this may possibly be my last day as a U.S. Senator--at least my \nlast time to vote. Up until January 2, I am a U.S. Senator, but \nactually being able to participate at this late date has given me some \ntime to reflect. I so appreciate some of the major communications and \nopportunities I have had with the real people in my home State of Texas \nand beyond. I always think of the many times I have been able to meet \nwith our troops in harm's way.\n  In the early years of my tenure in the Senate, our troops were in \nharm's way in Bosnia, where there were many conflicts, and I got to \nvisit with them and see what their concerns were and what was on their \nminds, and then into Iraq and then into Afghanistan. I have visited all \nof these places and had the chance to talk to our troops. What a person \ncomes away with when they have that opportunity is the understanding \nthat America is in good hands with our younger generation. They have \nsuch a great spirit.\n  I went to the Brooke Army Medical Center Hospital in San Antonio and \nvisited with a young man who had lost both legs in an IED explosion. He \nhad been able to get used to that situation for maybe 2 weeks. So it is \nreasonable to say he had had the shock of his life. So I went into his \nroom, and there is his wife and his little daughter, who was about the \nsame age as my daughter, sitting there with him.\n  He says to me: Senator, they won't let me go back, and that is where \nI want to be.\n  Then his darling wife pipes up and says: You know what, they took \nhalf of you and they are not getting the other half.\n  Now, if that isn't a story, for both of them to have such a spirit. I \nwas so touched by that.\n  Just in the last month or so, I was back in San Antonio visiting the \nwonderful Center for the Intrepid they have for the wounded warriors \nand their families. It is a recreation center, and it is a place where \nthey can go and cook food and have family meetings. They can play \ngames, and they have extensive learning opportunities with computer \nrooms. It is a wonderful center they have put together, the people of \nSan Antonio.\n  This was all spearheaded by a wounded warrior who had been cooped up \nin a room and wanted to have some ability to get outside the room with \nhis family and have some experiences even though he was still going \nthrough treatment. He started raising money, and he raised it from the \ncommunity and from many other wounded warriors, as well as military \npersonnel, but a lot of the citizens of San Antonio and Texas stepped \nforward. So this is a wonderful place.\n  I met a wonderful young man who lost his arm and parts of two of his \nlegs. He was a West Point graduate. He was sitting there, again with \nhis beautiful wife, and I was visiting with him.\n  He said: I just want to be able to continue to contribute.\n  And I thought, oh my goodness, here is a West Point graduate who has \nso much to give and who wants to continue to give. So I came back and I \nwrote a letter to General Odierno, the Chief of Staff of the Army, and \nI told him about the young man who lost most of three limbs out of four \nand who wants to keep contributing. What about making him a military \nfellow, as we have in our offices, as the Presiding Officer knows? We \nhave military fellows who are Active-Duty military, and they help us. \nWe can have one a year. They help us by providing the military \nperspective on the things we are doing. Of course, because I have \nserved on the Defense Subcommittee and the Military Construction \nSubcommittee of Appropriations and the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nlove to have those military fellows.\n  I was so pleased that within just a month or so, when the choices \nwere made for military fellows, this young man was chosen by the Army \nwith the support of General Odierno, whose own son also has lost an arm \nin combat.\n  So I think that is a wonderful thing and that on reflection is one of \nthe highlights of my moments to remember.\n  I also remember some of the great things my staff has done. I have to \nsay, my staff has been the can-do staff of all time. They never take no \nfor an answer. So when we have challenges, individuals who need help--\nit may be a veterans' benefit; it may be a Social Security problem--\nthey have always had the reputation as the staff who tries to do \neverything possible to come through.\n  I am very pleased the Senator who is going to take my place on \nJanuary 3 is going to have my staff director for case work, Joyce \nSibley--who has had such a great reputation--continue in that position. \nShe knows the issues. She knows the people. She will be great. I \napplaud Senator-elect Ted Cruz for making that decision and for keeping \nmost of the staff who have done this wonderful work.\n  But let me give a couple examples. First of all, we got a frantic \ncall from a friend of mine about a doctor who was trapped on top of \nMount Everest. He was a Dallas doctor, and he was trapped up there in a \nblizzard and not expected to live. They had a terrible loss of some of \nthe people in their climbing group, and a friend called and said: Is \nthere anything you can do?\n  My wonderful staff, one of whom is retired military and knows so many \nof the things that could be done, Dave Davis, and Carolyn Kobey, who \nhandles this casework in my Dallas office. Carolyn actually got in \ntouch with the Nepalese Armed Forces and as a result of Carolyn's \nefforts, they were able to get a helicopter up. Once you get past a \ncertain level--13,000 feet--you have to have oxygen in a helicopter or, \nobviously, if you are climbing.\n  So it was something that was a real ask of the Nepalese Air Force and \nwe were able to get them to take that risk and to go up and they were \nable to rescue Dr. Beck Weathers. He is alive and wrote a great book \nabout that experience from his vantage point. But we were very pleased \nto be able to take part in something such as that.\n  I will tell you, maybe the all time great experience was in my \nHouston office, led by Jason Fuller. We got a call in the Dallas \noffice, and so the Houston and Dallas offices together did this. We got \na call in the Dallas office from a woman in Mississippi. She said: I \ndidn't know who else to call, but I knew Senator Hutchison's name. My \nson is having an asthma attack in Houston, and\n\n[[Page S8565]]\n\nI don't know how to get him the help he needs. He is in his apartment \nby himself.\n  My staff said: Please give us the information. We will call our \nHouston office, and we will see if we can get help, which they did. \nThey called the Houston office. The Houston office called 9-1-1. They \nwent out to the young man's apartment. He was, in fact, in a dire \ncircumstance and would have died had he not gotten help right away. But \nthey took him in. They gave him the help he needed, and that young man \nis alive today.\n  So these instances are some of the great memories I will have of \nhaving a wonderful staff who will go the extra mile and try to help the \nindividuals in our State as well as on the big issues where we also try \nto make sure we do everything we can to get something that is very \nimportant to us, whether it is to America or to Texas or to Texans or \nto Americans.\n  These are some of the memories I will take with me as I leave this \ngreat body. As I said in my actual formal farewell speech, it is easy \nto be critical. I saw on television this morning that the esteem of \nCongress has fallen to 5 percent favorable. I am not surprised at that. \nAs my colleague John McCain once said: Now we are down to blood \nrelatives and paid staff. It is easy to criticize, and there are a lot \nof reasons to criticize. I will admit things have not been as \nproductive and most certainly the acrimony does show sometimes.\n  But I am going to say, as I leave, after almost 20 years in this \nbody, the people here are all dedicated. There is not one who is not a \ndedicated patriotic American. We disagree, sometimes violently \ndisagree, on the way we should get to our goals. But our agreement is \non the goal of keeping America the beacon of freedom to the world, to \nkeeping our military strong, to doing right by all our people, whether \nit is a small businessperson who is creating jobs who is trying to go \nup the ladder of success or whether it is someone who is in trouble \nbecause they have had a huge setback in their lives. Everyone here \nwants America to continue to be the magnet for the world. We want to be \nthe science and technology innovators who will continue to fuel our \neconomy. It is just how we get there that causes the disagreement.\n  We have patriotic people who have been elected. I hope for the next 2 \nyears we will put aside the partisan politics, put aside the thoughts \nof future elections, and try to solve the big issues of our time, \nbecause there is a lot of intelligence in this body. There is a lot of \nability to come together. I keep the abiding faith that our messy \ndemocracy will, in fact, prevail because I cannot think of going to \nanything else. As long as we can function and show the world we can \ngovern, as we disagree, that will be the example that will forever make \nour country the best and, hopefully, be a model for others to not think \nyou have to take to the streets, not think you need guns to have the \ngovernment you want but to show that peaceful transition can be done \nand also that we can have a lot of discussion, a lot of disagreements, \nbut we can do it civilly.\n  I leave this body knowing if we just remember the honor we have of \ngrowing up in the greatest Nation on Earth, we will recognize that it \nis our responsibility to give the same to our children and \ngrandchildren. It is the least we can do.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I just listened to the President, and my \nheart is still pounding. I was very disappointed to hear what the \nPresident just had to say in front of a pep rally--something very \nunbecoming of where we are at this moment.\n  It is my understanding that most of the tax issues have been worked \nout--should have been worked out on the floor in regular order. I think \nmost of the Senate is very distressed that we are in a situation where \nthe negotiations are taking place all of this time and it is not being \ndone through regular order, but that is the way things are today in the \nSenate.\n  But I just heard the President say that in dealing with the sequester \nthat was put in place to reduce spending--it was part of a $2.1 \ntrillion package to reduce spending so that we could raise the debt \nceiling back in August of 2011. No one ever thought we would end up in \nthis place where the sequester would be enacted, but it was done so \nthat we would reduce spending.\n  I notice my friend from Arizona is here. He has been one of the best \nthere is to focus on defense spending and how it should be done, and I \nknow he would like to see things happen in a very different way in that \nregard.\n  But I just heard the President say that the way we are going to deal \nwith this sequester is in a balanced way, through revenues and through \nreduced spending. I just want to go on record here on the Senate \nfloor--I know there are negotiations that are taking place, but the \nsequester was to be dealt with and substituted with other spending \nreductions, not through revenues. I hope all those who are involved in \nbringing this together understand that even on the Democratic side, \nthat was the understanding. Not only was it to be dealt with through \nspending reductions if these were considered to be ham-handed--and they \nare, and we should deal with them in a different way--but they were to \nbe dealt with in the same time period. In other words, we weren't going \nto reduce $100 billion of the sequester and pay for it over 10 years; \nit was to be done during the same amount of time.\n  So I know the President has fun heckling Congress. I think he lost \nprobably numbers of votes with what he did. He didn't lose mine; I am \nnot that way; I am going to look at the substance. But it is \nunfortunate that he doesn't spend as much time working on solving \nproblems as he does on campaigns and pep rallies.\n  But I just want to say that I am very disappointed in what the \nPresident had to say, and I am one Senator. I just want to go on record \nthat it is absolutely unacceptable to pay for the sequester with \nrevenues.\n  Yesterday we had a meeting that broke down because all the money was \nbeing spent. The President campaigned for a year on raising taxes on \nthe upper income. We have acquiesced to that. We know it is going to \nhappen. But yesterday the deal was that all the money was going to be \nspent. There was going to be no deficit reduction. It is unbelievable--\nunbelievable that all of the money was going to be out the door as soon \nas it came in. As a matter of fact, before it came in, it was going to \nbe spent.\n  I just want to say that I know the President enjoys heckling and \nhaving pep rallies to try to get Congress to act instead of sitting \ndown and actually negotiating, but I hope that is what is going to \nhappen, is we will end up following through on the reductions in \nspending that need to take place to replace the sequester.\n  I will also add just for what it is worth that the last time we \nextended unemployment insurance, we paid for it. The last time we did \nnot cause the doc fix, the SGR, to go into place, we paid for it. And I \nhope that as this negotiation goes forward, we keep the same principles \nin place that we have had.\n  This country is over $16 trillion in debt. The sequester was put in \nplace because we couldn't reach an agreement on reductions, but we knew \nthey\n\n[[Page S8566]]\n\nhad to take place. Mr. President, I hope we will continue to honor the \nfact that the sequester--the $1.2 trillion that we don't like the way \nit is being implemented--will only be adjusted through other \nreductions. If that is not the case, count me out. I think most people \nin this body consider me to be a semireasonable person, but if that is \nnot what we do, count me out.\n  This country has a spending problem and a revenue problem, I agree \nwith that. I am willing to support revenues to deal with this problem, \nthe overall problem. But what I will not agree to is using revenues to \nreplace spending reductions that were part of the Budget Control Act; \nthat, candidly, we need further reductions in place to totally get this \ncountry where it needs to be.\n  With that, I know we have other Senators on the floor. I don't know \nwhat their response is to what just happened at the White House.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto follow Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak as to what is going on \nhere today as the new chair of the Senate full Committee on \nAppropriations. That means we are the committee that actually puts \nmoney in the Federal checkbook. I would like to talk about that \nbecause, you see, today here we are on New Year's Eve doing what we \nshould have done right after Labor Day.\n  We are behind the clock, and actually we are behind the thinking of \nthe American people. They want us to come together and have sensible \nfiscal policies that promote growth and at the same time balance it \nwith a new sense of frugality. The fact that we have come to this point \nwith this culture of delay in this institution I think is really \nunacceptable. But I don't want to go into the culture of the \ninstitution, I want to go into actual discussions of something called \nsequester and spending.\n  The words of Washington are a foreign language. We use words that \nnobody understands, and we use numbers that nobody believes. I am \ntelling you that with me, there is going to be a new day and a new \nway--plain talk, straight talk about what we are doing here.\n  So let's talk about the word ``sequester.'' Sequester literally means \nthat you are going to--sequester stands for an arcane government word \nthat means you are going to have automatic, across-the-board government \nspending cuts. These are supposed to be triggered if we don't resolve \nthe issues today and will happen on January 2.\n  What is being proposed is that we would cut $110 billion in 2013--$55 \nbillion in defense and $55 billion in nondefense. This means every \nsingle program--not programs that are dated, not programs that are \nbloated, not programs that might be for another era or only benefited a \nsmall group of people in a distant past, it means every single program. \nYes, there will be certain exemptions to that in terms of Social \nSecurity benefits, veterans' benefits, and certain things related to \nthe military.\n  Since we are already 3 months into the fiscal year, the impact of \nthese cuts will even be worse. So when you hear that we are cutting \ndeals on the sequester, we are actually talking about government \nspending.\n  Now let's talk about cuts. This is not the first time either party \nhas talked about cuts, nor is it the first time either party has \nstarted to talk about a sense of frugality. One party, however, wants \nto also understand that we need to be able to meet the compelling needs \nthat are in the mission of our government, and we have already given at \nthe office.\n  So let's talk about, oh, this could be new spending, and I don't want \nthis. The fact is that since 2010, not 2001--let's get our zeroes \nstraight for a change--since 2010 we have already cut domestic spending \nby $43 billion. We have already cut $43 billion. That is nearly 10 \npercent of domestic spending in just 3 years. That $43 billion was in \nnondefense programs.\n  Then there is talk about, oh, why don't we have a budget? On August \n2, 2011, we passed something called the Budget Control Act. That was \ndeemed to be the budget of the United States of America. In that Budget \nControl Act, they instructed those of us on the Appropriations \nCommittee to cut discretionary spending $1 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. The Appropriations Committee will honor the instructions of the \nBudget Committee, as approved by the Congress of the United States. We \nare on the program. We are on the same page. We are on the same \nglidepath. We don't have to have showdowns here.\n  So we have already cut actual dollars--an actual checkbook--of $43 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. Also, in the Budget Control Act, we \nare to cut $1 trillion over the next 10 years. That would meet what was \nbeing discussed in Simpson-Bowles and so on, so we need to understand \nthat.\n  Now let's go to this across-the-board cut. I see on the Senate floor \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona, a well-known advocate for our \nnational security, well versed over the years in the compelling needs \nour military must have to protect the Nation. I am sure he will speak \nto those needs, and I will also.\n  But I also want to speak about another dynamic, which is the impact \nof $55 billion across the board in discretionary spending. What I want \nto say is that if, in fact, we go ahead with this, we are going to cut \ndefense, there is no doubt about it, $55 billion, and it is going to be \na meat ax. That is not the way to go, that is not the way to treat our \nmilitary, and that is not the way to focus on our national security.\n  Secretary Panetta, along with the generals, General Dempsey, the head \nof the Joint Chiefs, has gone through his own budget. He has \nrecommendations where, out of the $66 billion of defense, how we could \nbegin to have a prudent way where we could begin to have modest \nreductions in the DOD account without jeopardizing national security.\n  I serve on the Intelligence Committee. I served with the Senator from \nArizona and other distinguished people. We are going to make sure we \ncan do this in our own way, but sequestration could really affect a \nvariety of things related to operations and maintenance.\n  Let me tell you what else there is. There are many other people who \ndefend the United States of America, and I am proud of them all. These \nare things such as our Federal law enforcement. With our Federal law \nenforcement, if we go into this meat ax approach, over 7,500 \npositions--because it will come out of personnel--will be affected. \nThis could affect as many as 3,000 Federal agents--3,000 Federal agents \nof the FBI, DEA, and ATF. They might not be laid off, but they are \ngoing to be furloughed. They are going to have short-term furloughs. \nThis is going to have a direct impact on morale, a direct impact on \nmission, and it will have a direct impact on protecting the American \npeople, whether it is from cyber threats, border control threats--all \nthese things they do. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug \nEnforcement Agency are absolutely important.\n  Then the other area is in homeland security. We could reduce the \nmission hours at the Coast Guard by as much as 50 percent. Now, the \nCoast Guard is absolutely crucial when it comes to drug interdiction \nand also protecting our borders from our waterways.\n  You know, a lot of people love the Weather Channel. I love the \nWeather Channel too. If you watch what they do in Alaska, down in \nFlorida, wherever they are, they are doing search and rescue and making \nsure drug dealers aren't using our waterways and byways to bring drugs \ninto the country and just standing sentry and protecting the United \nStates of America.\n  Again, we could talk about the border control, but then there is this \nwhole issue of the center for health and human services. Whatever you \nfeel about ObamaCare, that doesn't affect what goes on at the Centers \nfor Disease Control. Right now, the Centers for Disease Control and the \nFDA are trying to make sure we have food safety and drug safety and are \nwatching out to make sure there are no big outbreaks that spread.\n  All of us were horrified at the meningitis outbreak. We had a \nsituation with a medical technician who went State to State--he was \nkind of a technician by hire--who spread terrible meningitis by \ninjecting dirty needles into people who needed steroid injections \nbecause of their back.\n\n[[Page S8567]]\n\n  So we need the FDA. We need the Centers for Disease Control. They are \nout there working to protect our American people. Remember, they are \nthe ones who discovered Legionnaires' disease.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I have a commitment to the gentleman from Arizona, and \nI will honor that commitment both in speaking here and in dealing with \nthese issues.\n  Mr. President, the point I am making is this across-the-board meat \naxe approach has very serious consequences. Let's use prudence and \ndelay them, I would hope, for at least 1 year or 2 years and not a \nmatter of weeks. But I am saying, and I promise, we do have methods for \ngetting our spending under serious discipline.\n  I yield the floor, and I look forward to working with my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland as \nalways for her usual courtesy, and I think she had a very important \nmessage. I appreciate not only the words themselves but her eloquence \nand passion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from South \nCarolina be included in a colloquy during my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Presidential Leadership\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I, as I believe all of us have, just \nfinished watching the President's remarks at--I guess it was the \nExecutive Office Building. I am not sure yet, as I sort out my \nimpressions of the President's remarks, whether to be angry or to be \nsaddened.\n  I have been around this town for a number of years, and as is well \nknown, I had more than an academic interest in the Presidency. I have \nwatched a lot of Presidents, going back to President Reagan, from the \nstandpoint of being a Member of Congress, and I have seen these other \ncrises as we have gone through them--whether it was the potential \nshutdown of the government when Newt Gingrich was Speaker of the House, \nor the crisis of the debt limit expiring, and a number of others. It is \nsometimes, unfortunately, the way we do business here.\n  But I must say, at a time of crisis, on New Year's Eve, when at \nmidnight, at least, certain actions will take place or have to be \nplanned to take place, today we had the President of the United States \nhaving a cheerleading, ridiculing-of-Republicans exercise in speaking \nto the people of the United States of America. As I have watched other \nPresidents address crises, the way they were able to address them and \nresolve them--with Presidential leadership, and that is why we elect \nPresidents, to lead--was by calling the leaders of both parties to the \nWhite House to sit around the table and do the negotiations and the \ndiscussions.\n  Sometimes concessions have to be made; compromises have to be made. \nBut what did the President of the United States just do? He kind of \nmade funny--he made a couple of jokes, laughed about how people are \ngoing to be here for New Year's Eve, and then sent a message of \nconfrontation to the Republicans. I believe he said: If they think they \nare going to do that, then they have another thought coming.\n  I guess I have to wonder--and I think the American people have to \nwonder--whether the President wants this issue resolved or is it to his \nshort-term political benefit for us to go over the cliff. I can assure \nthe President of the United States that historians judge Presidents by \ntheir achievements.\n  Now, we all read the polls. We, Republicans, know what is in the \npolls; that is, the majority of the American people--50-some percent--\nsupport and approve of this President. We also see the approval ratings \nof Congress--10, 11, 12, 9, 15 percent, whatever it is. I haven't seen \none that high lately. But historians judge Presidents by what happens \non their watch, and this President just made comments which clearly--\nclearly--will antagonize Members of the House. We are a bicameral \ngovernment. His comments will clearly antagonize them, and once we get \nan agreement--and I appreciate that negotiations have been going on in \nthe Senate between the majority leader and the Republican leader--\nwhatever is done and whatever is agreed to has to be ratified by the \nHouse of Representatives, men and women who were elected on promising \ntheir constituents they wouldn't raise taxes.\n  Now, whether they should have made that commitment or not, whether \nthat was the right thing to do, the fact is that is what they said. So \nthe President basically, in his talk to whatever group of people he was \ntalking to--who were laughing and cheering and applauding as we are on \nthe brink of this collapse, of the incredible problem this creates for \nmen and women all over, all of our citizens--said to the Republicans on \nboth sides of the aisle, but particularly the House of Representatives: \nTake it or leave it. That is not the way Presidents should lead. These \nare draconian effects.\n  Now, whether we should be at this cliff is a discussion for scholars \nin years to come, but we are where we are. Frantic discussions are \ngoing on. They went on into the middle of the night last night. So what \nis the President of the United States doing? In the middle of this, as, \nhopefully, they were reaching an agreement--and I understand there was \nonly one major issue remaining--he comes out and calls people together \nand has a group standing behind him while he laughs and jokes and \nridicules Republicans. Why? Why would the President of the United \nStates want to do that?\n  I want to say a word about sequestration. Now, sequestration is about \nto kick in. The Pentagon and our Defense Department are like a giant \noil tanker. We have to turn it around in a very difficult and slow \nmanner because they have to make plans, and they have to have \ncontingencies. They have to have procurement of weapons, and we have to \ndo all the things that are necessary to make sure our men and women who \nare serving in the military are the best trained, the best equipped, \nand most professional in the world--and they are. But when we look at \nsequestration, the Secretary of Defense says it will decimate our \nability to defend this Nation.\n\n  Shouldn't the President be concerned about that, about what his own \nSecretary of Defense is saying and what his own selection of Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff is saying? Instead, he kind of jokes \naround and tells people they are going to be here for New Year's Eve. \nThat is not the way to lead this Nation.\n  So I come to the floor and say to my colleagues, we need to get this \ndone. We all know we need to get this done. If we go over the cliff, we \nare going to disappoint the people we are elected to represent, and we \nwill disappoint them mightily, as we already have. But I also say it is \nthe time for Presidential leadership. It is time to stop the \ncheerleading; it is time to stop the campaigning. The President won. We \nall know that. He won fair and square. Isn't it now time to govern? \nIsn't the best way to govern to sit down with people from the other \nparty and from both Houses and say this is an issue we must resolve for \nthe good of the American people?\n  So I hope, again, the President will spend some time with the leaders \nof both parties in the Oval Office sitting down and ironing this out \nbefore the people of this country pay a very heavy price.\n  Now, my friend from South Carolina was around when we almost went \nover the cliff the last time, as we were about to shut down the \ngovernment, and there were all kinds of consequences. But we pulled \nback from the brink, after almost going over it, and it was the most \nserious of all these that I have seen. I guess I would ask him, is it \nnot true, in our experience, that Presidents, whether they be \nRepublican or Democrat, no matter what party or affiliation, going back \nto the famous Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill relationship, where they \nsat down together and they saved Social Security for about 25 years--\nand it was tough medicine, but they did it together. The President of \nthe United States basically dismissed Social Security and Medicare from \nhis list of priorities.\n  As my friend from Tennessee pointed out, we have a $16 trillion debt. \nFor us to say we are not going to do anything about spending when we \nall know that spending is the biggest problem we have in this \nagreement--again, that is\n\n[[Page S8568]]\n\nthrowing kerosene on the fire that is on the other side of the Capitol, \nand that is my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nhave committed and pledged to their constituents that we will end this \nhemorrhaging that we call spending which has given us the greatest debt \nin the history of this country.\n  So I guess I would ask my colleague from South Carolina, who is \nusually very modest and reticent in explaining his views, particularly \nin various media outlets, what is his view on this situation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I thank Senator McCain. My first view is it is \nbetter not to go over the cliff than to go over the cliff. But it is \nalso important, as my colleague just said, to understand what we have \naccomplished.\n  Let's assume for a moment--let's hope this is a good assumption--that \nwe are reaching an agreement by the end of the day that raises tax \nrates on people who make over $400,000. I don't think that is a good \nidea because I think it hurts job creation. The better way to get \nrevenue is to eliminate deductions and exemptions for businesses and \nwealthy individuals and take that money back into the treasury, lower \ntax rates to create jobs and pay down some debt. That is what Bowles-\nSimpson did.\n  Not one bipartisan group, I say to the Senator, that has tried to \nsolve our debt problem and our spending problem and our revenue problem \nhas suggested raising tax rates. Bowles-Simpson, a bipartisan group, \nactually lowered tax rates, and they did that by eliminating deductions \nand exemptions, and they put a lot of money on the debt. They had a 25-\npercent corporate rate, and the top personal rate was 30 percent. They \ntook this $1.2 trillion we give out every year in exemptions and \ndeductions to the favored few and brought it back into the treasury. \nThey paid down the debt and they lowered tax rates to help create jobs.\n  This President's approach is the opposite of Simpson-Bowles and the \nGang of 6. We had six Senators, three Democrats and three Republicans. \nHow did they try to solve our long-term problems? They reformed the Tax \nCode by eliminating virtually all deductions. They took that money back \ninto the treasury, they paid down debt, and they lowered tax rates, \njust as Simpson-Bowles.\n  Now, this President has taken another path. He wants to raise tax \nrates to generate revenue. My concern is the higher the tax burdens in \nAmerica, the less likely to create a job in America. There are better \nways to generate revenues. But he has gotten his way and he is going to \nwin.\n  Hats off to the President for having the courage of your convictions. \nYou said during the campaign you were going to raise tax rates on \neverybody making above $250,000. Well, you probably are not going to \nget that, but you are going to be somewhere around $400,000.\n  The money to be generated, you say you want it to go on the deficit. \nWell, that is good. Yesterday, the proposal by our Democratic \ncolleagues was to take that increased revenue from raising tax rates \nand spend $600 billion on the government. That is why they don't have a \ndeal.\n  I am willing to swallow my pride and vote for a tax rate increase--\neven though I don't think it is good policy--just to save the country \nfrom going into the abyss and destroying the military. I am willing to \ndo that, and I will take some heat. But that is the way democracies \nare. You win some, you lose some.\n  What I am not going to do is raise tax rates on anybody and take that \nadditional money to grow the government when we all know we need to get \nout of debt. That is what was going to happen yesterday.\n  By 2037, the amount of debt we have in the Nation will be twice the \nsize of our economy. Every child born in America owes $51,000 of debt \non the day of their birth. When we look at Medicare, Social Security, \nand Medicaid, the three big spending programs, called entitlements, in \nabout 25 years the cost of those programs is going to consume all the \nrevenue coming into the government, and there will be no money for the \nDefense Department.\n  So when the President said today that round 2 will be the debt \nceiling, he is right. He won round 1. But we have done nothing, as \nSenator McCain indicated, to lower the deficit in any real way.\n  If we took every penny of the money we are generating from raising \ntax rates for people above $400,000, that is 6 percent of the national \ndeficit. That doesn't even begin to solve the problem.\n  So this is a hollow victory--a victory of revenue with no change in \nthe Nation's march toward becoming like Greece, no real reduction in \nour deficit or our debt. The good news is that we are one big deal away \nfrom dominating the 21st century because America's problems are less \nthan most other places. The bad news is that deal is elusive. It \nrequires Presidential leadership, and I haven't seen much of it. If we \nstay on the course we are on today, we are going to lose the American \ndream because our grandchildren and your children cannot pay off the \ndebt we are about to pass on to them.\n  So in about 2 months round 2 begins, and we will be asked to raise \nthe debt ceiling. Trust me, I don't want to default on our obligations. \nBut in August of 2011, we borrowed $2.1 trillion because we ran out of \nmoney, and 42 cents of every dollar we spend is borrowed money. If we \ndon't keep borrowing, we have to cut the government by 42 percent. \nNobody suggests that is a good idea overnight.\n  But here is what I will not do. I will not continue borrowing money \nunless we address in the process what got us into debt to begin with. \nSo when we have to raise the debt ceiling again, I want to make a \nsimple request: Let's come up with a plan bipartisan in nature to save \nSocial Security and Medicare from bankruptcy because they are going to \nrun out of money and become insolvent in the next 20 years. Let's also \ncreate a spending reduction plan that will allow us not to become like \nGreece.\n  If you want to raise more revenue by capping deductions, count me in \nbecause we will need more revenue. But in 17 months, ladies and \ngentlemen, we spent $2.1 trillion. We are burning through money like \ncrazy. It took us 200 years to borrow the first $2 trillion. We spent \n$2.1 trillion of borrowed money in 17 months. That has to stop.\n  So to President Obama: Congratulations on your tax rate increase. You \nfought hard and you won. I hope I have the courage of my convictions \nnot to raise the debt ceiling until you and others will work with me to \nfind a plan to begin to get us out of debt. You mentioned Medicare \ntoday in your speech, and I am glad you did.\n  In 2024, it completely becomes insolvent. Think of how many people in \nthis country need Medicare and will need it 20 years from now. If we \ndon't do something, it is going to run out of money. The age of \neligibility for Medicare recipients is 65. It hasn't changed one day \nsince 1965 when it first started. We are all living longer. I propose \nwe adjust the retirement age to 67 over a 10-year or 20-year period. \nThat will save the program in many ways.\n  People at my income level shouldn't get any money from the government \nto help buy prescription drugs. I should pay the full cost because I \ncan afford to. That is called means testing. This CPI thing you hear a \nlot about, that is how you evaluate benefits. That needs to be \nreevaluated based on real inflation. We are overestimating the cost and \nadding burdens to these programs.\n  That is kind of technical stuff, but here is what I am telling you. I \nam not going to vote to raise the debt ceiling until we do something to \nsave Social Security and Medicare from bankruptcy, and I am not going \nto borrow a bunch more money that our grandkids are going to have to \npay off without a plan to get out of debt. If that is too much to ask, \nso be it. But it is not too much to ask of you at home because if you \nspend a lot more money than you make, you go to jail. We call it good \ngovernance. That has to stop.\n  So round 2 is coming, and we are going to have one hell of a contest \nabout the direction and the vision of this country.\n  The President we need 2 months from now is going to be the one who \nwill come down here and talk with us and work with us and not have a \npress conference. Because, Mr. President, I want to make you a historic \nPresident. I want, on your 4-year watch, for us to change the course of \nthe country. I want to save Medicare and Social Security from \ninsolvency, and I will give\n\n[[Page S8569]]\n\nyou full credit as the Presidential leader if you will help us as a \nnation find a way to save these programs from bankruptcy. I want to \nturn around the spending problem we have and prevent us from becoming \nGreece. And if you will lead I will follow. Yes, I will raise more \nrevenue in a responsible way. But without you, it is going to be hard \nfor us to get there.\n\n  So the next time we meet, it is going to be a round of debt ceiling, \nand the image I want is not a bunch of people behind the President who \nare clapping for him, but Members of Congress--Republicans and \nDemocrats--behind the President, clapping for the President because he \nsigned a bill that will save all of us from a certain fate. And our \nfate is being sealed as I talk unless we make changes.\n  We cannot survive on the course we are taking today. The good news \nis, with some bipartisanship and Presidential leadership, we still have \ntime to turn around this country and actually dominate the 21st \ncentury. It is going to take some pain and it is going to take some \nsacrifice.\n  One final story. When I was 21 my mom died. When I was 22 my dad \ndied, 15 months later. My family owned a liquor store, a restaurant, \nand a pool room. Everything I know about politics I learned in the pool \nroom. My sister was 13. My uncle took over the businesses. He left the \ntextile industry to run the businesses. We moved in with my aunt and \nuncle. They never made over $25,000 or $30,000 their entire life. And \nif it weren't for Social Security survivor's benefits for my sister, we \nwould have had a hard time making it. She went to college on a Pell \ngrant.\n  I am 57. I am not married. I don't have any kids. I am part of the \nproblem. That is what is happening all over America. But when I was 22, \nwe needed every penny we could get in Social Security benefits. Today, \nI could easily give up $500 when I retire and not feel it at all, and I \ncould pay more for Medicare--and I would, and I am going to ask people \nin my situation to do that. We just have to have the courage to ask. I \nthink most Americans would say yes.\n  So Medicare and Social Security are not programs to me. I know what \nthey do for real people, and if we do nothing, in 2032--which seems \nforever but it is not--Social Security becomes insolvent, and we have \nto cut benefits 25 percent for everybody, whether they can afford it or \nnot or raise taxes by 38 percent, whether businesses can afford it or \nnot. And the way you solve that is to reform the programs like Ronald \nReagan and Tip O'Neill.\n  Mr. President, I am willing to play, along with my other Republican \ncolleagues, the role of Tip O'Neill. You just need to play the role of \nRonald Reagan.\n  So the next time we talk about fiscal problems in America, I want a \nnews conference where the President is center stage, not surrounded by \npolitical activists but surrounded by Republicans and Democrats who can \ncelebrate accomplishing something that we should all be proud of.\n  They tell me this is the least productive Congress in the history of \nthe Nation. If it is not, I would hate to be in the one that was. We \nhaven't done a whole lot up here.\n  I know Senator McCain has been here a few years now. I ask the \nSenator, what is his opinion of where we are going as a nation and how \nwe get along with each other?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my friend, first of all, we have had some \nmeetings of a bipartisan fashion to try and improve the process so that \nwe can move legislation forward.\n  I believe the issue before us right now--at nearly 3 p.m., 9 hours \nfrom midnight and we still have not reached an agreement--and the \nlonger it takes for us to reach agreement, the less time we will have \nexamining it and the less time we will have before voting on it. As the \nSenator from South Carolina said: We can't keep doing business like \nthis. And we can't.\n  But on this particular issue, I want to express, as I began, my \ndisappointment in the President in having a cheerleading rally when we \nshould be sitting down together and resolving this issue. That is what \nI have seen other Presidents, Republican and Democrat, do.\n  I hope, now that the President has made his statement with his \ncheering section, that now he would sit down--as Presidents have and \nshould--and work to hammer out this agreement and agreements in the \nfuture.\n  The Presidential campaign is over. He won. Congratulations. Now let's \nget down to the serious business of governing this country in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, would the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I rise for a moment to associate myself with the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, the Senator from Arizona, and the Senator from South \nCarolina. I want to tell a personal story somewhat like the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  I made my living my entire life before I got here for 33 years \nselling houses, causing two people to come together and agree on price, \nagree on terms, sign and shake on a deal, and walk away from a closing \ntable feeling like both of them won.\n  I have also been elected to every legislative body I could be elected \nto in my State, and I have served in legislatures for 34 years. I have \nnegotiated deals and been on conference committees, and I never once \nfound myself making a deal by intimidating or insulting the other side.\n  What the President did this afternoon set us back in civility and in \nleadership and in dealmaking, and I am a big enough guy to know I am \nnot going to take it personally. If the desire was to offend me, the \nspeech did. But if the desire was to deter me, it did not.\n  It is time we all found ways to come together as Americans and solve \nour problems, not just in the short run but in the long run; not fill \nour room with partisan supporters, but, instead, cause everybody to sit \ntogether around the table and find a way to make a deal.\n  This is the greatest country on the face of this Earth, and it will \ncontinue to be unless we forget what got us here. What got us here are \nthe American people, not the American politicians. The American \nbusinessman, the American entrepreneur, the American worker, the \nAmerican laborer, and the American leaders--people who, through their \nsweat, their blood, and their toil built businesses, built factories, \nbuilt companies, and made this great enterprise known as the United \nStates of America work.\n  If we want to raise our revenue--sure, you can raise by percentage \nyour revenue by raising your assessment, but if you lower your base \nyour revenue goes down. What we need to do is empower our base by \nraising the prosperity of the American businessman, the American \nemployee, and the American worker. As their prosperity rises, taxes \nwill go up not because we are charging them more by rate, but because \nthey are making more. The rate and what they pay goes up because they \nare more prosperous.\n  You will never raise the revenue you need by insulting the American \npeople or taking away the incentives to work, make a living, maybe take \na risk and be an entrepreneur. So while we had a speech today--the \nintention of which I don't know, but it probably protracted and delayed \nwhat we are trying to do here today, and that is find a way to come \nback and fight another day.\n  I agree with Senator Graham. The big battle is yet to come, and it is \nover the debt ceiling. It is going to be a big battle, and I share \nevery comment and every sentiment that Senator Graham said because that \nis the one where we have to find a way to make a deal. The President is \nnot going to make a deal by poking us in the eye and by charging one \nside against the other to try and have a win-win proposition. I never \nmade a deal if it wasn't a win-win proposition. I always lost a deal \nwhen I made it a win-lose proposition.\n  I am at the table. I will continue to negotiate. I want to make this \ncountry work, but let's work together. Let's find common ground. In the \neleventh hour and in the twelfth hour, let's do what is right for the \nAmerican people.\n  I want to thank Senator Graham, Senator Corker, and Senator McCain \nfor their remarks. I associate myself with them, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor for the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Arizona, South\n\n[[Page S8570]]\n\nCarolina, and Georgia for the comments they have made. I already \naddressed the issue of the speech. I agree with the comments made by my \ncolleagues here.\n  I want to address the substance of this. We get caught up in \nterminology around here and sometimes talk beyond each other. I don't \nknow what most people are doing today, but the country almost came to a \nhalt in August of 2011 as we negotiated some reductions in spending--\n$2.1 trillion worth. Most people believed that was not enough. I know \neverybody in this body has been contacted by the Fix the Deck folks and \nothers who think we need to have a $4.5 trillion to $5 trillion deal, \nand I agree with that 100 percent. I thought that was what we were \ngoing to be doing.\n  As the Senator from South Carolina said, had we done that, we could \nfocus on the tremendous potential this country has. We are not going to \ndo that.\n  Let me go back to August 2011 when we agreed to reduce spending by \n$2.1 trillion. We implemented some things and we put some things off to \nwhat we call the sequester, which is what I am talking about now. The \nsequester was supposed to kick in on January 1 if we didn't reach an \nagreement on other spending reductions. I had hoped we would come up \nwith other spending reductions. I know my friend, the Presiding \nOfficer, felt the same way. But we have not done that.\n  Here is the substance of what the President just said in his speech; \nthat is, since we did not come up with an agreement on spending \nreductions, we are going to deal with the sequester that kicks in \ntomorrow--the $1.2 trillion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8570-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNET.

Mr. President, yesterday--after days of inaction--I \ncame to the floor and noted the obvious: we need to act but I need a \ndance partner. So I reached out to the Vice President in an effort to \nget things done. I am happy to report that the effort has been a \nsuccessful one, and as the President just said in his television \nappearance, we are very close to an agreement.\n  We need to protect American families and job creators from this \nlooming tax hike. Everyone agrees that action is necessary, and I can \nreport that we have reached an agreement on all of the tax issues. We \nare very close.\n  As the President just said, the most important piece--the piece that \nhas to be done now--is preventing the tax hikes. The President said, \n``For now our most immediate priority is to stop taxes going up for \nmiddle-class families starting tomorrow.'' I agree. He suggested that \naction on the sequester is something we can continue to work on in the \ncoming months.\n  So I agree, let's pass the tax relief portion now. Let's take what \nhas been agreed to and get moving. This was not easy to get to. The \nVice President and I spoke at 12:45 this morning, 6:30 this morning, \nand multiple times again during this morning. This has clearly been a \ngood-faith negotiation. We all want to protect taxpayers, and we could \nget it done right now.\n  So let me be clear: We will continue to work on finding smarter ways \nto cut spending, but let's not let that hold up protecting Americans \nfrom the tax hike that will take place in about 10 hours from now. We \ncan do this; we must do this.\n  I want my colleagues to know that we will keep everybody updated as \nwe continue to try to wrap this up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, it is appropriate that the Senator just \nsaid what I have said, and I thank him for his comments. This, again, \nleads me to what I see is the rub. In his comments a minute ago, the \nPresident alluded that the tax arrangements have all been agreed to and \nthe things Americans most care about have been agreed to.\n  In a late request this morning, the President wanted to do away with \nthe sequester--the $1.2 trillion in cuts--by paying for them with \nrevenues instead of trading out other cuts, which is unbelievable to me \nwith the amount of debt we have in this Nation. The fact is we have \nagreed to additional revenue. Now, at the last minute, what has \nhappened is the sequester is getting ready to kick in because we could \nnot agree to other revenue cuts. By the way, it was not part of this \ndeal but to supplant what we did back in August 2011.\n  We all know the sequester is going to kick in. For some reason people \nthink it is being done the wrong way and should be done in a different \nway, which I actually agree and hope we will do. Instead of reducing \nthat spending, the President wants to add revenues to that to keep that \nfrom happening.\n  Now, let me explain what that means. We have this tax increase that \nis getting ready to happen--by the way, I would support that--and \ninstead of reducing the deficit like the President campaigned on, what \nhe wants to do is use those revenues to supplant spending reductions we \nhave already agreed to, so we are not reducing the deficit. We are \nusing this revenue, which has been campaigned on for a year, not to \nreduce deficits but to keep spending cuts that have already been agreed \nto from happening. I don't think there are many people on either side \nof the aisle who would think that is a very good idea.\n\n  Now, what the President is doing is holding this agreement on taxes \nfor all Americans hostage to keep from doing the spending reductions we \nhave already agreed to. I don't know if most Americans who listen to us \nquite understand what is happening.\n  I listened to the President yesterday speaking with David Gregory, \n``Meet the Press,'' and I know he talked about the $1 trillion in \nspending reductions he has offered up, which by the way I applaud. The \nproblem is I have never seen them. I don't think the Presiding Officer \nhas ever seen them. As a matter of fact, there is not a soul in this \nbody who has ever seen the spending reductions that the President has \noffered up because they don't exist.\n  I know there were broad contours that were talked about; I know that. \nThe people in this body know that last week Lamar Alexander and I \noffered a bill on the floor to raise the debt ceiling by having $1 \ntrillion in entitlement reforms so we don't end up in a situation where \nthe credit of our country is in jeopardy. Today people are paying one-\nthird of the cost of Medicare. There will be 20 million more Americans \non Medicare over the next 10 years, and we are paying for one-third of \nthat. It is a time bomb.\n  We have offered reforms to cause Medicare to be here for future \ngenerations. We have done that in advance so the debt ceiling is raised \nin a way that does not jeopardize the country's credit. At the same \ntime, we reformed these programs so they will be here for the future.\n  Yesterday the President said on television that he has offered $1 \ntrillion in cuts. I have never seen them. What I would say to the \nPresiding Officer is, if they exist it would be helpful if we could see \nthose because that would help us with this debt ceiling debate. It may \nbe that some of those are similar to the reforms and reductions that \nSenator Alexander from Tennessee offered with me. That would be highly \nhelpful. Once the pep rallies are over maybe the President could send a \nlist of those reductions and reforms that he says he has offered that \nno one I know of has ever seen. I think it would be helpful to us in \nthe debt ceiling debate.\n  As a matter of fact, my guess is we might agree with a lot of those. \nWhat we could do is maybe take the President's reductions that he says \nhe has offered, which he has never offered, and\n\n[[Page S8571]]\n\nwe could use those to help raise the debt ceiling and alleviate some of \nthe issues that my friend from South Carolina was mentioning a minute \nago.\n  Mr. Presiding Officer, my friend, I will tell you that I am \ndisappointed where we are today. I thought 2 years after we began this \nprocess we would end up with something that would cause us to have this \nviewed from the rearview mirror. In other words, this would be behind \nus, and we would begin 2013 in a situation where the economy was ready \nto take off and people in this country would know that we dealt with \nour issues, and, candidly, people around the world would know it as \nwell. We have not done that. We are talking about the kick-the-can-\ndown-the-road deal. Everybody knows that.\n  Everybody in this body knows that by the time this agreement takes \nplace we have done nothing to reduce a penny of debt in this country. \nPeople know that, and that is a shame.\n  The American people are watching us. We have turned ourselves into \nthe laughing stock of the world because we cannot sit down and just \nsolve these problems. Candidly, I don't know why we cannot do this on \nthe Senate floor. It has been empty over the last week. I think we \ncould have brought a bill to the floor to deal candidly with this. I \nthink most people on both sides of the aisle think the same way. We \nhave not done it. Surely, we should not let this happen again.\n  I want to close by saying that I am disappointed with what I think is \nabout to happen on the sequester. It looks like we are going to use \nrevenues to substitute for spending reductions that have already been \nagreed to. What that means to the American people is that the tax on \nthe wealthy, which I support in the form that I have understood it to \nbe, is not going to be used to reduce our deficit but to keep from \nputting in place the spending reductions we have already agreed to.\n  I don't know many Democrats or Republicans who would think that is a \nparticularly good idea, especially with everything we went through and \neverything we put the world through in August 2011. Much of that will \nbe dissipated and watered down today. Not only are we not making \nprogress if that happens, we are actually going to be setting ourselves \nand our country back. I think this will make it even more difficult to \novercome the debt ceiling that is coming up in 75 days.\n  I am obviously making this speech to, hopefully, help influence the \noutcome over the next couple of hours. I hope that what the President \nsaid over in the Executive Office Building is not what he means. I \ndoubt there are many people in this body who agree with the comments \nmade by the President, and I hope the negotiators will take that into \naccount.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to express my \nown sense of encouragement about the statements made this afternoon by \nPresident Obama and Senator McConnell which indicate that the \nnegotiations to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff are making progress. \nWe are not there yet, but they are making progress. I am very \nencouraged by that.\n  I have heard over the last couple days a familiar phrase invoked many \ntimes, and it is that no deal is better than a bad deal. I suppose it \nis often true that no deal is better than a bad deal. But in the case \nof the fiscal cliff, no deal is the worst deal because the government \nwill go over the fiscal cliff and will take almost every American with \nus.\n  Almost every family who pays taxes now will pay higher taxes. \nPeople's jobs will immediately be put in jeopardy, unemployment \ncompensation will end for more than 2 million people. Our defenses will \nbe decimated by cuts that will put us in a position of accepting \nunacceptable risks to our security. Title I programs of education for \nlow-income children will be cut dramatically.\n  Most people, including our own Congressional Budget Office, say the \ncombination of tax increases along with the decreased spending required \nunder the Budget Control Act will push our economy back into recession \nin the new year.\n  So I do not agree that no deal is better than a bad deal. In this \ncase, I repeat, no deal is the worst deal because it allows our country \nto go over the fiscal cliff and hurts almost every American family and \nour country and our economy as a whole. This should not be a surprise \nto us. It is not as if--if I can use the metaphor that Congress was \ngoing along in a bus on a ride through the country and suddenly came to \nthe end of the road and there was a cliff. This should not be a \nsurprise to us. We created this cliff ourselves a year and a half ago \nwhen we adopted the Budget Control Act. We created it for a very good \nreason: Because we knew we had proven ourselves incapable of making the \ncompromises that were necessary to achieve the long-term bipartisan \ndebt reduction program America desperately needs.\n  We are over $16.4 trillion in debt. I am in my last days as a \nSenator. If you told me when I started that we would be $16 trillion in \ndebt, I would not have believed it. Frankly, if you had told me just a \ndozen years ago, at the end of the Clinton administration when we were \nin surplus, that we could possibly be $16 trillion in debt, I would \nhave thought you were not reality tested. But here we are.\n  Most everybody knows the way we are going to get out of this is with \na combination of tough medicine--I would call it tough love. We are \ngoing to have to reduce spending. We cannot do it all from \ndiscretionary spending. The Budget Control Act we adopted last summer; \nthat is, the summer of 2011, does it all from discretionary spending. \nWhat is discretionary spending? It is different from entitlement \nspending: Medicare, Medicaid, et cetera. It is what most people think \nof as the government. It is education programs. It is environmental \nprotection. It is social service programs. It is defense. It is \nhomeland security. It is law enforcement. That is about one-third of \nour budget. It is not the part of spending that is driving the debt and \ndeficit. That is being driven by the growth in entitlements, which are \nrising for a good reason, which is that the American people are living \nlonger; therefore, taking much more money out of programs such as \nMedicare than they put in and, I suppose, for reasons that are not so \ngood, which is the cost of health care continues to go up.\n  We proved ourselves incapable of dealing with this crisis as part of \nthe normal process of compromise. So we created the cliff, which was \nintentionally made so harmful that our assumption was that we would not \nallow ourselves to go over the cliff because it would be so hurtful. \nAgain, that is why no deal in this case is not better than a bad deal. \nNo deal is the worst deal because it means we go over the cliff.\n  Why is all this happening? For a lot of reasons. But one is that \nthere are groups within both great political parties who are defending \nthe status quo, who do not want the situation as it exists now, which \nhas created the $16\\1/2\\ trillion of debt, to change. But we cannot go \non this way. Because if we do, we already are putting an enormous \nburden on generations of Americans to follow in paying off the debt we \nhave incurred. But we are also coming to a point, if we do not do \nsomething soon, where the choices we are going to have to begin to pay \noff the debt are going to be hurtful to our great country, which is \nenormous tax increases, enormous spending cuts such as the one in the \nfiscal cliff proposal or, at worst, the monetizing of the debt, a drop \nin the value of the dollar, and all the harmful effects that will have \non our economy and our country.\n  Here we are, December 31, not only the eve of a new year--which we \nhope and pray will be a great one for our country and everyone who \nlives in it--but a few hours away from letting our country go over the \ncliff. We can't let it happen, and that is why I am so encouraged that \nthese bipartisan negotiations are looking like they will produce a \nbipartisan agreement, which hopefully will come before the Senate \nsometime this evening.\n  This is not, this will not be the comprehensive, bipartisan, long-\nterm debt\n\n[[Page S8572]]\n\nagreement we created the cliff to encourage. This will not be the \nbipartisan, long-term debt reduction agreement this country needs.\n  So much is beginning to turn right in our economy. Housing prices are \ndoing better, unemployment is down. We see manufacturing picking up \nagain. The big problem the American economy has is right here in \nWashington, our inability to get together across party lines to bring \nour country back into fiscal balance and to show the country and the \nworld we have a political system that is capable of fixing our \nproblems.\n  Earlier this year, Bob Carr, the Foreign Minister of Australia, one \nof our greatest allies in the world, said: ``The United States is one \nbudget deal away from restoring its global preeminence.''\n  ``The United States is one budget deal away from restoring its global \npreeminence.'' Perhaps because I am so proud of this country, I would \nsay we are one budget deal away from restoring our global dominance for \na considerable number of years.\n  Unfortunately, after--I hope and I pray we adopt the result of \nnegotiations going on now and avoid the fiscal cliff--we will still be \none grand bargain budget deal away from restoring our global \npreeminence. That work has to be done, but at least we will have \navoided the cliff.\n  By a twist of fate, the occupant of the chair is my colleague and \nfriend, the Senator from Connecticut. You have probably seen these \nnumbers, but just to bring it home for one State, what will be the \nimpact if we allow the country to go over the fiscal cliff in \nConnecticut: 1.4 million middle-class families will see their Federal \nincome taxes increase, almost 1.5 million families.\n  If the middle-class tax cuts are allowed to expire on January 1, a \nmedian-income Connecticut family--now I know the median in Connecticut \nis higher than it is in most other States, but this number is true for \nany family making this amount of money. It makes an important point.\n  A family of four earning $86,000 a year happens to be the median \nfamily income in Connecticut. But that family, which I think would be \nconsidered median just about everywhere, middle income just about \neverywhere, would see its Federal income taxes rise by $2,200. That is \na lot of money for a family of four paying a mortgage, paying for food, \nprobably paying something for education for their children, maybe \ncollege--too much.\n  Another Connecticut number is 680,000 additional Connecticut \ntaxpayers will be hit by the alternative minimum tax. It is amazing \nwhen we think about that. Those are going to be middle-class families \nwho will be hit by that. Also, 120,000 Connecticut taxpayers will no \nlonger get a tuition tax credit to help pay for college because that \ntoo will expire if we don't do something about it. There are 340,000 \nConnecticut families raising children who will see an average tax \nincrease of $1,000 as they lose access to the child tax credit.\n  The earned-income tax credit, which was something adopted during the \n1990s--which I was proud to be part of--is also set to expire on \nJanuary 1. That is for--when I say lower working families, some might \ncall them lower middle income, gives them a break that they need.\n  In the most recent year for which we have numbers, almost 43,000 \nConnecticut working families received important benefits from the \nearned-income tax credit, and they would lose it.\n  The national numbers are 2.1 million people long-term unemployed who \nwill see their unemployment checks end. We are setting them adrift. In \nConnecticut, that means 33,600 Connecticut individuals will lose \nunemployment benefits under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation \nProgram.\n  I met with a group of these folks recently, and I know a lot of these \npeople are white-collar people. Some of them are in their middle years \nof life, and they lost their jobs in companies that were hit by the \nrecession. They are having an impossible time finding new employment, \nand, believe me, they are working so hard to try to get it--33,600 of \nthem would be set adrift without unemployment benefits if we go over \nthe fiscal cliff.\n  One estimate by the National Economic Council is that there would be \n$2.5 billion less in consumer spending in Connecticut, and that is \nbasically because tax hikes will take a bite out of middle-class \nbudgets and, frankly, some people will lose their jobs. I am afraid \nthey will lose their jobs in many industries, including the defense \nindustry, which remains a foundation, as the acting chair knows, of our \nState's economy. The NEC also estimates that we would have 1.1 percent \nslower growth in the Connecticut economy with the attendant harmful \nresults of that.\n  I could go on and on. Title I would be forced to serve about 9,300 \nfewer Connecticut children. We would get $5.6 million less in funding \nlow-income home energy assistance payments to people in our State who \nheat with oil, and on and on and on.\n  This is all my way of coming back to the point I made at the \nbeginning and why I am encouraged by the statements President Obama and \nSenator McConnell made this afternoon that we are close to an \nagreement, close to a deal.\n  I don't agree, I say again, that no deal is better than a bad deal. \nIn this case of the fiscal cliff, no deal is the worst deal possible \nfor the American people.\n  We passed the time when we are going to, before tonight, negotiate \nthe comprehensive bipartisan debt reduction agreement our country \ndesperately needs. The least we can do is protect the constituents who \nwere good enough to send us here from the worst possible result, which \nis that we let the country go over the cliff. We have proved that to \neverybody, including people around the world who depend on American \nstrength and watch us, that our political system has become absolutely \ndysfunctional.\n  So I hope the negotiations going on now end with an agreement, and I \nhope we will pass it with a bipartisan majority, a strong bipartisan \nmajority in the Senate and the House. I certainly will support it from \nall I hear about it myself.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8572-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8572-S8575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President I wish to thank my friend, my long-time \nfriend whom I hate to see leave this body, Senator Lieberman from \nConnecticut, for his remarks.\n  I didn't have the opportunity to speak after he gave his farewell \nremarks. I do wish to say, before I get into the reason I came down \nhere--I am happy to see him here so I can say this--it has been a joy \nto serve with him over the years.\n  I am in my second life in the Senate, and during my first life we \nserved together on the Armed Services Committee. We did a number of \ninitiatives together on which I was proud to be associated with him, \nthat I believe strengthened our national economy and our security team \naround the world. We worked on school vouchers for DC and a number of \nother initiatives affecting the future of our military and other issues \nthat were of importance to us.\n  Most important, from my standpoint, we worked together to bring \nvalues that each of us cherish based on our faith. Joe is of the Jewish \nfaith, and I am of the Christian faith. We discovered on a trip to \nIraq, just after Desert Storm, that we, in talking to each other, \nshared our respective faiths and how it affected our lives, how it \naffected our families, and how it helped us form decisions we make. Of \ncourse, coming from two different parties, we didn't find agreement on \neverything, but we found agreement on a number of things, particularly \nthose things where we shared common values, where our faith shared \ncommon values and where individually we shared those values.\n  Under the direction of a rabbi from Chicago we cochaired the Center \nfor Jewish and Christian Values, bringing\n\n[[Page S8573]]\n\ntogether Jews and Christians to talk about what they had in common and \nwhat values we could work together on for the betterment of our country \nand for the betterment of our society. Too often we bring groups \ntogether of different persuasions to discuss, argue, and debate the \ndifferences. This was different because we brought these groups \ntogether, distinguished leaders from both sides, prominent leaders from \nboth sides, to set aside those differences and work to find those \nvalues we had in common. It was a joy to participate in that with \nSenator Lieberman and to cochair that.\n  We have remained friends. His contributions to our country, not just \nrepresenting a State but representing America around the world, will \nlong be remembered and will have great impact and effect. We are losing \na real talent, and we are losing a real gentleman. We are losing \nsomeone who is an example of how he conducts himself and is an example \nfor all of us as to how we ought to conduct ourselves, and we don't \nalways do that.\n  But Joe Lieberman has left a lasting impression on me--and I know a \nnumber of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle--and he will be \nsorely missed.\n  One thing I am happy about is that we will continue a lifelong \nfriendship, and I am looking forward to many more opportunities for \nSenator Lieberman to work on matters of interest but will enjoy a \ncontinued sharing of the commonalities of our Judeo-Christian faiths.\n\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize my colleague \nKent Conrad for his many years of distinguished service and leadership \non behalf of our country and the people of North Dakota. It has been \nsuch an honor for me to serve with Kent as my neighboring Senator these \nlast 6 years.\n  I like to kid with Kent that it seems like North Dakota is always in \nthe middle of some kind of drought or flood or other natural disaster. \nThere's actually a joke I once told him about how you can spot a \ntourist from North Dakota in the middle of a beach in Florida. It's \neasy--they are the ones putting all the sand in sandbags.\n  But jokes aside, Kent has been truly tireless in his work to improve \nour current flood prevention measures and to ensure North Dakota has \nthe tools it needs to prepare for and recover from natural disasters.\n  As anyone who has worked with him on the Agriculture Committee knows, \nhe has also been an outstanding advocate for our Nation's farmers, \nranchers, and rural communities. Kent has consistently led efforts to \nstrengthen the sugar program, which is critical to sugar beet growers \nin States like North Dakota and Minnesota. He played a key role in \ncrafting both the 2002 and 2008 Farm Bills, and he was a driving force \nin getting the 2012 Farm Bill drafted and passed out of the Senate on a \nstrong bipartisan vote in June.\n  So there is no question that Kent's expertise on farm policy will be \nsorely missed. As Congressman Collin Peterson likes to say, ``There are \nonly 11 people who truly understand how the complex farm payment \nprograms work. And ten of them are in North Dakota.'' Well, with Kent \nretiring I guess there will only be nine.\n  Whether it's standing up for farmers or fighting floods or saving the \nMinot military base, Kent has touched and improved the lives of people \nin every corner of North Dakota. At the national level, he has been an \noutspoken leader on the issue of debt reduction and has consistently \nadvocated for policies that benefit the middle class.\n  It would be impossible to do full justice to Kent's legacy in a \nsingle statement, so instead I will simply say this: North Dakota is \nbetter off because of Kent Conrad's leadership, and so is our country. \nSenator, thank you for all of the friendship, wisdom and support you \nhave shown me over the years. You will be missed, but I know that even \nin retirement you will continue to find ways to improve our great \ncountry and work for the people of North Dakota.\n\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to recognize my colleague Herb Kohl for his \nmany years of distinguished service and leadership on behalf of our \ncountry and the people of Wisconsin.\n  It has been an incredible honor for me to serve with Herb as \nneighboring Senators these last 6 years. He is a statesman in the \ntruest sense of the term, not to mention one of the most genuinely kind \nand steadfast public servants of our time. This is the reason he is so \nadmired in the Senate, and it is how he came to be known as one of the \nmost beloved and respected public figures in the State of Wisconsin.\n  Like Herb, my mom was born and raised in Milwaukee. I have many fond \nmemories of visiting Wisconsin and can personally attest to how loved \nand respected Herb Kohl is throughout the State. People know him for \nthe jobs he created as a businessman. They know him for the scholarship \nprogram created in his name. And of course, they know him for the way \nhe ``saved basketball'' by keeping the Bucks in Milwaukee. But above \nall, people know Herb for his consistent record of putting Wisconsin \nfirst.\n  From strengthening Wisconsin's manufacturing sector and keeping jobs \nin the State to improving the MILC program and better supporting our \ndairy farmers, Herb has touched and improved the lives of people across \nWisconsin and throughout the Midwest. At the national level, he has \nearned a reputation as a masterful policymaker with a quiet, \ncommonsense approach to legislating that is the stuff of Senate legend. \nBut don't be fooled by Herb's even keel.\n  When it comes to protecting consumers and standing up for the middle \nclass, few people are as fiercely committed as Herb Kohl. As chair of \nthe Antitrust Subcommittee, he has been a truly tireless champion for \nconsumer rights and competition policy. I've seen this firsthand, while \nworking with him on legislation to crack down on captive shipping in \nthe rail industry and to restrict the so-called pay-to-delay deals that \nkeep affordable prescription drugs off the market.\n  Senator Kohl, it would be impossible to do full justice to your \nlegacy in a single statement. So instead I will simply say this: \nWisconsin is better off because of your leadership, and so is our \ncountry. Thank you for all of the friendship, wisdom and support you \nhave shown me over the years. You will be missed, but I know that even \nin retirement you will continue to find ways to improve our great \ncountry and work for the people of Wisconsin.\n\n\n                          Kay Bailey Hutchison\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to recognize my colleague Kay Bailey Hutchison \nfor her many years of distinguished service and leadership on behalf of \nour country and the great State of Texas.\n  Over the course of her 19 years in the Senate, Kay has earned a \nreputation for being one of Washington's hardest-working and most \nmasterful policy makers. I've seen this firsthand, while working with \nher on a number of different issues over the years.\n  During the debate over Wall Street reform, Kay and I teamed up on \nlegislation that helped keep the lights on at over 600 community banks \nin Minnesota and over 2,000 in the State of Texas. We also worked \ntogether to update and improve our Federal anti-stalking laws, making \nit easier for law enforcement to crack down on high-tech predators \nusing devices like spyware and video surveillance. In both cases, I was \nimpressed with Kay's ability to reach across the aisle and find \ncommonsense solutions.\n  No matter what the issue, Kay has always stood up for the people of \nher State. She has been a strong and consistent voice for the people of \nTexas, but I also think it's important to recognize her role as a \npioneer for women.\n  I will never forget a story Kay once told me, about how she was one \nof just seven women in her law school class and couldn't find a job at \nany of the all-male Houston law firms when she graduated. So instead, \nshe took a job covering the Texas State Legislature for a local TV \nstation.\n  Kay clearly caught the political bug, because it was just a few years \nlater that she ran for a seat in the Texas House of Representatives. \nWhen she won, she became the first Republican woman ever elected to \nthat body. She shattered another glass ceiling in 1993, when she became \nthe first woman to represent Texas in the Senate. It was a milestone \nfor women everywhere from the Lone Star State to the North Star State.\n  When I was running for the Senate in Minnesota in 2006, only two \nwomen had run before me and both of them had lost. This came up during \nmy campaign\n\n[[Page S8574]]\n\nwhen reporters would ask me, ``Can a woman win in Minnesota?'' My \nresponse? Of course. A woman won in Texas.\n  So even before I knew Kay personally, I was inspired by her story and \nby everything she had accomplished. Senator, thank you for all of the \nfriendship, wisdom and support you have shown me over the years. You \nwill be missed, but I know that even in retirement you will continue to \nfind ways to improve our great country and give back to the people of \nthe State you love so much.\n\n\n                               Ben Nelson\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to recognize my colleague Ben Nelson for his \nmany years of distinguished service and leadership on behalf of our \ncountry and the people of Nebraska.\n  It has been an honor to serve with Ben over the past 6 years. He is a \ntrue statesman and a champion for the people of Nebraska. During his \ntime in the Senate, Ben has earned a reputation as a pragmatist who \nvalues problem-solving over partisanship, and I have admired his \nsensible, commonsense approach to legislating.\n  Ben seemed to be destined for public service from an early age, \nwinning his first election at the age of 17, and he is known for his \nconsistent record of putting Nebraska first. No matter what the issue, \nBen has always stood up for his State and he has improved the lives of \npeople across Nebraska. At a national level he has been a strong voice \nfor fiscal responsibility and shared sacrifice.\n  Having grown up in a small town in Nebraska, Ben has never forgotten \nhis roots. While serving on the Senate Agriculture Committee with Ben I \nsaw firsthand his deep appreciation and respect for the farmers, \noutdoorsmen, and rural communities that are vital not just to our \neconomy but to our way of life in the Midwest.\n  He was instrumental in crafting both the 2008 and the 2012 Farm Bills \nand he has been a clear and consistent advocate for homegrown energy, \nleading the way on policies to help our country achieve energy \nindependence.\n  He has also been a champion for our men and women in uniform, helping \nto ensure that members of the Armed Forces and our veterans receive the \nsupport they need and deserve.\n  Senator Nelson, it would be impossible to do full justice to your \nlegacy in a single statement. So instead let me simply say this: The \nState of Nebraska is better because of your leadership, and so is our \ncountry. You will be missed in the Senate, but given everything you \naccomplished before you were elected--as Governor of Nebraska and as a \nsuccessful businessman--I know in your retirement you will continue to \nfind ways to improve our great country and work for the people of \nNebraska.\n\n\n                             Olympia Snowe\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to recognize my colleague Olympia Snowe for her \nmany years of distinguished service and leadership on behalf of our \ncountry and the great State of Maine.\n  Olympia has long been a friend and mentor to me. In fact, she was \nassigned to be my official Republican mentor in the Senate, and she has \nbeen a great one.\n  That was almost 6 years ago. So much has happened in that time, but \nthroughout it all I have continued to be impressed with Olympia's \ngrace, composure and unfailing ability to find commonsense solutions. \nTime and again, she has reached across the aisle to put politics aside \nand get things done for the good of her State and the country.\n  In addition to being a voice for bipartisanship, Olympia has earned a \nreputation as one of the Senate's most masterful policy makers. I've \nseen this firsthand, while working with her on a number of different \nissues over the years. Olympia cosponsored my very first major bill in \nthe Senate ``Carbon Counter'' legislation to reduce carbon emissions \nand combat global climate change.\n  I also had the pleasure of working with her to create an Airline \n``Passengers Bill of Rights,'' which was included in the 2011 FAA \nreauthorization bill and has led to a significant decrease in tarmac \ndelays. And we joined forces again this year, on legislation aimed at \naddressing sexual assault in our military by improving the process for \ntracking and reviewing claims.\n  Working with Olympia these last 6 years has been an incredible \nprivilege for me. I've respected her as a policymaker, particularly for \nher work on national security and small business issues. I've admired \nher for her outspoken leadership and commonsense approach to \nlegislating. And maybe most importantly, I've genuinely enjoyed her as \na friend and a colleague--for her kindness, for her wisdom, and for her \nunfailing good nature.\n  Olympia has been a truly outstanding voice for the State of Maine and \na great leader for the people of this country. To say that she will be \nmissed would be a tremendous understatement, but I know she will \ncontinue to find ways to improve our great country and give back to the \nState she loves so much. Thank you, Senator Snowe. I wish you the best.\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to recognize my colleague Joe Lieberman for his \nmany years of distinguished service and leadership on behalf of our \ncountry and the people of Connecticut.\n  Joe will always have a special place in my heart. As many of my \ncolleagues know, he was actually one of my professors in college. He \ngave me one of my first introductions to the political process through \na seminar he taught on the subject of the national political parties. \nInterestingly enough, Senator Sherrod Brown also took that same class \njust a few years earlier. Even more interesting is the fact that \neveryone remembers what grade I got, but no one seems to recall what \ngrade Sherrod got.\n  But I digress. Not many political science professors can say they've \ntaught two concurrently serving U.S. Senators. Joe can, however, and I \nthink that's an enormous tribute to his character and genuine zest for \npublic policy. As one of his former students, I made a point of \nfollowing his career over the years and always admired his political \ncourage. But it never occurred to me that I might someday be serving \nalongside him in the Senate.\n  Working with Joe these last 6 years has been an incredible privilege \nfor me. I've respected him as a policymaker, particularly for his work \non national security and climate change. I've admired him for his \noutspoken leadership and commonsense approach to legislating. And maybe \nmost importantly, I've genuinely enjoyed him as a friend and a \ncolleague--for his kindness, for his wisdom, and for his famous sense \nof humor.\n  Joe Lieberman has been a truly outstanding voice for the State of \nConnecticut and a great leader for the people of this country. To say \nthat he will be missed would be a tremendous understatement, but I know \nhe will continue to find ways to improve our great country and give \nback to the State he loves so much, even in retirement. Thank you, \nSenator Lieberman. I wish you the best.\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to recognize my colleague Jim Webb for his \ndistinguished service and leadership on behalf of our country and the \npeople of Virginia.\n  I will always have a special place in my heart for Jim Webb, and that \nis because he and I were members of the same incoming class of Senators \nback in 2007. We ran for the Senate at the same time in 2006, and to \nthis day I will never forget how he wore his son's old combat boots on \nthe campaign trail. Day in and day out, no matter where he went, no \nmatter what the weather, Jim was walking tall in those boots.\n  Since his very first days in office, Jim has been a tireless champion \nfor our men and women in uniform. On day one, he introduced a 21st \nCentury GI Bill to deliver the most comprehensive educational benefits \nsince World War II. It led to legislation that was eventually signed \ninto law, and it has made it possible for tens of thousands of post-911 \ntroops and veterans to afford a college education.\n  While Jim is best known for his leadership on defense and military \nissues, he has also earned a reputation for being a problem solver who \ntakes a commonsense, bipartisan approach to legislating. Time and \nagain, Jim has reached across the aisle to put politics aside and get \nthings done for the good of the country. He has been a clear and \nconsistent voice for energy independence and a stalwart advocate for \npolicies that benefit the middle class. As a\n\n[[Page S8575]]\n\nformer prosecutor, I have greatly admired his work to improve our \ncriminal justice system from top to bottom--not just by strengthening \nlaw enforcement, but by addressing systemic challenges of reentry and \nrecidivism.\n  Jim, it would be impossible to do full justice to your legacy in a \nsingle statement. So instead allow me to end by saying this: The \nCommonwealth of Virginia is better because of your leadership, and so \nis our country.\n  You will be missed in the Senate, but given everything you \naccomplished before you were elected--as Secretary of the Navy, as an \nEmmy award-winning journalist, as the author of nine books--I'm \nconfident you will find some way to occupy your time in retirement. I \nknow you will continue to find ways to improve our great country and \ngive back to the State you love so much. Thank you, Senator Webb. I \nwish you the best.\n\n\n                              Scott Brown\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my gratitude to Scott \nBrown, with whom I have enjoyed the privilege of serving for the past 3 \nyears. During that time, Senator Brown and I served together on the \nHomeland Security and Government Services Committee, which I have \nchaired, as well as the Senate Armed Services Committee, where he and I \nhave worked closely together as chairman and ranking member.\n  Senator Brown's life story is a testament to our power to overcome \nany obstacle. His aptly titled memoir, ``Against All Odds,'' describes \nhow despite suffering through a childhood in which he had to steal in \norder to help feed his sister and in which he was the victim of abuse, \nhe rose to attend college and law school, serve in the Army National \nGuard, and eventually be elected to the U.S. Senate. Senator Brown \nshould be a role model to every young American who looks at themselves \nin the mirror and wonders whether they can overcome the obstacles in \ntheir path, because he has.\n  Senator Brown has been an invaluable Member of the Senate and the \ncommittees on which he has served, lending a voice of reason in an ever \nmore partisan time. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Brown played a critical role in the debate on whether to repeal \nthe military's don't ask, don't tell policy, grilling witnesses at the \ncommittee's hearings on the issue throughout the year. Senator Brown \nwas forthright in his view that the law should not be changed until \nCongress fully understood any possible risks associated with acting on \nthe issue, but after he had studied the report issued by the Defense \nDepartment's working group tasked with reviewing the issue, he lent his \nstrong voice in support of repeal. For that, I am grateful, as are the \ntens of thousands of gay and lesbian servicemembers who no longer serve \nunder the threat of separation because of who they are.\n  In the 112th Congress, Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on \nAirland, he and I were responsible for overseeing the tactical aviation \nand land power programs of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. \nIt was a great pleasure working with Scott on these important matters, \nand I always benefitted from his experience as a guardsman when \nreviewing these programs.\n  As a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Brown fought for and achieved passage of the Stop \nTrading on Congressional Knowledge Act, STOCK Act, a bill that forbids \nMembers of Congress and their staffs from profiting in any way from the \ninformation they obtain as part of the job that is not public. It is a \ntestament to his service in the Senate that one of Scott Brown's most \nnotable accomplishments was a bill to uphold the standards of the \nethical behavior of Congress. It was an honor to work with Senator \nBrown on this important effort.\n  As ranking member on the Federal Financial Management Subcommittee, \nScott Brown joined his chairman, Tom Carper, along with full committee \nranking member Susan Collins and me to introduce the bipartisan 21st \nCentury Postal Service Act, which the full Senate endorsed on April 25, \n2012. This bill reflected many hours of tough negotiations in which \nScott played a key role, and set out a balanced plan to get the Postal \nService's finances back in order.\n  Senator Scott Brown has enriched the work of the Senate and the lives \nof his colleagues over the past 3 years. He brought to the Senate not \nonly his considerable talents but a great sense of humor, which was \nparticularly helpful in the 3 tough years he was here. I wish him and \nhis family all the best as he opens a new chapter of his own life and \nknow that he will continue to serve our country in ways that really \nmatter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8575-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8575-S8576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FISCAL CLIFF\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I came to the floor before I heard the \nannouncement that apparently we are closing in, thankfully, on \nsomething which I don't have all the details of as yet. So I can't \nsimply say hooray, this is exactly what we ought to do. I think neither \nside is going to be able to say this is what we wanted to do.\n  But in recognition of the fact that we are careening now--hours are \nticking--hours away from a devastating impact on Americans all across \nthe country, every taxpayer--Senator Lieberman announced the statistics \nrelative to the impact on the average family in his State, and the same \nis true for Indiana and for all 50 States, to impose the massive tax \nincreases which will occur on every taxpayer at midnight tonight, \nwithout addressing that, it is just simply unacceptable.\n  It is hard for a lot of us to swallow how little we did in addressing \nthe larger fiscal issue in this country in order to get past this \nimposed deadline on something I did not vote for and did not support \nbecause I could see it coming to this end, and it was absolutely the \nwrong way to legislate and the wrong way to govern--pushing us toward \nthis fiscal cliff, laying that dark cloud of uncertainty over every \nbusiness in America, every household in America.\n  Everyone who had any interest in investing or was trying to plan for \nthe future kept saying: I can't make a decision. I can't make plans. I \ndon't know what you are going to do. Are we going over the cliff? Are \nmy taxes going to rise? Are regulations going to increase? What is the \nfuture? And if the future remains uncertain, I can't plan ahead. If it \nis bad certainty, I can work around it. I might not like it, but I can \nmake the adjustments necessary.\n  So, as a result, we have a stagnant economy as a result of all this.\n  I am hoping that when we learn the details of what we have finally \narrived at, which we will be learning very shortly, I am hoping it is \nsomething we can swallow hard and accept, knowing--knowing--this fiscal \ncliff is nothing compared to the real fiscal cliff. The real fiscal \ncliff is the continued excessive borrowing and spending of over $1 \ntrillion a year that is driving this country into a serious fiscal \nsituation for the future. And it is not just something our children and \ngrandchildren are going to have to pay for years down the line. It is \nsomething we are all paying for now. It is something that is keeping \npeople from getting back to work, keeping companies from expanding.\n  We have an obligation to our generation and all future generations to \naddress what I believe every American who is paying any attention \nwhatsoever understands--and certainly everyone in this body and in our \ncorresponding House down the hall understands, whether they are a \nRepublican, a Democrat, liberal, or conservative--is just simple math. \nIt is not even algebra or calculus. It is third grade math. You cannot \nraise $2.2 trillion a year and spend $3.5 trillion or $3.4 trillion. \nLiterally, we have now added approaching $6 trillion in just the last 4 \nyears, and it is unsustainable. That is going to hurt everybody, and it \nis hurting our economy right now. That is the real cliff. That is the \ncliff we have to continue to address. That is the cliff we were hoping \nto address in the leverage of this situation, but we are coming up \nvery, very short.\n  Mr. President, I didn't realize we were under a time limitation. Are \nwe under a time limitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. COATS. All right. I thank the Chair. I saw some angst on the face \nof the Chair, and I thought my time was up.\n  Let me just say this to my colleagues. Many of us who watched the\n\n[[Page S8576]]\n\nPresident's press conference--no, it wasn't a press conference; the \nPresident's speech--felt we were seeing a rerun of something that took \nplace during the campaign. We have all been watching a lot of football, \nand for Republicans to sit and listen and watch that, it reminded me of \ntaunting those people on the other team. It stops you cold. It stands \nover you and taunts. It got so bad that now the NFL has made it a \npenalty and they throw the flag. It is not something we would expect \nout of the leader of this free Nation. It is not statesmanship. It is \nnot leadership. It is in your face. It was dismissive, it was \ninsulting, it was belittling, and in the end it was sad.\n  Now, the natural reaction is to get angry and push back and get \nrevenge. But that is not where we are, and that is not where we need to \nbe. We need to set this aside. It is like the coach tapping us on the \nshoulder pad and saying: What was done speaks for itself; don't stoop \nto that level. So we need to set that aside now and go forward in the \ninterest of the future of this country, in the interest of America and \nthe families and people we represent in our States, and look at this \nvery carefully.\n  I think every one of us is going to say we haven't begun to address \nthe spending, we haven't begun to address what we need to do, and so \nthat has to be our charge in 2013--relentlessly.\n  And I would say, Mr. President, I think people on the other side of \nthe aisle were probably embarrassed also by that speech. It was a \ncampaign speech, and the campaigns are over. The President doesn't need \nto run for office anymore. It is time to lead. So let's all get \ntogether.\n  We have been working together----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. I want to say this: To make laughter out of this, to \nridicule it--it addresses all of us because I have been working with \nSenators across the aisle and they have been working with us. We all \ntake this very, very seriously. This is not a joke. This is not \nsomething to make fun of. This is not something to politicize. This is \nsomething where we should rise above politics and do what is right for \nthe future of America even though it is difficult. This is not doing \nwhat many of us would like to do, but we have been working together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, and I can name dozens of Democrats who think \nthis is a serious matter and who have been working hard for the last 2 \nyears to try to address it, as frustrated as we are on this side.\n  So let's understand this is not a game. This is real. Let's work \ntogether to do what we can do and then continue to address the real \nissues as we go forward in 2013.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, let me first of all join my colleague from \nIndiana in expressing my concern about where we are on taxes and \nspending and my hope that we get somewhere and get somewhere quickly.\n  We have certainly brought this down to the last moment. For months, \nmany people on this floor talked about the importance of certainty as \nit relates to our economy moving forward, of certainty as it relates to \nfamily farms and small businesses and whether they can stay in the next \ngeneration of that family. So I hope we can achieve those things in the \nnext coming hours as we finish this day and whatever it takes to create \nthat level of certainty at the highest possible levels. How it impacts \nAmerican individuals and families will be important.\n  The kinds of things we are hearing about the agreement--that we might \nbe able to go forward generally--sound as though, for most Americans, \nthey will solve problems that have been out there now for decades. \nTemporary tax policies--even tax policies that last for a decade, \nparticularly when they relate to things such as the inheritance tax or \nthe death tax--create problems that can be solved by just simply \ndriving that place in the Tax Code and saying: This is what our \npolicies are going to look like, and here is why they make sense for \nthe American people. And hopefully we get there.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Blunt and Ms. Landrieu are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Louisiana \nSupreme Court Chief Justice Catherine D. Kimball, who is scheduled to \nretire in 2013. It was 1975 and the courtroom was packed in New Roads, \nLA. The people in the courtroom weren't there to hear the ruling on the \nsalesman who allegedly scammed an elderly gentleman. They were there to \nsee Catherine D. Kimball--the first female lawyer to argue a case in \nthe New Roads courtroom. Catherine Kimball, affectionately known as \n``Kitty'', later became the first female Chief Justice of the Louisiana \nSupreme Court. She will retire on February 1, 2013 and I rise today to \noffer remarks about this very accomplished woman.\n  Chief Justice Kimball brought a diverse legal background to the bench \nand exemplified leadership as a Justice on the Louisiana Supreme Court. \nWhile breaking the glass ceiling, she demonstrated a commitment to \njuvenile justice and legal scholarship. Chief Justice Kimball is truly \na pioneer in the Louisiana legal community and a great legal scholar.\n  Catherine Kimball decided to attend law school during her freshman \nyear of college. So in 1966, after earning her Bachelor of Arts at \nLouisiana State University, she enrolled at LSU law school. While \nattending law school, the future Louisiana Chief Justice met Clyde \nKimball on a blind date. The two were married in January of 1967. By \n1970, Chief Justice Kimball was graduating law school with two children \nand another on the way. After graduating from law school, she clerked \nfor a Federal judge in Alexandria, LA before returning to Baton Rouge, \nLA to investigate construction fraud allegations in the Attorney \nGeneral's office. In 1975, the family moved to New Roads where she \nopened her private practice in New Roads, LA.\n  Although Chief Justice Kimball enjoyed success early in her career, \nshe also faced her share of adversity. At one point, she sat down with \nthe president of the bank to discuss borrowing money for her law \npractice. The bank president informed her that her husband had to sign \noff on her loan. Chief Justice Kimball said, ``Excuse me--are you not \naware of the new law that just passed? My husband does not have to sign \na note for me to borrow for my law office.'' She was committed to \nsucceed despite all obstacles.\n  As a result of her perseverance, Chief Justice Kimball became the \nfirst female judge in the 18th Judicial District in Louisiana in 1983. \nMembers of the legal community quickly recognized her talent and \npotential and in short order, the legal community encouraged her to run \nfor the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Kimball hesitated, saying she \nloved working as a district judge too much to leave that behind. \nNevertheless, she became the first woman elected to the Louisiana \nSupreme Court in 1992.\n  Chief Justice Kimball demonstrated strong leadership skills soon \nafter joining the court. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when \nthen Louisiana Chief Justice Pascal Calogero was evacuated from his \nhome in New Orleans and displaced in Dallas, he turned to Justice \nKimball for support. Chief Justice Kimball served as the court's point \nperson and worked with FEMA to get reimbursements and get the courts \nand lawyers back to work in New Orleans. That was the beginning of a \nlong road ahead as Chief Justice Kimball dealt with Katrina issues for \nat least the next 5 years.\n  On January 1, 2009, she became the first female Chief Justice of the \nLouisiana Supreme Court. As Chief Justice, she strengthened her \nreputation as a brilliant and tireless advocate for justice. She became \nknown for her work to preserve the judiciary as an equal and \nindependent branch of government and collaborated with the legislature; \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. Most of all, she made her mark by \nmaking strides in juvenile justice.\n  Chief Justice's dedication to juvenile justice developed from \nunderstanding\n\n[[Page S8577]]\n\nthe effects that courts can have on children. Through her work in \njuvenile justice, she earned the respect of members of the national and \nlocal judicial communities. Judith S. Kaye, a retired Chief Justice of \nNew York, said of the Chief Justice, ``She was outstanding in many \nways, but for me most of all on the vexing issues concerning juvenile \njustice. The Chief Justice's ideas and initiatives drew my attention \neven before she became Chief Justice.'' Sue Bell Cobb, the Chief \nJustice of Alabama, also praised Chief Justice's work on juvenile \njustice. ``Children,'' she said, ``do not vote and do not have a voice \nin arenas in which public policy is made. In Louisiana, Chief Justice \nKimball has been their voice.''\n  In Louisiana, former Louisiana Chief Justice Pascal Calogero said, \n``Justice Kimball's contributions to the juvenile justice system, as \nwell as the Judicial Leadership Institute, and other progressive \njudicial matters, were immeasurable. When she became Chief Justice, I \nknew that she would become one of the most active and respected chief \njustices in the history of the court.'' I could not agree more. Chief \nJustice Kimball has made her mark in history for many reasons, but \nespecially for her work in juvenile justice.\n  The Chief Justice's accomplishments are of equally important \nsignificance for women pursuing legal careers in Louisiana. My sister \nMadeleine became a State court judge in 2001. When I asked Madeleine \nwhat Chief Justice Kimball's career has meant to her, she said, ``When \nChief Justice Kimball took her seat among her six white male justices, \nit had a huge impact on me as a woman lawyer. The grace and dignity and \nexcellence with which Chief Justice has held herself has shown us there \nare no limits to where we can go. It made such lofty goals not as scary \nto us anymore.'' Chief Justice Kimball always strives to reach her full \npotential and encourages others to do the same.\n  Among Chief Justice's endless list of accomplishments is her creation \nof the Judicial Leadership Institute in Louisiana. She recognized the \nimportant leadership role of a judge as both an employer and as a \nmember of a community. She saw the value of judges of every level being \nin a room together and learning together. So she took the initiative to \norganize a training course which meets 7 days a year. This exemplifies \nso many of Chief Justice Kimball's great qualities--her devotion to the \njustice system and to the future of our state, her humility and her \nability to be a strong leader while simultaneously being part of a \nteam.\n  As the Chief Justice prepares to retire, I commend her for her years \nof service to our State and for her unwavering commitment to the \nLouisiana Constitution. Although she will step down at the end of \nJanuary, the impact she made on the nearly 4.6 million citizens in our \nState will live on beyond her retirement, just as the people in that \ncourtroom in New Roads, LA will never forget the day they saw Chief \nJustice Kimball make history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8577-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING BERNETTE JOHNSON\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a trailblazer \nand role model: Louisiana Supreme Court Justice Bernette J. Johnson. On \nFebruary 1, 2013, Justice Johnson will become Louisiana's first \nAfrican-American Chief Justice and only the second female jurist in \nLouisiana history to hold that office. It is fitting that the first \nwoman elected to the Civil District Court of New Orleans--a woman who \nhas devoted so much of her life to working as an advocate for social \njustice, civil rights and community organizing--would achieve this \nhistoric milestone.\n  Justice Johnson's commitment to civil rights began in the 1960s, when \nshe began working as a community organizer with the NAACP Legal Defense \n& Educational Fund. She worked with community groups in Alabama, \nMississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and \nLouisiana, disseminating information about recent school desegregation \ndecisions and encouraging parents to take advantage of newly \ndesegregated schools. Justice Johnson brings a unique perspective to \nthe bench that is informed by principles of justice and equity.\n  An alumnus of Spelman College in Atlanta, Justice Johnson received \nher Juris Doctor Degree at the Law School at Louisiana State \nUniversity, where her portrait now hangs in the Law Center's Hall of \nFame. While in law school, she worked at the U.S. Department of Justice \nexamining cases filed by the Department to implement the 1964 Civil \nRights Act. These cases primarily concerned discrimination in public \naccommodations. Following law school, Justice Johnson became the \nmanaging attorney with the New Orleans Legal Assistance Corporation, \nwhere she provided legal services to over 3,000 clients in socio-\neconomically deprived neighborhoods.\n  Justice Johnson worked in the Federal and State District Courts \nadvancing the rights of the poor, the elderly, and the disenfranchised, \nand in the Juvenile Court advancing the rights of children. In 1981, \nshe joined the City Attorney's staff, and later became a Deputy City \nAttorney for the City of New Orleans. There, she attained extensive \ntrial experience in the Civil District Court and U.S. District Court \ndefending police brutality claims and general tort claims filed against \nthe City of New Orleans. Her experience fighting to protect the rights \nof the under privileged undoubtedly prepared her for service on the \nbench.\n  Justice Johnson began her judicial career in 1984 as the first woman \nelected to serve on the Civil District Court of New Orleans. There, she \ntook the initiative to establish a system to refer custody, alimony, \nand child support issues to mediation conducted by certified social \nworkers of the Children's Bureau and Family Services, prior to court \nappearances. She was elected to the Supreme Court in 1994 and re-\nelected in 2000. She serves on the Louisiana Supreme Court's Judicial \nCouncil, and has served on the Court's Legal Services Task Force, as \nwell as the National Campaign on Best Practices in the area of Racial \nand Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.\n  This is a truly a moment to be remembered, not just for the people of \nLouisiana, but for Americans all across the country. From advocating \nwith the NAACP, to helping implement the 1964 Civil Rights Act, to \nbecoming Louisiana's first African-American Supreme Court Justice, as \nshe has now, Bernette Johnson's life and career is a testament to the \nspirit of the civil rights movement and the countless Americans who \nfought tirelessly to open the doors of equality. I congratulate Justice \nBernette J. Johnson on a stellar legal and judicial career and thank \nher for her fighting spirit, commitment to equality, and deep respect \nfor the dignity of all citizens. I have no doubt that she will continue \nto serve the people of Louisiana well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8577-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8577-S8578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING LEAH CHASE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing the 90th birthday of the ``Queen of Creole \nCuisine,'' Mrs. Leah Chase of New Orleans, LA.\n  Mrs. Chase was born in Madisonville, LA on January 6, 1923, and moved \nto New Orleans as a teenager to attend high school. It was in New \nOrleans that she developed her love for food and feeding others. Mrs. \nChase married her husband, Edgar ``Dooky'' Chase Jr., in 1946, and they \ntook over the family business--one of the best-known and most \nculturally significant restaurants in New Orleans, Dooky Chase's.\n  Mrs. Chase has cooked for jazz royalty, like Duke Ellington; for \nheads of state--among them Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama; \nand for the civil rights movement's greatest champions, like Justice \nThurgood Marshall and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. And though she is \nwell-known for having catered to America's history makers, perhaps her \ngreatest achievement is having quietly created a community where people \nare taken care of, no matter their situation in life. Mrs. Chase always \ntakes care of those in need. She makes it a point to know not only the \nnames of her patrons, but also their stories. And that feeling of a \nclosely knit community where people look out for each other is why New \nOrleanians have been dining with Mrs. Chase for three generations. They \nare family to her, just like her four children, sixteen grandchildren \nand 22 great-grandchildren.\n  Mrs. Chase has received too many awards to mention.

Mr. President, as we confront a whole range of difficult \nissues at the end of this year and at the end of this Congress, we \nshould also be reminded we have fighting men and women serving for us \nall over the world.\n  We think especially tonight of those serving in Afghanistan and those \nwho served prior to that time in Iraq. At various times we have come to \nthe floor and recited the names of those who were killed in action, and \ntonight I am joined by my colleague Senator Toomey to read the names of \nPennsylvanians who gave, as Lincoln said, the last full measure of \ndevotion to their country--those who have been killed in action in \nAfghanistan over the course of parts of 2011 and 2012.\n  I yield the floor for my colleague, Senator Toomey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, for organizing this brief tribute that is so much \ndeserved by the men and women we are acknowledging today.\n  I wish to begin by extending my deepest condolences to the families, \nfriends, and loved ones of these Pennsylvania heroes whom we are going \nto acknowledge this evening. In the lives our servicemembers led and \nthe cause for which they died, these folks represent all that is great \nabout America.\n  Many enlisted right after graduating from high school, and during \nthose very tough and grueling days and weeks in basic training they had \nprobably never heard of places such as Anbar Province in Iraq, the \nTangi Valley of Afghanistan or the other areas in those nations where \nthey fought and ended up dying for our country.\n  But these Pennsylvanians join a long line of soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, marines, and Coast Guard members who have given the supreme \nsacrifice to their country, a line that extends well back in the latter \npart of the 20th century and includes World War II, the Korean war, the \nVietnam war, and of course the global war on terrorism.\n  It is no accident that Pennsylvania has suffered very heavily in this \nconflict, as it has in other conflicts throughout our Nation's history. \nI think it is because in towns across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \ntowns and cities such as Dallastown, Easton, Philadelphia, and Erie, \nthere are certain values that are deeply rooted in these communities: \nimportance of family, importance of faith, importance of community, and \nthe importance of public service, including very much the service to \nthis Nation.\n  The conviction that freedom is worth defending is one of those \nconvictions and the belief that a cause worth fighting for is not just \nsomeone else's responsibility. These are the values that have shaped \nthese men and women, their families, their churches and houses of \nworship, and their communities.\n  These values were exemplified in the lives of our fallen men and \nwomen in service, and they will forever be honored by Pennsylvanians as \nthe native sons and daughters of our great Commonwealth for their \nservice to the country.\n  I will read the names of the men and women who have made the supreme \nsacrifice for courage in this conflict, and Senator Casey will complete \nthe list: PFC David Anthony Jefferson, U.S. Army, Philadelphia; SGT \nLouis Robert Fastuca, U.S. Army, West Chester; SPC Jesse David Reed, \nU.S. Army, Orefield; LCpl Abram Larue Howard, U.S. Marine Corps, \nWilliamsport; SPC Dale Justin Kridlo, U.S. Army, Hughestown; SPC \nAnthony Vargas, U.S. Army, Reading; SSG Sean Michael Flannery, U.S. \nArmy, Wyomissing; GySgt Justin Edward Schmalstieg, U.S. Marine Corps, \nPittsburgh; MSG Benjamin Franklin Bitner, U.S. Army, Greencastle; 1LT \nDemetrius Montaz Frison, U.S. Army, Lancaster; SSG Edward David Mills \nJr., U.S. Army, Newscastle; Sgt Joseph Michael Garrison, U.S. Marine \nCorps, New Bethlehem; Ssgt Patrick Ryan Dolphin, U.S. Marine Corps, \nMoscow; Sgt Christopher Matthew Wrinkle, U.S. Marine Corps, Dallastown; \nPO1 Michael Joseph Strange, U.S. Navy, Philadelphia; TSgt Daniel Lee \nZerbe, U.S. Air Force, York; SSG Eric Scott Holman, U.S. Army, Evans \nCity; Lt. Col. Christopher Keith Raible, U.S. Marine Corps, North \nHuntingdon; CPO Nicolas David Checque, U.S. Navy, Monroeville; CDR Job \nW. Price, U.S. Navy, Pottstown; and finally, MAJ Wesley James Hinkley, \nU.S. Army, Cumberland City.\n  I yield the floor to the senior Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator for reading the first half of our \nnames, and I will continue with 20 more names: Sgt Derek Lee Shanfield, \nU.S. Marine Corps, Hastings, PA; SFC Robert James Fike, U.S. Army, \nConneautville; SFC Bryan Alan Hoover, U.S. Army, West Elizabeth; Sgt \nJoseph Davis Caskey, U.S. Marine Corps, Pittsburgh; LCpl Joshua Thomas \nTwigg, U.S. Marine Corps, Indiana; CPL Joshua Alexander Harton, U.S. \nArmy, Bethlehem; LCpl Ralph John Fabbri, U.S. Marine Corps, Gallitzin; \nSSG David Jee Weigle, U.S. Army, Philadelphia; Cpl Eric Michael Torbet, \nJr., U.S. Marine Corps, Lancaster; CPL Jarrid Lee King, U.S. Army, \nErie; SGT Robert Curtis Sisson, Jr., U.S. Army, Aliquippa; PFC John \nFrancis Kihm, U.S. Army, Philadelphia; 1SG Kenneth Brian Elwell, U.S. \nArmy, Erie; SGT Edward William Koehler III, U.S. Army, Lebanon; SSG \nBrian Keith Mowery, U.S. Army, Halifax; SSG Kenneth Rowland Vangiesen, \nU.S. Army, Erie; SrA Bryan Richard Bell, U.S. Air Force, Erie; CPT \nMichael Cean Braden, U.S. Army, Lock Haven; PFC Cameron James \nStambaugh, U.S. Army, Spring Grove; and finally, SSG Brandon Robert \nPepper, U.S. Army, York, PA.\n  As I conclude the list of Pennsylvanians who were killed in action \nover approximately a 2-year time period in Afghanistan--and one of the \nnames that was read was killed in Iraq--we remember and think of them, \nand obviously we are paying tribute to them on a night like tonight. At \nthe same time, we are also thinking of their families as we pay tribute \nto them.\n  I am reminded of the great recording artist Bruce Springsteen. One of \nhis songs was entitled ``You're Missing,'' and the refrain over and \nover again is ``you're missing.'' He was able to sing, but I won't. The \nsong goes something like this: You're missing when I shut out the \nlights; you're missing when I close my eyes; you're missing when I see \nthe sunrise.\n  For all those families out there who lost someone in Afghanistan, \nIraq, or in other conflicts, we are thinking of them tonight because \nthey are missing someone in the midst of this end-of-the-year and \nholiday season. We are remembering them tonight and paying tribute to \nthose they loved and lost and also remembering them in our prayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is indeed unique that on New Year's Eve \nwe are in session. We still have some very important business we need \nto take care of for our Nation. We should not have put our country in \nthis position. We should have acted well before December 31. We all \nunderstand that, but it is important that we get this work done in the \nremaining hours of this term of Congress.\n\n[[Page S8579]]\n\n  On Thursday, the 113th Congress will take the oath of office and we \nwill start a new Congress. Before that, we must get the work of this \nCongress finished. At a minimum, we need to deal with the impact of tax \nrates that would go up for every taxpayer in this country unless we \ntake action before this Congress adjourns.\n  We need to protect middle-income families. We all talked about it. We \nknow that needs to be done. We need to protect Americans from the tax \nincreases that will take effect for the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans--those who are middle-income taxpayers. We need to do this \nfirst and foremost because it would create an incredible burden on \nworking families to pay an extra $2,000 to $4,000 of taxes, and we also \nneed to do it to help our economy. That type of money coming out of the \neconomy through additional tax increases would have a very detrimental \nimpact on our economy, which is coming out of a tough period.\n  We also need to deal with what we call sequestration. I was listening \nto the senior Senator from Maryland, chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Mikulski, talk about the effects of sequestration. \nShe is right. Some people may not understand that term, but what it \nmeans is that there will be dramatic cuts in governmental agencies, \nwhich will not only affect the performance of those agencies but also \nthe contracts they let to the private sector. It will affect not only \nour domestic budget but our military budget. She went through a lot of \nthe different impacts it will have, from children who are in jeopardy \nof losing their support from Head Start, to our researchers being \ndenied the resources they need in order to do work that is vital to our \neconomy.\n\n  The bottom line is that if we allow the across-the-board cuts to take \neffect, it will hurt our economy and hurt the job growth in America. We \ncannot allow that to happen. I expect that we can get this done before \nthis Congress adjourns on January 2.\n  We also need to deal with what we call the physician fix of Medicare. \nWe can get that done in this Congress. If not, doctors who treat our \nseniors and our disabled population will find that there will be almost \na 30-percent cut in their physician reimbursement. Many physicians \nwould say they are not going to treat seniors any longer with that type \nof reduction. We understand that. We need to make sure we take care of \nprotecting the reimbursement rates for physicians in the Medicare \nsystem. We need to get that done and can get it done before this \nCongress adjourns.\n  We need to extend unemployment insurance. There are millions of \nAmericans who depend on unemployment insurance in a soft economic time. \nThey cannot find jobs. Again, this is not only important for the \nindividuals who would be cut off if we do not extend the benefits, it \nis also important for our economic recovery.\n  We also need to extend the farm bill. We have heard the consequences \nif we don't do that. I had hoped they could pass a bill--which this \nChamber passed--over in the House. It is unlikely we can get that done \nin the next 2 days, so we need to make sure we at least extend the \ncurrent FARM policies in order to make sure we protect the security of \nour agricultural community and food prices here in America.\n  All of that we can get done. Hopefully we can get it done tonight but \ncertainly before we adjourn on January 2. We need to complete that work \nin order to keep our economy moving and to protect the interests of the \npeople in this Nation. Quite frankly, I don't think there is much \ndisagreement in this Chamber as to the method to get that done.\n  I am disappointed that we are not dealing with a broader budget \nframework for our Nation. We should have done that well before now. We \nshould do it for many reasons. For one thing, we need it. We have a \ndeficit that is not controllable. We have to bring our deficit into \nbetter control. In order to do that, we need to reduce spending and we \nneed the revenues in order to be able to give the right blueprint for \nAmerica's future and growth.\n  We also need to get a broader package done because of predictability. \nThe private sector needs to know what the rules are, and they need to \nknow what the Tax Code and spending programs are going to look like. \nThey need to have the confidence that we have our budget under better \ncontrol. We should have gotten that done.\n  I have spoken several times on the floor about how we should have \nadopted the Simpson-Bowles framework. To me, that was a bipartisan, \nbalanced approach for how we could have gotten out of our fiscal \nproblems. We are not going to be able to get that done in the next 2 \ndays before we adjourn on January 2, but we need to recognize that we \nneed to do that.\n  I have heard a lot of my colleagues come to the floor to speak, and I \nhave to clarify a couple of points. Simpson-Bowles was basically a $4 \ntrillion, 10-year deficit reduction package. It was booked up as the \nright approach. Many of us have been asking, how we can get $4 trillion \ndone? Well, it is interesting that with the Simpson-Bowles approach, \napproximately 60 percent was in spending reductions and about 40 \npercent was in revenue. That was a balanced way to bring down spending \nbut also bring in the revenues we need in order to get our budget into \nbetter balance. That is the proper way to do it.\n  Since the recommendations of Simpson-Bowles, we have done $1 trillion \nin deficit reduction in domestic discretionary spending. We have gotten \nthat done. Those budget caps are real, and we are living within those \nbudget caps. Sequestration--these across-the-board cuts--would get \nanother $1.2 trillion of spending cuts done. We should not do it \nthrough sequestration, but all of us recognize that we need to find \nways to reduce spending further.\n  I have talked on the floor about how we can get that done, \nparticularly in the health care field. Yes, we have to reduce the cost \nof Medicare, but the way to do it is to reduce the cost of health care. \nWe would have fewer readmissions to hospitals if we implemented the \nright delivery system protocols, and we would save money for our \neconomy and Medicare. If we use preventive health care appropriately, \npeople will enter our health care system in a less costly way, with \nmore people insured and less use of emergency rooms. Once again, we \nsave money.\n  Our committees need to come up with these solutions. It is not going \nto happen with two or three people getting together and coming up with \na package. We need the Senate and its committees to work and come up \nwith the right way to reduce the cost of these programs. I think we can \ndo it basically by making the health care system more efficient, and \nthat is much better than cutting benefits. I hope we can work together \nto get that done. We need to do that.\n  Yes, we need revenue. I heard some of my colleagues come here and \nsay: Well, look at all the revenue we are going to get under this \nsupposed agreement that has been talked about, which hopefully we will \nget as early as tonight. We already made a compromise. The rate at \nwhich no American will see any increase in taxes looks as if it will be \nhigher than $250,000. It has been reported it is going to be closer to \n$400,000. OK. Well, now, what does that mean? That means we are going \nto get less revenue as a result of this agreement reached tonight. The \nnumbers I have seen--and this may very well change based upon the \nagreement; hopefully, we are going to have an agreement--but somewhere \naround $500 billion to $600 billion. That is far short of the $1.2 \ntrillion or $1.4 trillion we have been talking about--the whole--in \norder to reach that $4 trillion number we all say is the minimum amount \nwe need as per the Simpson-Bowles numbers. So we are going to need more \nrevenue.\n\n  Here is the rub, here is the challenge: When we start looking to get \nmore revenue, we are talking about now getting it through tax reform. \nWe all understand we have to reform our Tax Code. It is difficult to do \nthat when we have to produce revenue at the same time because people \nare looking at trying to do something about rates. Well, since we need \nthe revenue for the deficit reduction package, it will be more \ndifficult.\n  My point is this: I am disappointed we haven't gotten our work done \nwell before tonight, but it is urgent that we work together, Democrats \nand Republicans, and get the minimum amount done the American people \nexpect; that is, to make sure tax rates don't go up for middle-income \nfamilies. We can get\n\n[[Page S8580]]\n\nthat done. We can get that done as early as tonight. We should avoid \nthe immediate sequestration order because that makes no sense--these \nacross-the-board cuts--and figure out a way we can have a much more \norderly process for reducing government spending.\n  We should make sure Medicare is not jeopardized by having a physician \nfix done in this compromise. We should make sure for the people who are \ngetting unemployment insurance, to maintain their benefits. And we \nshould extend the farm bill. That we can get done in the remaining \nhours of this legislative session.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to work together. I am hopeful our \nleaders are negotiating a package that can be brought to the floor as \nearly as tonight, certainly before we adjourn on January 2. If we do \nthat, then I think we have completed as much of our business as we can, \nas well as setting up for the debate in the 113th Congress which will \nindeed be challenging. But I urge us to work together and put the \ninterests of the American people first.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise this evening to once again \naddress the fiscal cliff. Clearly, the time to debate has come and \ngone. The simple fact is we need to act and we need to act now.\n  Earlier today, we heard from the President, and what I heard from the \nPresident is that he feels we have the framework for an agreement on \ntaxes. Also, the Senate minority leader has indicated, after his \nnegotiations with the Vice President, that he believes we have the \nbasic agreement on a tax proposal to avoid the fiscal cliff. So let's \ntake that step. Let's address the tax piece. Let's get it done.\n  Granted, the tax proposal is not the big agreement that will fully \naddress our debt and deficit--an agreement we hope to be able to put \ntogether, an agreement I support and one that includes tax reform, \nbipartisan entitlement reform, and finding savings in the Federal \nbudget. Clearly, these items all need to be addressed, and they need to \nbe addressed on the order of $4 trillion to get our deficit and our \ndebt under control.\n  That is the type of deal I favor, and it is the kind of deal we have \nto get to. But if we can't do it all at once, let's do it in pieces. As \nthe old saying goes, even the longest journey begins with a single \nstep. If the first step is this tax deal, let's get going. To break the \nlogjam, let's start with this piece--a tax deal that will ensure taxes \nare not increased for middle-class Americans. That is something we can \nand we must do. It does involve compromise. For example, I believe we \nshould extend the current tax rates for all taxpayers. Real revenue \ncomes from economic growth, not higher taxes. By closing loopholes and \nlimiting deductions, we can create a simpler, fairer Tax Code that will \nhelp our economy grow.\n  President Obama, however, has a different view, so we are forced to \nfind common ground. In this case, that means extending the tax rates we \ncan to help as many Americans as possible avoid higher taxes. We also \nneed to fully address sequestration. Sequestration involves automatic \nspending cuts. Those spending cuts hit the military disproportionately, \nand I believe they need to be revised. But the pressure to do that \nkicks in after January 1, and I believe that pressure will serve as a \ncatalyst for Congress to come up with and pass better alternatives.\n  Also, we must address the debt ceiling, and it must be addressed in a \nway that reduces spending. We have no choice. We are borrowing 40 cents \nof every $1 we spend, and that is simply not sustainable. But, again, \nwe have to break the current logjam, and if we can't get all these \nthings done in one package, then let's get started with what we can do. \nLet's get this tax piece done for as many working taxpayers as possible \nand immediately move on to the next tax. Quite simply, that is what \nAmericans want us to do.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Madam President, I am here tonight to talk about \nagriculture and the 16 million people all across our country who have \njobs because of agriculture. What I am very concerned about is the way \nin which an extension is being talked about as part of the larger \npackage this evening that goes against my wishes, the wishes of our \ncommittee, the chairman in the House--Chairman Lucas and I--our four \nleaders, working together on an extension that works and extends all \nthe programs for agriculture through the end of the fiscal year, giving \nus time to pass a farm bill. Again, I am very concerned about what I am \nhearing this evening.\n  Let me first go back and say how appreciative I am and proud of all \nof us in the Senate for having passed a farm bill last June. We all \nknow what it did--more reforms than we have seen in decades, $24 \nbillion in deficit reduction. I understand the proposal now--the \nnegotiations going on are attempting to find ways to pay for some \nprovisions in the large package. We sit here with $24 billion in \ndeficit reduction in a farm bill that has reforms in it that support \nour farmers and ranchers across the country but reforms through \nconsolidation, efficiencies, and cutting subsidies that we have agreed \nshould not be paid, that the country cannot afford to pay to farmers \nwho do not need them. We worked very hard on that. We passed that in \nJune by a large bipartisan vote. We worked together in committee in a \nbipartisan way.\n  It is deeply concerning to me that instead of working in a bipartisan \nway, as we have done throughout this process--even though the House \nnever took up the bill that was passed out of their committee in a \nbipartisan way, we here have worked in a bipartisan way until now, \nuntil this moment, at the eleventh hour, as we are dealing with very \nimportant issues--whether we are going to make sure middle-class \nfamilies do not see tax increases starting tomorrow. And no one has \nfought harder to make sure the middle-class families of Michigan and \nacross the country get those tax cuts than I have, and we know we need \nto get things done, but we also need to make sure that in the end we \nare not putting agriculture farmers and ranchers at a disadvantage in \nthe process.\n  So we on a bipartisan basis--in the House, in the Senate--worked \ntogether, knowing, when it became very clear that the House leadership, \nthe Speaker, had no intention of taking up the farm bill in the House \ndespite the fact that farmers need the certainty of a 5-year farm bill \nand disaster assistance--when that became clear, we turned to the\n\n[[Page S8581]]\n\nnext responsible approach, which was to work together on how we could \nkeep in place farm programs, making sure we address what is now being \ncalled the dairy cliff in terms of milk prices that over time would go \nup--not immediately but over time--if nothing is done; disaster \nassistance; and keep in place the provisions of the farm bill that we \npassed that we agreed were important for rural communities, for energy \nsecurity for our country, for jobs, for farmers and ranchers.\n  Now I understand that the Republican leader has insisted in his \nnegotiations that only part of the farm bill be extended for the next 9 \nmonths--not all of it, not all of the pieces that affect rural America \nand farmers and ranchers, but only part of it. They call that a clean \nextension because of the way the funding and baseline work. I call \nthat--well, I will not say what I would call it, frankly, except to say \nthat this is bad news for American agriculture and certainly for the \npeople whom I represent in Michigan.\n  Now, why do I say that? Well, first of all, in our extension, we make \nsure we keep our commitment on disaster assistance. We passed an \nimportant disaster assistance bill a few days ago here in the Senate. I \nsupported that, but agriculture was not in it. The majority of the \ncounties in this country suffering from severe drought, cherry growers \nin my State being wiped out, other fruit growers having problems--\nnothing for agriculture. Well, we in our extension make sure for this \nyear and next that livestock and fruit growers have the disaster \nassistance we passed in the farm bill, and we pay for that.\n  We also make sure we continue to have an energy title in the farm \nbill. Now, when we look at getting off of foreign oil and creating real \ncompetition, advanced biofuels are doing that. We are now creating jobs \nacross Michigan and America in something called biobased manufacturing, \nusing agricultural products to offset petroleum and other chemicals and \nproducts, and we are creating jobs. We are doing that in part through \nsupport from the energy title of the farm bill.\n  The Republican leader's way of extending the farm bill would have \nzero--there would be no energy title, zero. That is absolutely \nunacceptable. We also would not see the full conservation title \nextended, key areas involving protecting land and open spaces that I \nknow Ducks Unlimited and Pheasants Forever and others who hunt and fish \ncare deeply about in terms of protecting our open spaces.\n  Other areas that protect our land and our water would not be extended \nunder this partial farm bill extension. We would not see critical \nresearch for organic or specialty crops that are so important that \ncreate almost half the cash receipts in agriculture in the country. We \nwould not see that support continue.\n  There are multiple things that would not continue, not because we \nhave gone through a process to eliminate them--in fact, 64 Senators in \nthis body voted to continue them, and in some cases to increase funding \nin those areas while cutting back on the subsidies that we should not \nbe spending money on. But here is what happened under this extension.\n  The subsidies we agreed to end continue. It is amazing, you know, how \nit happens that the folks who want the government subsidies find a way \nto try to keep them at all costs. Not in the light of day. They could \nnot sustain a debate in the committee or a debate on the floor where we \nvoted to eliminate direct payments. But somehow they are able to come \nback around at the end and keep that government money, even when prices \nare high, even when no one could look straight in the face of any \ntaxpayer and say they ought to be getting that subsidy.\n  Yet under the Republican leader's partial extension of the farm bill, \nthose subsidies we voted to eliminate would be fully continued. Now, in \nour version, agreed to by Chairman Lucas and me, put on the calendar by \nSpeaker Boehner, on the suspension calendar in the House by the Rules \nCommittee in the House, agreed to on the calendar in the House, we \nwould shave a portion of those subsidies to make sure we continued to \nfund all of the farm bill for the next 9 months until we can once again \ncome together and write a farm bill.\n  But I have to say, as someone who has been operating in good faith in \nthe committee and on the floor, to find this situation occurring that \nis not agreed to on a bipartisan basis, not put forward on a bipartisan \nbasis, I find to be absolutely outrageous. It makes you wonder what is \ngoing on here. If in the end, the things we agreed to, the things we \nworked hard to develop into a farm bill that saves $24 billion, at a \ntime when we are--right now people are sitting in rooms trying to \ndecide how to get deficit reduction. We passed something that saves $24 \nbillion in a fiscally responsible way, cutting programs. We cut 100 \ndifferent programs and authorizations. We went through every single \npage of the farm bill, which is what we ought to be doing in every part \nof government to be responsible, to make the tough choices, to set good \npriorities. We did that.\n  Now, at the last minute, none of that matters? They are trying to \nstick in an extension that only extends part of the farm program and \nkeeps 100 percent of the direct subsidies going. That is amazing to me, \nI have to say. That is absolutely amazing to me. I want to hear someone \njustify that on the Senate floor.\n  We are going to hear all kinds of things. Well, the extension \ninvolves possibly a budget point of order. This whole bill coming to \nthe floor is going to have multiple points of order that we are going \nto have to waive. This is not about procedure or budget points of \norder, it is about whether we mean it when we say we want to reform \nagriculture subsidies; whether we mean it when we say we care about \nrural America and farmers and ranchers who want to know that they can \nhave the certainty of a 5-year farm bill and not just limp along.\n  I can see it coming, limping along, limping along, extension after \nextension, just like we seem to see happening everywhere here. I \nthought agriculture was the one area where we were not going to do \nthat. I was so proud when we came together on a bipartisan basis and \nworked together. Regular order. The leaders, both sides, this is the \nright way to do things. It was regular order, 73 amendments. We went \nthrough it.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Would the Senator from Michigan yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be happy to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the leader of the Agriculture Committee, my \ncolleague from Michigan, who has steered this Chamber through such a \ncomplex set of issues in trying to address the true agricultural needs \nof our Nation while spending the taxpayers' dollar efficiently, and, in \nfact, producing a huge amount of savings in the overall bill.\n  But I wanted to ask a couple of questions in regard to the points the \nSenator from Michigan is making. If I understood the Senator right, \nfirst, the disaster assistance for America's ranchers and farmers and \norchardists that has been approved in the farm bill and sent to the \nSenate is not in the Republican leader's version that he wants to put \nthrough the floor of this Chamber?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, I would say to my friend and strong advocate on \nthese issues, it is not. Those disaster provisions are not in the \nextension he has arbitrarily on his own put forward.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Just a couple of days ago, due to the efforts the \nSenator engaged in, and I engaged in and others joined us--Senator \nBlunt was very instrumental--we had a debate about putting those \nemergency provisions into the emergency bill for Hurricane Sandy. I \nheard the Republican leader of the Budget Committee stand up and say: \nDon't worry, farmers and ranchers of America, because we are going to \nget those provisions passed in the farm bill.\n  But from what I am hearing now, that promise is being broken tonight \nby the Republican leader?\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I might respond, yes, that is exactly what is \nhappening. Without consultation with me or with the chairman in the \nHouse, we now have a partial extension of the farm bill. These are \ncomplex issues that involve a lot of pieces when you try to extend all \n12 titles of the farm bill. They not only do not extend all of the \ntitles, but they do not include critical disaster assistance, which, as \nthe Senator knows, our farmers and ranchers have been waiting for \nacross America.\n\n[[Page S8582]]\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So if I can try to translate this for the farmers and \nranchers in my State of Oregon and the orchardists and ranchers in the \nSenator's State, this Chamber committed itself to restoring the \nemergency disaster program either through the farm bill or through some \nother mechanism, but we have left them hanging since the fires and the \ndrought of July and August. Since the cold weather problems that \noccurred a year ago, we have left them hanging without disaster \nassistance. Now, the promise made a couple of days ago that we get this \ndone in the farm bill is being broken.\n  How can I possibly explain to my farmers and ranchers that when they \nhad the worst fire in a century, larger than the State of Rhode Island, \nthat burned their fences, burned their forage, burned their cattle, \nwhen others had some of the coldest weather that destroyed the crops, \nhow can I explain to them that not only do some of our Republican \ncolleagues, and apparently the Republican leader, consider that not to \nbe a disaster, but the very argument made a couple of days ago to not \nput it in the Sandy bill is now being thrown aside?\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would say to my friend and colleague from Oregon, \nthere is no way to explain this. None. There is absolutely no way to \nexplain this other than agriculture is just not a priority. I mean, \ndespite our best efforts and our working together to get something \ndone, it certainly has not been a priority in the House with the \nRepublican leadership. It has been on the committee. I have thoroughly \nenjoyed working with my counterpart in the House. We have worked \ntogether on a bipartisan basis. But we could not even get a bill taken \nup in the House.\n  I do appreciate the fact that when they did not act in the House, \nthat they have agreed to do the extension that we put together. At \nleast that is what they were willing to do. I honestly never thought \nthe problem would be here in the Senate because we had passed a farm \nbill. We passed a farm bill. We passed a farm bill with disaster \nassistance, with $24 billion in deficit reduction, in a strong \nbipartisan way, with supportive words in terms of the process from the \nleaders.\n  I am so shocked to see that the problem now is here in the Senate \nwith the Republican leader. There is just no excuse for this.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. The Senator from Michigan has worked over the past year \nto find a bipartisan strategy to reform elements of the farm bill that \nwe were spending too much money on in certain places and to reform \nthose overly generous subsidies, if you will, and make them kind of fit \nthe circumstances. The Senator saved a lot of money in the process. Am \nI to understand that the Republican leader has taken those reforms, \ndesigned to wisely spend the taxpayers' money in the right places, and \nhas thrown them out the window?\n  Ms. STABENOW. In this extension that he has proposed, the subsidies, \ncalled direct payments, that we have all agreed should not be given \nduring high prices and good times to farmers, extend with absolutely no \nreductions. They are fully extended for the next 9 months, and who \nknows how much longer. I am sure the folks who want to have them are \ngoing to try to just keep blocking farm bills and doing extensions as \nlong as they can in order to get the money--$5 billion a year--$5 \nbillion a year that we have agreed in taxpayer money should not be \nspent.\n  Now, I also want to say, it is not that we do not need to support \nagriculture. I know my friend agrees with that. Whether it is disaster \nassistance, whether it is crop insurance, we need to give them risk \nmanagement tools, conservation tools. We need to make sure we have \nstrong crop insurance. We need to make sure that there is disaster \nassistance there. But in good times you should not be able to get a \ngovernment check when prices are high, which is what some in \nagriculture have been doing and getting and it is wrong, and it is \nfully continued in what the Republican leader has proposed.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I would say to my colleague, I have sat on this floor \nand listened to lectures of fiscal responsibility and the need to move \nthings and work things in committee before they come to the floor. Now, \nthe work that the Senator did was the best of those two qualities: \nEverything being done in committee, being in open conversation, \ndialogue, working on it, bringing it to the floor, having a debate on \nthe floor in front of the American people, in front of our colleagues, \ncomplete openness and a complete sense of fiscal responsibility. So are \nthose lectures that I have been hearing about fiscal responsibility and \ncommittee process, are they just lectures but no real belief in them?\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I can say to my colleague, I certainly cannot \nindicate what the intent is of another colleague. But I will tell you \nthat my mom always said: Actions speak louder than words. So I can tell \nyou that the actions here, the actions that have been occurring, go in \nthe opposite direction, both of supporting farmers and ranchers in a \ncomprehensive way by fully extending the farm bill for the next 9 \nmonths and by allowing the complete, 100 percent extension of subsidies \nthat we voted to eliminate.\n  I can tell you, that does not make any sense to me. It certainly goes \nagainst what I have heard over and over on the floor, and I also find \nit just amazing to me that when we--by passing the farm bill, if the \nfarm bill were included in this agreement, we would have $24 billion \nmore in deficit reduction to be able to report to the American people.\n  They are saying no. I do not understand that.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. There is one more piece of this I want to clarify \nbecause I am not sure where the minority leader's version came out on \nthis; that is, our organic farmers have gotten a very unfair deal, and \nthat deal was that they were going to be charged extra for their \ninsurance. In exchange they were supposed to get the organic price of a \nparticular crop. We fixed that on the floor of the Senate. We addressed \nthat. We said, no, the Department of Agriculture that was supposed to \nget the studies done to get the organic prices in place so that the \nupfront price had the back side as well, we gave them a confined number \nof years to get that done, to rectify that injustice. Is that now \nmissing from the proposal from the Republican leader?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes. In fact, the organic provisions are not funded, \nare not extended. So, again, when we look at the future of agricultural \nchoices for consumers, this is not extended.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. How can one possibly justify charging organic farmers \nmore because they are going to get a higher insurance compensation, but \nthen say they will not get a higher insurance compensation? We are \ngoing to take that away?\n  So it operates as a structural effort to basically take money away \nfrom the organic community and give it to the nonorganic community--I \nmean, complete unfairness in a competitive marketplace. How can one \npossibly justify stripping that from this extension?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would just say to my friend from Oregon that it makes \nno sense. This is certainly not about fairness. It is not about an open \nprocess. I mean, when the Senator mentioned earlier that we had worked \nin a very open and transparent process, we did. Throughout the \ncommittee, throughout the floor, even those who didn't support the farm \nbill indicated they supported the openness, the due process, the \nability to provide amendments, to have them voted on up or down.\n  Now to take what was the consensus view of what things should look \nlike and basically throw it out the window at the last minute makes me \nwonder what the motivation is here. What is really going on? All I can \nsee is that in the end, what we have is a situation where the \ngovernment subsidies we eliminated are extended 100 percent, and those \nwho behind the scenes have been trying to continue to get the \ngovernment money appear to have been successful, at least with the \nRepublican leader.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. In closing my part of this colloquy, I want to thank the \nSenator for clarifying those three points--that the disaster relief is \nout, that the pork is in, and that the organic farmers are going to \ncontinue to get the short end of the stick. It seems to me that is \nthree strikes and you are out. And I didn't even address many of the \nother points I heard the Senator raising.\n  The Senator's outrage about this is so deeply justified, and I am \ncertain I\n\n[[Page S8583]]\n\nwill be standing with her as we try to make sure that the good work \ndone in committee and on the floor of the Senate for fiscal \nresponsibility, for fairness to farmers, for fairness to those who have \nsuffered disasters, for fairness to those who are in the organic or the \ninorganic world or nonorganic world--that these mistakes, these three \nstrikes-plus, do not carry forth through this Chamber.\n  I thank the Senator for her leadership.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Again, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nleadership on disaster assistance, on support for the organic \nagriculture community, and for others that benefit from his leadership, \nforestry and other areas. The Senator from Oregon has been a very, very \nstrong leader, and I thank him for his words and for his actions in \nstanding and fighting for the people we are supposed to be fighting \nfor. I mean, the farmers and ranchers across the country, like every \nother American right now, are shaking their heads: What is going on?\n  I know there is a lot of work going on to come up with a larger \nagreement, but for those of us who care about many things but want to \nmake sure agriculture is not lost in this, I am deeply concerned. This \nis the second largest industry in Michigan. It is the largest industry \nfor many places in the country. Yet I don't see agriculture being the \npriority it needs to be either on disaster assistance or help for those \nwho have been hit so hard by drought or by an early warmth and then a \nfreeze in the orchards. Where is the willingness to stand and support \nfarmers and ranchers across the country?\n  Well, I used to be able to say and I have said up to this point: \nWell, the support was in the Senate, where we passed a bipartisan farm \nbill and we worked together very closely to do that. But tonight I find \nthat rather than proceeding in a bipartisan way, which has been what we \nhave done, rather than consulting with myself as chair in the Senate \nand Chairman Lucas in the House, we see that a proposal which neither \none of us has put forward or supported and which is adamantly opposed \nby many people is now being offered as the approach to extend part of \nthe farm bill, picking and choosing arbitrarily what should be extended \nand not, not doing disaster assistance, and not being willing to shave \noff even 2.5 percent of these government subsidies in order to be able \nto fully fund an extension for the next 9 months--2.5 percent. Mr. \nPresident, 2.5 percent is directing us, is what we are talking about in \norder to be able to extend critical, important priorities for people \nacross the country. This is for consumers, for farmers, for ranchers, \nfor people in this Chamber. I can only assume, based on what I see, \nthat this is the effort of the group that has been trying very hard to \nmake sure that their subsidies continue and that they continue unabated \n100 percent, and this is their opportunity.\n  When we are trying to do deficit reduction, which I find amazing this \nis in the context of a deficit reduction package--and I am still going \nto be looking to see where the deficit reduction is. But the deficit \nreduction package--it will not accept $24 billion in savings in \nagriculture. Now, instead, it puts in place policies that will take us \nin the exact opposite direction. It is very, very unfortunate.\n  I have been spending the day expressing grave concerns. I will \ncontinue to do that. There is absolutely no reason this can't be fixed \nbefore the proposal comes to this body. It absolutely can be fixed. \nPeople of good will in agriculture have worked together every step of \nthe way, certainly in this Chamber. We can continue to do that if there \nis a desire to do it. I hope there is because there is a tremendous \namount at stake.\n  Let me say again that 16 million people across our country pay their \nbills because of income they receive through agriculture or the food \nindustry. Small farmers and large farmers want the certainty of a 5-\nyear farm bill, and they also want to know we are working together with \ntheir interests in mind. I hope we can still see that happen.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8583-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, over the last few decades, the real \nmiddle-class families in America--and when I say ``real middle class'' \nI mean those who are making $40,000, $50,000, $70,000, not $400,000 a \nyear--have seen their jobs become more insecure and their wages \nstagnate. In fact, their income adjusted for inflation is less now than \nit was in the late 1990s. Their savings and pensions have shrunk or \ndisappeared.\n  The cost of education has soared at the same time as the wealthiest \nAmericans and large corporations grow ever richer and pay less and less \nin taxes. For example, just take dividends. Prior to 2003, dividends \nwere always taxed as ordinary income. Now they are taxed at a less rate \nthan the capital gains rate. Income of hedge fund managers is taxed at \na lower rate than middle-class families--the so-called carried interest \nrule.\n  The share of our Nation's wealth going to corporate profits has been \nrising as the share going to wages and salaries is declining. This has \nled bit by bit, Tax Code change by Tax Code change, pension cuts by \npension cuts, job outsourcing by job outsourcing to an economy that is \nout of balance, that threatens the very fabric of our society. That is \nbecause the gap between the rich and the real middle class grows ever \nwider. That is because our economy is driven from the middle out and \nnot from the top down.\n  Our economy is driven by middle-class families with good jobs and \nmoney in their pockets to spend. So our first goal must be to put \nAmericans back to work and to get our economy moving, to rebuild the \nreal middle class now.\n  The average American across our land tonight--today--probably thinks \nwhat we are about here is just that, to solve our country's most \npressing problem--creating new jobs, laying the foundation for future \neconomic growth and, thus, reducing our deficits in the long term. But \ninstead we are here tied in knots to avert a manufactured fiscal cliff \nwhich could have been avoided 6 months ago by the House passing S. 3412 \nto avert the tax hikes on 98 percent of Americans.\n  As I have said repeatedly, I will evaluate any such fiscal cliff \nlegislation on how these proposed policies affect working families and \nthe real middle class--again, the real middle class being those making \n$30,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 a year. So I am disappointed to say, \nin my opinion, this legislation we are about to vote on falls short.\n  First, it does not address the No. 1 priority: creating good middle-\nclass jobs now. Unemployment remains way too high. This bill should \ninclude direct assistance on job creation makers; for example, our \ninfrastructure, education, and job retraining. How many jobs we see out \nthere going wanting because people aren't trained for those jobs; yet \nwe don't have enough money to put into job retraining. The legislation \nbefore us neglects our most pressing concern at the present time, and \nthat is\n\n[[Page S8584]]\n\nthe lack of jobs and the lack of qualified people to fill those jobs.\n  Secondly, this proposal does not generate the revenue necessary for \nthe country to meet its needs for everything from education to job \ntraining, infrastructure, and research and development. The idea that \npeople earning $300,000 to $400,000 a year could not pay the taxes they \npaid in the 1990s when the economy was booming is just plain absurd. \nBut that is what we are being told; that people who make $300,000 or \n$400,000 simply cannot pay the same taxes they would have been paying \nin the Clinton years.\n  Furthermore, these wealthiest Americans made a lot of money in the \nlast decade. So what do we do? Now we are raising the estate tax \nexemption to $5 million. It was $1 million under the Clinton tax years. \nNow the few who are really wealthy, who made a lot of money, and who \nhave accumulated this wealth, we now have raised the estate tax so they \ncan pass it on without any of that gain ever being taxed because the \nheirs now get it with what they call a stepped-up basis. So none of \nthat is taxed.\n  So what we see, then, are the few who are wealthy getting more and \nmore wealthy. So wealth becomes even more concentrated under this \nsystem.\n  Now, some will say: What is the problem? You want to protect the \nmiddle class. They are in this bill. How can you object if some higher \nincome individuals are protected as well? Well, I point out these are \nnot unrelated matters. With government investments and government \nspending dropping, being squeezed every year by my conservative friends \non the other side of the aisle, and with deficits remaining high, every \ndollar of sacrifice the wealthy forego is a sacrifice we will later be \nasking of real middle-class, modest-income Americans. Every dollar the \ntop 2 percent of taxpayers do not pay under this deal, we will \neventually ask folks of modest means to forego--to forego on Social \nSecurity or Medicare or Medicaid or Head Start benefits or other items \nthat benefit the real middle class.\n  I believe it is gravely shortsighted to look at these issues in \nisolation from each other, especially since the Republicans have made \ncrystal clear that they intend to seek mandatory spending cuts just 2 \nmonths from now using the debt limit as leverage.\n  No. 3. Why in this deal do we make the tax benefits for the rich \npermanent while the progressive tax benefits we put in place in 2009 to \nhelp people of modest means--why are those temporary? For example, the \nestate taxes that benefit the wealthiest are made permanent. The \nearned-income tax credit that affects the lower income, that is \ntemporary. The income tax rates that are set now are going to be made \npermanent to benefit higher income individuals, but the child tax \ncredit is made temporary. The AMT fix is made permanent, but the \nAmerican opportunity tax credit for modest families to be able to \nafford to send their kids to college is made temporary.\n  In this deal we are about to vote on, logic is turned on its head. We \nprovide permanent benefits to those who need it the least, and yet this \ndeal sunsets the modest assistance to middle-class families--again, I \nrepeat, middle class, real middle class; not $400,000-a-year middle \nclass, I mean the real middle class.\n  I think it is quite telling that earlier this last evening, Grover \nNorquist said he is for this bill, but our former Secretary of Labor \nBob Reich is opposed.\n  So maybe now I guess we are all believers in trickle-down economics. \nNot I. I guess we now redefine the middle class as those making \n$400,000 a year when, in fact, that represents the top 1 percent of \nincome earners in America, not the middle class. So I guess that we now \naccept as normal practice in reaching bipartisan deals that the most \nvulnerable in our country, such as those who are out of work and who \ndepend on unemployment benefits, can be held hostage as a bargaining \ntool for more tax breaks for the richest among us.\n  I am not saying that everything in this deal is bad. There are some \ngood parts. But I repeat, I am concerned about this constant drift, bit \nby bit, deal by deal, toward more deficits, less job creation, more \nunfairness, less economic justice--a society where the gap grows wider \nbetween the few who have much and the many who have too little.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I must in conscience vote no on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8584-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8584-S8586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          JOB PROTECTION AND RECESSION PREVENTION ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, very quickly, we have worked really hard \nthis week. We Senators had to be here and are happy to be here, but \nthere are four individuals who didn't have to work this week, but they \nvolunteered to do so. These four pages have kept this place operating \nby helping floor staff and us. They could be home with their families \nand friends enjoying the holiday. Instead, they are here.\n  We have 18-year-old Jarrod Nagurka, of Arlington. He gave up his \nwinter break to be here; Twenty-two-year-old Priscilla Pelli of \nWashington, DC, is a staff assistant in my office. She has devoted her \ntime here. Twenty-two-year-old Erin Shields of Takoma Park, MD, is an \nintern in my office. And 16-year-old Gwendilyn Liu of Kaneohe, HI, the \nonly remaining current page, skipped her winter vacation to help here. \nI want the record to reflect our deep appreciation for them, and I wish \nthem the very best in their future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, working through the night and throughout today, we \nhave reached an agreement with Senator McConnell to avert tax increases \non middle-class Americans.\n  I have said all along that our most important priority was to protect \nmiddle-class families. This legislation does that. Middle-class \nfamilies will wake up today to the assurance that their taxes won't go \nup $2,200 each. They will have the certainty to plan how they will pay \nfor groceries, rent, and car payments all during next year. The \nlegislation also protects 2 million Americans who have lost their jobs \nduring the great recession from losing their unemployment insurance.\n  I am disappointed that we weren't able to make the grand bargain that \nwe tried to do for so long, but we tried. If we do nothing, the threat \nof a recession is very real. And passing this agreement does not mean \nthe negotiations halt--far from it. We can all agree there is more work \nto be done. I thank everybody for their patience today--and they have \nhad a lot of patience.\n  I also thank my friend the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, for \nhis hard work to reach this bipartisan agreement. It has been difficult \nand very hard. As we have said before, Senator McConnell and I out here \ndo a lot of talking to each other; we kind of go over everybody's head. \nBut he and I know that when the talk is done out here, we work hard to \ntry to help this country. So he is my friend, and I appreciate very, \nvery much the work he has done.\n  For example, this bill cuts $4 billion in fiscal year 2013 and $8 \nbillion in fiscal year 2014. These are real cuts that are in this bill.\n  I hope the new year will bring a new willingness on the part of the \nHouse Republicans to join Democrats in the difficult but rewarding work \nof governing. The Speaker has said all along that he was waiting for \nthe Senate to act. The Senate soon will act. Now, I hope for America \nthat the Speaker will allow the full House of Representatives to vote \non this bipartisan legislation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my good friend the \nmajority leader for his kind words and thank everyone for their \npatience and their counsel throughout this process.\n  I also thank the Vice President for recognizing the importance of \npreventing this tax hike on the American\n\n[[Page S8585]]\n\npeople and stepping up to play a crucial role in getting us there. It \nshouldn't have taken us this long to come to an agreement and this \nshouldn't be the model for how we do things around here, but I \nappreciate the Vice President's willingness to get this done for the \ncountry.\n  I know I can speak for my entire conference when I say we don't think \ntaxes should be going up on anyone, but we all knew that if we did \nnothing, they would be going up on everyone today. We weren't going to \nlet that happen. Each of us could spend the rest of the week discussing \nwhat a perfect solution would have looked like, but the end result \nwould have been the largest tax increase in American history.\n  The President wanted tax increases, but thanks to this imperfect \nagreement, 99 percent of my constituents will not be hit by those \nhikes. So it took an imperfect solution to prevent our constituents \nfrom very real financial pain. But, in my view, it was worth the \neffort.\n  As I said, this shouldn't be the model for how we do things around \nhere, but I think we can say we have done some good for the country. We \nhave done some good for this country. We have taken care of the revenue \nside of this debate, and now it is time to get serious about reducing \nWashington's out-of-control spending. That is a debate the American \npeople want. It is the debate we will have next, and it is the debate \nRepublicans are ready for.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to address the bill before us \ntonight. Despite the best efforts of Senate Democrats to strike a \nbalanced and fair compromise--to avert tax hikes on Americans making \nless than a quarter of a million dollars, to avert the expiration of \nunemployment insurance, to avert the damaging automatic spending \nreductions--we instead have before us a package that is at best a half-\nmeasure. This is not how we should govern.\n  However, the bill before us is better than the alternative facing \nmillions of Americans. If we do not act, taxes for the middle-class \nwill rise tomorrow, support for unemployed workers will lapse, Rhode \nIslanders will be hurt, and our economic recovery could suffer another \nRepublican induced economic setback.\n  Unless this bill is signed into law, starting January first, taxes \nrise on every American and hundreds of thousands middle-income Rhode \nIsland families will see their taxes increase by an estimated $2,200 in \n2013. Rhode Islanders numbering 37,000 would lose a tuition tax credit \nto help them pay for college and 103,000 Rhode Island families raising \nchildren would see an average tax increase of $1,000 because they would \nno longer qualify for the Child Tax Credit. The economy is tough enough \nfor most Rhode Islanders, and they shouldn't be asked to absorb a hit \nlike that due to the stubbornness of the other side of the aisle.\n  This bill will also continue unemployment insurance for 2.1 million \nAmericans and almost 9,000 Rhode Islanders. Without a continuation of \nunemployment insurance, millions of Americans actively seeking work \nwill suffer a debilitating economic blow. People will lose their homes \nand be unable to put food on the table, as they lose one of the few \nlifelines they and their families have as they look for work in a tough \neconomy. Neighborhood businesses would have taken a hit as well. An \nestimated $48 billion in economic activity will be sapped from our \nrecovery and one of our most effective counter-cyclical economic \npolicies would have been lost.\n  It is a sad truth, but the middle-class tax cuts and unemployment \ninsurance were being held hostage by my Republican colleagues in order \nto secure even more generous tax cuts for the wealthy. So at least with \nthe permanent extension of tax cuts for the middle-class and a one-year \ncontinuation of unemployment, that immediate threat is gone.\n  However, it is outrageous that this threat has been taken this far \nand that my Republican colleagues continue to demand a perpetuation of \nan unfair tax code that is tilted towards the wealthiest.\n  So I remain committed to reforming the tax system so it is fair for \nall Americans. I remain committed to ending egregious loopholes that \nresult in absurd and unfair results, like a private equity partner \npaying a lower tax rate than a janitor.\n  I do want to stress that, despite Republican demands for big cuts in \nthe social safety net, this bill protects Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid beneficiaries. Such beneficiary cuts would have made this \npackage even more unbalanced and unfair. Unfortunately, it appears that \nRepublicans are already planning to hold the debt ceiling hostage in \norder to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Today they will \ninsist on additional tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, \nespecially estate tax cuts, but then demand that we cut Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid to cover these and other debts. I will \nwork to prevent such callous efforts.\n  I am deeply disappointed by the package before us today. I believe \nthe White House should have stood firm on reducing the deficit by \nnearly $1 trillion and let income tax rates for those making over a \nquarter of a million dollars revert to Clinton-era levels. I am \ndisappointed with Republican intransigence and the prospect of once \nagain being on the brink of a manufactured economic catastrophe in \norder to secure tax preferences for millionaires and billionaires and \nattempting to pay for them by cutting Social Security or programs that \nbenefit middle-income Americans.\n  In the coming weeks, I hope Republicans will drop their attempts to \ncut the deficit on the backs of the middle-class and seniors, and \ninstead work with us to craft a fair and balanced compromise that \nstrengthens, not endangers, our economic recovery.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nDave Brubeck, the iconic jazz musician and composer who defined and \npopularized modern jazz during a pioneering career that spanned seven \ndecades. Mr. Brubeck passed away on December 5, a day before his 92nd \nbirthday, in Wilton, CT.\n  Dave Brubeck was born in Concord, California, on December 6, 1920. \nWhen he was 11, Dave's family moved to the town of Ione in the rolling \nSierra foothills of Amador County, where his father, Pete, managed a \ncattle ranch, and his mother, Elizabeth, a classically-trained pianist, \ntaught Dave and his two brothers how to play various musical \ninstruments. Although his poor eyesight kept him from reading music, \nthis determined young musician learned mostly by listening, and his \nabundant musical talents made him a popular feature at local events by \nthe time he was a teenager.\n  At the College of the Pacific, Dave initially studied veterinary \nmedicine before switching to music after one year. It was there that he \nmet Iola Whitlock, a schoolmate who became his wife in 1942. Almost \nimmediately upon graduation, he was drafted into the Army, where his \nstandout performance as part of a travelling Red Cross show prompted a \ncommanding officer to assign him to form a band to play for the troops \nin combat areas. He recruited black and white musicians to play \ntogether in his 18-piece band, the Wolfpack Band.\n  After the war, Dave returned home to study music on a GI bill \nscholarship at Mills College under the tutelage of French composer \nDarius Milhaud. During this period, he met the musicians who would \nlater form the Dave Brubeck Quartet. With Mr. Brubeck at the helm, the \nquartet's unique and groundbreaking style earned wide acclaim and a \nlegion of fans from across the country, and eventually from around the \nworld. In 1954, in recognition of his fame and prodigious talents, he \nwas featured on the cover of Time Magazine. In 1959, the quartet's \nrecording of ``Take Five'' became the first jazz single to sell a \nmillion copies. Over the years, he would produce other iconic jazz hits \nsuch as ``Time Out'' and ``It's a Raggy Waltz,'' record more than a \nhundred albums, and even write two ballets.\n  A man of strong convictions, Mr. Brubeck used his musical gifts and \ncelebrity to stand up for principles and causes in which he believed. \nIn 1958, at the invitation of the U.S. State Department, he led the \nquartet on a good will tour that introduced jazz music to countries and \naudiences behind the Iron Curtain and in the Middle East. That same \nyear, he refused to tour in South Africa when promoters insisted that \nhis band be all white.\n  Mr. Brubeck performed for eight presidents and composed the entrance \nmusic for Pope John Paul II's 1987 visit to Candlestick Park in San \nFrancisco. He was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the \nArts and received a Kennedy Center Honor for his contribution to \nAmerican culture. His alma mater, now known as the University of the \nPacific, established the Brubeck Institute to further his lifelong work \nand goal to use the power of music to ``transform lives as well as to \nenlighten and entertain.''\n  On behalf of the people of his home state of California, I extend my \ndeepest sympathies to Dave Brubeck's wife of 70 years, Iola; sons \nDarius, Chris, Dan and Matthew; daughter Catherine Yaghsizian; 10 \ngrandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. Dave Brubeck was an \nAmerican treasure, and he will be dearly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8586-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8586-S8587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         CELEBRATING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HAWAIIAN ROOM\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncelebrate the 75th anniversary of the opening of a historic and \nfamously popular Manhattan attraction--the Hawaiian Room at the Hotel \nLexington in New York City. Throughout its 30 years of quality cultural \nperformances, its authentic and captivating shows were widely praised \nfor giving audiences not only an exotic, entertaining experience, but \nalso a raved off-Broadway production, not to be missed.\n  In the 1930s, the newly built Hotel Lexington at 48th and Lexington \nin New York City was an impressive hotel and with prestige and \ngrandeur. At the cost of $5 million to build in 1929, the iconic hotel \nbecame an instant favorite for global leaders, celebrities, business \nexecutives, and some of America's most famous sports icons including \nJoe DiMaggio, who famously lived in a penthouse suite during his whole \ncareer playing for the Yankees.\n  The manager was Charles Rochester, and in the late 1930s, he decided \nto open a Hawaiian-themed room in a large unused area of the hotel to \ntry and attract new uppercrust business to his establishment to help \nwith ``the bottom line.'' At the time, Hawaiian and Polynesian cultures \nwere growing in popularity and interest across the country. However, \nthe creation of the Hawaiian Room was still a bold move not only \nbecause of the Great Depression, but also an increasingly complicated \nglobal scene as world conflicts were escalating in both Asia and \nEurope. Nevertheless, on June 23, 1937, the Hawaiian Room opened its \ndoors for the first time.\n  The Hawaiian Room found success for an unprecedented 30 years \nstraight in its presentation of Hawaiian culture and aloha, with the \nunique music and indigenous hula as its foundation. The room became a \ngathering place for many with Hawaii ties to share the knowledge and \ninfluence of the Hawaiian culture throughout the East Coast and the \nworld. The venue became ``the place to be'' for celebrities in New York \nCity, and it was the people who worked in the Hawaiian Room who made it \nsuch a success. Because of their talents, island ways, and authentic \naloha many were able to enjoy a piece of Hawaii, even if they were on \nanother ``island'' 5,000 miles away.\n  Recently, I was fortunate to meet with some of the gracious ladies \nwho performed at the Hawaiian Room so many years ago. Their stories and \nspirit of aloha embody the qualities that made the Hawaiian Room so \ngreat for so many years.\n  I would like to commend TeMoana Makolo, Hula Preservation Society, \nand the dozens of Hawaiian Room members who worked in the room during \nits 1937-1966 run for their partnership and efforts in creating the \nHawaii Room Archive to perpetuate this great piece of Hawaii's history. \nThe oldest living former Hawaiian Room member is Tutasi Wilson at 98 \nyears old, who was a featured dancer at the Hawaiian Room in the 1940s \nand 1950s.\n  Living members include Leonani Akau, Pua Amoy, Leilehua Becker, \nIwalani Carino, Martha Carrell, Loma Duke, Wailani Gomes, Mamo Gomez, \nMealii Horio, Mona Joy, Leialoha Kaleikini, Leialoha Kane, Manu \nKanemura, Ed Kenney, Nona Kramer, Nani Krisel, TeMoana Makolo, Tautaise \nManicas, Torea Ortiz, Olan Peltier, Vicky Racimo, Io Ramirez, Alii Noa \nSilva, Kaui Virgeniza, Tutasi\n\n[[Page S8587]]\n\nWilson, and Janet Yokooji. Each has personally contributed to \ndevelopment of the first Hawaiian Room Archive by contributing their \nstories and personal photos to this new educational resource.\n  Many other esteemed Hawaiian Room members have passed on, including \nAlfred Apaka, Aggie Auld, Keola Beamer, Mapuana Bishaw, Eddie Bush, \nJohnny Coco, Leilani DaSilva, Ehulani Enoka, Leila Guerrero, Ululani \nHolt, Meymo Holt, Keokeokalae Hughes, Clara Inter ``Hilo Hattie,'' Andy \nIona, Alvin Isaacs, Momi Kai, George Kainapau, Sonny Kalolo, David \nKaonohi, Nani Kaonohi, Ray Kinney, Kui Lee, Sam & Betty Makia, Lani & \nAlfred McIntire, Pualani Mossman, Tootsie Notley, Lehua Paulson, Telana \nPeltier, Luana Poepoe, Dennie Regor, and Jennie Napua Woodd. All were \nlegendary talents in their own right, and also contributed to making \nthe Hawaiian Room the success it was.\n  Although the Hawaiian Room was in New York, it played an ever \nimportant role in the spread of Hawaiian culture across the continental \nUnited States, as well as the development of Hawaii's major industry--\ntourism. The nightly exposure of business executives, celebrities, and \nNew York's working men and women to the Hawaiian songs, sceneries, and \nhula at Lexington Hotel was sure to have put dreams of a Hawaii \nvacation in the minds of more than a few over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8587-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8587-S8588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GRANDMASTER HONG LIU\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as I reflect back on my 36 years of \nservice in Congress and the Senate, I realize how fortunate I was to be \nmostly healthy. As we age, we pay more attention to our health. The \nchallenge is how to maintain good health.\n  It was after I was struck in the shin by a stray golf ball on a \nVirginia course that I met a Chinese Grandmaster who introduced me to \nan ancient Chinese methodology for maintaining good health. This \nmethodology was developed and tested over thousands of years--it was \nthe ancient practice of natural healing using Qi Gong.\n  Grandmaster Hong Liu was born in Shanghai, China. His Mother was the \ndirector of medical care and hospitals in Shanghai. As a result of \nbeing raised in a health-oriented environment, he enrolled in the \nMilitary Medical College to become a doctor of Western medicine.\n  His home was always filled with visitors from the health industry, \ndoctors, and even healers who practiced Traditional Chinese Medicine or \nTCM as it is popularly known today. Whenever the Qi Gong masters \nvisited his Mother, crowds of sick people would gather seeking \ntreatment. He would watch intently as these people were treated by \nthose masters.\n  Grandmaster Hong became interested in one of the healers who lived \noutside of Canton high up on a mountain in a cave, Master Kwan. During \nthe time of the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's wife banned all \nancient medical traditions--healers escaped imprisonment by living in \nremote caves in high mountains outside the cities. This interest in \nancient Traditional Chinese Medicine conflicted with his role as an \narmy officer practicing in a military hospital. All doctors were \nscheduled for duty in the hospitals and were expected to perform \nroutine duties. His days were scheduled with long hours of patient care \nleaving very little spare time. Medical doctors who did not perform \ntheir duties and who did not work diligently were reprimanded and \nsometimes demoted. For 8 years, he spent all of his spare time studying \nQi Gong and traditional Chinese medicine under Master Kwan. This meant \ntaking the train to Canton and then traveling many miles outside the \nCity to a mountain called Golden Cock to get to Master Kwan's cave. \nGrandmaster Hong or Master Hong became an apprentice of Master Kwan and \nthen became a Qi Gong Master in 1979. Grandmaster Hong came to the \nUnited States in 1990 and has practiced Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n  Getting back to that golfing incident, I did not worry much about the \ngolf injury after icing it because it seemed to have healed. It was not \nuntil a week later when I flew back to Hawaii and was at my physician's \noffice for a regular checkup that it was discovered the inside of the \nwound had not healed and was infected. My physician prescribed \ntreatment for the infection, but a family friend asked if I would \nconsider additional treatment in complement with my physician's medical \ncare. This was my introduction to natural healing and to Grandmaster \nHong Liu, we call him Master Hong, who is a Grandmaster of Natural \nHealing, which includes Feng Shui, herbs, exercise, martial arts and \nnutrition. This introduction was the start of a remarkable journey for \nme into the world of natural healing using proper breathing, movement \nthrough exercise, and nutrition to nourish and heal.\n  This natural healing method seemed too simple, but what I learned \nover time was that illness occurs when the natural flow or circulation \nof the energy canals or pathways in our body are blocked, but this can \nbe remedied again with proper breathing, exercise, and eating \nnutritionally. Injuries to the body are remedied in the same manner \nwith the addition of herbs. The Qi of Qi Gong is that natural energy \nthat runs through those canals in our body like blood flows through \nveins. That energy is what keeps us living, and if that Qi is \ncirculating property or flowing freely, then we are healthy. The simple \n``science'' of Natural Healing is viewed as an approach to remove the \nblockages that occur when the energy does not flow freely and balance \nthe internal organ energy. The ultimate goal in Traditional Chinese \nMedicine is balance--the body should be balanced naturally--seems \nsimple.\n  Master Hong has not only been good to me--he is good to the people of \nHawaii. He has held free seminars and events. His foundation holds \nfree, weekly senior programs because he recognized the demographics of \nthe aging population, its rapid growth globally, and the issues with \naffordable healthcare. He developed and offers a weekly self-healing \nprogram for seniors that includes exercises and nutritional information \nfor them to get healthy and stay healthy. For the past 9 years, he's \ngiven immunity events to the community. People attend these events to \nget free patches to help boost their immunity systems. The immunity \nevents are held on the hottest and the coldest days of the year because \nthose are the most potent days for the effectiveness of those patches. \nThe events originally started out as asthma events since Hawaii has had \n30 years of volcanic activity which affected the respiratory systems of \nmany Islanders. Those asthma events evolved into the bigger bottom line \npicture or the source of the problem which is the immunity system.\n  Master Hong is the founder of the Natural Healing Research Foundation \nin Hawaii. The foundation is his basis for advancing remedies for the \nmajor diseases affecting humanity by promoting the time honored natural \nhealing practices of Eastern medicine in complement with Western \nmedicine to attain that goal. The marvel of the remedies of natural \nhealing is that it offers simple yet effective healing programs that \nwork with conventional practices and have no side effects. The \nfoundation reaches out to the community providing information and \ntraining in disease prevention and offering proactive solutions to \nmaintain optimal health.\n  Master Hong was proclaimed a ``Living Treasure'' not only in his \nhomeland of China but also in the State of Hawaii because of his \nresearch of various diseases, cancer, drug addictions, diabetes, \nobesity, and heart disease to name a few, and his devotion to teaching \npreventive health care. He has also authored ``The Healing Art of Qi \nGong'' by Warner Books.\n  The basic simpleness of all of this knowledge is that this energy is \nall around us, but you need to work at keeping the movement of this \nenergy moving or circulating in order to be healthy and balanced. I \nlearned that foods of a certain color were specific to different \norgans. Foods white in color, mushrooms, ginger, garlic are for the \nlungs and skin, while foods that are black in color, black beans, black \nsesame, seaweed, are for the kidneys.\n  There is so much that I have learned from Grandmaster Hong Liu, and \nthere is more learning to be done when I get back to Hawaii. What I do \nknow is that the Traditional Chinese Healing methods he used in \ncomplement with my regular physician improved my health.\n  I will continue to learn from this Grandmaster, and I continue to be\n\n[[Page S8588]]\n\ngrateful for my health and wellbeing. It has been about 8 years of \nlearning and exercising and eating right for me, but in that time I \nhave seen an industry boom in natural health care and products--what a \ncoincidence. All of this makes me more aware of how fortunate and \ntimely my meeting Grandmaster Hong Liu was to promote the balance and \nwellbeing in my life. Thank you, Grandmaster Hong for what you have \ndone not only for me but for the people of Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8588-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONS\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and \ncongratulate the women's volleyball team of Concordia University in St. \nPaul, MN, for winning their sixth consecutive NCAA Division II \nchampionship. On December 8, 2012, the Golden Bears bounced back from a \ntwo-set deficit to defeat the University of Tampa and secure the \nnational title.\n  The team has an incredible record of success, winning the national \nchampionship every year since 2007--a title streak that matches the \nNCAA record in all divisions. They have clinched 36 NCAA tournament \nmatches in a row, and have won 44 out of 48 matches in 10 tournament \nappearances. Brady Starkey, who has coached the team for a decade, has \nled the team to victories in six out of seven tournament matches.\n  I would especially like to recognize the team's All-Americans--Ellie \nDuffy, Cassie Haag, Kayla Koenecke, and Amanda Konetchy, all four of \nwhom were named to the all-tournament team. Ellie Duffy was also \nselected to the Academic All-American Division II Volleyball team.\n  The women of Concordia University's volleyball team are part of \nMinnesota's long tradition of excellence in college athletics and they \nmake our State proud. I want to commend the team on their hard work and \noutstanding achievements this season and wish them success in many \nseasons to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8588-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 3202.

Res. 628\n\n       Whereas United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates \n     that there are 740,000 children in Russia living without \n     parental care;\n       Whereas the Ministry of Science and Education of Russia \n     estimates that 110,000 children live in state institutions in \n     Russia;\n       Whereas the number of adoptions by Russian families is \n     modest, with only 7,400 domestic adoptions in 2011 compared \n     with 3,400 adoptions of Russian children by families abroad;\n       Whereas on December 28, 2012, Russian Federation President \n     Vladimir Putin signed into law legislation entitled ``On \n     Measures Concerning the Implementation of Government Policy \n     on Orphaned Children and those without Parental Care'', which \n     includes language that permanently bans adoptions of Russian \n     children by United States citizens;\n       Whereas a spokesman for President Putin, Dmitry Peskov, \n     announced that the law is to take effect on January 1, 2013, \n     thereby abrogating the bilateral agreement between Russia and \n     the United States that entered into force on November 1, \n     2012, and requires both countries to provide one year notice \n     of intent to terminate the agreement;\n       Whereas 46, and possibly more, inter-country adoptions of \n     Russian children by United States families have already \n     received a final adoption decree from the Russia judicial \n     system, and hundreds of other United States families are in \n     the process of adopting Russian children;\n       Whereas United Nations Children's Fund released a statement \n     urging the Russia Government to ensure that ``the current \n     plight of the many Russian children in institutions receives \n     priority attention'' and that the Russia Government consider \n     alternatives to institutionalization including ``domestic \n     adoption and inter-country adoption'';\n       Whereas the United Nations, the Hague Conference on Private \n     International Law, and other international organizations have \n     recognized a child's right to a family as a basic human right \n     worthy of protection;\n       Whereas the Christian Alliance for Orphans reports that \n     United States families have opened their homes to more than \n     179,000 orphans from overseas in the last 20 years;\n       Whereas after China and Ethiopia, Russia is the third most \n     popular country for United States citizens who adopt \n     internationally;\n       Whereas adoption, both domestic and international, is an \n     important child protection tool and an integral part of child \n     welfare best practices around the world, along with \n     prevention of abandonment and family reunification: and\n       Whereas more than 60,000 Russia-born children have found \n     safe, permanent, and loving homes with United States families \n     over the last two decades: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that all children deserve a permanent, \n     protective family;\n       (2) values the long tradition of the United States and \n     Russia Governments working together to find permanent homes \n     for unparented children;\n       (3) disapproves of the Russia law ending inter-country \n     adoptions of Russian children by United States citizens \n     because it primarily harms vulnerable and voiceless children; \n     and\n       (4) strongly urges the Russia Government to reconsider the \n     law on humanitarian grounds, in consideration of the well-\n     being of parentless Russian children awaiting a loving and \n     permanent family, and prioritize the processing of inter-\n     country adoptions of Russian children by United States \n     citizens that were initiated before the enactment of the law.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ncolleague, Senator Landrieu from Louisiana, to talk about Russian \nadoptions and the decision by the Russian Duma and the President, \nPresident Putin, to sign a law that includes a provision that bans \nadoption of Russian children by American families. This ban is going \ninto effect tomorrow--tomorrow. This is a ban which would go into \neffect tomorrow with four dozen American families in the process of \nbringing a child home from Russia.\n  My wife Abby and I adopted our son Charlie from Russia a number of \nyears ago now. After visits to Russia and as we were leaving the \ncourthouse the day the court procedures were accomplished, we were in \nthe car with people who had helped us with that adoption who \nrepresented an organization here in the United States--in this case, \nthe Gladney organization in Texas--and they got a call that four of \ntheir fellow organizations had just been decertified in Russia. They \nwere decertified for some technical reason with their papers. All of \nthe adoptions they had done were reviewed, and at least one error was \nfound in one paper somewhere. Over the course of the next 12 months, as \nevery single agency came up for review--and this was about 6 years ago \nnow--every one of them had a problem that wound up with their being \ndisqualified.\n  At the end of that year, there wasn't a single American organization \nthat could be helpful to an American family with a Russian adoption \nbecause that was the policy the government decided at that time. They \nwere going to somehow penalize American families who wanted to adopt \nRussian kids in ways that made that virtually impossible.\n  At that time, there were families who had met a child, who had bonded \nwith that child, who had taken pictures home, who had talked to doctors \nin Russia and the United States, and who had done everything a family \nneeded to do, and who had even gotten ready to go to court. I think at \nthat point, if you had gone to court, you probably took your child home \nwith you, but that is not the case right now. But they all were caught \nin a situation where in some cases it was 2 or 3 more years before that \nadoption was allowed to be completed, if it was ever allowed to be \ncompleted.\n  Now the Russian Government has decided once again to use Russian kids \nin orphanages as political pawns to help create some international \ndispute with the United States. This is not behavior that is worthy of \nthe credit that, frankly, we just gave the Russians whenever we entered \ninto a trade agreement that said: We want to accept you further into \nthe relationships we have.\n  By the way, I have talked to parents in the last few days who have \nadopted children from Russia. These are parents who, like every one of \nus in this room right now on the floor of the Senate, grew up at a time \nwhen the Soviet Union was seen as a great adversary. But suddenly the \nbonding that occurred between our two countries because of this \nopportunity for Russian kids to become American kids made a big \ndifference in the way Americans looked at Russians and the way Russians \nlooked at Americans. But this is a difference that somehow the Russian \nGovernment wants to do away with as they take offense because we--\nappropriately, I think--put in the Russian trade agreement penalties \nfor people who were involved in the imprisonment and death of Russian \nattorney Sergei Magnitsky in 2009. We were pretty specific about the \nnarrow group to which this applied. And they are very specific about \nthe 110,000 kids in orphanages in Russia today who cannot be adopted by \nAmerican families because they have decided to use these kids as a \npolitical tool. It is the wrong thing to do.\n  Russia and the United States have had a tradition now that goes back \nto the end of the Cold War of working together to find permanent homes \nfor children without parents in our country. As recently as November 1 \nof last year, we signed a bilateral agreement to strengthen the \nprocedural safeguards for this process so that families who got \ninvolved wouldn't get way\n\n[[Page S8591]]\n\ndown the line or get into the line at all and find out they were not \ngoing to let this happen.\n  We have one family in St. Louis who has adopted, they have gone to \ncourt, have been to Russia multiple times, and the court has said they \nare now the adoptive parents--the Russian court--of this child, but \nunder the new requirement, they have to wait another 30 days before \nthey can come back and take this child home. And now the Russian \nGovernment says they can never take this child home. That is totally \nunacceptable.\n  Last week Senator Landrieu and I, along with at least a dozen other \nSenators, sent a letter to President Putin urging him not to violate \nthe agreement by signing the law. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the letter to his Excellency \nVladimir Putin.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 21, 2012.\n     His Excellency Vladimir Putin,\n     President of the Russian Federation, The Kremlin, Moscow, \n         Russia.\n       Dear Mr. President: We respectfully ask you to veto the law \n     ``On Measures of Coercion on Persons, Involved in the \n     Violation of the Rights of Russian Citizens,'' which includes \n     language that permanently bans adoptions of Russian children \n     by American families. We are deeply saddened by the events in \n     the Duma over the past few days which have led to the passage \n     of this law, that would abrogate the bilateral agreement \n     between our two countries that you signed earlier this year \n     and which entered into force on November 1, 2012. We fear \n     that this overly broad law would have dire consequences for \n     Russian children.\n       If the law takes effect, thousands of Russian children \n     living in institutions may lose an opportunity to become part \n     of a family. As you know, our two countries have a long \n     tradition of working together to find permanent homes for \n     unparented children. At any given moment, based on the \n     statistics of the past few years, there are at least 1,000 \n     Russian children in the process of finding supportive and \n     protective families in the United States. They and those who \n     would follow them would become the real victims of a \n     misplaced legislative effort. We share in your desire to \n     ensure the wellbeing and safety of all adopted children and \n     remain steadfast to the commitments we made in the bilateral \n     agreement.\n       Nothing is more important to the future of our world than \n     doing our best to give as many children the chance to grow up \n     in a family as we possibly can.\n       We hope that your spirit of compassion for voiceless \n     children will prevail so that this sad turn of events will \n     not lead to harm to so many innocent children.\n         Mary L. Landrieu,\n         John Boozman,\n         Maria Cantwell,\n         Roger F. Wicker,\n         Jim Inhofe,\n         Karen Bass,\n         John Sarbanes,\n         John Cornyn,\n         Joe Lieberman,\n         Frank R. Lautenberg,\n         Roy Blunt,\n         Chuck Grassley,\n         Dave Camp,\n         Daniel Lipinski,\n         Amy Klobuchar,\n         Jeanne Shaheen.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. He signed the law anyway. Senator Landrieu and I are going \nto have a resolution that she is going to talk about, asking not only \nthat this position be reversed but that immediately we do whatever is \nnecessary to unite these families who have already bonded with children \nwho are in orphanages in Russia.\n  I talked to a number of parents just yesterday. Bob and Sandy Davis \nof St. Louis have been very involved in the efforts for adoptive \nchildren from Russia and the Ukraine.\n  I talked to a young man this morning, Sergei Quincy, from Branson, \nwho is 22, who was adopted by the Quincys in Branson when he was 14. At \n14, he came to the United States, didn't speak any English, started the \nninth grade, learned English, and at 22 he is now happily married with \na couple of young children. He told me the moment of his adoption was \nthe moment that made his dreams possible. He had a bad family \nsituation, institutionalized with his brother and his sister in three \ndifferent orphanages, and his brother was adopted by the same family \nwho didn't know about his sister.\n  I talked to Senator John Lamping of Missouri, who adopted a son who \nis now 14 who had never gone to school. He was adopted at 8 or 9 years \nold, and he had never been to school anywhere.\n  I would hope the Senate speaks strongly and that we work as \neffectively as we can with the Russian representatives in this country \nto help them right this wrong--the immediate and unbelievable wrong for \nalmost 50 families who know the child they are about to bring into \ntheir family and emotionally and psychologically already have.\n  For all the kids in Russia, the country that is No. 3 in foreign \nadoptions for the United States--all those kids who are likely to spend \ntheir growing-up years in an orphanage and at 15 or 16 be put out of \nthat orphanage with no support system there are families in the United \nStates of America who want to make them part of their family.\n  I would like to close by saying I continue to appreciate the great \nleadership on all these adoption issues that Senator Landrieu has shown \nand look forward to working with her and others as we try to help right \nthis tragic wrong.\n  I would be glad to yield to my good friend from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am proud to join my friend, the \nSenator from Missouri, on the floor to add voice to this travesty that \nhas recently occurred.\n  The Senator from Missouri described the situation accurately; that a \ncountry that claims to be a powerful nation on the Earth has decided to \ntake powerful action against the weakest, most vulnerable individuals \non the Earth, and those are children without families.\n  It makes no sense whatsoever for the country of Russia to take the \naction they did because they are in a disagreement with us in America--\nand maybe others around the world--about human rights violations \nregarding adults.\n  The Russian Government, in front of the whole world, has taken their \nanger and frustration out on their own children--their own children who \nare orphans, their own children who are sick, their own children who, \nin some cases, are disabled. It makes no sense in the world.\n  I was trying to think, I say to the Senator from Missouri, of what \nwould ever possess the United States of America or any country to take \ntheir anger and their frustrations out on children. That is what the \nDuma did.\n  They are hurting their own children, and we would like to urge them \nstrongly in this resolution--which I am going to submit for its \nimmediate consideration on my behalf and Senator Blunt and Senator \nInhofe. We would like to ask the Russian Government to please \nreconsider--there might be other actions they could take to make it \nclear they are unhappy with some things we have done, but damning their \nchildren should not be one of them, causing children to not have an \nopportunity for a family or an education or health care or enough \nfood--and to please be considerate of their needs.\n  The 50 or so families who are in the very end of the process, we also \nwant to ask the government to understand that just as birth parents \nanticipate the birth of their child, adoptive parents anticipate the \ncoming of that union to their family. Most important, many of these \nchildren are not infants. Some of them are, but some of them are older \nchildren who know they are about to be adopted, who understand that a \nmother or a father has already agreed to take them to the United \nStates. It is going to crush their hopes and their dreams and their \nspirit.\n  We are hoping the Russian Government will reconsider.\n  This resolution, I hope, will be joined by our colleagues in a strong \nvote of support. I know that with the Senator from Missouri, he and I \nwill continue to work in every way we can to see if we can find a \nbetter resolution.\n  But there are a couple other things I wish to say about this quickly. \nI want everyone to be clear that in the United States of America--and I \nam very proud of our country in this regard--we adopt over 100,000 \nchildren a year. We have 350 million people-plus, but we adopt 100,000 \nchildren. Most of those children are American children adopted by \nAmerican parents, children who have lost their parents, children who \nhave been abandoned by their parents, children who have been grossly \nabandoned or neglected by their parents and the courts have stepped in \nand terminated those rights and we immediately\n\n[[Page S8592]]\n\nfind relatives or people in the community to adopt because we believe, \nas Americans--and many people around the world--that children shouldn't \nraise themselves. Every child belongs in a family, in a permanent, \nloving, supportive, protective family, and it is our job as a \ngovernment and our job as a faith-based community and our \nresponsibility as a community to make sure there is no parentless child \nin the world.\n  So we work very hard, not just government to government but in the \nchurches, in the faith-based communities, working with nonprofit \norganizations, to make the rules and regulations and systems strong to \nprotect children and also to protect fragile families from \ndisintegrating, reconnecting children with families, trying our very \nbest to do that.\n  We want to work with Russia to strengthen their internal child \nprotection system. We work on strengthening ours every day. It is not \nperfect, but it is one of the best in the world. We still make terrible \nmistakes, but we do want to continue to work to improve our child \nwelfare system. But adoption, both domestic and international--kinship \nadoption included--is a very important tool of child protection. We \nwant to do a better job in the United States. We want to continue to \nkeep avenues of adoption open for children from Russia, from China, \nfrom Romania, et cetera.\n  Some people may be wondering: Senator, you are so bold speaking about \nthis. Are children from America adopted overseas? The answer is yes--\nnot many, but under the international treaties of the rights of a child \nto a family, we need to be open to have American children--if they \ncan't find an adoptive home here--to be able to go to other countries.\n  But the most important thing is to know that Americans step up every \nday to adopt American children, both infants, teenagers, and I have \neven known of adoptions of children who were 22 and 23 years of age. \nWhen are you ever too old to need a mother and a father?\n  But the action the Russian Duma has taken is a travesty, and it is \nincomprehensible that any government would take their anger out on \nanother country against the children of their own country. We hope they \nwill reconsider. We hope the people of Russia will rise and tell their \ngovernment: Absolutely not. Take out your anger and frustration in \nanother way, not on our own children, and allow these adoptions to be \nprocessed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/31/senate-section/article/S8592-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 629--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n                      COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n\n  Mr. REID of Nevada (for himself and Mr. Pryor) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
