Mr. President, it is my honor to introduce to the Senate \nRev. Ron McCrary, who just gave the prayer on the floor of the Senate. \nHe is here with Chaplain Black.\n  Reverend McCrary is a great individual from my home county, Cobb \nCounty, GA. He is the chaplain to the Cobb County Board of \nCommissioners, the fourth largest county in Georgia. He is chaplain of \nthe Police Officers Standards and Training facility in Georgia, which \ncovers 40,000 law enforcement offices. He is a great preacher, a great \nleader, and a great chaplain. He was recommended to me by Sheriff Neil \nWarren, the sheriff of Cobb County, who because of his graciousness \nallowed Ron to come and be with us today.\n  Ron is a father, a minister, and a great witness. He witnessed as an \nathlete through the Campus Crusade for Christ and Athletes in Action. \nHe witnessed as a pastor by ministering churches. He witnessed to the \ncommunity by delivering great sermons--one of them about voting, in \nhonor of Coretta Scott King, delivered in 2006 at the Turner Chapel in \nMarietta, where he empowered everyone to honor Coretta Scott King's \nlife's work by making sure they participated in the political system.\n  It is an honor and a privilege for me to welcome and host Rev.

Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 250, \nS. 1940.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 250, S. 1940, a bill to \n     amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, to restore \n     the financial solvency of the flood insurance fund, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following leader remarks, the time until 11 \nthis morning will be equally divided and controlled. At 11 o'clock \na.m., we will begin up to 10 rollcall votes. We will complete the farm \nbill today in the early afternoon. We also hope to have a cloture vote \non the motion to proceed to the flood insurance bill today.\n\n\n                            Working Together\n\n  Mr. President, we come here and lament all the bad things happening \nin the Senate. It is not out of order once in a while to talk about \nsome of the good things happening in the Senate. I think we should look \nat it as if, as difficult as it has been to get things done, we are \nmaking progress. We had that postal bill, which was good work on behalf \nof the Senate. The highway bill worked out extremely well. We have this \n5-year farm bill--very difficult, but it is now near passing, which is \ngood for the country.\n  We have to make sure before the end of the month we finish our work \non the Flood Insurance Program, which is so extremely important to the \ncountry. With the construction picking up a little bit everyplace, we \nhave to make sure when a loan is to close it can be\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\nclosed. Thousands of them each day cannot be closed unless we do a \nrenewal of the Flood Insurance Program.\n  I had a meeting with the Speaker on Tuesday, with Senator Boxer, \nchairman of the committee, Chairman Mica, her counterpart in the House, \nand Senator Inhofe, and we are making progress on the highway bill. I \nfeel good about that. Whether we get it done remains to be seen. But \nthe House, in an overwhelming vote yesterday--totally bipartisan or \nthey could not get the 384 votes--instructed the conferees to come back \nwith the bill by tomorrow. Contentious issues have been resolved, and I \nbelieve we have a shot at getting the highway bill done. That would be \ngood for the country and good for the Senate.\n  So I appreciate everyone working together. As the Republican leader \nand I have talked, as difficult as it is to work out agreements on the \nbills I have just mentioned--including the farm bill--it is good for \nthe Senate.\n  I appeared before a committee chaired by Senator Carper, and there as \nthe ranking member was Senator Collins. They both indicated today \nbefore everybody that the spirit on the Senate floor was good \nyesterday.\n  That is because everyone can feel we are accomplishing something. \nSome of the votes were difficult, and some we all wish we had not taken \nbecause they were tough votes. But that is what the Senate is all \nabout. So I feel comfortable with the last bit, that we are trying to \nwork together for the good of the country.\n  I have said lots of times, if we are able to accomplish good as a \nbody, everyone can take credit for it. We can go back to our States and \nclaim we are part of a victory for the country. But if we do not get it \ndone, we are part of the blame and people can go home and lament the \nfact that we have not been able to get our work done. People point \nfingers at us: Why can't you get more done?\n  So, hopefully, this summer, which started yesterday--in fact, today \nis the longest day of the year--will bring good tidings to the Senate.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Traditional Senate Operation\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves the \nfloor, let me just say I agree entirely that the Senate, it seems to \nme, is sort of getting back to operating the way the Senate \ntraditionally has. I think the way Senator Roberts and Senator Stabenow \nhave handled the farm bill has been exemplary. Members on both sides \nhave gotten opportunities to offer amendments. We have had a lot of \nvotes, but it is an important bill.\n  So I commend all of those who have been involved in beginning to work \nus back in the direction that I think most of the Senate would be \ncomfortable with.\n  I also want to thank my friend, the majority leader. He has a tough \njob setting the agenda and deciding how to go about moving legislation. \nI think the way we have handled the farm bill and other measures to \nwhich he has referred in recent months has been a very important step \nin the right direction.\n\n\n                           Student Loan Rates\n\n  Mr. President, 3 weeks ago today, Republican leaders in the Senate \njoined Republican leaders in the House in calling on the President to \nresolve a pending increase in student loan rates.\n  Drawing on some of the President's own ideas, we proposed multiple \ngood-faith solutions to this problem before it is too late. We have \nbeen waiting ever since for the President's response. He has actually \nbeen missing in action. He has yet to offer a concrete solution. So you \ncan understand our surprise upon learning this morning that the \nPresident plans to call on Congress later today to do something about \nstudent loan rates.\n  Mr. President, the Republican-led House of Representatives already \npassed a bill that would solve the problem. As I said, Republican \nleaders in the Senate have been on record supporting multiple--\nmultiple--good-faith solutions to this problem for literally weeks. It \nis actually the Democratic-led Senate that has failed to act, and the \nPresident who has failed to contribute to a solution. The reason is \npretty obvious.\n  It was reported yesterday that the Democratic Congressional Campaign \nCommittee is launching a Web site with a student loan countdown clock \naimed at raising money off this issue. The implication is that \nRepublicans are the ones dragging their feet.\n  As for the President? Well, this is just another sad example of the \nelection-year strategy of deflection and distraction--deflection and \ndistraction.\n  College graduates are struggling to find work and pay their bills in \nthe Obama economy. He would like them to believe it is somebody else's \nfault.\n  Latinos are struggling with high unemployment. He would like them to \nbelieve the Republicans are the problem.\n  Middle-class moms are struggling to make ends meet. He wants them to \nthink we are engaged in some phony war on women.\n  The President does not have a positive message to send to any of \nthese folks, so he is cooking up false controversies to distract them \nfrom his own failure to turn the economy around.\n  Well, on the student loan issue, we could solve this problem in a \nsitting. Republicans have acted quickly, and on a bipartisan basis, to \nhelp prevent these rates from going up. We have passed a bill out of \nthe House. We have reached out to the President. We have proposed \nmultiple--multiple--solutions.\n  The only reason this issue is not already resolved--the only reason--\nis that the President wants to keep it alive a little while longer. He \nthinks it benefits him politically for college students to believe \nsomehow we are the problem.\n  It is time to stop playing games. It is time for the President to \nact.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, good morning to you. Good \nmorning to my colleagues.\n\n\n                          PTC for Wind Energy\n\n  I am here again on the Senate floor to urge all of my colleagues to \nvote for an extension of the production tax credit for wind energy, \notherwise known as the PTC.\n  Today, as I have been doing, I will focus on an individual State. I \nam going to look at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and show all of us \nthe promise it holds as a wind energy manufacturing hub, as well as the \nnegative effects that will occur if we do not extend the production tax \ncredit.\n  Pennsylvania has a strong blue-collar background and an extraordinary \nnumber of highly skilled workers. With those factors, those positive \nelements in Pennsylvania, it has seamlessly transitioned into a wind \nenergy powerhouse.\n  Look at this map I have in the Chamber of the State of Pennsylvania. \nYou will see, from Philadelphia to Rockwood, from Pittsburgh to \nScranton, there are wind projects all over the State. Those wind \nprojects have created good-paying jobs and stability for Pennsylvania \nfamilies.\n  Pennsylvania, as I have alluded to, has long been a center of \nmanufacturing in the United States, and the wind industry has taken \nnote.\n  You can see these green circles on this map. Each one of those \nindicates a manufacturing facility that makes parts for wind turbines \nin the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. That represents over 20 plants and \nhundreds of employees in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  I would suggest that the State of Pennsylvania is only beginning to \nrealize its potential when it comes to the wind energy industry.\n  My colleagues know I have been on the Senate floor talking about the \neconomic benefits of wind energy. I want to highlight what has happened \nin Pennsylvania.\n  If we look at this chart, in Pennsylvania, the wind energy industry \nsupports 4,000 jobs. There are 180,000 homes that are powered by wind, \nand there is a conservative $1.4 million in property taxes from wind \nprojects that go to local communities.\n  So this is an important set of numbers. It is money, particularly on \nthe\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\ntax side, that helps local communities pay for basic services, and it \nis critical in this time of decreasing local and State budgets.\n  If we think about it, all of these figures--the jobs, the revenues, \nthe investments--are prime for significant growth going forward. But \nthat future and that growth are going to be threatened unless we act, \nunless the Congress acts to extend the production tax credit.\n  Just last week, Gamesa--which is a global leader in the manufacturing \nof wind turbines--announced it is ending the development of the Shaffer \nMountain Wind Farm, which is in northeastern Somerset County. This \nproject would have ultimately ended up with 30 new wind turbines, and \nit was planned to come online in 2013. That is just 6 months from now. \nBut because of the uncertainty tied to Federal policies, such as the \nproduction tax credit, Gamesa has sidelined this project.\n  In short, our inaction is costing this community jobs, this \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania jobs. It does not make any sense in the \ncurrent economic environment we now face and as our Nation is \ndesperately focused on becoming more energy independent.\n  The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette made the point that this is the third \nwind project under development that has been stopped--all in the last \nmonth--just because of the uncertainty we have created here by not \nextending the PTC. These are on-the-ground examples of how \ncongressional inaction is costing American jobs and investment.\n  I know the Acting President pro tempore knows this is not a partisan \nor regional issue. There is strong bipartisan support for extending the \nproduction tax credit, and the wind industry has a presence in almost \nevery single State in our country. So if we look at the overall \npicture, this is not the time for companies such as Gamesa to grow, \nreluctant to invest in the future. So we have to expand the PTC. It \nwill incent this industry to continue its rapid growth, and it will \nbuild a strong foundation for a 21st-century clean energy economy.\n  So I am again on the floor urging my colleagues to work with me to \nextend the wind production tax credit as soon as possible.\n  As I close, I want to highlight an event that is on Capitol Hill \ntoday where Members, staff, and others can learn more about the \npotential of wind energy, as well as other types of renewable and \nenergy-efficient technology.\n  That event is the 15th Annual Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \nEXPO. It is underway all day in the Cannon Caucus Room on the House \nside.\n  The bipartisan Senate Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, \nwhich I cochair along with Senators Lieberman and Crapo, is an honorary \ncohost of the event. I encourage all of us to go over there, look at \nthe technologies. They are awe inspiring. They are awesome. They are \ntruly the future. When we implement policies that will help these \ntechnologies penetrate all of these various markets, we are going to \ncontinue to be a leader in the clean energy economy.\n  So I will be back next week to talk about the wind production tax \ncredit. I will be here every day until we pass it and extend it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio.) The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, before reading our order of amendments, \nI wish, one more time, to say thank you to everyone. We have had two \nvery productive, hard-working days. I thank my ranking member for his \nincredible leadership and all our staffs.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to show that the Senate can come \ntogether--and we have been doing that--to pass a significant piece of \npublic policy for Americans. I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the previous order, the amendment votes occur in the \nfollowing order and that all other provisions of the previous order \nremain in effect: Boxer amendment No. 2456; Johanns No. 2372; Toomey \nNo. 2247; Sanders No. 2310; Coburn No. 2214; Murray No. 2455; McCain \nNo. 2162; Rubio No. 2166.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2456\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2456.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2456.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On p. 1009, after line 11, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 122__. REQUIREMENTS FOR AERIAL OVERFLIGHTS OF \n                   AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS TO PROTECT PUBLIC \n                   HEALTH AND SAFETY.\n\n       The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     pursuant to her responsibility to protect public health and \n     safety, shall only conduct aerial overflights to inspect \n     agricultural operations if the EPA Administrator determines \n     that aerial overflights are more cost-effective than ground \n     inspections to the taxpayer and the Agency has notified the \n     appropriate State officials of such flights.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, on the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Johanns has an amendment which \nwould stop the EPA from ever using any kind of airplanes--including \nmanned small planes, which is all they do use--to check on serious \npollution spills.\n  I wish to say this is about life and death. I hope the Senate will \nsupport the Boxer amendment and vote no on the Johanns amendment \nbecause the Boxer amendment says the EPA can only use these overflights \nif it has to do it to protect the health and safety and if it has been \napproved by the State.\n  This pollution could cause serious illness, and they want to make \nsure they can track the plume. We have heard of cryptosporidium, E. \ncoli, and giardia. That is what we are talking about--terrible bacteria \nthat sometimes comes from animals.\n  In 1993, at least 50 people died from the bacteria cryptosporidium in \nMilwaukee, and it came from animal waste. The EPA has never used a \ndrone, and they don't plan to, but don't stop them from using small \naerial oversight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, given the EPA's recent track record with \nagriculture--if not downright contempt for it--farmers and ranchers \nsimply don't trust the EPA. They could have done this program right and \nreached out to the congressional delegations in Nebraska and Iowa and \nsaid: Here is what we are doing. Here is the plan. They did not.\n  I found out about this accidentally. I have requested information--in \nfact, our entire delegation has--and the administrator has been \nnonresponsive. That is why the amendment is here. It is an amendment \nbased on a lack of trust for the EPA. This maintains the status quo. \nThis will change nothing. It will rubberstamp what they are doing.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment and support the next \namendment, which I will call up in due time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll. This is a 60-vote threshold.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I was unavoidably \ndetained and unable to vote on the Boxer amendment No. 2456 this \nmorning. If I had been present, I would have voted in favor of this \namendment. It is important that the use of overflights to monitor \ncompliance with the Clean Water Act be limited to circumstances where \nground inspections of large industrial agriculture operations would not \nbe as cost effective or sufficiently protective of public health and \nsafety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2372\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2372 and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2372.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n  Agency from conducting aerial surveillance to inspect agricultural \n       operations or to record images of agricultural operations)\n\n       On page 1009, after line 11, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 122___. PROHIBITION ON AERIAL SURVEILLANCE OF \n                   AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS.\n\n       The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \n     shall not conduct aerial surveillance to inspect agricultural \n     operations or to record images of agricultural operations.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, low-altitude surveillance flights over \nfarmers' and ranchers' private property has caused bipartisan concern, \nand it is happening--EPA is flying these flights. Senator Nelson and I \nand the entire Nebraska delegation wrote to Administrator Jackson \nsaying, ``What is going on? What are you doing?'' Their response was \nkicked down to the Regional Director. It was incomplete. It was totally \nunacceptable.\n  This is not about drones, this is about flights over feed lots, \ntrying to determine if there is a violation and then pursuing that \naction. What we are asking for is for the public to be advised of what \nthey are doing. Until that happens, this amendment simply says: Stop. \nYou can't do this anymore until you let us know how you are using this \ninformation and for what purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask for support of the amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I be recognzied?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognzied.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this amendment is very serious. It is \nabout life and death. It is true that on occasion EPA will use small \nmanned aircraft to inspect a bacteria spill.\n  Let me recall for you: Wisconsin, 1993, at least 50 people lost their \nlives from the bacteria cryptosporidium from animal waste. When you are \nfollowing a plume, the way to do it is from the air. It is much more \nexpensive in many cases to do ground inspection. EPA estimates that on-\nthe-ground inspection may cost $10,000, but it could cost $2,500 to \nsurvey the same area by air.\n  This is life and death. We are talking about E. coli. We are talking \nabout giardia and cryptosporidium. We are talking about the health and \nsafety of the American people that is compromised from these kinds of \nanimal waste.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

There is 2 minutes of debate.\n  Senator Toomey.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, water systems are currently required to \nmail reports every year that detail in great specificity all the minute \ntrace chemicals that are inevitably in the water supply. This is at a \ngreat cost and it is a problem, particularly for rural water systems. \nWhat my amendment would do is permit the water companies, provided \nthere are no violations, to inform their customers in each and every \nmonthly bill that they can obtain this information on the Web site. \nThere are absolutely no changes whatsoever in water standards, of \ncourse, and every company would still have to mail these detailed \nreports if the water failed to comply with the State or Federal \nstandards. This is a way we can free up tens, even hundreds of \nthousands of dollars in unnecessary mailing costs and make that \navailable for infrastructure investment.\n  I am happy to yield to my colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. This is very simple. This is the information age. In my \nrural State of Oklahoma, sometimes they have to drive 30 miles to a \npost office. This will make it a lot easier as an accommodation and \nnothing is lost.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today our families receive in the mail \njust once a year a report about the safety of the water their kids \ndrink every single day. The Toomey amendment repeals that important \nright to know. There are 70 regulated dangerous contaminants in our \nwater. For example: arsenic, benzene, vinyl chloride, asbestos, \ncadmium, mercury, radium, and uranium. Some of these dangerous toxins \nare deemed unsafe at any level. Yet under Toomey you would no longer \nreceive that information.\n  Senator Toomey says go to the Web site. One thousand water districts \nhave no Web site. And right now, under the current right-to-know law, \nthe Governor can say he waives this requirement for the small rural \ndistricts.\n  Please vote no. Our people have a right to know what their kids are \ndrinking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

It says the American people \nshould have the right to know what is in the food they and their \nchildren are eating and if that food contains genetically engineered \nproducts.\n  This amendment grants States the authority to label genetically \nengineered food. It is not a mandate. It grants States that right--\nsomething which, by the way, is now taking place in 49 countries \nthroughout the world.

The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first I want to thank the Senator from \nVermont for his wonderful leadership on so many issues in this bill. I \nmust, reluctantly, ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  Consumers certainly need to have available information. We need to \nmake sure it is accurate, according to the FDA, after they determine \nthat.\n  I would make one other point: American farmers are feeding the world, \nwith 7 billion mouths to feed. This is harder every day. Science and \ninnovation are very important to that.\n  Recently, I talked with Bill Gates, with the Gates Foundation, for \nexample, which is doing incredible work around the globe: with drought-\nresistant crops in Africa, with innovative rice in the Philippines and \nBangladesh, and so on.\n  This is an issue that needs to be thoroughly studied to make sure we \nare not hurting those efforts. I know the chairman of the HELP \nCommittee has asked that we not do this. It is within his jurisdiction.\n  Madam President, I yield time now to Senator Roberts.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Very quickly, we all wear coats and ties in this body. \nThis amendment would put us in lab coats. Don't wear a lab coat. Vote \n``no'' on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is a small step, but it is an \nimportant step.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his leadership in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, 99 percent of the American public has no \nidea that when they check the box, we are going to take actual American \ntaxpayer dollars and subsidize party conventions for candidates who \nhave already been decided.\n  If we are going to lead as a body on starting to solve some of our \nproblems, this is where we should start. This is $34.6 million that \ngets doled out that is not spent in the best interests of the American \npublic but spent in the best interests of the politicians for the \nAmerican public. It needs to be changed. It has no effect on security. \nIt has no effect on the present allocation that was made in January to \neach party. If we cannot do this, this little simple thing of leading \nby example, then our country is doomed because that means we cannot \nsolve the very significant problems in front of us either.\n  I would appreciate your support and vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-\naffirmative threshold be waived, since it is my understanding that we \nwill adopt this by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, the amendment we are going to vote on \nis bipartisan, fair, and it will make sure Congress gets a report on \nthe impact of all aspects of the scheduled automatic cuts. We all agree \nthe bipartisan sequestration agreed to in the Budget Control Act is a \nterrible way to cut spending. It was included as a trigger in order to \nbring both sides to the table ready to compromise.\n  I am hopeful we can get together and get the bipartisan deal required \nto replace these automatic cuts responsibly and fairly. But as we work \ntoward that we all should know exactly how the administration would \nenact sequestration if we don't get a deal.\n  I was very proud to work with Senators McCain, Levin, and Thune to \ncome together on a bipartisan compromise to make sure Congress has the \ninformation we all need on sequestration from the painful cuts to the \nDefense Department, border security, food safety, education, and \nprograms for middle-class families, on which the most vulnerable \nAmericans depend.\n  So I thank all my colleagues for working with me on this bipartisan \ncompromise, and I thank the families and advocates who called and wrote \nletters urging us to examine all aspects of sequestration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if sequestration comes to pass at the end \nof this year, many of us believe it could derail the economic recovery \nand do immense damage to important programs throughout the government, \nmaking our Nation less safe and our government less responsive to the \nneeds of the people we serve.\n  But at this point, while our concern is deep and widespread, it is \nnot specific. We know only in the most general terms what impact \nsequestration might have. And while that is enough to encourage many of \nus to seek the compromises needed to avoid sequestration, the Congress \nand the American people deserve a more complete picture of what we \nface.\n  That is why I am a cosponsor of the amendment offered by Senators \nMurray and McCain, which would help give us and all Americans that more \ncomplete picture.\n  I thank Senator McCain and Senator Murray for the leadership and hard \nwork, on a bipartisan basis, that produced this amendment. It deserves \nbroad bipartisan support, and not only because it will provide valuable \ninformation to us and our constituents. We must find ways to work \nacross party lines more often and compromise for the common good. I \nhope this amendment can serve as one step toward the larger and more \ndifficult compromises we must accomplish to avert the deep and lasting \ndamage of sequestration.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is my understanding that Senator \nMcCain will not speak at this time, so I urge a ``yes'' vote on this \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2455) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, given the work that has been done, I \nwish to thank Senators Murray and McCain for their efforts. Senator \nMcCain will not be offering his amendment, just for the information of \nthe Senate. So we will move on now to the Rubio amendment, when Senator \nRubio is prepared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an amendment I \nhave introduced--with a dozen cosponsors to require the Secretary of \nDefense to provide to Congress a detailed\n\n[[Page S4387]]\n\nreport by August 15, 2012, on the impacts on national security of the \nautomatic budget cuts, also known as sequestration. These cuts will be \nimposed upon the Defense Department 6 months from now unless Congress \nacts.\n  My amendment makes no changes to the Budget Control Act and should be \nnon-controversial. It simply requires the Secretary of Defense to \ndetail for us the implications of these cuts so that we may consider \nlegislative options. My colleagues are well aware of how budget \nsequestration became the law of the land, of the failure of the Joint \nSelect Committee on Deficit Reduction, and of the enforcement mechanism \nof automatic cuts. But none of us fully understand the specific \nconsequences of the across-the-board spending reductions should they be \ntriggered on January 2, 2013.\n  We know from statements and testimony from the Secretary of Defense \nand high-ranking DOD and military officials that the impact of \nsequestration on the Department of Defense would be disastrous. I need \nnot remind my colleagues that one of government's foundational \nresponsibilities is to defend the Nation. Our constituents entrust us \nto do so. Allowing budget sequestration to occur in the Department of \nDefense would dramatically increase risk to our national security and \nundermine our ability to protect our interests at home and abroad.\n  I agree that our current fiscal climate demands that we reduce annual \ndeficits and pay down the massive Federal debt. I also recognize that \nthe demands placed on our Armed Forces are beginning to diminish at \nleast insofar as current operations in Afghanistan are concerned. The \nadministration and the Congress have acknowledged as much, reducing war \nfunding by almost half since 2011. The President's withdrawal plan for \nAfghanistan will reduce that funding need even further. In addition, \nthe President has already put in place a plan to cut the defense budget \nby $487 billion over the next 9 years.\n  I have reluctantly supported these planned cuts in the interest of \ndeficit reduction, and we have scrutinized their impact on the Armed \nForces. Many of my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee \njoined me in expressing concerns to the Secretary of Defense about \nsignificant troop reductions in the Army and Marine Corps, major \nprogram curtailments, and proposed base closures.\n  Army Chief of Staff GEN Odierno told us that his service could \nperform its mission with 80,000 fewer troops. Commandant of the Marine \nCorps General Amos echoed those sentiments when describing his plan to \nreduce by 20,000 marines. My point is that the Department of Defense \nhas already undertaken major budget reductions which will impact our \nforces for a decade or longer. While I do not agree with every \nreduction proposed by the administration, I acknowledge that we all \nneed to tighten our belts and that the Defense Department is not \nsacrosanct.\n  It is in the context of the nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion of reductions that \nhave already been levied against the Defense Department that we should \nconsider the impact of additional automatic budget cuts. Budget \nsequestration would cancel an additional $\\1/2\\ trillion from the \ndefense budget and would do so in a thoroughly arbitrary and \ndestructive way. It is one thing for the Department to make planned \nreductions to troops, equipment, training, and operations, and to keep \nthese reductions synchronized; it is quite another to apply an across-\nthe-board percentage reduction to every defense program. The law does \nnot provide flexibility; it dictates that budget sequestration must be \napplied in equal percentages to each ``program, project, and \nactivity.'' That means equal percentage cuts in every research project, \nweapons program, and military construction project. Assuming military \npersonnel accounts are exempted, we understand that cut to be about 14 \npercent. A 14-percent cut in a military construction project would \nrender it unexecutable. How can you buy 86 percent of a building or 86 \npercent of an aircraft carrier? This is the danger of sequestration. \nThe law mandates that cuts be taken equally across every budget line. \nIt is absolutely senseless and will have enormous primary and secondary \neffects.\n  As an example, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of contracts for services \nand equipment will have to be renegotiated. Contracts with specific \ndelivery quantities will have to be rewritten to reduce the quantities, \nwhich will increase the cost per unit to the government. More likely, \nmanagement decisions will be taken out of the hands of managers and put \ninto the hands of lawyers, as companies sue the government for breach \nof contract and termination costs. Legal proceedings could stretch out \nover years, at enormous expense to the taxpayer. ``Savings'' from \nbudget sequestration would be consumed by the cost of implementing it. \nMaybe we should think of sequester as an earmark for lawyers.\n  Beyond the cost of implementing a dysfunctional system for budget \ncutting, the impact of sequestration on the capability of the Armed \nForces would needlessly increase risk to national security. I am very \nconcerned about the recent decision by the administration to apply \nsequestration to accounts supporting our military operations in \nAfghanistan. In November 2011, I was assured by the Secretary of \nDefense that this account would not directly be affected. Now, the \nDepartment is conceding that funds we are using to defeat our enemies \nand to build a secure and self-sufficient Afghanistan will be subject \nto immediate reductions. Despite this potentially grave risk to our \nmilitary forces engaged in combat, the Department cannot tell me with \nany assurance to what extent our deployed forces will be affected. We \nmust have a detailed assessment of the impact of these mandatory cuts \nto the support of our forces engaged in hostilities on behalf of our \nNation.\n\n  We know that the President has decided to exempt veterans programs \nfrom budget sequestration but to include war funding under sequester. \nThis demonstrates that the administration is actively deliberating the \nimplementation of the Budget Control Act, which makes it all the more \nsurprising that the President is reluctant to provide even a \npreliminary estimate of the impact of sequestration. If the President \nis making decisions regarding sequestration, why not reveal the impacts \nto Congress and the public?\n  The leaders of the Department of Defense have consistently stated \nthat threats to the national security of the United States have \nincreased, not decreased. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said that \nthese automatic reductions would ``inflict severe damage to our \nnational defense for generations.''\n  General Odierno testified that sequestration would force the Army to \ncut an additional 100,000 troops, half of which would come from the \nGuard and Reserve on top of the 80,000 soldiers already planned to be \nseparated from service. General Odierno stated that the damaging \neffects of sequestration would force the Army to ``fundamentally re-\nlook [at] how we do national security.''\n  The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Greenert, testified that the \nNavy fleet would shrink from 285 ships to 230 to 235 ships, well below \nthe 313 ships the Navy has said it requires. The Navy will be forced to \nabsorb a cut equivalent to the entire annual shipbuilding budget. \nAccording to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, ``The force that comes \nout of sequestration is not the force that can support the current \n[defense] strategy.''\n  Chief of Staff of the Air Force GEN Schwartz testified that \nsequestration ``would slash all of our investment accounts, including \nour top priority modernization program such as the KC-46 tanker, the F-\n35 Joint Strike Fighter, the MQ-9 remotely piloted aircraft, and the \nfuture long-range strike bomber.''\n  We would be left with a much more expensive, much less capable \nnational defense program.\n  The irony in all this is that defense spending is not the reason we \nare in a fiscal mess. The United States spends about 20 percent of its \nannual budget on national defense. Since one of the principal \nresponsibilities of government is to protect the Nation, I consider \nthis amount to be quite modest. The real driver of our national debt is \nmandatory spending, which consumes 58 percent of the annual budget and \nis projected by the Office of Management and Budget to be over 62 \npercent by 2017--growth of almost a percentage point per year. However, \nunder budget sequestration, half of the total amount of cuts would be \nlevied from defense and the other half from all other government \nprograms. Let me repeat that.\n\n[[Page S4388]]\n\nDefense is 20 percent of the budget but will take 50 percent of the \ncuts. It simply doesn't make sense.\n  In addition, these cuts will impact jobs in the defense industry as \nwell as countless counties and towns around the country at a time when \nmillions of Americans are still seeking employment. I appreciate the \nwork of my friend Senator Ayotte to bring this issue of industrial and \neconomic impact to the forefront.\n  We must receive a clear assessment from the Department on the extent \nof the risk to our military operations in Afghanistan, to our military \nprograms, and to readiness here at home if the automatic cuts are \nallowed to occur. Only when we have a clear picture of the impact of \ncurrent law will we be able to consider alternatives to sequestration \nthat reduce the deficit but do not imperil our Nation's security.\n  Some have suggested that the Congress wait until after the election \nto address possible alternatives to sequestration. Mr. President, we \nall know that nothing good happens in a lameduck session. We cannot \nwait for an election to muster the courage to make difficult budget \ndecisions. This amendment to the farm bill is meant to inform the \ndebate about the perils we face if we do not take action.\n  I thank my colleague from Washington, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there is nothing pending now on the Senate \nfloor other than the farm bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. We are in between votes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 1940\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of S. 3240, which is the farm bill, the Senate proceed to \nthe cloture vote on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 250, S. 1940, \nwhich is the flood insurance bill; further, if cloture is invoked on \nthe motion to proceed, notwithstanding cloture having been invoked, it \nbe in order for the majority leader to lay before the body the House \nmessage with respect to S. 3187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, if I might indicate to colleagues, we \nhave one final amendment, the Rubio amendment, and Senator Rubio will \nbe coming to the floor shortly. Following his amendment, we will then \nbe going to final passage.\n  I do want to take a moment to thank the leader. In the midst of an \nextremely demanding schedule, with things that need to get done in the \nSenate, he has given us this opportunity to complete this work. We will \ntalk more about who has been involved in it later, but with all the \ndemands of the Senate--whether it be flood insurance or addressing the \nconcerns of student loan interest rates, the issues of small business \nand jobs and a whole range of issues that are very important for us to \nget done--our leader, with the support of the Republican leader, has \nbeen willing to allow us to move through 73 amendments. Now, I would \nnote that we started with the possibility of 300, so 73 is certainly \nbetter than 300, but we know it was a major piece of work, and we very \nmuch appreciate our colleagues coming together to get this done.\n  Let me remind everyone that 16 million people work in jobs related to \nagriculture and our food systems, and they are watching us to see if we \ndo the right thing and to see us work together to get this done and to \ncreate economic certainty for them and food security for our Nation. So \nI just would like to thank our leaders for their patience and \nwillingness to stand with us.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have come to the floor to speak in favor \nof Senator Rubio's amendment No. 2166, the Rewarding Achievement and \nIncentivizing Successful Employees Act, known as the RAISE Act. It is a \ncatchy title, and sometimes here in Congress catchy bill titles can be \nvery misleading. Sometimes the bill title means the exact opposite of \nwhat the bill would do, such as the Employee Free Choice Act, which \nactually would have taken away the right to make a free choice through \na secret ballot. But in this case, I congratulate my colleague Senator \nRubio for a title that conveys precisely what the amendment aims to do.\n  The RAISE Act would allow employers to give employees raises, \nbonuses, incentive payments, and other monetary rewards whenever they \nare earned, whether the union boss approves or not. As all of us know, \nwe are in extremely difficult economic times. Unemployment has been \nabove 8 percent for over 40 months, now and a striking number of \nindividuals are dropping out of the workforce altogether. When we do \nrecover, as I know we will, we are likely to face a skills gap that \nwill further hamper hiring and growth. One of the keys to our economic \nrecovery is the health of small businesses.\n  For small businesses to reach their full potential, and grow into \njob-creating machines, they need the flexibility to maintain and \nattract the key employees who will get them there. Any small \nbusinessperson will tell you that their employees are their most \nimportant asset. They literally make the difference in whether the \nbusiness succeeds or fails.\n  Once your company is unionized, you learn one way or another that it \nis now an ``unfair labor practice'' under section 8(a)(5) of the \nNational Labor Relations Act to give an employee a raise or a bonus or \nan incentive or even a gift card for a job well done without the \napproval of the union boss. All compensation issues must be negotiated \nwith the union, which allows the union to take credit for securing the \nraise. We have come across scores of cases where employers wanted to \nthank employees for good customer service, impressive sales growth, or \nattract employees to fill a critical manpower shortage, and the \nNational Labor Relations Board, NLRB, penalized the employer for it. In \na time of global competition, the last thing we need is a Federal \nagency punishing companies for trying to perform better by rewarding \nemployees.\n  Believe it or not, there is opposition to this amendment. At least \nfour of our largest labor unions AFL-CIO, AFSCME, SEIU, and the \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters--have opposed allowing employers \nto give raises.\n  Critics of this bill have said that if employers want to be able to \nreward employees beyond the union-approved wage floor, they can \nnegotiate that provision into their contract. This is true. An employer \ncan make the ability to incentivize employees one of their ``asks'' in \nnegotiations, and they probably have to give up something else in order \nfor the union to agree to that. But it is also true that getting such a \nprovision in the bargaining agreement is not enough to protect \nemployers from a charge of unfair labor practice from the union and \npenalty from the NLRB. In my research on this issue, I came across \nseveral cases where employers had negotiated a raise clause, but since \nthe collective bargaining agreement expired and was in renegotiation, \nthe NLRB ruled that the provision did not apply.\n  Let me cite an example from just a few years ago. A Montana water and \nmineral drilling company had negotiated a contract clause with their \nunion to ensure that union-negotiated wages were only a floor and \nsuperior wages could be given with or without the consent of the union. \nWhen the company's orders increased, the company wanted to share the \nprofits and decided to give employees unilateral raises, increase the \nper diem for meals, and raise the clothing and safety allowance \nreimbursement by 167 percent. But the union objected, and the NLRB \nagreed and stopped the raises. Why? Because although the company had \nnegotiated the right to give raises, they were currently in the process \nof renegotiating their collective bargaining agreement and there had \nbeen no explicit extension of the clause allowing for superior wages \nand benefits. O'Keefe Drilling, Case 19-CA-29222(2005)\n  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. NLRB has repeatedly \npunished employers in similar situations.\n\n       An Oregon newspaper publisher had historically offered \n     commission for sales of certain long-term advertisements. As \n     it was adapting to having an online edition, it decided to \n     qualify internet ad sales for commissions, as well, and added \n     signing bonuses for new advertising clients. Although the \n     newspaper had specifically negotiated for a\n\n[[Page S4389]]\n\n     contract provision allowing it to pay wages in excess of the \n     established wage, the bargaining agreement was in \n     renegotiation. The NLRB sided with the union. Register-Guard, \n     339 NLRB 353 (2003)\n\n  The fact that raise provisions are negotiated into union contracts \nnegates another criticism I have heard about this proposal. Some say \nthat it would allow an employer to favor employees based on gender or \nrace. This is entirely false--all race, sex, national origin and \nreligion Federal discrimination statutes are and would remain in full \neffect.\n  I would like to share a few more examples of why this legislation \nwill not just benefit American workers but everyone who relies on the \nservices they provide. For example, there is a great deal of concern \nabout the quality and availability of health care services in this \ncountry. You would think that any Federal agency would congratulate \nhospitals that strive to improve the service they provide. \nUnfortunately, that was not the case in these two examples.\n\n       During the nationwide nursing shortage we experienced in \n     the last decade, a nonprofit New Mexico hospital was \n     desperate for nurses. It was concerned about the ability to \n     provide care and comply with mandatory staffing levels, so \n     the hospital decided to offer $8000 signing bonuses and $2000 \n     relocation bonuses. These generous bonuses were available for \n     new applicants as well as current nurses--union members--who \n     transferred to fill critical needs. But the union objected \n     and the hospital was ordered to stop offering bonuses. St. \n     Vincent Hospital, Case 28-CA-19039(2004)\n       In another case, a Brooklyn hospital was concerned about \n     poor reviews of their nursing staff from patient satisfaction \n     surveys, which had been an ongoing problem. The hospital \n     decided to reward its best nurses, so it honored high-\n     performing nurses with a breakfast, a pin, and gave them $100 \n     gift cards since it was the winter holiday season. \n     Unfortunately, the union objected to this honoring of \n     exceptional nurses and filed charges with the National Labor \n     Relations Board. Although these nurses earned $67,000 to \n     $150,000 a year, the NLRB found that the gift card was not a \n     one-time, de minimis gift but, rather, should be considered \n     compensation and should have been a subject of negotiation \n     with the union. The hospital was banned from giving such \n     bonuses again. Brooklyn Hospital Center, Case No. 29-CA-\n     29323(2009)\n\n  Clearly something has gone very wrong here, and I want to thank \nSenator Rubio for offering us the ability to make it right. The ability \nto reward and incentivize employees is critical to the success of any \nenterprise. Instead of fixating on who gets credit for anything \nbeneficial, our national labor-management policy should be to \nstrengthen unionized and nonunionized businesses and encourage job \ncreation. This will be good for all Americans, no matter what their \nunion membership status.\n  I urge the Senate to support the Rubio amendment and adopt this \ncommonsense change to allow American companies and their employees to \nthrive.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I see Senator Rubio is on the floor, \nand I will now defer to him to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2166\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2166.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Rubio] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2166.\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the National Labor Relations Act to permit employers \n                to pay higher wages to their employees)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. PAYMENT OF HIGHER WAGES.\n\n       Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \n     159(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Notwithstanding a labor organization's exclusive \n     representation of employees in a unit, or the terms and \n     conditions of any collective bargaining contract or agreement \n     then in effect, nothing in either--\n       ``(A) section 8(a)(1) or section 8(a)(5), or\n       ``(B) a collective bargaining contract or agreement renewed \n     or entered into after the date of enactment of the RAISE Act,\n     shall prohibit an employer from paying an employee in the \n     unit greater wages, pay, or other compensation for, or by \n     reason of, his or her services as an employee of such \n     employer, than provided for in such contract or agreement.''.\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, this amendment would amend the National \nLabor Relations Act to allow employers to give merit-based compensation \nincreases to individual employees, even if those increases are not part \nof the collective bargaining agreement. Essentially, this will make the \nunion contract wage a minimum, while giving employers the flexibility \nto reward diligent employees for their hard work. The bottom line is \nthat today, if you work at one of these firms and the employer wants to \ngive you a raise, they can't do it because it goes against the \ncollective bargaining amount. So this amendment would allow them to do \nthat.\n  That is a brief explanation of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, this amendment is a solution in search \nof a problem. I don't know--have any of my colleagues here had \nunionized businesses come to them complaining that they can't give a \nraise? Have any of my colleagues ever heard of that--they have \ncomplained they can't give a raise?\n  The fact is collective bargaining agreements already provide--many of \nthem--for merit-based performance increases. That is part and parcel of \na lot of the agreements today. So what this amendment basically does is \nit undercuts the National Labor Relations Act. That is exactly what it \ndoes. If you think we should do away with the National Labor Relations \nAct and all the benefits and all the protections it has both for \nbusinesses and for workers, this is your amendment right here. Quite \nfrankly, I can't think of anything that would be more disruptive of a \nworkplace than this amendment. When a business and workers have agreed \non a collective bargaining agreement, this would destroy that kind of \ncomity in the workplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I disagree. And I know we are now going \nto vote on this matter, so I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on the engrossment and \nthird reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\n                              2501 Program\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I have filed an amendment \nrelating to the Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program \nthat I would like to bring to Senator Stabenow's attention.\n  As the Senator knows, the Outreach and Assistance to Socially \nDisadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program, also known as the ``2501 \nProgram,'' helps our Nation's historically underserved producers gain \naccess to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's credit, commodity, \nconservation, and other programs and services.\n  The program provides competitive grants to educational institutions, \nagriculture extension offices, and community-based organizations to \nassist African-American, Native American, Asian-American, and Latino \nfarmers and ranchers in owning and operating farms and participating in \nUSDA programs. The Outreach and Assistance to Socially Disadvantaged \nFarmers and Ranchers Program has served more than 100,000 rural \nconstituents in over 400 counties and more than 35 States.\n  In my State many farmers and ranchers have benefited from projects \nfunded through the 2501 Program.\n  I will just mention a few.\n  The New Mexico Acequia Association uses a 2501 grant to improve the \nsustainability and economic viability of small-scale agriculture among \nthe farmers and ranchers who are part of the historic acequias and \ncommunity ditches in New Mexico. With this funding the association \nsupports centuries-old irrigation systems and agricultural traditions.\n  The Northern New Mexico Outreach Project, run by the New Mexico State \nUniversity Cooperative Extension Service, is also working in my State \nto develop an education network system between northern New Mexico \nHispanic and American Indian farmers and ranchers.\n  And with the help of 2501 funding, the Taos County Economic \nDevelopment Corporation is revitalizing ranching and farming traditions \nthat support the cultures of the area, utilizing new technologies and \nmarketing opportunities.\n  Thanks to the efforts of the committee, the Socially Disadvantaged \nFarmers and Ranchers Program can now also extend benefits to veterans.\n  My amendment would have provided additional funds to support the \ntraditional and new constituencies of the program by increasing direct \nfunding for the program to $150 million over 5 years.\n  It would continue assistance to disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. \nAnd ensure that veterans are fully able to benefit from the program.\n  The committee mark of the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of \n2012 includes $5 million in annual mandatory funds for the Socially \nDisadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program and $20 million in annual \ndiscretionary funds for the program.\n  I hope that the Senator and her committee will work with me and with \nthe Appropriations Committee to ensure adequate funding is allocated to \nthe 2501 Program through the Appropriations process in the coming \nyears.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I want to begin by thanking the Senator from New Mexico \nfor his thoughtful work on this issue. This is an important program, \nand I commend the Senator for offering his amendment. As we move \nforward, I am happy to work with the Senator to engage the \nAppropriations Committee to provide adequate annual funding for the \nprogram in the coming years.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator. I am certain she is \naware that the USDA's Office of Inspector General released a \npreliminary audit report in May finding a level of mismanagement of the \n2501 Program within the Office of Advocacy and Outreach, or OAO. The \nreport found that OAO officials had not adhered to the agency's draft \npolicies and procedures and did not carry out proper documentation \nduring the selection of 2012 grant recipients.\n  The OAO has had an immediate and deliberate response to the report. \nThe previous manager of the Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers \nOutreach Program has been replaced, the office is putting in a more \nlong-term staff, and the 2012 applicants and grant recipients are being \nreevaluated.\n  As the Senator knows, the 2501 Program is vital to ensuring that \nhistorically underserved farmers and ranchers have access to USDA \nprograms. And, with the new mission to also serve veteran farmers and \nranchers, it is more important than ever that the outreach program be \nproperly administered.\n  I look forward to working with the Chairwoman and the committee in \nits oversight role to ensure that the Outreach and Assistance to \nSocially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program is properly and \neffectively administered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I, too, am concerned by the recent administration of \nthe program, and I thank the Senator for addressing some of those \nissues in his amendment. I am hopeful that the positive steps already \ntaken by the Office of Advocacy and Outreach will ensure the 2501 \nProgram's continued success. I know that the Senator will continue to \nmonitor this situation closely, and I look forward to working with him \nto ensure that the office fully complies with the recommendations of \nthe OIG report and that the most qualified applicants are awarded \ngrants.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator. In closing, I would \nlike to thank the Senator, the members of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, and dedicated staff for all of the efforts to negotiate a \ngood farm bill, one that provides significant savings and eliminates \nantiquated subsidies but seeks to ensure a sound future for agriculture \nand access to healthy food for families across the Nation.\n  Madam President, I rise today to discuss the farm bill. First, I wish \nto thank Senator Stabenow and Senator Roberts for their efforts in \ncrafting a bill that will strengthen our agricultural and rural economy \nas well as one which reflects fiscal realities. Chairwoman Stabenow and \nRanking Member Roberts reached across the aisle. They relied on common \nsense and they found common ground, with compromise and with a focus on \nresults. They, and the members of the Agriculture Committee, worked \ntogether and created this bipartisan legislation.\n  We all know how important this bill is for the 16 million Americans \nwhose jobs are in agriculture and for the consumers who depend on safe, \naffordable food. It is also important for the families who need \nnutritional assistance and for the prudent stewardship of our lands. \nThe importance of this legislation cannot be understated.\n  Like so many New Mexicans, farming and ranching are in my blood. My \ngrandmother drove cattle through New Mexico in the late 1800s. Ranching \nand farming is a part of my heritage, and of New Mexico's. And it is \nvital to our economy. More than 20,000 farms are in New Mexico.\n  The people in my State know that ranching and farming is hard work. \nThe only thing one can count on is uncertainty. It is a uniquely risky \nbusiness, vulnerable to calamities of weather, subject to global \nfluctuations in prices and unfair competition. But, American \nagriculture is the world's leader. It is second to none. It is crucial \nto our economy and to our national security.\n  This legislation is truly a reform bill. It is the most significant \nreform of our agriculture policy in decades. For years, Congress has \nreauthorized confusing and inequitable farm subsidies, and the public \nlooked on in wonder. The subsidies have in some part helped to keep \nsectors of US Agriculture vibrant, but, there have been blatant \ninefficiencies and waste. The rules surrounding direct payments is one \nexample. Such rules do not even require that the recipient grow the \ncovered commodity to receive their payment. The result is an \ninequitable flow of Federal funds. This hinders new producers and short \nchanges producers who were not lucky enough to own ``base acres'' when \nthey were identified in the 1980s.\n  For decades, farm bills have come and gone without the subsidy \nreforms Americans have been calling for. But Chairman Stabenow and \nRanking Member Roberts have taken that unprecedented bold step. Their \nbill ends direct payments and other major subsidies once and for all.\n  The 2012 Senate farm bill offers a more equitable insurance that \nproducers buy into. It is not mandatory, but it is a sound safety net \nthat will support American producers.\n  Chairman Stabenow and Ranking Member Roberts also set new precedent \nin turning more attention to\n\n[[Page S4391]]\n\ncrops historically left on the sidelines. Their bill boldly supports \nfruits, vegetables, nuts and other products so important to creating \nhealthy living. The bill promotes access to nutritious food through \nfarmers markets and locally grown produce. And it strengthens specialty \ncrop provisions. My State is justly famous for its green chile. This \nbill will help chile and other specialty crops find export markets. And \nit provides for more research to keep these crops vibrant and \ncompetitive.\n  This legislation will create a more even playing field for dairy \nfarmers, providing a safety net that has no regional or size bias. The \nbill also continues essential support for livestock producers. In my \nState, ranchers face grave threats from severe drought and fires and \nfrom the continued loss of grazing lands.\n  This farm bill streamlines and consolidates programs and it reduces \nthe deficit by over $23 billion. Let me repeat: $23 billion in deficit \nreduction. That is twice the amount recommended by the Simpson-Bowles \ncommission.\n  This is a strong bill overall. It is not perfect. It consolidates and \nsimplifies conservation programs. But, unfortunately, there are \nsignificant cuts in funding. There are cuts in programs that protect \nwatersheds, grasslands, soil, and habitats. These are programs that \nproducers depend on. There are cuts in programs to restore forage, \nensure compliance with environmental laws, and maintain healthy soil. \nIt is truly unfortunate to lose such vital funding.\n  The farm bill covers a very large canvas and addresses many diverse \nneeds. There will be, and should be, healthy debate.\n  I want to speak today about three specific amendments that I believe \nwill improve this bill.\n  First, I have filed an amendment to restore mandatory funds for the \nOutreach and Assistance to Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers \nProgram. Thanks to the efforts of the committee, this program can now \nextend benefits to veterans. My amendment would ensure that the \nnecessary funds are there. This program has helped our Nation's \nhistorically underserved producers for over 20 years by providing \nbetter access to Department of Agriculture credit, commodity, and \nconservation services and by providing technical assistance. It has \nworked and it deserves continued support.\n  The Outreach and Assistance to Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and \nRanchers Program has served more than 100,000 rural constituents in \nover 400 counties and more than 35 States. With adequate funding, it \ncan also provide critical support for veteran farmers and ranchers.\n  Specifically, my amendment would restore direct funding to $150 \nmillion over 5 years.\n  It would continue assistance to disadvantaged farmers and ranchers \nand ensure that veterans are fully able to benefit from the program.\n  Second, I have proposed an amendment for rural development funding \nfor frontier communities. Across our Nation, including in my home \nState, there are many very small, very rural communities with a \npopulation density of less than 20 people per square mile. These are \ngreat communities, proud communities, with rich histories. But, they \nhave a hard time competing for rural development loans and grants. \nOften, they don't have the personnel. They don't have the resources. \nBut, their need is just as great as that of larger communities.\n  My amendment would create a setaside for frontier communities \nallowing them to access USDA funds targeted for these very small, very \nrural communities. It would allow the USDA to reach our Nation's most \nrural and underserved communities. The setaside would be a minimum of \npercent of rural development programs and it would allow frontier \ncommunities to qualify for up to 100 percent grant funding, with no \nminimum grant or loan requirement.\n  My amendment would also create a grant program for technical \nassistance and planning for frontier communities, making sure that \nfunding goes as far as possible. Financing for this program would be \nfrom overall rural development funding of no more than 5 percent.\n  And, third, I have filed an amendment for a rural development \nsetaside for community land grants. These land grant Mercedes are part \nof a unique and important history in the southwest dating back to the \ntreaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. These were grants of land made by the \ngovernments of Spain or Mexico to entire communities.\n  These community land grants have a history of loss of land, a history \nof manipulation and unkept commitments, and a recognized need for \nincreased economic opportunities. My amendment proposes to respond to \nthis unfortunate history. Rural development assistance is crucial to \nthese unique communities.\n  I wish to again commend my colleagues for this bipartisan \nlegislation. It will continue building our economy by providing jobs \nand by providing the certainty that producers need for innovation and \ngrowth and by providing for the safest, healthiest, and most abundant \nfood supply in the world.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise to support and encourage passage of \nthis farm bill.\n  Farm bills are difficult measures to shepherd through this chamber. \nThere has never been--and never will--be a `perfect' one in the eyes of \nevery Member of this body. But American agriculture needs a new farm \nbill and this one deserves our support for a variety of reasons.\n  For starters, it delivers over $23 billion dollars in savings at time \nwhen our Nation's balance sheet needs it most.\n  It improves nutrition programs by curbing fraud and improving program \nintegrity. Hungry Americans--many of whom are children--need a food \nsafety net when times are tough. These changes support that safety net \nand deliver more accountability to taxpayers.\n  This bill also responds to concerns articulated by dairy farmers who \nare hugely important to me and to Wisconsin. Long-time farm policy \nobservers know of my enduring interest in dairy policy. The MILC \nprogram, which I co-authored with several of my colleagues in this \nchamber, was the first comprehensive safety net for American dairy \nproducers. It provided payments in time of low prices and cost the \ngovernment nothing when we had robust dairy prices. Dairy farmers today \nface new and different challenges. In recent years they have seen \nsituations where, despite robust milk prices, their input prices \ndramatically escalated and their margins evaporated. The dairy policy \nembodied in this bill recognizes that challenge and establishes margin \nprotection insurance. Participants will be given the option to choose \nthe level of margin protection that makes the most sense for their \ndairy operations.\n  I supported a number of amendments to this farm bill. Among them were \nmodifications to enhance rural development and programs for beginning \nfarmers. Farm bills touch our Nation in many different ways, and these \nare two areas that merit more attention and continued diligence. I also \nopposed a number of amendments because I feared they would undermine \nagriculture exports, our ability to innovate, and our organic \nagriculture sector.\n  Finally, I want to congratulate the chair and ranking member of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee for their diligent work. It takes an \nenormous amount of effort to move a farm bill. They worked hard to find \nconsensus and deserve our thanks. I also want to acknowledge with \nthanks their staff, including Cory Claussen and Jonathan Coppess of the \nmajority and Eric Steiner from the Republican staff. They worked very \nhard on a variety of topics, including the dairy provisions.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I support passage of the 2012 farm bill, \nS. 3240, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012.\n  I have made it a priority to keep Pennsylvania's agricultural \nindustry and our rural economies strong to support Pennsylvanian \nfamilies.\n  Agriculture is the Commonwealth's largest industry. Pennsylvania's \nfarm gate value that is cash receipts to growers, in 2010, was $5.7 \nbillion. Agribusiness in Pennsylvania is a $46.4 billion industry, and \n17.5 percent of Pennsylvanians are employed in the food and fiber \nsystem. What does this mean?\n  It means that the Senate MUST pass this farm bill, that the House \nmust pass a farm bill, and that the President\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\nmust sign a farm bill into law before it expires at the end of \nSeptember.\n  The farm bill creates economic opportunities in our rural areas and \nsustains the consumers and businesses that rely on our rural economy. \nWhen the cows need to be milked, dairy farmers go out to the barn and \ndo their jobs. We should follow their example and reauthorize the farm \nbill in a responsible way that helps contribute to deficit reduction.\n  If passed into law, this farm bill would reduce the deficit by \napproximately $23 billion through the elimination of some subsidies, \nthe consolidation of programs, and producing greater efficiencies in \nprogram delivery.\n  Dairy is the Commonwealth's No. 1 agricultural sector. The dairy \nindustry annually generates more than $1.6 billion in on-farm cash \nreceipts, which represent about 42 percent of Pennsylvania's total \nagricultural receipts.\n  I introduced two dairy bills this Congress: the Federal Milk \nMarketing Improvement Act, S. 1640, and the Dairy Advancement Act, S. \n1682. These bills are aimed to ensure that farmers receive a fair price \nfor their milk to increase price transparency, to protect against price \nvolatility, and to encourage processor innovation.\n  I am concerned that while the proposed dairy program to manage the \nNation's milk supply will reduce the volatility of dairy farming, that \nprogram will discourage innovation and exports, as well as send the \nwrong signals to our trading partners.\n  I secured language which requires USDA to thoroughly examine if the \ndairy market stabilization program is working, and if it is not \nworking, make recommendations on how to fix it. This bill also contains \nmy amendment to codify the frequency of dairy product reporting that is \nimportant for the dairy industry to make business decisions. It would \nalso require USDA to examine whether it would be practical to move to a \ntwo-class system for milk that could help to simplify the Federal milk \nmarketing orders.\n  Dairy farmers deserve the best dairy program possible. The Senate \nbill contains many improvements that I support.\n  Making risk management and crop insurance products work better for \nPennsylvanians, especially small farmers, specialty crop farmers, and \norganic farmers is very important.\n  This bill contains language similar to an amendment that I offered \nduring the Agriculture Committee's markup that would help to improve \ncrop insurance for organic farmers.\n  Providing funding through risk management, conservation, and \nagricultural marketing agencies to underserved States, the Agricultural \nManagement Assistance, AMA, Program helps to make the farm bill more \nequitable among regions.\n  I sincerely appreciate the chairwoman's and ranking member's work to \nenhance the Agricultural Management Assistance Program, including \nsupport for organic transition assistance.\n  The improvements in this bill to crop insurance delivery are \ncritical.\n  We have worked to address the unique concerns of specialty crop \nfarmers and beginning farmers--and we have done so in a bipartisan way.\n  Specialty crops are very important to Pennsylvanian agriculture.\n  After working with the chairwoman and ranking member, I was able to \nensure improvements in promotion programs within the farm bill and \ndirect USDA to assess the feasibility of allowing organic producers to \nparticipate in an organic foods promotion program.\n  The Specialty Crops Research Initiative, SCRI, Specialty Crops Block \nGrant Program, and Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program all advance \nthe specialty crops industry, playing a key role in ensuring that this \nimportant agricultural sector receives continued acknowledgement in the \nfarm bill. These programs remain strong under this bill.\n  In addition, the Nation's organic industry has grown exponentially \nfrom $3.6 billion in 1997 to $29 billion in 2010, with an annual growth \nrate of 19 percent from 1997 to 2008. In 2008, Pennsylvania was ranked \nsixth in number of organic farms with 586 and third in sales at $212.7 \nmillion.\n  Through research, we develop more efficient and effective farming \nmethods. Research also helps producers maintain a competitive edge in \nthe global market by fighting threatening diseases and pests.\n  I am pleased that the farm bill invests in relevant and targeted \nresearch and maintains the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \nprograms that work to eradicate the invasive species that threaten our \nNation's forests and farms.\n  The U.S. Forest Service's State and private forestry programs are \nessential for assisting forest landowners in managing threats and \nenhancing stewardship. I am pleased that the farm bill continues the \nForest Stewardship Program, FSP, so that forest owners can create long-\nterm management plans with the technical assistance of State forestry \nagency partners.\n  I am also grateful to the chairwoman and ranking member for working \nwith me to fix USDA's Biopreferred Program to even the playing field \nfor Pennsylvanian forestry products. Revenues from Pennsylvania's \nforest products industry exceed $5.5 billion annually. Over 10 percent \nof the State's manufacturing workforce is involved in the forest \nproducts industry.\n  I am appreciative to the committee for the inclusion of my provision \ndirecting USDA to work with the Food and Drug Administration toward the \ndevelopment of a standard of identity for honey, a tool which will \npromote honesty and fair dealing and serve the interest of consumers \nand Pennsylvania's honey industry. The majority of our honey is \nimported, but because there is no standard, contaminated, low-quality \nhoney continues to pass through customs and undercut our domestic \nproduct. Pennsylvania is a major player in the honey industry. Honey \nbee pollination can be directly attributed to the production of about \n$60 million of agricultural produce in Pennsylvania annually.\n  I am committed to keeping Pennsylvania's rural communities strong and \nsupport rural development programs that provide access to capital for \nrural businesses to provide economic opportunities and create jobs. A \nrural community's viability in attracting and keeping businesses is \noften directly related to the condition of its infrastructure and \nfacilities. USDA's rural development programs empower rural \ncommunities, transform local economies, and preserve the quality of \nlife in small towns across the Commonwealth. A rural economic \ndevelopment program that saves and creates jobs in rural economies and \nimproves rural life is extremely important for Pennsylvanian families.\n  I introduced the Growing Opportunities for Agriculture and Responding \nto Markets, GO FARM, Act, which will help to enhance local food systems \nand encourage production of food for local communities. The GO FARM Act \nwould provide loans to third parties to lend to producers growing \nproducts for local markets. In addition to the GO FARM Act, I support \nincreasing the availability of healthy foods, addressing the issue of \nfood deserts and developing and improving local food systems.\n  Farmers are the original stewards of the land and continue to lead \nthe charge in protecting our natural resources. I believe the voluntary \nconservation programs in the farm bill provide important tools to help \nfarmers comply with Federal and State regulations while keeping farmers \nin business. I am committed to making conservation programs more \nefficient, effective, and relevant to farmers.\n  Conservation programs are an extremely important resource for many \nPennsylvanian farmers. I worked with my Senate colleagues to support \nenhancements to conservation programs through this process in an effort \nto ensure that these remodeled programs would better serve the needs of \nPennsylvanians.\n  Pennsylvania's watersheds contribute more than half of the fresh \nwater flowing to the Chesapeake Bay. While Pennsylvania does not border \nthe bay, activities in the Commonwealth profoundly affect the bay's \nhealth. The bay, the largest estuarine ecosystem in the U.S., and its \ntributaries, such as Susquehanna and Potomac Rivers, are important to \nthe region's economy, culture, and outdoor recreation.\n  Under the 2008 farm bill, the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Initiative, \nCBWI, provided essential support to farmers facing Federal and state \nregulations\n\n[[Page S4393]]\n\nconcerning water quality and helped to meet demand for conservation \nprograms. In advance of the Agriculture Committee's consideration of \nthe 2012 farm bill, I introduced the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Fairness \nAct, which among other things reauthorized the CBWI, because I know \nPennsylvania farmers used this program very well.\n  I am grateful that the 2012 farm bill contains portions of this \nlegislation which are aimed at equipping farmers with the tools \nnecessary to better meet water quality goals. However, in this bill, \nCBWI is not continued. Due to the committee's desire to reduce the \nnumber of conservation programs, the farm bill consolidates four \ndifferent programs into one that will provide competitive funds to \nregional partnerships and will also provide conservation funding \ndirectly to producers. CBWI was one of the programs that got folded \ninto this new program.\n  I worked very closely with other Senators from the watershed to \nstrengthen the conservation title to better benefit our region. \nTogether we secured significant policy improvements. The current bill \nfocuses on the most critical conservation areas and will help farmers \nin the Chesapeake Bay watershed participate in conservation programs so \nthat they can help the region meet water quality standards.\n  Pennsylvania's agricultural producers and forestland owners use the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, to implement \nconservation practices, which might otherwise be cost prohibitive, to \nprotect valuable natural resources.\n  Further, the Farmland Protection Program, FPP, protects prime \nfarmland from development. FPP should remain a permanent easement \nprogram to keep working lands preserved as farm land; should keep \nState, local governments, and nongovernmental organizations as \npartners; and should certify successful entities like the Pennsylvania \nDepartment of Agriculture's Bureau of Farmland Protection to improve \nthe efficiency of this program. We worked very hard to make \nimprovements to FPP during the last farm bill and those developments \ncontinue.\n  While I do not mention all of the farm bill conservation programs, I \ndo believe that each serves an important purpose.\n  Ending hunger remains one of my top priorities, as it cuts across all \nof the major challenges we face as a country. There is no better \nopportunity to strengthen nutrition policy and programs than through a \nwell-crafted farm bill.\n  The Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, SNAP, is the Federal \nGovernment's primary response to the food insecurity experienced by so \nmany people. SNAP is an integral part of the overall safety net, which \nenables people to get back on their feet.\n  Similarly, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, TEFAP, enables food \nbanks, shelters, and other providers to deliver necessary food packages \nand meals to people with emergency food needs. The Senior Farmers' \nMarket Nutrition Program and the Commodity Supplemental Food Program \nalso provide vital food resources to low-income seniors who are often \nnot helped by other food assistance programs. I support these programs \nas they assist the most vulnerable of our society--children, seniors, \nand families experiencing food insecurity.\n  As Congress works to authorize the 2012 farm bill, I will continue to \nfight to protect the needs of Pennsylvanians.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this farm bill.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act \nof 2012, also known as the farm bill, makes some strides in reforming \nagriculture policy and subsidies. However, in my view, these reforms \nare not sufficient. Moreover, the bill contains cuts to nutrition and \nconservation programs and changes to eligibility for rural communities \nthat when taken together make it worse than current law. As such, I \nwill oppose the bill, although I do so reluctantly.\n  Indeed, despite my conclusions, I commend Chairwoman Stabenow for \ncrafting a bill that delivers $23.6 billion in taxpayer savings over 10 \nyears, cracks down on abuse, and eliminates egregious payments to \nnonfarmers, millionaire farmers, and farmers for crops they aren't \ngrowing.\n  The bill also makes several positive changes to programs important to \nmy home State of Rhode Island that help small farms, farmers markets, \nand local food production. Rhode Island is a model example of the small \nand local farm movement. Since 2002, the number of farms has increased \nfrom 858 to 1,220 farms, whereas the average farm size in the State has \nactually decreased from 71 to 56 acres. That is why I am pleased that \nthe bill includes many measures from Senator Sherrod Brown's Local \nFarms, Food and Jobs Act that I cosponsored and increased funding for \nspecialty crop block grants to support research and promotion of \nfruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops.\n  The bill also initiates new hunger-free communities incentive grants \nby providing funding of $100 million over 5 years for a national pilot \nto incentivize the purchase of fruits and vegetables at farmers markets \nby SNAP participants. A similar privately funded program has already \nbeen successfully implemented in Rhode Island where every $5 in SNAP \nbenefits spent at a farmers market allows low-income individuals to \nreceive an additional $2 in fruits and vegetables. It is good to see \nthe ingenuity of our States replicated at the national level in ways to \nhelp low-income families have access to nutritious local foods.\n  Another positive measure is the enhancement of the Farmers Market and \nLocal Food Promotion Program to aid direct producer-to-consumer \nmarketing channels and local food sales to retailers and institutions. \nThe bill also doubles mandatory funding for this program.\n  However, as a recent Washington Post editorial stated, ``The current \nbill achieves some reform. There is still much more to be done.''\n  While the current bill cuts direct payments by $44.6 billion, it \nrestores $28.5 billion of those cuts by creating a new market-based \nprogram called Agriculture Risk Coverage and adds an additional $5 \nbillion for crop insurance.\n  Indeed, many of the reform measures in the bill do not go as far as \nthose in the Lugar-Lautenberg Fresh Act of 2007, which I cosponsored \nduring the last farm bill debate.\n  At the time, that measure would have increased funding by $2.5 \nbillion for nutrition programs, SNAP, and specialty crops, and $1 \nbillion more for conservation programs. In contrast, the Senate bill we \nare currently debating cuts SNAP by $4.5 billion and conservation \nprograms by $6.4 billion.\n  The nutrition cuts are particularly challenging for Rhode Island, \nwhere roughly 1 in 6 people receives SNAP benefits and the unemployment \nrate remains at a too-high rate of 11 percent, the second highest in \nthe country.\n  SNAP usage is unfortunately very high right now as Americans are \nstruggling along with the economy to get back on track. No one wants to \nsee such a high need, but at the same time SNAP assistance is the \nlifeline for these families to be able to put food on the table. My \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle shouldn't be trying to cut \nthese funds; they should be working with us instead of thwarting our \nefforts to pass meaningful jobs bills that could help many of these \nSNAP beneficiaries find work and lessen their need for assistance.\n  That is why I cosponsored and voted in favor of Senator Gillibrand's \namendment that would have restored the nutrition cuts, which the \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates would result in an average \nbenefit cut of $90 per month for 500,000 households nationwide. \nAccording to RI Department of Human Services, approximately 20,000 \nhouseholds could see an average SNAP cut of $95 per month if the cuts \nwere implemented.\n  The Gillibrand amendment was paid for by reducing the subsidies that \nthe Federal Government pays the crop insurance companies for \nadministration and operating expenses and lowering their guaranteed \nrate of return from their current level of 14 percent to 12 percent. \nThat is certainly a reasonable rate of return in this economy.\n  I was very disappointed that this amendment was not agreed to as this \nproposed cut of $4.5 billion starts us down the wrong path in future \nfarm bill negotiations with the House, which is expected to have even \ndeeper SNAP cuts in their bill.\n\n[[Page S4394]]\n\n  Another provision I am concerned could negatively impact Rhode Island \nis the change in the definition of rural that could decrease the \neligibility for Rhode Island communities to be able to apply for loans \nand grants under Rural Development programs. I appreciate Chairman \nStabenow and Ranking Member Roberts working with Members from affected \nStates to include in the managers' package a 3-year grandfathering of \nexisting communities and an important stipulation that thereafter \ncommunities shall remain eligible unless ruled otherwise by the \nSecretary of Agriculture. However, the change in the definition does \nnot completely remove the uncertainty for Rhode Island rural \ncommunities to be eligible in the future as they look to make needed \nimprovements to their water and waste disposal systems or community \nfacilities.\n  We need to help out the small farmers and businesses in this country, \nnot continue to help the large, wealthy farmers. And we certainly \nshould not pay for expansive farm programs by placing additional \nburdens on those who are struggling to make ends meet.\n  It is for these reasons that I am unable to support this bill in its \ncurrent form. While I fear the bill will only get worse as negotiations \nbegin with the House, I certainly hope the matters that I have raised \ncan be addressed during that process.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am pleased to vote for passage of the Agriculture \nReform, Food and Jobs Act. The bill before us makes important reforms \nto farm programs by helping agricultural producers manage their risk, \ninvests funding to protect our natural resources, and provides food \nassistance to families in need.\n  America's agricultural economy is responsible for 16 million jobs. \nThere are over 2 million farms in this country that contribute nearly \n$80 billion to the Nation's economy. Americans and people all over the \nworld depend on America's farms to feed their families. So passage of a \nfarm bill that protects the food supply, gives farmers the support they \nneed, and combats hunger is of high importance.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Stabenow, the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee and my Michigan colleague, for managing this \nimportant legislation so skillfully.\n  This bill marks important change in how we assist our Nation's \nfarmers. Instead of making direct and countercyclical payments to \nfarmers, sometimes for crops they haven't even grown, this bill ends \nthose practices and instead focuses on working with farmers to manage \nrisks.\n  My home State of Michigan is second only to California in the number \nof crops grown and second to none in tart cherry production. Unusually \nwarm weather in March resulted in an early bloom for many of our fruit \ncrops, including tart cherries. These crops were then heavily damaged \nby a series of freezes during April and May.\n  I visited a cherry orchard in northern Michigan last month and viewed \nthe damage. The damage from these freezes is severe; many trees and \nentire orchards will bear no fruit at all. Growers still need to \nmaintain their orchards, spraying for bugs and disease, but can expect \nno payment for their crop. I am particularly concerned about tart \ncherry growers as they cannot currently purchase crop insurance.\n  The bill we are voting on today directs the Federal Crop Insurance \nCorporation Board to develop new crop insurance policies for \nunderserved crops, including specialty crops like cherries. The bill \nalso increases funding to help develop these policies. These new \npolicies are sorely needed in Michigan.\n  The bill also includes $58 billion over a 10-year period for \nconservation programs that protect our Nation's waters, soil quality \nand wildlife habitats, prevent erosion, and help alleviate other \nnatural resource problems. These programs have benefitted Michigan by \nprotecting sensitive lands and waters and preventing polluted runoff \nand sediments from getting into our precious Great Lakes, where they \ncan create problems such as harmful algae blooms. Preventing runoff and \ncontrolling erosion can also lower costs for water treatment and \ndredging of Great Lakes harbors. To create a more efficient system for \naccessing and implementing these conservation programs, the bill \nconsolidates more than 20 existing programs into 10 programs.\n  One new program in the bill, the Regional Conservation Partnership \nProgram, in particular could benefit the Great Lakes. This program \nwould provide funding through a competitive process for conservation \nprojects that improve soil quality, water quality or quantity, or \nwildlife habitats on a regional or watershed scale. Because the Great \nLakes region already has a regional plan in place, our region should be \nable to effectively compete for the $250 million in annual funding that \nwould be provided for this program. We have made some solid progress in \ncleaning up our Great Lakes and other waters in Michigan, but there is \nstill much more to be done. The conservation funding provided in the \nfarm bill would help with the efforts to protect and restore the Great \nLakes, as well as protect sensitive lands and wildlife, conserve open \nspace and forests, and provide economic benefits.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as is evident from the amount of debate \nand attention devoted to it, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act \nof 2012 is an enormously important piece of legislation for our Nation, \nas it certainly is for my State of Iowa. Although the measure is \ncommonly referred to as the farm bill, that name captures just a \nfraction of what it contains to benefit all Americans and millions of \nothers around the world.\n  Despite the severe economic challenges over the past half decade, \nagriculture and agriculture-related jobs and economic activity have \nbeen a real source of hope, opportunity, and recovery. That is \nespecially so in my State, where agriculture generates about one of \nevery five Iowa jobs and about a fourth of our State's economic output.\n  Iowa is well known, of course, for its distinctive farm state and \nsmalltown character and for producing corn, soybeans, hogs, cattle, \neggs, and other commodities. We have enjoyed tremendous benefits from \ngreater diversification in agriculture and the rural economy. Take for \nexample the boom in biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel and in wind \npower.\n  It is critical for us to enact this bill in order to continue and \nenhance the contributions of agriculture and agriculture-related \nindustries to our Nation's economy, to jobs, and to meeting ever-\ngrowing global demands for food, fiber, and energy.\n  I commend Chairwoman Stabenow and Senator Roberts, the ranking \nRepublican member, for all of their hard, conscientious, and successful \nwork on this bill. I also thank them for their efforts to take into \naccount and reflect in this bill the circumstances, views, and needs of \nboth rural and urban America as well as the various regions and types \nof agriculture across our Nation. I certainly appreciate their task. \nThis is the eighth farm bill I have worked to enact, starting as a \nmember of the House Agriculture Committee. Since 1985 I have served on \nthe Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee and am proud \nto have been the chairman of that committee during the writing and \nenactment of the most recent two farm bills.\n  This legislation, approved by our committee in April, is a sound, \nbalanced, and bipartisan bill crafted under budget conditions that have \nnecessitated difficult decisions, judgments, and compromises. According \nto scoring by the Congressional Budget Office, this measure will reduce \nspending over the next 10 fiscal years by more than $23 billion from \nbudget baseline levels.\n  The spending reductions in programs encompassed in this bill thus \nappear to be several billion dollars larger than the automatic spending \ncuts slated to begin in January of next year under the sequestration \nmechanism in the Budget Control Act of 2011. Hence, this farm bill is a \nserious, good-faith effort going significantly beyond the minimum to \nreduce our budget deficits and curtail our Nation's debt. Again, these \nspending reductions will have very real impacts, and frankly I regret \nthem and their consequences. We are not as a Nation investing too much \nin the future of our Nation's agriculture and food system, in fighting \nhunger and malnutrition, in conserving our Nation's soil, water, and \nother resources for future generations, in securing our future with \nrenewable energy and biobased materials, or in strengthening and \ngrowing jobs in our Nation's small towns and rural communities. \nUnquestionably, because of our Federal budget\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\nsituation and choices that have been made in dealing with it, there is \nless money to respond to national needs and priorities in the Federal \npolicies and programs covered in this bill.\n  Given the budgetary hand dealt it, the Agriculture Committee, with \nthe bipartisan leadership of our Chairwoman and Ranking Member, \nreported a bill combining budget savings with genuine reforms \nthroughout its various titles. The most significant reform--in fact, \npivotal reform--lies in the substantial changes in the commodity and \nfarm income protection programs.\n  To help farm families and rural communities survive and manage the \ninevitable vagaries of weather and markets, the new farm bill continues \na strong system ensuring a degree of stability and protecting against \nsignificant losses in farm income. The legislation contains major \nreform in terminating the existing direct and countercyclical Payments \nProgram and replacing it with the Agriculture Risk Coverage, or ARC, \nprogram. ARC is designed to compensate for a portion of farm revenue \nlosses and to supplement the revenue insurance policies that farmers \ntypically rely upon to manage risk.\n  Because farm income protection based on revenue accounts for the fact \nthat farm income is the product of crop yield times its price in the \nmarket, ARC is an improvement over the direct and countercyclical \npayments program in current law. Direct payments are made in fixed \namounts according to each farm's base acreage and program payment \nyields, which in general were established decades ago. Consequently, \nthe direct payments do not accurately reflect or respond to existing \neconomic circumstances in agriculture because they are made without \nregard to a farm's current planted acres of crops or to whether crop \nprices and yields are high or low. The existing countercyclical payment \nprogram compensates for a portion of losses when the national average \nprice of a covered commodity falls below a statutory target price. But \nthe countercyclical program's target prices are well below current \nmarket prices and costs of production for commodities, and of course, a \nprice-based system does not account for yield losses.\n  Agricultural producers have been divided over the direct payments \nsince they were adopted in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \nReform Act of 1996 as a replacement for the then-existing target price \nincome protection system. Supporters of direct payments note that they \nare considered not to be production or trade distorting and that they \nprovide income assistance to farmers who may not benefit much from \nother commodity programs or crop insurance.\n  From their beginning, I believed that the direct payments were not \nsound policy. Within a few years, after they were enacted during a \nperiod of strong commodity prices, the direct payments proved \ninadequate to protect farm income in the face of a sharp falloff in \ncommodity prices, and so we had to resort to enacting ad hoc emergency \nlegislation to make up for the shortcomings of the direct payments.\n  To restore better protection against farm income losses, I introduced \nlegislation in November 2001 to create a new countercyclical target \nrevenue program. As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I was \npleased that we then reinstated a countercyclical income protection \nprogram in the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act. In 2007 and \n2008, with the leadership of Senator Dick Durbin and Senator Sherrod \nBrown, I was pleased that we included the Average Crop Revenue \nElection, or ACRE Program, in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of \n2008. ACRE is, of course, the forerunner of the ARC program in the \npending new farm bill.\n  The reform and evolution reflected in this new farm bill is very \ngreatly facilitated by the significant improvement and strengthening of \nthe Federal Crop Insurance Program. Crop insurance, particularly the \nrevenue policies, are now vitally important to agricultural producers, \ntheir lenders and creditors, and to the rural economy. So it is an \nimportant feature of this bill that it further strengthens and improves \nthe Crop Insurance Program, building upon the Agriculture Risk \nProtection Act of 2000 and additional improvements in the past two farm \nbills.\n  The pending bill also continues a strong conservation title with \nhighly effective programs and funding for them, along with extensive \nreforms, streamlining, and updating of their structure and functioning. \nThe Department of Agriculture's conservation programs have an \noutstanding record of success in helping America's farmers and ranchers \nproduce an abundant supply of food, fiber, and fuel, while conserving \nand protecting our Nation's soil, water, wildlife, and other natural \nresources. Again, I very much regret that budget circumstances have \nimposed spending reductions in the conservation title of this bill. \nThere is far more conservation work to be done and demand for USDA \nconservation assistance than can be met with existing levels of \nfunding. But, as I have noted, these funding reductions are the reality \nfor the crafting of this bill.\n  In the past two farm bills, as chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, I made a very strong push for strengthening the full range \nof USDA conservation programs and for increasing funding to respond to \nthe need and demand for conservation assistance to farmers and ranchers \nacross our Nation. In the 2002 and 2008 farm bills, we very \nsubstantially increased our Federal investment in agricultural \nconservation, building upon successes in preceding farm bills, \nespecially owing to the leadership of the former chairmen of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Leahy and Senator Lugar.\n  For many years, I have emphasized the necessity of promoting and \nassisting sound conservation practices on land in agricultural \nproduction, often referred to as ``working lands''. Agricultural \nproducers are striving to produce much more food in the coming decades \nto nourish billions more inhabitants of the the Earth. If we hope to \nproduce more and more food in the coming years, it is critical to \nconserve the underlying resources that support agricultural production.\n  My objective has been to enact and invest in programs that compensate \nand assist agricultural producers for their costs, foregone income, and \nenvironmental benefits associated with adopting and maintaining \npractices that protect and sustain soil, water, wildlife, and other \nresources. In the 1990 farm bill, the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, \nand Trade Act, we included the Agricultural Water Quality Incentives \nProgram, which I had authored, to provide incentive and cost share \npayments for practices addressing water quality issues in agricultural \nproduction.\n  In the 1996, 2002, and 2008 farm bills, we substantially expanded and \nimproved conservation programs covering land in agricultural \nproduction. I am especially proud of the Conservation Stewardship \nProgram, CSP, which I authored and worked successfully to include in \nthe 2002 farm bill, where it was then named the Conservation Security \nProgram. CSP now has enrolled nearly 50 million acres of agricultural \nland across our Nation, including crop land, pasture land, range land, \nand forest land.\n  CSP and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, both \nfocus on promoting and supporting conservation on land that is in \nagricultural production. They are not land-idling programs. \nAgricultural producers voluntarily enroll in CSP and EQIP because they \nare committed to good stewardship and these programs help them fulfill \nthat commitment. CSP and EQIP also help farmers and ranchers to take \nvoluntary action to solve environmental and conservation challenges and \nthereby avoid regulations. Participants in both programs contribute \ntheir own money, time, and effort, so the Federal funds leverage a \nsignificant amount of added private money. The level of interest in and \ndemand for both EQIP and CSP greatly exceeds the funding now available \nand that which is provided in this bill.\n  To be clear, America's farmers and ranchers have done a tremendous \namount of excellent conservation work. Even so, they know that a good \ndeal more conservation work is needed, and they are dedicated to \ncarrying it out. Providing them assistance through the several USDA \nconservation programs included in this farm bill is a tremendously \nimportant investment in conserving and protecting our Nation's vital \nnatural resources for future generations.\n\n[[Page S4396]]\n\n  This agriculture and food legislation also continues, with reforms \nand spending reductions, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, \nSNAP, and related programs that help low-income families put food on \ntheir tables. No title of this bill is more critical to those who rely \nupon its benefits, nor is any title more important to our Nation in \nmeeting our responsibilities to our fellow citizens. We hear criticisms \nof Federal nutrition assistance, but let us not forget that the vast \nmajority of Americans who receive this help are children, seniors, \npeople with disabilities, or working families. Indeed, recent years \nhave shown how vitally important SNAP and related nutrition assistance \nare to enabling working families and especially the children in these \nfamilies avoid hunger and malnutrition.\n  The reforms in this bill reduce Federal spending by limiting \neligibility and benefits. I regret that our budget circumstances have \nled to this outcome, but again I give credit to Senator Stabenow and \nSenator Roberts for holding these cuts to nutrition to much lower \nlevels than other proposals that have been made, including the budget \nresolution adopted in the House of Representatives. It is also \ngratifying that this body has in recent days rejected several \namendments that would have drastically reduced food assistance for the \nmost vulnerable Americans.\n  Because the nutrition title in this bill is responsibly and carefully \ncrafted, it continues important reforms and improvements that I am \nproud we were able to enact in the most recent two farm bills. In the \n2002 legislation we restored certain benefits for legal immigrants, \nrestored a portion of benefits that had been cut in previous \nlegislation, increased incentives for work, simplified and increased \nintegrity in nutrition assistance, increased emergency food assistance, \ndedicated mandatory funding to the Farmers Market Nutrition Program, \nand adopted a pilot program I authored to provide free fresh fruits and \nvegetables to children in schools. In the 2008 bill we likewise \nincluded key improvements to nutrition assistance, such as further \nrestoring previously cut benefits, encouraging savings by recipients, \nadopting a pilot program of incentives for healthier eating through \nSNAP, improved benefits for families with high childcare costs, \nexpanded the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program to a national program, \ndedicated mandatory funding for community food projects, increased \nmandatory funding for the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program, \nallowed a preference for purchasing locally produced food for child \nnutrition programs, and dedicated mandatory funds to the Farmers Market \nPromotion Program.\n  To promote energy efficiency on farms and in rural businesses and the \nproduction and use of renewable energy and biobased products, this \nlegislation extends, improves, and strengthens programs in the energy \ntitle in the 2002 and 2008 farm bill. I am proud to have included the \nfirst farm bill energy title in the 2002 legislation, to strengthen and \nexpand the energy title in the 2008 bill, and to continue the energy \ntitle as a prominent part of this bill. And thanks to the cooperation \nof Senators Stabenow, Roberts, Lugar, and Conrad, we were able to \ndedicate about $800 million in new funding to these critical energy \ninitiatives in the bill reported from the Agriculture Committee.\n  In March of this year, I introduced S. 2270, the Rural Energy \nInvestment Act of 2012, in order to extend the programs in the energy \ntitles of the 2002 and 2008 farm bills and to provide mandatory funding \nfor the energy title of this new farm bill. So I am very pleased that \nit includes a strong energy title and dedicates mandatory funding to \nit.\n  The bill continues the requirement I authored and we enacted in the \n2002 farm bill for Federal departments and agencies to purchase \nbiobased products and to create a ``BioPreferred'' labeling program to \nencourage private markets for biobased products. Also included in this \nbill are grants to assist pilot-scale biorefineries and loan guarantees \nfor commercial biorefineries.\n  This bill appropriately continues the Biomass Research and \nDevelopment Program, which is a joint initiative of USDA and the \nDepartment of Energy that awards grants for research on the full \nspectrum of bioenergy supply chains, from biomass feedstock development \nand production, to harvesting and handling, to biomass processing and \nfuels or products manufacturing.\n  The Rural Energy for America Program, REAP, the most popular program \nin the energy title because it provides direct financial support to \nmany farmers, ranchers, and rural small businesses for rural energy \nsystems or energy efficiency projects, is also continued. And this bill \nextends the Biomass Crop Assistance Program, BCAP, that supports \nestablishment of biomass crops for bioenergy use and provides cost-\nshare payments for harvest and delivery of biomass to user facilities \nin the initial years.\n  I am also very pleased that the bill continues, improves, and \nstrengthens a number of initiatives that we included in previous farm \nbills to assist and promote opportunities for farmers and good \nnutrition for consumers through farmers markets and increased local \nproduction and marketing of food.\n  In this bill, the Farmers Market Promotion Program is renamed as the \nFarmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program, and it provides \ncompetitively awarded USDA grants to improve and expand farmers \nmarkets, roadside stands, community-supported agriculture marketing, \nand other direct producer-to-consumer marketing, including funding for \nmobile electronic benefits transfer technology. The grants may also be \nused to help develop local systems focused on serving low-income \ncommunities. This bill increases the mandatory funding dedicated to the \nprogram to a total of $100 million.\n  The bill also extends and increases funding for community food \nprojects through grants to nonprofit organizations to be used in \nimproving access to healthy, nutritious food in communities, which can \ninclude assistance to farmers markets and other local food marketing \nsystems. We included $5 million a year in mandatory funding in the 2008 \nfarm bill, and this bill doubles that to $10 million a year.\n  For the Hunger Free Communities Initiative, the bill dedicates $100 \nmillion in new mandatory funding for incentive grants to support \nincreased purchase of fruits and vegetables by families participating \nin SNAP in underserved communities.\n  To help farmers cover the cost of obtaining certification as \nqualified organic producers, the bill includes an increased level of \nmandatory funding, and it continues and funds the organic research and \nextension initiative. Also continued are the program of block grants to \nthe States to assist fruit, vegetable, and horticulture crop producers \nand a special program supporting research projects focused on helping \nthese producers. The bill continues the initiative I was pleased to \ninclude in the 2008 farm bill to provide cost-share assistance through \nEQIP to farmers who are making the transition to organic food \nproduction.\n  Mr. President, these are only some of the important features in this \nnew farm bill. It is a strong bill, with substantial reforms and \ncontinued progress toward improved food, agriculture, conservation, \nenergy, and rural policies for our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on passage of S. \n3240, as amended.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their \npatience and for supporting this bipartisan effort on the agriculture \nreform, food, and jobs bill.\n  I thank Senator Reid for his incredible patience and willingness to \ngive us this time, and the Republican leader for joining in that effort \nas well. I especially thank my ranking member Senator Roberts for long \nhours and hard work on this bill to get to this point. It has been \ntruly a partnership. Senator Roberts is my friend and my partner in \nthis effort, and I am very grateful.\n  I have said all along in this debate that there are 16 million people \nin this country whose jobs depend on the strength of the American \nagricultural economy and our food systems. The agriculture reform bill \nis about standing up for our Nation's farmers, our small businesses, \nour manufacturers, our exporters, and others whose livelihood depends \non us getting the policy right.\n\n[[Page S4397]]\n\n  This represents significant reform. It cuts subsidies, it cuts the \ndeficit, and it creates jobs. We are ending direct payments and three \nother subsidy programs that pay farmers regardless of losses or whether \nthey are even planting a particular crop. We are putting in place the \nmost significant payment reforms ever.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for his tenacity and Senator Johnson for his \npartnership in that effort as well. We are cutting Federal spending by \n$23 billion by streamlining and consolidating programs. Therefore, we \nare going to have an opportunity to vote on $23 billion in deficit \nreduction--probably the only opportunity to vote on debt reduction in a \nbipartisan way on the floor of the Senate in the next number of months.\n  We are eliminating more than 100 authorization programs and \nstreamlining others, strengthening crop insurance, consolidating \nconservation programs and innovative energy programs, and we are \ncontinuing the critical work around nutrition to give temporary help to \nfamilies who have fallen on hard times. We are also creating more \nopportunities for families to buy healthy, local food and the \nopportunity to put fresh fruits and vegetables in our schools and on \nour tables.\n  Agriculture is one of the few parts of our economy where we are \nrunning a trade surplus, and we need to recognize it is also a job \ncreator. The men and women who work hard from sunrise to sunset to give \nus the bounty of safe, nutritious food that we put on our tables \ndeserve the certainty of this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on \na very important bipartisan effort and yes to the 16 million men and \nwomen who bring us the safest, most affordable, most reliable food \nsystem in the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, when you go back home or if you conduct \na press conference or if you have any contact with anybody about what \nwe are doing here in Washington, the No. 1 question is: Why can't you \nall get along? Why can't you quit pointing fingers of blame? Why can't \nyou end the rhetoric? Why can't you work together? Why can't you get \nsomething done?\n  We knew we had something special when we had a farm bill and the \ncurrent farm bill was going to expire and you would go back to a farm \nbill that nobody wanted, or the 1949 act, which is ridiculous, and that \nwe had to move. Farmers and ranchers and their lenders and everybody \nconcerned with agribusiness knew we had to have a farm bill.\n  We went to work and we got a 16-to-5 vote out of committee, it was \nbipartisan, and we did it in 4\\1/2\\ hours. That set a record. I don't \nknow of any time where in an Agriculture Committee, House or Senate, \nthat it has been moved in 4\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Now 2\\1/2\\ days, with 73 amendments, opening it up to everybody \nregardless of circumstance, regardless if they voted for the bill or \nnot? That is what we have accomplished--2\\1/2\\ days, 73 amendments. It \nis what can happen if we break the logjam of partisanship and work \ntogether to get something done. A tremendous amount of credit goes to \nthe leadership of the Senator from Michigan. I feel very privileged to \nhave worked with her and to work with her staff. They have been like \nMusketeers, every night, every morning, meeting: What can we do; how \ncan we fix this?\n  It has worked. So after 2\\1/2\\ days and 73 amendments I thank you all \nfor your patience. If anybody did not get an amendment, I am terribly \nsorry, I don't know how I missed you; consequently, on that side as \nwell.\n  Let me say again, $23 billion provided in deficit reduction through \nreduced mandatory spending. The chairwoman is right, this is probably \nthe only time on the Senate floor we will actually have a reduction in \nFederal spending and make our deficit contribution.\n  This is a good bill. Is it the best possible bill? No, it is the best \nbill possible. We should move it and we should vote for it. I urge you \nto vote for it.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Republican leader and I have spoken \nprivately. We would be remiss if we did not say something to the entire \nSenate about how we feel about this bill and the leadership that was \nshown by these two fine Senators. Also behind the scenes--we know how \nhard they worked to get where we are--we have had such good staff \ninvolved. These staff people are not fighting with each other. They \nhave causes they are trying to protect for their Members but they do it \nin a way that is cordial. There has been nothing but courtesy shown for \nweeks.\n  I have managed quite a few bills in my day. This is a difficult bill \nto have in the position we have it in now. I hope our friends in the \nHouse see what we have done. We are working together. I know they can. \nI cannot say enough--although I will try--to applaud and compliment \nSenator Stabenow and Senator Roberts. They are both my friends but my \nview of them has risen appreciably in their legislative methods of \ngetting this done.\n  They have done it on their own. Senator McConnell and I have done \nwhat we can, but we have been bystanders to much that has gone on. It \nhas been the work of these two fine Senators and the cooperation of \nevery Member. I am grateful we are at the point where we are today--2 \no'clock. We are going to be able to finish this bill and it is 2 \no'clock in the afternoon, not in the morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me echo the remarks of my good friend. This bill \nhas been handled in a way entirely consistent with the norms and \ntraditions of the Senate. Members have had an opportunity to express \nthemselves in a whole variety of ways, both relevant to the amendments \nand a few not relevant to the amendments. Senator Stabenow and Senator \nRoberts have worked together very skillfully. This is one of the finest \nmoments in the Senate in recent times in terms of how you pass a bill.\n  I think we are all feeling good about the way this has been handled. \nI think we are moving back in the direction of operating the Senate in \na way that we sort of traditionally understood we were going to operate \nthe Senate.\n  I also thank my good friend, the majority leader. I think this has \nbeen a good cooperative effort, to have a process that respects the \ntraditions of the Senate. This is a very fine day in the recent history \nof the Senate. Again, my congratulations to the chairman of the \ncommittee and the ranking member. They did a fabulous job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? All time is yielded back?\n  The question is on passage of the bill, subject to a 60-vote \nthreshold.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, the Agriculture Reform, Food, and \nJobs Act, or the 2012 farm bill, represents the most significant reform \nof U.S. agriculture in decades. This bill is the product of many months \nof policy discussions and late night deliberations guided by the steady \nleadership of Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member Roberts. I commend \ntheir efforts in successfully navigating this bill. All Americans stand \nto benefit from their hard work and commitment to reform agriculture \npolicy and strengthen our rural communities.\n  There is a reason why people across the country--farmers and business \nowners, faith leaders and county commissioners--have been paying \nattention to what we are doing.\n  This bill benefits all Americans, including in Ohio, where 1 in 7 \njobs is related to the food and agriculture sector. From making the \nfarm safety net more fiscally responsible, ensuring communities have \naccess to broadband, protecting nutrition and conservation programs, to \nstrengthening initiatives for healthy, nutritious food--this \nlegislation touches all Ohioans.\n  Also, at a time where there is too much gridlock, this bill is a \nwelcome change.\n  Many thanks to Leader Reid and Senator McConnell for their patience, \ntheir cooperation, and for allowing time for proper consideration of \nthe farm bill.\n  Many of the policies I proposed as legislation and worked to include \nin this farm bill were made at the suggestion of Ohioans. Traveling \nacross the State on my ``Grown in Ohio'' listening tour, I learned what \nis working and what needs to be changed from people whose primary job \nis to grow our food, feed the hungry, and run small businesses and \nsmall towns. Thanks to the many Ohioans who have shared their opinions, \nideas, and provided feedback over the past several months. This farm \nbill is better because of their involvement.\n  This legislation would not have been possible without the dedicated \nwork of the Senate Agriculture Committee's leadership of Chairwoman \nStabenow, Ranking Member Roberts, and that of its members. In \nparticular, I enjoyed the opportunity to work with a number of my \nAgriculture Committee colleagues. Their willingness to reach across \nparty lines ensured that this bill had a much-needed dose of Midwestern \npragmatism. I would like to thank Senators Thune and Grassley, as well \nas Senators Harkin, Nelson, Lugar, Johanns, Klobuchar, and Casey. Their \ncontinual engagement in the farm bill process has made a stronger \nproduct and I am grateful for their efforts.\n  The 2012 farm bill has been many months in the making and was made \npossible by the work of Senate staff, often in a bipartisan manner. \nMike Seyfert, Joel Leftwich, and Tara Smith of Ranking Member Roberts' \nstaff were invaluable resources in this process, as well as Jared Hill \nfor Senator Grassley and Lynn Tjeerdsma with Senator Thune, whose work \nwith my staff was indispensable.\n  I was continually impressed with the open and collaborative nature of \nSenator Stabenow's staff. This farm bill was written in a unique and \nchallenging process--all of which made the efforts by Chris Adamo, \nJonathan Coppess, Joe Shultz, Tina May, Brandon McBride, Jacklyn \nSchneider and others to remain engaged and open to suggestions all the \nmore invaluable. Their hard work has not gone unnoticed.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on S. 3240, \nlegislation to reauthorize the farm bill. It is important to reflect on \nthe process and the debate we just had, as well as consider the final \nproduct. First, I wish to commend Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking \nMember Roberts for their diligent efforts in bringing this bill to the \nSenate floor for consideration and debate. It is no small achievement \nand there have been countless hours expended by Members and staff on \nthis very important effort. However, in spite of this, as I weigh the \nbill and its impact on the State of Georgia and the Southeast, I am \ntruly disappointed that I am not able to support it.\n  This bill does include significant reform with the elimination of \ndirect payments and it makes several improvements to crop insurance. I \nhave always been an advocate of risk management delivered through the \nprivate sector. However, the bill establishs a one-size-fits-all \nprogram rather than recognizing the limitations of crop insurance for \ncertain regions of the country, namely, the Southeast, and whether the \nnew commodity title program, the Agriculture Risk Coverage, ARC, \nprogram can work as a safety net for crops other than corn and \nsoybeans. Leaving producers without an effective safety net provides \nvery little protection and certainty for those outside of the Midwest.\n  A good idea often stumbles by asking it to do too much. Crop \ninsurance is a tool that addresses risk in an individual crop year. It \ndoes not work as a safety net by insuring against multiple-year price \ndeclines. This is simply beyond its design and capabilities. Crop \ninsurance is a critical part of a producer's risk management program, \nbut it is not a cure-all to a commodity market that can expand and \ncontract based on the vagaries of weather, disease, and international \nevents. That is why farm policy in the past encouraged programs such as \nthe marketing loan and the countercyclical program to work with, not in \ncompetition, to crop insurance.\n  This week we have had the opportunity to debate and improve the bill. \nWe made some important changes, but it still lacks the balance I have \nadvocated for the past several weeks. It is still my hope to support \nthe bill at the end of the legislative process. Perhaps after action by \nthe House of Representatives and a conference of the two Chambers, we \nwill see the changes necessary to gain my support.\n  Chairwoman Stabenow has assured me on several occasions that my \nconcerns will be addressed and I know she will keep her commitment. I \nwould rather have dealt with the issues during the Senate debate, but \nthat was not possible.\n  We must remember that the farm bill should help farmers and ranchers \nmanage a combination of challenges--much out of their own control. We \nmust also remember that the farm bill is not an entitlement for any one \nregion or any one commodity. Policymakers must remember that the bill \nneeds to serve all producers in all parts of the country equitably and \neffectively. To fail in this endeavor means we as legislators have \nfailed to produce a bill worthy of the people we represent. I am proud \nof the work we did on the 2008 farm bill and its ability to provide a \nstrong safety net program for producers. I am confident that the next \nfarm bill will adhere and honor that same commitment we made 4 years \nago.\n  While I could not support the bill in front of us, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the weeks and months ahead.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate today \npassed the Farm bill. This is bipartisan legislation that is critical \nto all Americans--from the farmers who grow our food, to the consumers \nwho purchase that food, to kids who get school lunches, and to the \nneediest in our Nation who deserve access to adequate nutrition. I \nespecially want to commend Senator Stabenow and Senator Roberts for \ntheir yeoman bipartisan work to craft this important legislation.\n  As Senator Stabenow has so eloquently put it time and again, this \nbill is a jobs bill. One in every 12 American jobs is tied to \nagriculture and this legislation represents an opportunity to create \nmore jobs.\n  In my home State of Oregon, agriculture is now more than a $5 billion \na year industry and it reflects a wide array of crops, mirroring the \ndiversity in America's agriculture.\n  As I like to say, Oregonians do a lot of thing well, but what we do \nbest is\n\n[[Page S4399]]\n\ngrow things and add value to those things. This bill has a lot in it to \nhelp Oregonians do that even better and in turn create more \nopportunities to sell those products better locally, nationally and \nabroad.\n  I was particularly pleased to have been successful in adding two \namendments to the Farm bill. These are amendments to make it easier to \nprovide healthier foods for children in schools and to help address the \nproblem of hunger in our country.\n  One of my amendments would for the first time test out direct farm-\nto-school approaches to provide healthier foods for children in our \nschools. It will do this through a competitive pilot program with at \nleast five farm-to-school demonstration projects in all regions in the \ncountry.\n  While there are currently some farm to school programs in place, it's \na patchwork system and, according to the Agriculture Department's own \nEconomic Research Service, ``data and analysis of farm to school \nprograms are scare.'' This pilot program will fill in the information \nvoid about what works and what doesn't, and it will provide a way to \nimprove and replace ineffective programs.\n  What is more, under these demonstration projects, innovative States \nand school districts will truly be able source fresh, high-quality \nlocal produce for our schoolchildren to enjoy. No more having to \npurchase faraway food from a Federal warehouse hundreds of miles away \nwhen there is healthy food just down the road.\n  Under my amendment, schools win. Farmers win. And most importantly, \nour children get to enjoy the delicious, local produce that they should \nbe able to enjoy--every day--for breakfast, or for lunch, or for a \nsnack. That is why the American Academy of Pediatrics the Nation's \npediatricians supported my no cost farm-to-school amendment.\n  With the adoption of this amendment, it will be easier for delicious \npears, cherries, and other healthy produce, grown just a few miles down \nthe road, to make it into our schools.\n  Schools and school food authorities from all over the country with \ninnovative ideas can now begin drawing up novel plans of action to \npurchase fresh, local produce for their kids.\n  New ideas will come forth, and the existing farm-to-school \ninfrastructure will improve as new and better distribution models begin \nto emerge.\n  I am heartened that the farm-to-school movement has truly become \nnational in scope, as more people recognize both the health and \neconomic benefits that derive from these efforts. My amendment will \nmake this movement not only bigger but better.\n  I thank Senator Stabenow and her staff for working with me on this \namendment and helping me get this passed.\n  Fewer folks will be hungry thanks to the Senate's passage of my \nmicroloan for gleaners amendment.\n  These gleaners are mostly volunteers who collect food from grocery \nstores, restaurants, and farms--food that would otherwise be wasted--\nand distribute it to agencies or nonprofit organizations that feed it \nto the hungry.\n  These good Samaritans who save food from being tossed into landfills \nor burned in incinerators will finally be able to access the capital \nthey deserve to expand and improve their operations.\n  At a time when food waste is the single largest category of waste in \nour local landfills--more than 34 million tons of food, even a portion \nof that wasted food could feed a lot of people. By redistributing food \nthat would otherwise go to waste to the hungry--again, without spending \nextra taxpayer money--we can do more to ensure that this unwanted food \nis used to tackle hunger in America.\n  Instead of burning this food in incinerators, gleaners can help more \npeople in need burn this food as calories.\n  This is just one more step in the right direction to help alleviate \nfood insecurity in our country.\n  I again thank Senator Stabenow and her staff for their assistance in \ngetting this amendment passed. It will provide real help to a group of \nselfless folks that are trying to bring some commonsense solutions to \nthe hunger crisis.\n  As happy as I was to get the Farm Bill passed and get these \namendments included, an opportunity to encourage healthier eating by \nrecipients of SNAP benefits--what was previously known as food stamps--\nwas unfortunately not able to come up for a vote.\n  This is disappointing. Not disappointing for me, but for the millions \nof SNAP beneficiaries, public health officials, and others who know we \ncan do better to encourage healthier eating and increase consumption of \nhealthy fruits and vegetables.\n  The existing waiver authority for SNAP is extremely restrictive and \nhas resulted in a number of innovative State proposals being denied. It \nmakes no sense to continue to stifle innovation and progress when it \ncomes to incentivizing beneficiaries to eat healthier.\n  I will continue to push for ways to promote healthier eating through \nthe SNAP program, given that it will improve public health, increase \nthe consumption of healthy food, boost local farmers' incomes, and give \ntaxpayers the confidence that their tax dollars are being spent on food \nthat is really food.\n  I was also very disappointed that my amendment to legalize industrial \nhemp was also not granted a vote.\n  I firmly believe that American farmers should not be denied an \nopportunity to grow and sell a legitimate crop simply because it \nresembles an illegal one.\n  I fought for an amendment that would have recognized industrial hemp \nas a legitimate crop, but since doing so requires amending the \nControlled Substances Act it was considered non-germane to the current \ndebate and could not be brought up for a vote.\n  However, just my raising this issue has sparked a growing awareness \nof exactly how ridiculous the U.S.'s ban on industrial hemp is and I \nfeel that important progress was made in advancing this dialogue.\n  I am confident that if grassroots support continues to grow and \nMembers of Congress continue to hear from voters, then commonsense hemp \nlegislation can move through Congress in the near future.\n  I plan to continue to keep fighting for this and hope to reintroduce \nthis as a stand-alone bill.\n  I also want to raise concerns with language that was passed in the \nbill that amended the Healthy Forests Restoration Act. It is my hope \nthat this issue will still be addressed in conference. I understand \nSenator Bennet made remarks expressing that same desire.\n  The language in the forestry title of the Farm bill amended an Act \nwhich I played a key role in helping pass originally in the Senate a \ndecade ago.\n  As part of efforts to pass that legislation, which streamlined \nNational Environmental Policy Act requirements, as well as appeals and \njudicial review, a carefully balanced compromise was reached. \nEnvironmental protections and clear limitations for appropriate places \nfor the use of that authority were enacted as part of that legislation.\n  The language in the Farm Bill creates a sweeping new authority to use \nthe Healthy Forest Restoration Act for areas potentially threatened \nwith insect or disease infestations but fails to include any of the \nenvironmental protections or clear limitations in the original \nlegislation. Additional, the way those areas that are threatened by \ninsects and disease are defined is very broad.\n  I worked very hard with several of my colleagues to try to reach a \ncompromise. It is my hope that given a little more time, we will be \nable to reach a compromise before a final Farm Bill becomes law.\n  I hope we will have a chance to perfect this language to address \nthese concerns as the bill goes to conference.\n  Lastly, I want to touch the labeling of genetically modified foods.\n  I have always believed that consumers benefit from having more \ninformation about the food they consume, and that is why I supported an \namendment offered by Senator Sanders regarding the labeling of such \nfoods. However, I continue to believe that the most realistic way to \nimprove consumer information about genetically modified foods is to \ntake a national approach and I will continue to work towards that goal. \nThat is why I cosponsored Senator Begich's legislation to ensure that \ngenetically modified fish are labeled.\n  In sum, I again want to reiterate my strong support for the Farm Bill \npassed\n\n[[Page S4400]]\n\nin the Senate and my great pleasure at having successfully gotten two \namendments into this bill.\n  I raised several additional issues and it is my hope that there will \nbe continued opportunities to address these issues going forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4400-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4400-S4409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT----MOTION TO PROCEED----\n                               Continued\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that be \nthe order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Mr. President, I will be brief. I know other Members are on the floor \nwho want to speak on other subjects.\n  First, I want to thank the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from \nKansas for an extraordinary job on a very difficult bill, a very \ncomplicated bill--and difficult because it is not just a Republican-\nDemocratic debate or a Democratic-Republican debate, it is a regional \ndebate that has to take place, and there is a lot of give-and-take.\n  I have been proud to vote for every farm bill that has been before \nthe Senate to my knowledge, but I voted ``no'' today, and I want to say \nwhy.\n  Despite the great work of Senator Stabenow and Senator Roberts, there \nwas a weak part of this bill, in my view, related to rice farming, and \nit is such a significant and important part of our farming structure in \nLouisiana that I cast a vote against the bill to send a signal that \nmore work needs to be done.\n  This bill passed the Senate with an overwhelming vote. I voted for \nmany of the amendments that I think helped to shape it to be even \nbetter than when it came out of committee.\n  We beat back several attacks to uproot, destroy, or significantly \nmodify the U.S. Sugar Program, which has been very important to the \nState of Louisiana--one of the Nation's great sugar growers. As I have \ntried to explain to people who continue to attack this program, why \nwould you want to end a program in this bill that does not cost the \ntaxpayers a single dime?\n  There are no direct subsidies for sugar, as there are for all the \nother crops. The U.S. Sugar Program provides American consumers with \nlow, stable sugar prices and ensures that our sugarcane and sugar beet \ngrowers receive a fair price for their crop.\n  I am happy to say that American growers of sugar can provide almost \n85 percent of domestic demand. So why not use domestic sugar if we can \nsupply our domestic demand? We only import what we need to import. We \ndo not want to flood the market with cheap imports coming into America \nand undermining our jobs. I was proud to stand with our sugar industry \nand beat back those amendments.\n  Louisiana farmers and ranchers make a significant contribution to our \nState, generating over $10.8 billion in economic activity alone. \nAgriculture--including fisheries and, of course, forestry--and energy \nare the backbone of Louisiana's economy.\n  This farm bill is an important bill. As I said, I was happy to vote \nfor literally dozens of amendments that strengthened it. But I held out \nmy final support, hoping that, as it travels to the House and goes \nthrough the conference process, the farm provisions related to our rice \ngrowers could be perfected.\n  People like to say the United States grows the cheapest, safest, and \nmost abundant food, fiber, and energy supply in the world. They are \nright. The people in my State who do that day in and day out are proud. \nThey have every reason to be proud because farming is more than a \nbusiness, it is more than a job; it is a way of life. It is a way of \nlife that is important and precious and should be honored. There are \nmany families--cousins and aunts and uncles and fathers and mothers and \nchildren who are involved in farming. In Louisiana, in our forest \nlands, and along our coastal lands, these families follow a preferred \nway of life, even though it means hard work, long hours, high risks, \nand sometimes heart-breakingly limited returns.\n  So from sugar and rice in the south to cotton and poultry in the \nnorth, and all the areas in between, Louisiana needs a farm bill that \nsupports all of\n\n[[Page S4401]]\n\nour farmers. This one failed in one important area, which is why I cast \na ``no'' vote.\n  This bill did not support adequately, in my view, the 2,000 rice \nfarmers we have in Louisiana. Our rice industry generates $638 million \nin our State alone. Along with Arkansas, we are one of the major rice \nproducing states. Nationally, U.S. rice supports about 128,000 jobs. It \nis $34 billion of economic input each year.\n  This bill did reduce the deficit by $23 billion, and that is \nsomething I support. However, it took a larger chunk out of rice than \nwas asked for any other commodity. Rice took a 65% reduction when the \nother crops, on average, took a 30% reduction. And I know some of the \npeanut growers in Georgia have some of the same concerns we do.\n  So let me end by saying that I hope the position of our rice farmers \nand the important industry that rice represents can be strengthened in \nthe House. If so, I will proudly put my name on this bill, because \nthere is some very good that was done to protect our nutrition \nprograms, to help our middle-class families who find themselves in the \nunusual situation of having to get some food relief in these difficult \ntimes. I want to thank Senator Stabenow particularly for her help in \nthat way.\n  But for my rice growers, my rice producers, the important mills we \nhave from Crowley, LA, to other places, for companies such as Kellogg \nin Battle Creek, MI, that depend on strong rice production from \nLouisiana, I cast a ``no'' vote.\n  Finally, I will say, I hope we can find a way to open some more \nmarkets for our rice growers. We are interested--very interested--in \ntrade with Cuba. And the politics sometimes prevents us from opening \nmore trade relations with a nation that I know has not met our standard \nof democracy but most certainly would be an open market for many of my \nfarmers.\n  So for my farmers who are looking for markets where we can sell and \ncompete on the world market, if you give us an opportunity to compete \nand open these markets, then we may be able to adjust our program. But \nuntil then, our farmers need the support of other farmers and did not \nreceive it in this bill.\n\n  I so appreciate my colleague from Rhode Island giving me this \nopportunity to speak. I thank the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                   40th Anniversary Of The Pell Grant\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, 1972 was a watershed year for expanding \neducational opportunities in this country.\n  The Education Amendments of 1972 included title IX--now known as the \nPatsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act--guaranteeing \neducational opportunities for women and girls in federally supported \neducational institutions.\n  But 1972 also saw, within the Education Amendments, the creation of \nthe Basic Educational Opportunity Grant. Today we know it as the Pell \nGrant. It was named in honor and in recognition of the extraordinary \nvision and service of my colleague, my predecessor from Rhode Island, \nClaiborne Pell. He authored this provision.\n  Forty years later, we can see how these two key changes to our \neducational laws have transformed our Nation and transformed the \naspirations of millions of Americans.\n  It is also a good time to reflect on the challenges that remain and \nto renew our commitment to fulfilling the promise of opportunity \nrepresented in the Education Amendments of 1972.\n  Senator Pell's vision was that no student with the talent, drive, and \ndesire should be denied the opportunity for a post-secondary education \nsolely because of a lack of financial resources. Pell grants have \nopened the doors to a college education for millions of Americans.\n  In the 1973-1974 academic year--the first year students received \ngrants--176,000 Pell grants were awarded. In the school year that began \nin the fall of 2010, that number grew to over 9.6 million.\n  Pell grants constitute approximately 23 percent of all Federal \nstudent aid, which includes grants, loans, and work study programs.\n  The Pell grant is the cornerstone of our Federal student aid \nprograms. For needy students, it is the foundation for making college \naffordable. Unfortunately, reduced State support for higher education \nand rising college costs have eroded that foundation.\n  In 1976, the maximum Pell grant was $1,400, which was enough to cover \n72 percent of the cost of attendance at a public 4-year college. In \n2010, the maximum Pell Grant was $5,550, which was only enough to cover \n34 percent of the cost of attendance at a public 4-year college.\n  We have seen an erosion of the buying power of the Pell grant. If we \nwere matching the effort that he initiated in the 1970s, we would be \nproviding more opportunities and more support for college students \nacross this Nation.\n  Senator Pell understood that grant aid was critical for low-income \nstudents and families. The goal was to minimize the need for loans. \nFrankly, back in the 1970s, most young people with a Pell grant--\nworking through the summer, and working the extra hours they had to \nduring the academic year--could pay their way through school, leave \nschool without huge debt.\n  Today, regrettably, there are students graduating from school with \n$10,000, $20,000, $30,000 worth of debt because the Pell grants have \nnot kept up, because college costs have accelerated, and because they \nhave been forced to borrow. Today, low-income students and middle-\nincome students rely heavily on student loans to pay for college.\n  And we are seeing another burden; and, frankly, this ripples \nthroughout our economy. In the 1970s and 1980s, if you left college \nowing a few thousand dollars, you could pay that off very quickly. So \nby your late twenties, you were ready to settle down, to buy the house. \nToday, we have a generation of students who are struggling with debt \nthat might take them 10 or more years to pay off. Effectively, they \ncannot begin to buy the home, to settle down, to do the things that are \nso important to our overall economy.\n  Unless we are able to come to an agreement over the next several \ndays, we also face the prospect of seeing the rate on subsidized \nstudent loans double by July 1.\n  That would deal another blow to moderate- and low-income families. \nLeader Reid has proposed a very reasonable compromise. I hope that the \nRepublicans will let that compromise go forward. I am hopeful my \nRepublican colleagues can use this opportunity not only to continue to \nkeep the lending rate low for Stafford loans but renew our own pledge \non the Pell grant.\n  It would be ironic to see, on the 40th anniversary of the Pell grant, \na further undermining of the ability of middle- to low-income Americans \nto go to college. In fact, this should be an opportunity to do much \nmore. Senator Pell's words ring as true today as when he spoke them in \n1995, one of the last years of his tenure in the Senate.\n  In his words:\n\n       As I have stated on many occasions, few things in life are \n     more important than the education of our children. They are \n     the living legacy that we leave behind and their education \n     determines the future of the American Nation. . . .\n\n  He continued.\n\n       . . . Every day families are making decisions about sending \n     their children to college. Certainly one of, if not the major \n     obstacle they face is how to pay for college. The loan is \n     their last resort. It provides the extra but necessary money \n     they must have after exhausting their own resources and \n     obtaining any grants for which their children might be \n     eligible. Increasing the amount that children owe after \n     graduation may well place the dream of a college education \n     beyond their reach. That, to my mind, would be a tragedy of \n     truly immense proportions. . . .\n\n  Senator Pell was right. Increasing student debt, especially during \nthese difficult economic times, would be a tragedy for students, their \nfamilies, and our Nation. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, on our side of the aisle, all my colleagues, to work together to \nprevent an increase in the student loan interest rate from doubling on \nJuly 1.\n  That would, indeed, be a fitting tribute to Senator Pell on the 40th \nanniversary of the Pell grant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am honored to join my senior Senator \nto commemorate such an important milestone as he has described in \nAmerican education.\n  It was 40 years ago this week that President Nixon signed into law \nthe\n\n[[Page S4402]]\n\nEducation Amendments Act of 1972, including a provision establishing \nfor the first time the basic educational opportunity grant, which came \nto be called the Pell grant for its sponsor, Senator Claiborne Pell of \nRhode Island.\n  Over the next four decades, Pell grants would turn the dream of \ncollege education into a reality for millions of Americans. Today, more \nthan ever, a college diploma is important to a young person's success. \nThe unemployment rate for those 25 and older with a bachelor's degree \nis less than 4 percent and over 8 percent for those with only a high \nschool diploma. The value of that college degree could not be more \napparent. Higher education provides the skills and credentials that \nmany employers require in today's economy.\n  In the decades following World War II, the U.S. Government made \ncollege and occupational mobility a reality for more Americans than \never before. Claiborne Pell was a veteran of that war, and he saw how \nthe GI bill enabled millions of his fellow veterans to better \nthemselves through education. He recognized that many of his Coast \nGuard shipmates had as much talent as his Princeton classmates but not \nthe privilege or resources to go to college.\n  Given the opportunity, this Greatest Generation would not only \nprovide a better life for their families with that access to college, \nbut they would contribute mightily to the growth of this Nation, a \ngrowth we still enjoy today.\n  Claiborne Pell resolved then that all Americans should have such an \nopportunity, and his vision would become a reality for millions through \nthe Pell grant. In 1976, the first year the Pell grants were fully \nfunded, a full Pell grant paid 72 percent of the cost of attendance at \na typical 4-year public college. Today, a full Pell grant covers just \n32 percent of those costs, but still, for many, this vital assistance \ncan mean the difference between being able to attend college or not.\n  As grant aid has fallen and tuition has soared, families have had to \nborrow to make up the difference to send their kids to college. The \ntotal amount of student loan debt carried by Americans has recently \nsurpassed $1 trillion, more than Americans now owe on their credit \ncards.\n  I have talked to students around my State and I have read many \nheartfelt letters. It is clear Pell grants serve as a gateway to the \nopportunities available with a college degree, a gate that would be \nshut if not for Pell grants.\n  I received a letter from Phil in Wakefield, RI, the oldest of five \nchildren. Last year, Phil graduated from Cornell. Phil worked his way \nthrough college, including summers. His parents chipped in when they \ncould. Phil's father is still paying off student loans, and Phil was \nlucky enough to earn private scholarships and receive grants from his \nschool. He said:\n\n       But there's no way my education would have been possible \n     without Pell Grants. We just wouldn't have been able to \n     afford it.\n\n  I also heard from Anthony, who has been working as a waiter in \nProvidence. Thanks to the Pell grant, he and his wife Jen have been \nable to go back to school at the University of Rhode Island for degrees \nin biotechnology. They say their education will enable them to build a \nbetter future together in Rhode Island's rapidly expanding biotech \nsector.\n  Leann is a single mother of two from Pawtucket, already carrying \nstudent loan debt, although she has not been able to finish her \nundergraduate program. Last year, Leann enrolled in the School of \nContinuing Education at Roger Williams University, and when she \ngraduates with a bachelor's degree next year, she plans on opening her \nown small business. ``None of this would be happening'' she wrote, ``if \nI were not receiving a Pell Grant.''\n  The simple fact is this: Pell grants help millions of people achieve \nthe dream of college and improve their prospects for employment. It is \na wise investment in the future of our country. Congress has, in recent \nyears, increased the buying power of Pell Grants, increasing the \nmaximum grant from $4,050 in academic year 2006-2007 to $5,550 in 2012-\n2013.\n  We also increased the minimum family income that automatically \nqualifies a student for the maximum Pell grant, a change that better \nreflects today's economic realities. Sadly, however, we are seeing a \ntruly misguided assault on Pell grants.\n\n  The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal marked the 40th \nanniversary of Pell grants this week by printing claims about the Pell \ngrant that, simply to be polite, do not withstand scrutiny. The Journal \nsays the Pell grant is rife with abuse, with students engaging in \n``creative accounting'' to qualify by feigning financial independence.\n  The most common way one gets deemed independent under the Pell Grant \nProgram is by being 24 years of age or older. It is hard to imagine \ndoing much creative accounting with one's date of birth. The other \nmajor proofs of independence are being married and having children. \nMaybe when they said ``creative accounting'' they meant ``procreative \naccounting.''\n  The Wall Street Journal implies that better off students can win \nlarger grants by attending more expensive institutions. But the cost of \ntuition cannot increase the maximum size of a grant. The maximum Pell \ngrant, as I said, is $5,550, regardless of the school one attends. As \nwe all know, $5,550 is far from sufficient to cover the cost of most \nhigher education.\n  Perhaps the most misleading claim from the Journal is to pick out the \nperiod when Pell grant costs rose significantly, between 2008 and 2010, \ndue largely to the enactment of a funding expansion that has since been \nrepealed and the fact that more eligible students applied for \nassistance as the economy worsened in those years. What they left out \nis that the Congressional Budget Office projects almost no average \nannual growth in program costs over the next 10 years.\n  The Republican budget in the House of Representatives slashes funding \nand eligibility for Pell grants and eliminates all mandatory funding \nfor the program over the next 10 years. We all understand the need to \nfind savings in the Federal budget. We all understand the need to make \ndifficult choices. But of all the bad choices we could make, of all \nunintelligent choices we could make, failing to invest in Pell grants \nwould be among the worst.\n  It is, frankly, shameful that Federal financial aid has not kept pace \nwith the rising cost of college. It is truly misguided to roll back \nfinancial aid for a generation of young Americans preparing to compete \nin an evermore global economy. We need a highly trained workforce. Pell \ngrants are very often the keystone in the arch that students must build \nto afford college, as Phil and Anthony and Jen and Leann all showed.\n  Rhode Island is a small State. But over the years we have had some \ntowering and remarkable Senators. Claiborne Pell was one. Claiborne \nPell believed, as he once told the Providence Journal, ``that \ngovernment--and the federal government in particular--can, should, and \ndoes make a positive impact on the lives of most Americans.''\n  The Pell grant's positive impact is that people who cannot afford \ncollege have the chance to go to college, and it lifts off their backs \na little bit of that burden of debt. That is something we want in this \ncountry, not just for the sake of the individual Pell grant recipient, \nnot just for the sake of the next generation but for the sake of the \ngood of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the farm bill. As we \ncan see from an open Senate, I think we have done our work, and we have \nbeen successful. Most of what we can say on this bill has already been \nsaid.\n  After final passage, I simply wish to reiterate what the chairwoman \nhas said, what I have said all along: This is a reform bill. We cut $23 \nbillion in mandatory spending. These are real cuts, no gimmicks. We \nhave eliminated four commodity programs--four commodity programs. We \nhave streamlined conservation programs from 23 to 13. We have \neliminated numerous other authorizations.\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\n  In total, approximately 100 authorizations for spending and \nappropriations are eliminated. This is real reform. I also wish to take \na quick moment to thank all the staff who have worked so hard on this \nlegislation, especially the committee staff on both the majority and \nthe minority sides.\n  I especially wish to thank the legislative magician, if I may call \nhim that--expert--David Schiappa and his staff. They are no longer \nhere, but they guided us through some difficult times, as he always \ndoes--as they always do.\n  I would like to take a few moments to recognize the members of my \nstaff who worked on this bill. For me, this is a very special occasion. \nWe are only as good as our staff. I have been blessed with the very \nbest, and I have been a bucket toter. That is what a staff member is. \nWhen someone totes buckets, they try not to spill anything.\n  Sometimes they are successful and other times they may trip and fall. \nOther times it is just the way it is. I was administrative assistant to \nSenator Frank Carlson, the only man in Kansas to serve us as a Member \nof Congress, as a Governor, and a Senator, prior to our current \nGovernor, Sam Brownback.\n  I was the administrative assistant for Congressman Keith Sebelius, \nwho was on the House Agriculture Committee, and learned an awful lot \nabout agriculture with Keith as we went through those days. Obviously, \nif someone is from Kansas, they are a legislative assistant or a bucket \ntoter or whatever description you want for Bob Dole forever.\n  These people, as far as I am concerned, are not only my staff, they \nare my family. They have persevered. Anne Hazlett, my chief counsel, in \nmy opinion, is the best chief counsel in the Senate, one of the top \nlegislative drafters in the Senate, former director of the Indiana \nState Department of Agriculture under Gov. Mitch Daniels. When she is \nat my door, I know I am going to be told no on something.\n  I actually had better listen to her.\n  Eric Steiner. Eric has charged me with cruel and unusual punishment \nfor putting him in the charge of dairy policy. After the 1996 farm bill \nand all that--and the 2002 and 2008 farm bills--I said I don't do dairy \nanymore. Then, in came Eric. He also became a dad for the first time \nearlier this year as we worked on this bill--talk about working 24/7 \nand giving up your family.\n  Keira Franz is a former Bob Dole staffer. Bob still tells her what to \ndo so she can tell me what he says I am supposed to be doing.\n  Autumn Veazey, our southern bell and specialty crop guru, has also \nhad the pleasure of getting to know places such as Dodge City and the \ninside of a meat processing plant--something that should be required of \nevery agriculture assistant. Don't ask her.\n  Gregg Doud. Here is a real Kansas cowboy and one of the top \nagriculture trade experts in Washington, and he still wears his boots.\n  Tara Smith, our commodities and crop insurance expert, helps me \nnavigate the minefields of both. Thank you so much, Tara. You have been \nwonderful.\n  Janae Brady keeps our staff--and, most importantly, my staff--\ndirector organized.\n  Andrew Vlasity, a great young man and a tremendous writer, has helped \ncreate a research title for the future.\n  Max Fisher, our No. 1 crunching guru, also became a dad for the third \ntime as we worked on this bill.\n  Chris Hicks, our other legal counsel, is a former Senate-confirmed \ngeneral counsel at the Department of Agriculture and provides the \nwisdom of that position as we work on complicated matters.\n  Patty Lawrence is our Department of Agriculture detailee on \nconservation issues and the ultimate professional.\n  Also, in my personal office: Ryan Flickner, a young Kansas farm lad \nwho will soon return to Kansas to get married and become my deputy \nState director.\n  Wane Stoskopf is another Kansas farm boy who is taking Ryan's \nposition, and Emily Haug.\n  Also, my communications director, Sarah Little--dear Sarah is never \nshort of work when it comes to cleaning up what I have said and should \nnot have said.\n  My State agriculture representative is Mel Thompson. I used to work \nwith Mel. He was a legislative assistant and I was administrative \nassistant with Keith Sebelius. We went through two farm bills. There is \nno better person to have eyes and ears on the ground than Mel Thompson.\n  Then, there are Joel and Mike, the ``two musketeers,'' who saw me \nevery morning, every afternoon, and every evening. I have a tendency to \nwander, to reflect on past farm bill stories, and to occasionally give \nranks. These are not particularly helpful in regard to moving \nlegislation forward, and so Joel and Mike would say: Sir--at least they \nsaid ``sir''--Sir, keep your eye on the ball. Stay focused. Where there \nis a will, there is a way. If you rank, if you wander, you will be lost \nin the midst of the desert farm bill purgatory. Don't be lost in the \ndesert farm bill purgatory. Stay focused.\n  I tried. I think we succeeded, for the most part.\n  The chairwoman also has a great staff. Everybody likes to brag on \ntheir staffs, and I know she will mention many of them. I especially \nthank her staff director, Chris Adamo, and chief counsel, Jonathan \nCoppess, for their outstanding work on this legislation. They have been \nprofessional throughout. I don't know what you guys are going to do now \nthat we are not breaking into your office in the mornings, afternoons, \nand evenings to see your smiling faces--and then we wonder why you are \nnot smiling. Thank you for a top job.\n  I also thank all those in Senate legislative counsel and the \nCongressional Budget Office who helped us get to this point today. They \nall worked behind the scenes, but we could not be here today without \nthem.\n  I view my staff as family. I thank my family over here for their \ntremendous work in achieving what I think is a great farm bill and for \ndoing something to restore the Senate back to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we have been looking forward to this day \nto be able to have the opportunity to celebrate a successful conclusion \nin the Senate. We have more work to do, but for 1 day we can pause and \ncelebrate what is an important and great day after a tremendous amount \nof hard work that has gone on by our staffs, my ranking member, myself, \nalong with our colleagues on the committee. We are so grateful for the \nwonderful effort that has gotten us to this point.\n  I have said this before and I will say it again: 16 million people \ncount on us. They work in agriculture or food-related industries. That \nis a lot of people. I am not sure we have had a jobs bill that has come \nbefore the Senate that we can say addresses 16 million people's jobs, \nbut certainly this is one. It affects every corner of every State.\n  I thank everyone in the Senate for their patience with us. I thank \nthe majority leader for his incredible patience and leadership. I thank \nSenator McConnell for working with us and I thank all those who voted \non 73 amendments and everybody who was involved in putting those \ntogether and making sure we could move through this process.\n  Of course, I thank Senator Roberts again. Kansas is lucky to have him \nas a champion in the Senate. I have been very lucky to have him at my \nside throughout this debate and work, starting in the fall with our \ndeficit reduction proposal up until today. We have come together on a \nbipartisan basis. I hope we can do that more. I have heard so many \ncomments from colleagues in the last few days, saying it feels good to \nwork through issues, debating issues, having votes, working together, \nand actually accomplishing something. It feels good and we need to \ncontinue to do more of it. Frankly, the American people want us to do \nmore of it. So I am hopeful this will be a sign, as other things have \nbeen, frankly, in the Senate moving forward.\n  I am proud we have been the ones doing a bipartisan transportation \nbill and the ones passing other bipartisan bills. This is a significant \nmilestone in that process of working together.\n\n  I am also very proud of the reforms in the bill we have done on a \nbipartisan basis. This is $23 billion in spending cuts for deficit \nreduction. It is true that if every committee within their jurisdiction \nwere to focus on analyzing and reviewing the programs under their \njurisdiction and making tough\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\ndecisions, ending paperwork duplication, and so on, actually it would \nend up to be a pretty big deficit reduction plan--if we all did it in \nthose areas we control. That is the way we looked at the process.\n  We have come up with $23 billion in deficit reduction. We have done \nthat by ending four different subsidies that folks have talked about \nchanging for a long time--direct payments and other subsidies that are \npaid out regardless of losses. We passed a bill that continues support \nfor healthy local food systems, farmers markets, and local food hubs.\n  We have passed a bill that strengthens conservation and continues \nprotections that maintain healthy soil, clean water, and fresh air.\n  We passed a bill that supports America's rural communities. Every \nState has small rural communities, towns, villages, and counties that \nare counting on us to continue to have their economic development \ntools--which is the rural development title of the farm bill--as robust \nas possible. American energy independence is addressed in this bill. We \npassed the bill in a bipartisan way. This is an incredibly important \nstep.\n  Now our bill goes to the House of Representatives. I have great \nconfidence in the chairman and ranking member of the committee. I know \nthey will be successful in moving a bill out of committee, and I am \nsure they are going to do everything humanly possible to pass it in the \nHouse. I believe, ultimately, they will because every American is \ncounting on them in order to maintain food security for our country and \nthe ability for us to have a strong, successful, safe food supply, as \nwell as all the jobs connected to that.\n  I wish to thank my extraordinary staff. They worked from sunrise to \nsunset and then another few hours. I think we added hours--I think we \nchanged from 24 hours to 30 a couple of times. It has been an \nincredible experience, and I am very grateful, truly, to all of them.\n  No team does it without a great captain. I thank Chris Adamo, who was \nwith me on the last farm bill and is now our staff director. He has \nprovided incredible leadership. He has deep knowledge of agriculture, \nand he brings a tremendous leadership to this process. He put together \na tremendous team. I would not be here, and we would not be here in the \nSenate without his leadership and hard work and the team effort \ninvolved.\n  I also thank Jonathan Coppess, my great chief counsel, who actually \nhelped bring a baby into the world last August, as we were saying, \n``Why don't we do deficit reduction.'' When the supercommittee was put \ninto place, he was helping bring a new baby into the world. So we thank \nJonathan for his leadership. I have to say this as a point of personal \nprivilege: Even though he is from Ohio, we still welcomed him into the \nfold--despite the rivalry between Michigan and Ohio.\n  I thank all our teams as well. I thank our commodities and dairy \nteams. It is tough work. We changed the commodity title. I think this \nis the most reform, probably--I don't know ever but in a long time. \nMoving from subsidy systems to a risk management system is easy to say, \nbut it is hard to put into place in a way that makes sense. It is fair \nwith commodities and will work in a simple way across the country.\n  I thank our Joe Shultz, who has been amazing. So many times we said: \nI don't know how we are going to do this, and he pulled another rabbit \nout of his hat. We thank Joe for all his wonderful work as our chief \neconomist.\n  Cory Claussen is on dairy. It is not an easy thing to do--focus on \ndairy. There are large farms and small dairies. It is an incredible \njob.\n  Marcus Graham, as well, did amazing work, as did Chelsea Render. \nThere was great teamwork on commodities and the dairy issues. Thank you \nso very much.\n  We had a great team on title II. Thanks to the ``T2 warriors'', Tina \nMay, an amazing person, who reminded me every other day that we had 643 \nconservation groups from every one of the 50 States. I have it in my \nmemory because Tina said it every time I saw her. The truth is we did \nhave 643 different conservation and environmental groups supporting \nthis bill. It is because of Tina May, Catie Lee and Kevin Norton and \nthe incredible work they brought to what I believe is an extraordinary \nreform in conservation. We are placing conservation as a priority in a \nway that has not been in other farm bills. We will see our country \nprovide better opportunities around land and water and air quality and \nquantity issues as a result of their hard work.\n  Jacqlyn Schneider and Jesseca Taylor deserve a tremendous amount of \ncredit for their work on the nutrition and healthy food issues. A major \narea of debate that will be going forward, as we address nutrition and \nhealthy foods issues, is specialty crops, which are so important to me. \nI know in New Hampshire and other parts of the country it is very \nimportant. They did incredible work. We had some hard issues to work \nthrough on how we could create savings in our bill in nutrition, while \nmaintaining the strong commitment to families. So I would like to thank \nthem for an extraordinary effort as well.\n\n  And then each of our team members--let me go through them because \nthere are so many people who did so many wonderful things.\n  Jonathan Cordone, who kept me out of trouble at most moments, in his \nwork as general counsel, counseled me well and gave me wonderful words \nof wisdom as we moved along, both on procedure as well as policy.\n  Brandon McBride on rural development--we worked through many issues \non the floor with Members, many issues that Members who were not on the \ncommittee had and wanted to work on and develop further, and Brandon's \npatience and creativity and hard work really created a rural \ndevelopment title that is extraordinary.\n  One of the things we worked on, which may sound easy but was not easy \nat all, was the differing definitions of what rural is. The Secretary \nof Agriculture told me one time we had 11 different definitions of what \nrural was. He said: You know, you ought to fix that.\n  We heard from part-time mayors and village presidents and county \ncommissioners and others who said: We would like to figure this out, \nhow we might use these programs to support our communities, but we \ndon't know whether we fit or under which definition we fit.\n  Well, we have one definition now, and that may sound simple, but, no, \nit was very hard. And Brandon deserves a tremendous amount of credit, \nalong with our team, for getting us to that point.\n  Karla Thieman, who is not here at the moment, did a tremendous job on \nlivestock, livestock disaster assistance, and efforts on the energy \ntitle. We thank her and wish she were able to be here to actually \ncelebrate. I don't think she is, is she? No, she is not here, but we \nthank her so much.\n  Ben Becker made sure that we were communicating effectively with \nthose in the media, that we were communicating what we were doing. He \nworked extremely hard to make sure that was happening.\n  Russ Behnam. We thank Russ so much for all his incredible work as we \nmoved through these amendments and moved through this process. He was \nabsolutely invaluable in his work as well.\n  We thank Hanna Abou-El-Seoud, who was a terrific part of our team, \nand Maureen James, Alexis Stanczuk, Ryan Hocker, and Jesse Williams, \nour chief clerk, Nicole Hertenstein, Jacob Chaney, Seth Buchsbaum, and \nAlvaro Zarco. They are a terrific team, each one of them playing a very \nimportant role in getting us to this point and helping me have the \ninformation I needed, making sure things were getting done and the team \nwas able to come together.\n  We had two great fellows, Lauren Reid and Matt Eldred, whom we thank \nas well. Also, we thank all of the great interns we have had with us \nsince we began this process: Ryan Smoes, Jasmine Macies, Dawn Lucas, \nand Seth Collins.\n  This really is a team effort, with an extraordinary breadth of \njurisdiction under this bill that created the need to really make sure \nwe had the smartest people in the room, and I really believe we \nachieved that with this great team.\n  Also, I couldn't have gotten it done without my great chief of staff, \nAmanda Renteria, and the great role she played with Chris Adamo putting \ntogether our great agriculture team, and Todd Wooten, legislative \ndirector, who was on the phone counting votes every moment right up \nuntil the final vote. He did such a great job in bringing that \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\n  Bill Sweeney, my deputy chief of staff, made sure we were \ncommunicating in the right way, being able to tell the story of what it \nmeans to have a farm bill, what it means to people back home, to every \nfamily, every business, and every farmer. He did an extraordinary job \nof helping me do that.\n  Cullen Schwarz, who is a terrific communications director, made sure \nwe were communicating effectively what we were doing and why we were \ndoing it.\n  I also wish to thank our team in Michigan, led by Teresa Plachetka, a \nwonderful team that made sure we were focused, as I always am, on \nMichigan. Our great team consists of Mary Judnich, Kali Fox, and \nBrandon Fewins, who have done terrific work and outreach around the \nState, and Korey Hall in urban agriculture. All of our team made sure \nwe were communicating at home with our growers.\n  We are proud to say we have more diversity of crops than any State \nbut California, so I have always had to pay attention to every page. I \nhave always kind of been jealous of folks who had to only pay attention \nto one title. We have had to pay attention to everything. The good news \nis that prepared me well for assuming the chair of the committee. But I \ndo want to thank our Michigan staff because they are terrific as well.\n  This really is a bipartisan effort. It really, really is. And I have \nsuch respect and admiration for the staff of Senator Roberts on the \ncommittee, led by Mike Seyfert, Joel Leftwich, and Anne Hazlett. I \nthank them all so much for their terrific work and partnership. \nEveryone involved whom Senator Roberts spoke of is professional, smart, \nand dedicated. We had some tough things we had to work through, both \npolicy-wise and procedurally, and they were terrific, just absolutely \nmagnificent, and I am very grateful for the wonderful way in which we \nreally have a team. It is not a Democratic team or a Republican team--\nwe have a team.\n  I also wish to briefly mention our CBO farm team, whom we kept up \nlate at night many times as we tried to get scores and work through how \nwe fit this all together and maintain over $23 billion in deficit \nreduction. So Doug Elmendorf and his terrific team--Jim Langley, Greg \nHitz, Dave Hull, Kathleen FitzGerald, Emily Holcombe, Ann Futrell, Dan \nHoople, and Jeff LaFave--we call them the farm team--have been \nmagnificent and worked weekends, have gone above and beyond for us, and \nI thank them, with a shout-out to everybody at CBO who has helped us.\n  I thank Michelle Johnson-Wieder and Gary Endicott from Legislative \nCounsel for their invaluable assistance. And on Senator Reid's staff, I \nthank Kasey Gillette and Nathan Engle. I claim Kasey as my former staff \nperson, so I told Senator Reid that I trained her well. But we are very \ngrateful for the incredible team effort there.\n  All our floor staff, Gary Myrick, Tim Mitchell, David Krone, Bill \nDauster, Reema Dodin, Stacy Rich, Meredith Mellody, and everyone \ninvolved on the majority team who was so absolutely essential to us, \nputting in very long days and getting this done--everybody hung in \nthere with us, and we are grateful.\n  Finally, let me mention the Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, \nand the USDA Office of General Counsel. We had a lot of technical needs \nas we worked through this bill, a tremendous need for technical \nassistance and support, so that when we were done, as we completed the \nbill, it actually worked for farmers and ranchers, it worked from a \nDepartment standpoint to support farmers and ranchers and those \ninvolved in every part of this bill, and we received tremendous help \nand encouragement and support. So I thank them for their leadership.\n  To all the members of the Agriculture Committee, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and their staffs, I wish to say how very lucky I am to \nhave such a tremendous team who is so knowledgeable and has so much \nexperience and a committee that has so much experience. It has been \nquite amazing.\n  So as I conclude, Madam President, I would just say this is a proud \nday for those who care about having the Senate work together well, for \nproducing a product that is one that has real reforms in it and \nsomething that we can look to the American people with pride and say: \nWe worked hard, we worked together, and we got the job done.\n  I thank everyone, and now we look forward to working with our House \ncolleagues as they move this measure forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded and that I be allowed to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Taxmageddon\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise to express my growing concern as \nmassive tax increases loom on the horizon, and yet the Senate has not \ntaken a single vote to forestall what many are appropriately calling \ntaxmageddon.\n  Washington tends to be a place where people speak in hyperbole, but \nit is hard to overstate the magnitude of the tax increases that will \nhit our economy starting next year if we do not act. If Congress does \nnot vote to extend the current income-tax rates, the lower tax rates on \ninvestment income, relief from the alternative minimum tax, relief from \nthe Federal estate tax, and other expiring tax relief measures, the \nresult will be a tax increase of more than $470 billion on Americans in \n2013 alone.\n  Over the next 10 years this tax increase will result in nearly $4.5 \ntrillion in new taxes on American families and entrepreneurs. This will \nbe the largest tax increase in our Nation's history in absolute dollars \nand the second largest tax increase since World War II as a percentage \nof our economy. This massive tax increase does not even take into \naccount the new taxes enacted as part of ObamaCare that will also go \ninto effect in 2013 and that will impose an additional $23 billion in \nhigher taxes on individuals and businesses.\n  What will these taxes mean to the average American family? The \nHeritage Foundation recently published a study that estimated the \nincrease per tax return in every State. In my State of South Dakota, \nHeritage estimates that the average tax increase per tax return will be \n$3,187 in 2013.\n  I would say this to my Democratic friends who generally believe in \ndemand-driven Keynesian economics: The average family in South Dakota \ncan do more to stimulate our economy and create new employment by \nkeeping their $3,187 and spending it as they see fit, not as Washington \nsees fit to spend it on their behalf.\n  Taxmageddon is an apt description when we consider the impact of \nthese tax increases not just on individual families but on our entire \neconomy. Until recently we could speculate about the impact of these \ntax increases on our fragile economy, but the magnitude of the damage \nwas not in dispute. Not anymore.\n  Last month, the Congressional Budget Office gave us the most \ndefinitive estimate yet of the impact of the nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion of \ntax increases in 2013 when combined with the more than $100 billion of \nspending cuts from the sequester.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that the combination of \nmassive tax increases and the sequester will result in real GDP growth \nin calendar year 2013 of only one-half of 1 percent. The picture is \neven bleaker when we consider that the Congressional Budget Office also \nprojects that the economy will actually contract by 1.3 percent in the \nfirst half of 2013. According to the CBO, such a contraction and output \nin the first half of 2013 would ``probably be judged to be a \nrecession.''\n  So let's be clear about what ``taxmageddon'' means. We are not \ntalking about a slight slowdown in growth of a few tenths of a percent. \nWhat we are facing is the difference between positive growth on one \nhand--which will mean more jobs and higher incomes--and a recession on \nthe other hand.\n  How big is the difference in economic growth next year if we act to \nforestall the pending tax increases versus not doing anything about it? \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, if Congress acted to \nremove the tax increases and budget cuts, the growth of real GDP in \n2013 would be in the range of 4.4 percent.\n\n[[Page S4406]]\n\n  This sort of robust growth is a far cry from the lackluster economic \nperformance that we have experienced of late. In fact, GDP growth for \nthe first quarter of this year was recently revised downward to just \n1.9 percent. This is hardly the magnitude of economic growth necessary \nto sustain a meaningful recovery that will finally bring the \nunemployment rate below 8 percent--something the current meager \nrecovery has failed to accomplish.\n  We can, and must, do better. We can start by providing Americans some \ncertainty as to what their taxes are going to be come next year. \nFortunately, we learned recently that the House of Representatives \nintends to hold a vote on legislation to extend the existing tax rate \nnext month. According to statements by House Speaker Boehner and \nMajority Leader Cantor, the House is likely to consider a short-term--\nperhaps for 1 year--extension of existing tax rates as a bridge to \nfundamental tax reform next year.\n  Some may question why we need to vote on an extension of the tax \nrates now because they assume these tax issues can simply be dealt with \nas a part of the postelection lameduck session. The answer is that we \nneed a vote now because the delay in extending current tax policy is \nhaving a very real impact on our economy today.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office again estimates that the \nmere possibility of pending tax increases and spending cuts will lower \nU.S. GDP by one-half of 1 percent in the second half of this year--not \nnext year, this year. The reason for this is simple. Americans, whether \nthey be investors, small business owners, or simply consumers, \nunderstand that they may have a larger tax bill come next year, meaning \nthey will have less aftertax income. Faced with that possibility, we \nshould not be surprised if Americans are choosing to consume less or \nput off business investments until they know what their tax situation \nis going to be.\n  Just this week there was a Bloomberg article entitled ``Fiscal Cliff \nConcerns Hurting Economy As Companies Hold Back.'' The article quoted a \nsenior economist at Bank of America who said, ``You don't board up the \nwindows when the hurricane is there. You board up the windows in \nanticipation.'' This economist predicted U.S. growth decelerating to \n1.3 percent in the third quarter of this year and 1 percent in the \nfourth quarter.\n  The moral of the story is clear. The sooner we act to extend the \ncurrent tax rates, the better off our economy will be and the better \noff will be the 12.7 million Americans who are currently unemployed. \nThe sooner we act, the better off will be the 5.4 million Americans who \nhave been unemployed long term or the 46.2 million Americans living in \npoverty or the record 46 million Americans who receive food stamps.\n  I agree with President Obama when he said in August of 2009, ``You \ndon't raise taxes in a recession.'' End quote of President Obama in \nAugust of 2009.\n  If you should not raise taxes in a recession, it stands to reason you \nalso should not raise taxes that will cause a recession. I also agree \nwith a number of my Democratic colleagues quoted earlier this week in \nan article about these pending tax increases. I agree with Senator Jim \nWebb, who is quoted as saying, ``We shouldn't raise taxes on ordinary \nincome.'' I agree with Senator Ben Nelson, ``My druthers is to extend \nthe tax cuts for everybody.''\n  I agree with former Senator Pete Domenici and former OMB Director \nAlice Rivlin, who appeared before the Finance Committee earlier this \nweek, and who both agreed we need a short-term extension of current tax \nlaw in order to get us to a place where we can consider fundamental \nreforms to our Tax Code and our entitlement programs.\n  Even former President Bill Clinton, a major surrogate for the Obama \ncampaign, admitted the obvious when he said recently that a short-term \nextension of the tax cuts might be necessary.\n  Former President Clinton and other Democratic Members whom I \nmentioned have not suddenly become supply-side tax cutters. But they \nrealize it is simply common sense that with the economy slowing, the \nlast thing the Congress should do is slam on the brakes by allowing \nmassive tax increases.\n  We were reminded earlier this week just how destructive the proposed \nincome tax rate increases would be on the sector of our economy \nresponsible for the bulk of new job creation, and that is our small \nbusinesses. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee \non Taxation released on June 18, the tax increases that President Obama \nhas proposed would hit more than half--53 percent, to be precise--of \nall flowthrough business income. The Joint Tax Committee estimates that \n40,000 business owners would find themselves subject to higher tax \nrates next year.\n  Does anyone think, with unemployment above 8 percent for 41 straight \nmonths, that higher taxes on nearly a million business owners is the \nright policy? Yet that is exactly where we are headed if we do not act.\n  Of course, extending current tax law temporarily is only a short-term \nfix. What is needed is comprehensive tax reform, much like the Tax \nReform Act of 1986. Real tax reform will drive economic growth higher, \nwill lead to robust job creation, and result in more revenue to the \nFederal Government. But real tax reform will require Presidential \nleadership, something that has been unfortunately lacking over the past \n3\\1/2\\ years. Perhaps next year we will have a President truly willing \nto commit to tax reform, a President who is not content with simply \nreleasing a 23-page framework for corporate tax reform. But until we \nget to comprehensive tax reform, the least we can do now is ensure that \nAmericans do not face a massive new tax hike.\n  In conclusion, we are facing a moment of truth. We can choose to put \nour heads in the sand and pretend as though Taxmaggedon is not real, we \ncan choose to accept slower economic growth for the remainder of this \nyear and a recession in the first half of next year or we can choose to \ntake action in a way that says, loudly and clearly to all Americans, \nnow is not the time for a massive new tax increase.\n  I am hopeful we will see a bill from the House of Representatives in \nthe coming weeks to extend the tax rates in order to avert Taxmaggedon. \nIf the Senate majority is serious in its rhetoric of getting our \neconomy back on track, they will allow a straight up-or-down vote on \nthis measure. Fundamental tax reform may need to wait until the next \nCongress, but we can and we should act immediately to forestall the \nlooming tax increases that we know will throw this economy back into a \nrecession. It is not a Republican or a Democratic thing to do, it is \nsimply common sense. I am hopeful the Democratic majority will allow \nfor debate and vote on an extension of the current tax rates sooner \nrather than later. Every day we wait is another day our economy suffers \nunnecessarily.\n  I do not have to tell anybody here, if you look at all the economic \ndata that comes in month after month, we have the weakest economic \nrecovery in 60 years. We have 23 million unemployed or underemployed \nAmericans. We have, as I said, 41 consecutive months now of \nunemployment over 8 percent, and we have anemic, sluggish growth \nprojections next year by the Congressional Budget Office if in fact we \ndo not take the steps necessary to avert Taxmaggedon.\n  I hope the House of Representatives will vote. I hope the U.S. Senate \nwill follow suit. I hope the President of the United States will join \nus in recognizing that we cannot afford to allow taxes to go up--the \nlargest tax increase in American history--on January 1 of next year.\n  We cannot wait until a lameduck session to address it, because every \nsingle day we do, Americans, investors, small businesses are putting \noff decisions about hiring, about putting their capital to work and \ngrowing this economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                             Debt And Taxes\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, next week I will probably speak more \nabout this. But looking at tax policy and debt and whatnot--I urge \nSenators to look at the article written by Walter Pincus in today's \nWashington Post. The two wars we have been in, Iraq and Afghanistan--\nthe two longest wars in America's history--are noted not just for their \nlength but for the fact that it is the only time America has gone to \nwar where we have not had a special tax to pay for the war. In fact, it \nis the only time America has gone to war where we not only have not had \na tax to pay\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nfor the war but we have ended up with a tax cut, and we ended up \ntrillions of dollars in debt as a result.\n  I hope we will come to the time that we will say--especially with \nwars of choice, these were not cases where we were attacked that there \nwas a totally unnecessary war in Iraq--totally unnecessary. We went to \nwar in Iraq and said we will put it on our credit card.\n  Of course, there were no weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had \nnothing to do with 9/11. A bad guy was running it, but there are a lot \nof countries we support with bad guys running them. There are $1 \ntrillion and thousands of American lives--tens of thousands of \ncoalition and Iraqi lives--gone, and our children are going to have a \n$1 trillion bill to pay for it and we got absolutely nothing out of it.\n  We went in Afghanistan to get Osama bin Laden. We got him. We have \nbeen stuck there for years--another $1 trillion to beef up a corrupt \ngovernment, and our children and grandchildren will be given the bill. \nThen we talk about what else can we do that we will not pay for? We \nshould think about it. Let me speak now about a more positive thing.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Earlier today, the Senate passed legislation to address one of the \nmost significant legislative issues on our agenda this year--making \nneeded reforms to our Nation's agriculture and food systems.\n  I have been both chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee and I think I can say, probably as well as anybody here, how \nmuch thanks the U.S. Senate and the country owe to Chairwoman Stabenow \nand Ranking Member Roberts, who did what Senators are supposed to do. \nThey worked together in a bipartisan way to advance the farm bill, the \nAgriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2012.\n  A lot of what people criticize about the Congress today would \ndisappear if everyone acted the way Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan \ndid, and Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas did, working across party lines, \nacross ideologies, to try to put together a farm bill that is not a \nDemocratic or Republican farm bill, but a farm bill for the United \nStates of America. I am so proud of them.\n  I mentioned earlier today to Chairwoman Stabenow, I don't know how \nmany times she called me weekends when I was at my home in Vermont, or \nsent me e-mails late in the evening, because she was trying to keep \nthis coalition going.\n  The work of these leaders and the passage of this bill proves that \nthe Senate can act in accordance with its greatest traditions and we \ncan reach across the aisle to pass critical legislation that reflects \ncompromise. As a former Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and \nhaving worked closely with Senator Lugar on many bipartisan Farm Bills, \nI know how difficult the task can be of forging a comprehensive bill \nthat addresses the many competing needs. I said earlier that Senator \nRichard Lugar and I traded places back and forth, as either chairman or \nranking member on that committee. We passed bipartisan farm bills. We \nworked closely together, with complete candor and honestness with each \nother, as one would expect from Senator Lugar. We forged these \ncomprehensive bills.\n  The Senate's action today could not have been accomplished without \nthe hard work of many dedicated, wonderful staffers, mine and others, \nboth here in Washington and back home in Vermont. Being such a large \nand far reaching bill there were many staff involved throughout its \ndevelopment and final passage. I would like to thank in particular \nAdrienne Wojciechowski, Michelle Lacko, Aaron Kaigle, Kathryn \nToomajian, Kara Leene, Tom Berry, Chris Saunders, Emma Van Susteren, \nTed Brady, Lauren Bracket, Nikole Manatt, Greg Cota, Will Goodman, \nErica Chabot, and John Dowd from my staff.\n  I would also like to thank both the Chairwoman and Ranking Member's \nstaff on the Senate Agriculture Committee who worked so closely with my \noffice on many different issues and programs including the dairy \nreforms, conservation consolidation, nutrition, rural development, \nforestry, food aid, research, organics, energy, and the wonderful \nimprovements we made to the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance \nProgram.\n  It is not easy to get what we have here, a strong bipartisan bill. So \nI rise to say I hope the House of Representatives will act swiftly to \nconsider legislation that is going to allow us to move to conference. \nBecause just as it was important to the U.S. Senate to get together and \npass this bill by an overwhelming majority, the swift passage of this \nfarm bill is essential. The current Farm Bill expires at the end of \nSeptember. Before August 31, we must address the serious problem of \ndairy policy or our dairy farmers will be left without a vital safety \nnet.\n  Dairy is a crucial industry in Vermont. I hear often from dairy \nfarmers who are worried about the dangerous rollercoaster of price \nswings that impacts both producers and consumers. This is a roller \ncoaster we have been on in dairy pricing in Vermont since January of \n2000. How can any farmer stay in business if this is the way their \nprices go? How can they plan to buy new equipment? How can they plan to \nsend their children to school? How can they plan to modernize their \nfarm if they never know what day the price will be up, what day prices \nwill be down?\n  I hear too often from dairy farmers who meet with me or talk to me \nwhen I am at the grocery store in Vermont, or just walking down the \nstreet. They tell me they are worried about the dangerous roller \ncoaster of prices. These swings impact both consumers and the \nproducers.\n  For our farmers in Vermont, the dairy reforms included in the 2012 \nfarm bill will bring some relief. We simply must free our dairy farmers \nfrom this destructive cycle of volatile price changes.\n  The current Federal safety net provides no protection for dairy \nfarmers from this roller coaster of price volatility.\n  The 2009 dairy crisis brought plummeting milk prices and sky-high \nfeed costs that combined to devastate dairy farmers in ways that many \nwere unable to recover from. Many had to close down. Let's stop the \nroller coaster. Let's give stability to the hard-working men and women \nwho are dairy farmers. Dairy farmers have come together to identify \nways to move us away from the regional dairy fights and the constant \npolicy conflicts between small and large farms. The results are the \nchanges included in the 2012 Farm Bill, which will help farmers and \nconsumers move away from these volatile price swings. Now we will have \nsome protection.\n  The 2012 Farm Bill scraps outdated price supports and the Milk Income \nLoss Contract Program. It establishes a new risk management plan that \nprotects farm income when margins shrink dangerously, and a \nstabilization program to allow farmers to take a proactive role in \neasing the instability in our dairy markets. And it accomplishes this \nat a lower cost than the current program that it replaces while \ncontributing to the savings to this bill. It is a voluntary program, \nand can be tailored by the farmer to fit their individual needs.\n  Dairy is Vermont's largest agricultural commodity. Dairy products \naccount for upward of 83 percent--or 90 percent depending on market \nprices--of Vermont's agricultural products sales. I am proud the dairy \nfarmers of Vermont have had a voice in developing this farm bill, and \nenacting it is going to bring long-needed relief to the industry.\n  I hope that the House can now come together in a bipartisan way, just \nas we did in the Senate, to quickly pass a bipartisan Farm Bill. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike came together in this body, so surely \nit can be done. We know the impact of this legislation goes well beyond \nour farms and forests to our economy, our families, and our kitchen \ntables.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\n                  Tribute to Governor Gaston Caperton\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate former West \nVirginia Gov. Gaston Caperton on 30 years of outstanding leadership as \nthe president of the College Board.\n  It is my privilege to honor Governor Caperton, a native of \nCharleston, WV, for his leadership in the field of education. Governor \nCaperton's own childhood experience instilled in him the importance of \neducation at a very young age. As a child who struggled with dyslexia, \nhe was able to overcome the hurdles he faced in the classroom and truly \nachieve educational excellence. He earned his bachelor's degree in \nbusiness from the University of North Carolina and has taught at \nprestigious institutions, including Harvard and Columbia University. He \nalso holds 10 honorary doctoral degrees.\n  Governor Caperton returned to the great State of West Virginia and \nserved as Governor from 1989 to 1997. During his two terms in office, \nGovernor Caperton made education a top priority and improved the lives \nof thousands of West Virginia students. He supported an $800 million \nschool renovation program that directly benefited two-thirds of West \nVirginia's public school students, facilitating classroom upgrades and \nadditional renovations in all of our schools. Governor Caperton has \nbeen recognized nationally for working to upgrade our State's classroom \ntechnology to keep West Virginia students competitive in an \nincreasingly global economy. In addition, he helped raise teacher \nsalaries from 49th place to 31st place in the Nation.\n  Governor Caperton's leadership in education left a lasting legacy in \nour State, and I am so proud of the work he did for West Virginia \nschools and all of our students.\n  In 1999 Gaston Caperton was appointed the eighth president of the \nCollege Board. Over the past 13 years Governor Caperton has done such \nimportant work to make higher education available to a greater number \nof students, especially those from underserved areas, and that is truly \nsomething of which to be proud. No matter their background, we need to \ndo all we can to help our students achieve a higher level of education \nif we are going to create the jobs and train the workforce that makes \nAmerica the greatest Nation in the world.\n  Since 1999 the College Board has reached a total of 23,000 high \nschools and 3,800 colleges and has served 7 million students and \nparents. The organization continues to provide college preparatory \nmaterials and has dramatically changed college entrance exams. In \naddition, the College Board has enabled students' enrollment in \nadvanced placement courses, and Governor Caperton is responsible for \nmore than tripling the number of students from low-income backgrounds \ntaking AP courses.\n  Governor Caperton has continued to be a champion for students as he \nsupports financial aid policies and programs, while advocating for \ntuition equity. From his tenure as Governor, to his work at Harvard and \nColumbia Universities, to his 13 years of leadership at the College \nBoard, providing equal opportunities in the classroom has been the \ndriving force behind Gaston Caperton's career. I am proud to honor this \noutstanding West Virginian and recognize his achievements in the field \nof education. I am also extremely proud to call him my friend, as do \nmost all West Virginians.\n\n\n                        Prescription Drug Abuse\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise today to express my deep concern and my \ndisappointment that the special interest groups who have a vested \nfinancial interest have derailed a strong effort to fight prescription \ndrug abuse. It is an epidemic that is devastating communities all \nacross this Nation. They got their victory--but not at my expense. The \npeople who will pay the price are the young boys and girls in \ncommunities all across this Nation who are seeing their families and \ntheir schools and their neighborhoods wrecked by abuse and addiction.\n  What my amendment would do is simply this: It would require patients \nto get a new prescription to get their pills refilled. What we have \nright now in trying to schedule hydrocodone from a schedule III to a \nschedule II is the ease of availability and the prescriptions that are \nbeing refilled without any visits to their doctors. It is of an \nepidemic proportion. The pills would have to be stored and transported \nmore securely, and traffickers would be subject to increased fines and \npenalties.\n  I am not trying to put anyone out of business. In fighting for this \namendment, I asked anyone and everyone who was opposed to come to see \nme, and if we could find a way to work together, we would do that. We \ntried to accommodate the groups who were worried about additional \nadministrative costs, such as new security requirements for storing \nhydrocodone, or additional paperwork that would come as a result of \nrescheduling. But at the end of the day these groups seemed more \nconcerned with their business plans and the ability to sell more pills \nthan the responsibility we all have to protect the future of this \ncountry and the future of the generation we are counting on to lead and \ndefend this country.\n  Since the moment the Senate adopted my hydrocodone rescheduling \namendment, lobbyists have been turning out in droves to fight this \neffort to limit people's ability to get pills too easily and abuse \nthem. Yesterday these lobbyists got a victory when the House of \nRepresentatives passed a compromise version of the FDA bill that does \nnot contain my amendment, and I assume the Senate will do the same.\n  Just a few weeks ago it was a different story. I was so proud when \nthe Senate unanimously adopted this amendment because this is a problem \nthat affects every single Member in every single State. I don't know of \na person in this country who doesn't have somebody in their immediate \nfamily, extended family, or a close friend who has not been affected by \nthe abuse of prescription drugs. Where I come from, that is an \nepidemic. It is an epidemic we all have and we all are facing. In fact, \nprescription drug abuse is responsible for about 75 percent of drug-\nrelated deaths in the United States and 90 percent in my State of West \nVirginia. According to the White House Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, prescription drug abuse is the fastest growing drug problem in \nthe United States, and it is claiming the lives of thousands of \nAmericans every day.\n  I understand that limiting access to hydrocodone pills doesn't \nnecessarily fit into the model of selling more product, but I also \nunderstand this: We have a responsibility to this Nation and, most \nimportantly, to the next generation to win the war on drugs.\n  I have been a businessperson all of my life. I understand that in \nbusiness one has to have a good business plan to be successful. One \nshould also have the ability to alter that plan when necessary, while \nstill being successful. I assure my colleagues that this is one of \nthose necessary times. The health of our country and the public good \nare at stake.\n  I am hearing on a daily basis from people and businesses--small, \nmedium-sized, and large--that are having a hard time finding qualified \nworkers--qualified workers who can pass a drug test.\n  We have folks who cannot get the type of education they need to be \npart of the workforce of the 21st century because they are drug \nimpaired.\n  I have been in Washington a short time compared to some of my \ncolleagues, but I have been here long enough to know the pressures \nMembers face around here when special interest groups get entrenched--\nit is no different in the Presiding Officer's beautiful State of \nDelaware and my State of West Virginia--and it does not look like my \namendment will go into this bill. But I can assure you, it will not go \naway and neither will the problem of drug abuse. I am determined to see \nthis thing through. This measure will pass. It might not be this year, \nit might not be next year, but I assure you it will pass.\n  Until we do something, there are going to be families who are \nseparated and torn apart because of drug abuse and little kids who come \nto me and the Chair and plead for help because their daddy is addicted \nor their mother is hooked on drugs or they have had a brother or a \nsister or a friend who has overdosed or died.\n  I do not pretend this amendment will solve the entire problem of \nprescription drug abuse. But when every law enforcement agency--listen, \nevery law enforcement agency in America, every\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\none of them to a T, which we rely on to fight the war on drugs--has \nsupported this amendment openly and spoken out loudly and clearly that \nit would help them tremendously, I do not know how we can ignore this \nproblem much longer.\n  The fact is we must act. I can assure you that working together, as \nwe do, we will find a way to move forward with this vital piece of \nlegislation.\n  I promise the Presiding Officer this: I will continue to fight this \nwar on drugs with him, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. \nThis is a war we cannot afford to lose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to do what I have done week after \nweek since the health care bill was signed into law by President Obama, \nto offer a doctor's second opinion about the health care law, a law \nthat I believe is bad for patients, bad for providers--the nurses and \nthe doctors who take care of those patients--and I believe it is \nterrible for the American taxpayers.\n  I come to the floor because the Supreme Court is soon going to rule \non the constitutionality of the President's health care law.\n  The Court's decision will revolve around, primarily, the individual \nmandate, the component of the law requiring all individuals to purchase \nnot just health insurance but government-approved health insurance.\n  Never in the history of this country has the Federal Government \nrequired individuals to purchase a product, to come into our homes and \ntell us we must buy a government-approved product. Why? Simply because \nwe happen to be a citizen of the United States.\n  The American people are not happy with this mandate. As a matter of \nfact, a recent Gallup poll found that 72 percent of Americans believe \nthe mandate is unconstitutional. The results of the Gallup poll, \nhowever, are not surprising.\n  As I travel across Wyoming, I hear constantly from people who are \nopposed to the mandate.\n  It is not just the mandate they are opposed to. But, specifically, \nthe mandate is what brings people all across the country together to be \nopposed to the law.\n  It is interesting when I go and have meetings and talk to folks. I \nwill ask them: Under the President's health care law--remember, the one \nwhere he promised insurance rates would drop by $2,500 per family--how \nmany of you actually believe your own insurance rates will go up, and \nevery hand goes up.\n  Then, when I ask: How many of you think the quality and availability \nof care for you and your family is going to go down, again, the hands \ngo up.\n  It is not just the mandate; it is the entire health care law that is \na problem for patients and providers and the taxpayers.\n  But the mandate is interesting. I bring this to the attention of the \nSenate because President Obama, at one point, was opposed to the \nmandate. When he was running for President, during his campaign for the \nWhite House, then the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Obama, quipped: ``If a \nmandate was the solution, we can try to solve homelessness by mandating \neverybody to buy a house.''\n  Now the President's tune has obviously changed.\n  I believe the mandate is unconstitutional. I believe if the Court \nstrikes down the mandate, the rest of the law should also be found \nunconstitutional.\n  During the health care debate 2 years ago, supporters of the law \nrepeatedly stated--repeatedly stated--that the mandate was an essential \ncomponent of the law. So let's review what folks have said.\n  Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius and Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder, in an op-ed in the Washington Post, wrote: \n``Without an individual responsibility provision''--is what they called \nthe individual mandate--the law ``doesn't work.''\n  The law ``doesn't work.''\n  Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi also came to this same conclusion. In two \nseparate blog posts, she stated that without the individual mandate, \nthe math, she said, behind the health care law does not work.\n  The current chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, \nalso came to this same conclusion during the debate on the health care \nlaw.\n  During a committee hearing, Chairman Baucus stated that allowing \nindividuals to opt out of the individual mandate would ``strike at the \nheart of health care reform.''\n  Finally, Senate Democrats in their amicus curiae brief filed with the \nSupreme Court argued that the individual mandate is an ``integral \npart'' of the health care law.\n  It seems to me that supporters of the law from the very beginning of \nthis debate recognized that without the individual mandate, the rest of \nthe health care law would need to go away.\n  Now it seems Washington Democrats are changing their tune and coming \nto a different conclusion.\n  In a story published by the Associated Press on June 18 of this year, \nit was reported that ``the Obama Administration plans to move ahead \nwith major parts of the President's health care law if its most \ncontroversial provision''--obviously, the individual mandate--``does \nnot survive.'' In fact, an anonymous, high-level Democratic official \ndeclared that the administration would move ``full speed ahead'' with \nimplementation of the health care law.\n\n  It seems the administration only views the mandate as essential when \nit is politically convenient.\n  As I have stated many times before, I believe the entire health care \nlaw needs to be completely repealed and replaced. This law does not \naddress runaway health care spending, it increases taxes, and it hurts \njob creation at a time of 8.2 percent unemployment across the country, \nat a time when college graduates are moving back home because they \ncannot find work, when people are underemployed, people have given up \nlooking for work. Yet the health care law adds to the costs and adds to \nthe uncertainty of these uncertain times and a weak economy.\n  The American people want a healthy economy, and this health care law \nis making it worse. If the law's individual mandate is struck down, the \nPresident should not implement whatever is left standing. Instead, he \nshould work with Congress--both sides of the aisle--to implement \ncommonsense, step-by-step reforms that will actually lower the cost of \nhealth care for all Americans.\n  It seems to be lost on many that the original goal of health care \nreform was actually to lower the cost of care. It is what the President \ntalked about in his initial speech to the joint session of Congress. \nBut it is something that was ignored when the 2,700-page health care \nlaw was presented to Congress and the American people.\n  Americans know what they want. They know what they have been looking \nfor in a health care law, and this is not it. Americans deserve a law \nthat helps them get the care they need, from the doctor they choose--\nnot that the government chooses, not that the insurance company \nchooses: the doctor they choose--and at lower cost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin).

Mr. President, today is the culmination of several days of \nactivities across the Nation in recognition of the oldest known \nobservance of the ending of slavery--``Juneteenth Independence Day''.\n  It was in June of 1865, that the Union soldiers landed in Galveston, \nTX, with the news that the war had ended and that slavery finally had \ncome to an end in the United States. This was 2\\1/2\\ years after \nPresident Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which was \nissued on January 1, 1863, and months after the conclusion of the Civil \nWar.\n  This week and specifically on June 19, when slaves in the Southwest \nfinally learned of the end of slavery, the descendants of slaves have \nobserved this anniversary of emancipation as a remembrance of one of \nthe most tragic periods of our Nation's history. The suffering, \ndegradation and brutality of slavery cannot be repaired, but the memory \ncan serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated again \non American soil.\n  I was very pleased that on June 19 of this week the Senate \nunanimously adopted a resolution, S. Res. 496, recognizing the \nhistorical significance of Juneteenth Independence Day to the Nation. \nThe resolution, which I sponsored along with Senators Hutchison, \nCardin, Landrieu, Cornyn, Sherrod Brown, Boxer, Stabenow, Harkin, \nBegich, Durbin, Wicker, Leahy, Bill Nelson, Casey, Warner, Akaka, Webb, \nLautenberg, Gillibrand, and Schumer expresses support for the \nobservance of Juneteenth Independence Day, and recognizes the faith and \nstrength of character demonstrated by former slaves, that remains an \nexample for all people of the United States, regardless of background \nor race.\n  All across America we also celebrate the many important achievements \nof former slaves and their descendants. We do so because in 1926, Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a recognition as \na way of preserving the history of African Americans and recognizing \nthe enormous contributions of a people of great strength, dignity, \nfaith, and conviction--a people who rendered their achievements for the \nbetterment and advancement of a Nation once lacking in humanity towards \nthem. Every February, nationwide, we celebrate African American History \nMonth. And, every year on June 19, we celebrate ``Juneteenth \nIndependence Day.''\n  Lerone Bennett, Jr., writer, scholar, lecturer, and acclaimed \nExecutive Editor for several decades at Ebony Magazine, has reflected \non the life and times of Dr. Woodson. Bennett tells us that one of the \nmost inspiring and instructive stories in African American history is \nthe story of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West \nVirginia to the summit of academic achievement:\n\n       At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal \n     Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after \n     teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, \n     he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum \n     in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at \n     Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines \n     and studied Latin and Greek\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\n     between trips to the mine shafts. He then went on to the \n     University of Chicago, where he received his bachelor's and \n     master's degrees, and Harvard University, where he became the \n     second Black to receive a doctorate in history. The rest is \n     history--Black history.\n\n  In keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I \nwould like to pay tribute to two courageous women, claimed by my home \nState of Michigan, who played significant roles in addressing American \ninjustice and inequality. These are two women of different times who \nwould change the course of history.\n  The contributions of Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out \nof the dark days of slavery, and Rosa Parks whose dignified leadership \nsparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the civil rights \nmovement are indelibly etched in the chronicle of the history of this \nNation. Moreover, they are viewed with distinction and admiration \nthroughout the world.\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement, and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of \nequality for women. Michigan has honored her with the dedication of the \nSojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle Creek, \nMI, on September 25, 1999. In April 2009, Sojourner Truth became the \nfirst African American woman to be memorialized with a bust in the U.S. \nCapitol. The ceremony to unveil Truth's likeness was appropriately held \nin Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor's Center. I was pleased to \ncosponsor the legislation to make this fitting tribute possible. \nSojourner Truth lived in Washington, DC for several years, helping \nslaves who had fled from the South and appearing at women's suffrage \ngatherings. She returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained there \nuntil her death in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the \nmost troubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's convictions \nis that her words continue to speak to us today.\n  On May 4, 1999, legislation was enacted which authorized the \nPresident of the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to \nRosa Parks. I was pleased to coauthor this tribute to Rosa Parks--the \ngentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the \nhumiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. I was \nalso pleased to be a part of the effort to direct the Architect of the \nCapitol to commission a statue of Rosa Parks, which will soon be placed \nin the U.S. Capitol, making her the second African American woman to \nreceive such an honor.\n  Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence \nand respect by us all. Over 55 years ago, in Montgomery, AL, the modern \ncivil rights movement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat \nand move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this \ncourageous woman captured the consciousness of not only the American \npeople, but the entire world. The boycott which Rosa Parks began was \nthe start of an American revolution that elevated the status of African \nAmericans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who \nwould one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr. In addition, the overwhelming majority \nof my colleagues in the Senate joined me in sponsoring legislation \nauthorizing the Congressional Gold Medal to be presented to Dr. King, \nposthumously, and Coretta Scott King in recognition of their \ncontributions to the Nation. Companion legislation was led in the House \nby Representative John Lewis.\n  We have come a long way toward achieving justice and equality for \nall. We still however have work to do. In the names of Rosa Parks, \nSojourner Truth, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nand many others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle \nof civil rights and human rights.\n  Mr. President, I was also pleased to join Senator Hutchison and other \nMembers of the Senate this week, in sponsoring another measure \nintroduced on June 19th in recognition of Juneteenth Independence Day, \nwhich will require further action in the Senate. It is a Joint \nResolution, S.J. Res. 45, requesting the President to issue a \nproclamation each year designating Juneteenth Independence Day as a \nNational Day of Observance, encouraging Americans of all races, creeds, \nand ethnic backgrounds to celebrate freedom and the end of slavery in \nthe United States.\n  In closing, I would like to commend the Juneteenth directors and \nevent coordinators throughout my State of Michigan. They have worked \ntirelessly in the planning of intergenerational activities in \nobservance of Juneteenth, heading up a wide range of activities over \nseveral days in Detroit, Flint, Holland, Lansing, Saginaw, and other \nareas around the State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4411-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4411-S4412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EPA EMISSION STANDARDS RULE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on December 21, 2011, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, finalized the mercury and air toxics standards, \nMATS, rule for powerplants. These standards, which will be fully in \neffect in 2016, will require coal-fired powerplants to install \npollution controls for mercury and toxic air pollution. When fully \nimplemented, the MATS for powerplants will reduce mercury emissions \nfrom powerplants by 90 percent, acid gases by 88 percent, and \nparticulate emissions, including nonmercury toxic metals, by 41 \npercent. Senator Inhofe's S.J. Res. 37 would disapprove and nullify \nthis rule and, more importantly, make it impossible for the EPA to \nimplement substantially similar rules in the future.\n  The State of Maine, located at the end of our Nation's ``air \npollution tailpipe,'' is on the receiving end of pollution emissions \nfrom coal-fired powerplants operating in other States. The pollution \nreductions required under the rule will improve public health and \nimprove the environment in our State. That is why I will vote to uphold \nthe clean air rule that requires coal-fired powerplants to install \npollution controls.\n  While legitimate concerns have been raised that additional compliance \ntime and more cost-effective options are needed, I have significant \nconcerns with overturning this rule and permanently barring the EPA \nfrom issuing any standards in the future that are substantially \nsimilar. I will push the EPA to work with utilities to develop \nreasonable implementation schedules.\n  Reductions in air pollutants from other States will reduce air \npollution in Maine, which has one of the highest asthma rates in the \nNation, affecting 1 in 10 adults and over 25,000 children. The EPA \nestimates that the MATS will prevent 130,000 cases of childhood asthma \nsymptoms.\n  Every State in the country has issued mercury advisories for human \nfish consumption because of high levels of mercury in our Nation's \nstreams, lakes, and rivers, and half of U.S. manmade mercury comes from \ncoal-fired powerplants. Mercury is one of the most persistent and \ndangerous pollutants, particularly harmful to children and pregnant \nwomen, and it threatens our health and environment today. Under the new \nrule, 90 percent of this mercury would be removed. I am a longtime \nsupporter of efforts to reduce mercury pollution and have sponsored \nlegislation to establish a nationwide mercury monitoring system to \naccurately measure mercury levels.\n  The rule also includes standards for 186 other hazardous pollutants, \nincluding arsenic, acid gases, and toxic metals. Additionally, the \nequipment installed to control these pollutants will not only reduce \nthese hazardous air pollutants but also capture fine particles, which \nare linked to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.\n  I am a longtime supporter of Clean Air Act protections. This landmark \nlegislation, authored by Maine's own Senator Ed Muskie more than 40 \nyears ago, has helped protect and improve our Nation's air quality and \npublic health for decades.\n  I also support sensible regulatory reforms and have introduced \nlegislation that calls for Federal agencies to analyze the cost and \nbenefits of proposed regulations, including the impact on job creation \nand consumer prices. This will help cut the tangle of redtape that is \nholding businesses back from expanding and adding jobs. But when it \ncomes to the air we breathe, I reject the false choice of pitting the \nenvironment against the economy because we\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\nunderstand that for much of the State of Maine, the environment is the \neconomy.\n  The people of Maine have always been faithful stewards of our \nenvironment because we understand its tremendous value to our way of \nlife.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nbicentennial celebration of the War of 1812. The U.S. Congress declared \nwar on Great Britain 200 years ago this week. The State of Maryland is \nproud of its contributions to this ``Second War for Independence,'' \nwhich reinforced United States sovereignty and gave birth to our \nnational anthem.\n  A generation after the United States declared its independence from \nGreat Britain, the mercantilist ties between the two countries were not \nfully severed. The British impressed American merchant seamen, enforced \nillegal and unfair trade regulations, colluded with certain Native \nAmerican tribes to attack frontier settlements, and attempted to block \nwestward expansion. The United States declared war to assert autonomy \nover its own affairs once again, establish free trade, protect sailors' \nrights, and ensure that our Nation could prosper from sea to shining \nsea.\n  President James Madison eloquently outlined these reasons 200 years \nago when he called on ``all the good people of the United States, as \nthey love their country, as they value the precious heritage derived \nfrom the virtue and valor of their fathers . . . [to] exert themselves \nin preserving order, in promoting concord, in maintaining the authority \nand efficacy of the laws, and in supporting and invigorating all the \nmeasures which may be adopted by the constituted authorities for \nobtaining a speedy, a just, and an honorable peace.''\n  The contributions of the U.S. Navy were instrumental in repelling the \nBritish during the War of 1812. The U.S. Navy hardly had a dozen \nwarships compared to the hundreds of ships comprising the British \nfleet. British ships were undermanned, however, while well-trained and \ntalented officers and seamen took command of American ships. These men \nwere largely from coastal States, like Maryland, and were accustomed to \nseafaring. COMO Matthew Perry took on the British Navy on Lake Erie in \n1813 with a scrappy fleet of light ships. Even though his force was \nseemingly decimated by the British, Commodore Perry resorted to \npaddling a rowboat with a banner that read ``Don't Give up the Ship.'' \nHe then boarded the Niagara, double-loaded the carronades, and sailed \ndirectly into the British line, ultimately claiming victory.\n  The following summer, in 1814, the British Navy sailed up the \nChesapeake Bay to attack our Nation's capital and seize the valuable \nport city of Baltimore. The British dealt heavy blows to Washington, \nDC, setting both the U.S. Capitol and the White House ablaze. British \nforces then moved toward Baltimore. Citizens of Baltimore, including \nfree Blacks, quickly mobilized to protect their city. Barricades \nstretching more than 1 mile long were constructed to protect the \nharbor, hulls were sunk to impede navigation, and a chain of masts was \nerected across the harbor entrance. When the British fleet approached \nBaltimore at North Point, Marylanders fought the British Army and \nhelped repulse the British Navy from Fort McHenry during the Battle of \nBaltimore. It is important to note that American forces during the \nBattle of North Point were volunteer militia, heavily outnumbered by \nthe highly trained British infantry, but managed to delay the British \nforces long enough for 10,000 American reinforcements to arrive, \npreventing a land attack against Baltimore. Following 25 hours of \nintense British naval bombardment at Fort McHenry, the American \ndefenders refused to yield, and the British were forced to depart.\n  During the bombardment, American lawyer Francis Scott Key, who was \nbeing held on board an American flag-of-truce vessel in Baltimore \nHarbor, took notice of the American flag still flying atop Fort \nMcHenry. Key realized then that the Americans had survived the battle \nand stopped the enemy advance. He was so moved by the sight of the \nAmerican flag flying following the horrific bombardment, he composed a \npoem called ``The Defense of Fort McHenry,'' which was published in the \nBaltimore Patriot and Advertiser newspaper later that year. This poem, \nand later the song, inspired love of country among the American people \nand not only helped usher in the ``era of good feelings'' immediately \nafter the war, but became a timeless reminder of American resolve. \n``The Star Spangled Banner'' officially became our National Anthem in \n1931. The flag that flew over Fort McHenry and inspired this anthem is \nnow a national treasure on display at the Smithsonian Institution, a \nvery short distance from where we are today.\n  The War of 1812 confirmed the legitimacy of the Revolution and served \nas a critical test for the U.S. Constitution and newly established \ndemocratic government. Our young Nation battled against the largest, \nmost powerful military on the Earth at that time and emerged with an \nenhanced standing among the countries of the world, both militarily and \ndiplomatically. The U.S. economy was freed of its dependence on British \ngoods, which unleashed domestic manufacturing and spawned the \nindustrial revolution. The U.S. Navy proved its worth and the U.S. \nCongress rewarded the Navy with funding for a permanent, more expansive \nfleet. A new generation of Americans too young to remember Lord \nCornwallis's surrender at Yorktown, which effectively ended the \nRevolutionary War, and an older generation proud of defending American \nindependence twice in their lifetimes, were inspired by Francis Scott \nKey's words, which embody our universal feelings of patriotism and \ncourage.\n  As a Marylander, I am proud of the contributions of my State in the \nWar of 1812 and I have been involved in legislative efforts to bring \ngreater attention to this bicentennial celebration. My colleague, \nRepresentative Dutch Ruppersberger, and I sponsored the Commemorative \nCoin Act, which President Obama signed into law in August 2010, \ndirecting the U.S. Mint to create coins commemorating this important \nanniversary. These gold and silver coin designs are emblematic of the \nWar of 1812, particularly the Battle of Baltimore that inspired our \nNational Anthem. The coins are on sale this year only and the \nsurcharges from these commemorative coins will provide support to the \nMaryland War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission to conduct activities, \nassist in educational outreach, and preserve sites and structures \nrelating to the War of 1812.\n  I am proud that Maryland will lead the Star-Spangled 200 celebration, \na 3-year celebration that just began with Baltimore's ``Sailabration'' \nthis past weekend. The Navy's Blue Angels treated spectators to \ndazzling air shows; the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra premiered the \n``Overture for 2012,'' composed by Philip Glass; and dozens of tall \nships and naval warships from around the world anchored in the Inner \nHarbor, open for public tours. Through 2014, Maryland will host \nnumerous events along the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail \nand at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine to celebrate \nthe bicentennial. This commemoration is an opportunity to showcase to \nthe world that Maryland is an exceptional place to live, work, and \nvisit.\n  I am also proud that the U.S. Senate unanimously adopted a resolution \nI sponsored to mark the bicentennial, to celebrate the heroism of the \nAmerican people during the conflict, and to recognize the various \norganizations involved in the bicentennial celebration, including the \nU.S. Armed Forces, the National Park Service, and the Maryland War of \n1812 Bicentennial Commission. As we recognize all of these ongoing \nefforts during this commemorative period, I encourage all Americans to \nremember the sacrifice of those who gave their lives to defend our \nnation's freedom and democracy in its infancy, and to join in the \nbicentennial celebration of our victory in the War of 1812.\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4413-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4413-S4414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 UNIQUE SIGNIFICANCE OF SHELBURNE FARMS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont boasts many gems that draw visitors \nto our Green Mountains. Among them is Shelburne Farms, known to many \nVermonters--and many visitors to Vermont--for its work on historic \npreservation, agriculture, sustainability, and nutrition. And so it was \nwith great interest and appreciation that I read an article about the \nFarm's caretakers in the Burlington Free Press.\n  I have been proud of the work Alec Webb and his wife, Megan Camp, \nhave done at Shelburne Farms for the last many years. Through their \nleadership, Shelburne Farms has become a first-rate educational hub, \npromoting environmental conservation, food education and agriculture \nsustainability. The partnerships initiated by Alec and Megan with the \nNational Park Service Conservation Studies Institute and with the \nUniversity of Vermont Center for Sustainable Agriculture have furthered \nthese goals.\n  Today, Shelburne Farms is a National Historic Landmark, a distinction \nI was proud to help secure in 2001 because they earned it. During this \nweek's debate on the Farm Bill, I think it is fitting to highlight the \nimportant work being done at Shelburne Farms. Others can take a page \nfrom their successful playbook as we explore ways to bolster our green \neconomy, put food on Americans' tables, and promote the environmental \nstewardship that continues to protect our farm lands and environment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this article, ``A Vision \nRealized,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, June 16, 2012]\n\n                           A Vision Realized\n\n\n Alec Webb is living--and managing--a vision he returned home to create\n\n                           (By Sally Pollak)\n\n       Shelburne.--The summer Alec Webb turned 18, he ran his \n     first camp. He pitched a tent in a field in his backyard--it \n     was a big yard, about 1,000 acres--and camped out for six \n     weeks with kids from Labrador, the Bronx, and a Cambridge, \n     Mass., housing project. There were a couple of locals, too.\n       ``It was a funky group of urban and rural kids,'' said \n     Webb, who will turn 60 next month. It was the summer of 1970 \n     and Webb, now president of Shelburne Farms, was a recent high \n     school graduate. He had left Groton School, a prep school \n     outside Boston, spring semester of his senior year and moved \n     back home. Webb spent his last semester at the Shaker \n     Mountain School, an alternative school in Burlington, where \n     he earned credit to graduate from Groton.\n       ``Instead of going abroad, I went to Burlington,'' Webb \n     joked.\n       He left Groton because the school had become, to him, \n     irrelevant.\n       ``It was the '60s and that (Groton) environment didn't feel \n     relevant to what was going on in the world,'' Webb said. ``I \n     wanted to be in an environment that was more real, more \n     connected to what was going on in the world. A place that was \n     engaged with more meaningful social issues.'' In that \n     context, Webb pitched a tent, built a campfire, and invited \n     kids over. The campers even spent a solo night in the field, \n     grown-up free (if you can call Webb, a newly minted 18-year-\n     old, a grown-up).\n       ``They all seemed to survive,'' Webb said.\n       The camp was the original manifestation of Webb's interest \n     in ``meaningful education'' that is an intersection of \n     agriculture, nature and environmental awareness. From these \n     beginnings, at the boyhood home where Webb grew up the fourth \n     of six siblings, Shelburne Farms would become a nonprofit \n     (incorporated in 1972) whose various endeavors bring 140,000 \n     people a year to the farm.\n       There are so many camps and school programs at Shelburne \n     Farms these days, the child-centric activity prompted Webb to \n     wonder on a recent walk--where packs of happy kids raced \n     around the place--if summer camps had already started.\n       He's no longer sleeping in a field with the kids.\n       These days, you can find him in his corner office in a \n     barn, surrounded by big maps and less-glamorous paperwork. He \n     says he's part town manager, part town planner. And full-time \n     fundraiser.\n       Webb lives with his wife, Megan Camp, the farm's vice \n     president and program director, and their cats Fanta and \n     Stella, in an 1850s shingled farmhouse that predates \n     Shelburne Farms. Other animals sometimes wander onto their \n     lawn. Chickens make regular appearances; goats jump the fence \n     and hang at Webb's place. A donkey came by one morning last \n     week.\n       The visitors come with the territory when you live where \n     you work and work where you live: a teeming campus with \n     activities including walking trails, a Brown Swiss dairy \n     herd, environmental education programs, harvest festivals and \n     a cheese making facility.\n       Shelburne Farms, a onetime private estate, was founded by \n     Webb's great-grandparents and designed by landscape architect \n     Frederick Law Olmstead in the 1880s. At the turn of the \n     century, the lakeside property of Dr. William Seward and Lila \n     Vanderbilt Webb encompassed nearly 4,000 acres. The barn they \n     built for work animals was colossal--so big, in its \n     reincarnated life it houses a cheese-making and packing \n     operation, a school, a woodworking shop, a kid's farmyard, a \n     bakery and offices.\n       In 1972, Shelburne Farms was incorporated as a nonprofit--a \n     decision that was useful in setting the farm on more solid \n     financial ground, Webb said. (His father had to borrow money \n     to pay property taxes, he said.) In seeking a new direction \n     for Shelburne Farms, Webb and his five siblings saw that the \n     property could and should be a community resource and asset, \n     he said. The six young Webbs did not want the dairy farm \n     where they grew up to become a carved-up, high-end suburb of \n     Burlington, Webb said.\n       ``If we all had one-sixth of this place,'' he said, ``we \n     would've spent the rest of our lives dealing with that.''\n       The common experience of growing up on the farm, a love of \n     the land, and an interest in ``responding to the context of \n     the world we were living in at that time,'' helped shape the \n     siblings' shared vision for Shelburne Farms, Webb said.\n       ``Those threads of agriculture, youth, community, those \n     were our intentions,'' he said the other day, eating lunch at \n     a picnic table in the farmyard.\n       ``We started Shelburne Farms because we were worried about \n     all the things that are more pressing now,'' he said, noting \n     climate change wasn't an issue people were thinking about. \n     ``We wondered: `How are we going to get ourselves on a path \n     that could be more sustainable for people and the planet.' \n     The farm would be an expression of a pathway to a better \n     future. Not a model for that, necessarily, but an example of \n     how things can work given a different set of intentions, \n     around sustainability.''\n       They wanted the land whole and accessible to the public.\n       Their father, Derick Webb, made that possible on his death \n     in 1984 at the age of 70. Derick Webb--who had retired to \n     Florida--rewrote his will before his death from a heart \n     attack. In his revised will, he left the 1,000 acres he \n     inherited to the nonprofit that was established by his kids \n     12 years earlier. An earlier version had given the property \n     to the six children.\n       Though Webb and his siblings agitated for this change--\n     including writing letters that Webb says make him cringe to \n     read today--they didn't know their father had gifted the land \n     to the nonprofit until after he died.\n       Now the integrity of the property was assured. Suddenly, \n     the nonprofit was in a more formidable position.\n       ``At that point, we were playing for real,'' Webb said. \n     That meant fundraising, restoring and managing the property, \n     building an organization and related programming.\n       Making the world a little bit better is something of a \n     bureaucracy--with custodial work on the side.\n       ``When I'm walking around, I'm always looking for deferred \n     maintenance and potholes,'' Webb said. ``It's not a downer. I \n     kind of enjoy that.''\n       His primary focuses are finances and farming; his brother, \n     Marshall Webb, manages the woodland and special projects.\n       The farm was in disrepair when Webb was a kid, but he liked \n     his father's Brown Swiss herd and chores related to dairying. \n     In those days, a milk hauler rumbled up the long driveway to \n     transport the milk to a creamery. Earlier still, the family \n     delivered milk in cans to Shelburne.\n       Back then, the barn roofs leaked; plumbing didn't work in \n     portions of Shelburne House, now called the Inn at Shelburne \n     Farms; and Alec and his brothers, wearing plain white T-\n     shirts, ate corn on the cob at picnic tables on a terrace, \n     goats sniffing around the table for scraps. ``It's a whole \n     different scene down there now at 6 o'clock at night,'' Webb \n     said.\n       At 6 o'clock these days, spiffy diners--guests, not \n     family--eat dinner on the terrace at the inn, a dining spot \n     that overlooks formal gardens, Lake Champlain and the \n     Adirondacks. The food they're eating, chef-prepared, was \n     likely produced on the farm. Not counting work-related \n     dinners, Webb said he eats at the inn about once a year.\n       He still prefers dairying hours, rising by 5 a.m. and \n     eating a bowl of oat bran before heading to work. His commute \n     is walking across the farmyard. With the exception of two \n     years working for the state Department of Education--\n     fulfilling duty required for his conscientious objector \n     status in the Vietnam War--Webb's work has been connected to \n     Shelburne Farms.\n       In his office is a black and white photograph of a young \n     girl standing at a table of vegetables. It is the summer of \n     1973, before the existence of the Burlington Farmers Market. \n     The table is set up on St. Paul Street in front of the \n     original Ben and Jerry's.\n       It holds cabbages, cauliflower, and bushels of beans. Hand-\n     lettered signs describe vegetables that are organically grown \n     and reasonably priced. The girl grew the vegetables at \n     Shelburne Farms. She's an early example of the farm's \n     decades-long yield: sustainable agriculture, community \n     connections, youthful energy and vision.\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n       ``We didn't say, 40 years ago, we're going to have an \n     inn,'' Webb said. ``We had the intention of seeing this place \n     being used as a place for learning--creating a living/\n     learning environment for kids and others to increase their \n     awareness of the environment and community.\n       ``There was something that would seem wrong about doing \n     anything other than treating Shelburne Farms as a community \n     asset. Maybe it's Olmstead's design: (But) the importance of \n     conserving this land was not as clear as it is now.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4414-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL BARRY GASDEK\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor LTC Barry Gasdek, \nRetired, for his decades of service to Wyoming and to America.\n  As Walter Lippmann once said, ``The final test of a leader is that he \nleaves behind him in other men the conviction and the will to carry \non.'' In his 49 years of service to our country, Barry's proven \ndedication and loyalty have touched hundreds of lives. From his \nextensive active duty service in the U.S. Army to his quest to aid the \nveterans of Wyoming, Mr. Gasdek is a true Wyoming hero.\n  Barry's path to Wyoming is similar to the historic trails that cross \nWyoming's terrain--he started out in the east and eventually headed \nwest. Barry showed the strong will and discipline of a natural born \nleader. Growing up in Pennsylvania, he excelled as an athlete and a \nscholar. He earned the rank of Eagle Scout in high school. At the \nIndiana University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a B.S. in \neducation, he earned letters in three sports. All of these honors \nprepared him for a lifetime of service to his country.\n  Barry's passion and devotion to the armed forces sparked a \ndistinguished career with the U.S. Army. Barry started his career \nserving in Germany, fresh from the ROTC program, where he gained \nfirsthand experience of Cold War tensions. Later, he was called to \nserve in Vietnam as the conflict there worsened. Barry proved himself \nin Vietnam. He flew observation missions and eventually returned for a \nsecond tour of duty. One of his commanders joked that he was like a \nmagnet for drawing fire. Despite the adversity he faced, Barry met his \nchallenges head-on and with fortitude. He continued his military \nservice well after Vietnam by training to become both a Ranger and a \nPathfinder and by serving at a number of Army bases around the world.\n  He is a qualified leader, and his military achievements reflect his \nsuccess. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, an award \nsecond only to the Medal of Honor. In addition, Barry received the \nSilver Star for his service in Vietnam, 5 Bronze Stars, 2 Purple \nHearts, the Soldier's Medal, the Legion of Honor, and 17 Air Medals. \nThese awards are but a few of his military accomplishments.\n  After many years of successfully serving his country, Barry accepted \nanother challenge--this time in Laramie, WY. He was assigned as a \nprofessor of military science at the University of Wyoming through its \nArmy ROTC program. Barry was a natural for the title, given his own \ninvolvement in the ROTC program in Pennsylvania. He brought the same \nlevel of talent and perseverance to this position as he did on the \nbattlefield. For years, he encouraged his students to become our \nNation's future leaders.\n  While many would be comfortable slipping into retirement, Barry knew \nhis mission in Wyoming had not yet been completed. This time, he took \nup the banner to fight for veterans' issues. He had experienced the \nlack of support for Vietnam's veterans, and he vowed to keep that from \nhappening again. Barry served in leadership positions with the American \nLegion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, \nand the Military Order of the Purple Heart. His goal was to support the \nState's current veterans while teaching the next generation about the \nimportant sacrifices our Armed Forces make each and every day. \nEventually, his passionate advocacy led him to serve as a State \nveterans service officer for the Wyoming Veterans Commission, the UW \nVeterans Task Force, and as the Army Reserve ambassador.\n  LTC Barry Gasdek, Retired, has devoted his entire life to serving his \ncountry, his brothers in arms, and the people of Wyoming. He is a \nfighter, a mentor, a teacher, and a good man. He embodies the cowboy \nethics and what it means to be a citizen of Wyoming. It is certain that \nthe legacy of his leadership will inspire new generations of brave \nsoldiers. On behalf of the State of Wyoming and the United States of \nAmerica, I thank Barry for his service. His boots will be hard to fill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4414-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, this week we celebrate the 40th \nanniversary of the passage of title IX of the Education Amendments of \n1972. For over 40 years, this historic law has furthered gender \nequality in education and sports in schools so that young women, \nincluding my three daughters, Caroline, Halina, and Anne, who all play \nsoccer, may enjoy the benefits that come along with sports \nparticipation.\n  On October 29, 2002, title IX was renamed the ``Patsy Takemoto Mink \nEqual Opportunity in Education Act'' to honor the tireless \ndetermination and leadership of Congresswoman Mink of Hawaii in \ndeveloping and passing title IX. If Congresswoman Mink was still with \nus today, I know she would be proud of the remarkable gains that have \nbeen made to ensure equal opportunity for women and girls in sports, \neducation, and professionally.\n  In my home State of Colorado, we are ahead of the curve with regards \nto opportunities for girls and women in sports. The U.S. Olympic \nTraining Center, located in Colorado Springs, was created by an act of \nCongress in 1978, just a few years after title IX was passed. It is \nencouraging to know that women, like Gold Medal Winner Lindsey Vonn, \nnow make up nearly half of all U.S. Olympians competing at the games--\nrepresenting more than 48 percent of the 2008 team. Jamie Derrieux, a \nsenior at Grand Junction High School, was named to the 5A First-Team \nAll-State team and will be playing basketball at the University of \nNorthern Colorado this fall. The flagship all-girls charter school, \nGALS, Girls Athletic Leadership Schools, in Denver practices active \nlearning that engages students in health and wellness activities in the \nbelief that these are key contributing factors in optimizing academic \nachievement and self-development. The Colorado Women's Sports Fund \nAssociation works toward increasing the number of girls and women who \nparticipate in athletics and reducing and eliminating barriers that \nprevent participation.\n  Studies show that participation in sports has a positive influence on \nthe intellectual, physical and psychological health of girls and young \nwomen. By a 3-to-1 ratio, female athletes do better in school, do not \ndrop out, and have a better chance to graduate from college. Sports \nparticipation is linked to lower rates of pregnancy in adolescent \nfemale athletes, and according to a study from the Oppenheimer/\nMassMutual Financial Group, of 401 executive businesswomen surveyed, 82 \npercent reported playing organized sports while growing up, including \nschool teams, intramurals, and recreational leagues.\n  Despite the vast improvements, inequalities and disparities still \nremain. According to the National Federation of State High School \nAssociations, schools are still providing 1.3 million fewer chances for \ngirls to play sports in high school than boys. These numbers have an \neven greater impact on Latinas and African-American young women. It is \nbecause of such disparities that I signed on to the Senate resolution \nput forth this week by Senators Patty Murray of Washington and Olympia \nSnowe of Maine to show my commitment to working toward a more equal \nfuture.\n  We have work to do. Please join me in celebrating the 40th \nanniversary of title IX by supporting efforts to expand equality in \nsports participation and education for women and girls around the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4414-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4414-S4415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED WAY\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate the \nUnited Way on its 125th anniversary. The organization began in 1887 as \na community\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\nendeavor in Denver, and it spread throughout the country.\n  Today, the United Way includes almost 1,800 community-based \norganizations in the United States and 40 other countries and \nterritories. It applies the nearly $5 billion it raises annually to \nprovide for the common good in communities all over the world.\n  I am proud that my State of Mississippi is home to dozens of \nnonprofit United Way organizations. With their network of partners, \nthese groups do remarkable work to gather private resources and \ngenerate volunteer services from all ages to address the educational, \nhealth, and income problems faced by children, families, and seniors.\n  Projects such as the Back 2 School Resource Fair hosted by the United \nWay of Northeast Mississippi, the Summer Youth Corps volunteer program \nrun by the United Way of the Capital Area, and the Literacy Kit \nWorkshop sponsored by the United Way of Southern Mississippi are just a \nvery small sample of ongoing activities carried out to help improve our \nState.\n  In addition, Mississippians are grateful for the helping hand the \nUnited Way provides when disasters strike. United Way volunteers from \nMississippi and around the Nation were among the thousands of people \nwho came to the aid of my State following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. \nMore recently, the United Way stepped up to assist those hurt by \ntornadoes in northeast Mississippi and historic flooding throughout the \nMississippi River delta.\n  The United Way has recorded an outstanding history of accomplishment \nin its 125 years. It has done so by joining forces with everyone from \nthe individual giver to Fortune 500 partners.\n  I am pleased to be able to join in commending this organization for \nits good works, and I look forward to its continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4415-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SOURIS RIVER FLOOD ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it has been nearly a year since the \ncity of Minot and surrounding communities were devastated by a historic \nflood along the Souris River in North Dakota.\n  As we recognize this anniversary, we are reminded of the devastation \nit brought to thousands of families throughout the Souris River Basin, \nthe extraordinary leadership of local officials, the valiant efforts of \nresidents and businesses, the outpouring of support, and the \nperseverance and determination of the region to rebuild.\n  On June 22, 2011, the sirens sounded in Minot signaling the mandatory \nevacuation of nearly a quarter of the city's residents. A wall of water \nwas coming at us, and we knew the existing levees would be overtopped. \nWork continued around the clock on temporary, secondary levees to \nprotect as much of the city as possible, but we knew thousands of homes \nwould be impacted by floodwaters. On June 23, the river overtopped the \nlevees in Minot, spilling into neighborhoods and businesses. When the \nriver finally peaked, it had surpassed the record set in 1881 by more \nthan 3.5 feet and crested more than 12.5 feet above flood stage. While \nthe flood damaged homes, businesses, schools, parks, the zoo, and many \nother things, it did not dampen the spirit of those in Minot and the \nsurrounding communities or their resolve to rebuild.\n  In those days leading up to and following the flood, many Federal \nagencies were on the ground assisting the region with response and \nrecovery. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency were there from the beginning, and both are still \nthere today helping residents recover and repairing levees. Many other \nFederal agencies also provided critical support throughout the \ndisaster. For that, we are forever grateful.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues for the disaster assistance \nprovided through the Community Development Block Grant Program, the \nEconomic Development Administration, and Emergency Relief to respond to \nthis and other disasters in 2011. This funding is providing important \nresources for the region and a key part of its foundation for recovery.\n  The city of Minot and surrounding communities, including Burlington, \nVelva, and Sawyer, have come a long way since those dark days last \nyear. While the recovery will continue for some time, I am so proud of \nthe spirit and can-do attitude of all in the basin as they rebuild \ntheir communities.\n  Officials and residents will gather together this weekend to \ncelebrate a ``Weekend of Hope: Return to Oak Park.'' It will be a time \nfor reflection on how far the region has come and to focus on the \nregion's continuing recovery. Hope is guiding the region's recovery and \nensuring that Minot, Burlington, and the other communities will be back \nbetter and stronger than ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4415-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FULLERTON, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to honor an active \ncommunity in North Dakota that will soon commemorate its 125th \nanniversary. From June 29 through July 1, the residents of Fullerton \nwill be celebrating their community's history and founding.\n  The history of Fullerton is closely connected to early American \nhistory. Fullerton was founded in 1887 on land donated by Mr. Edwin F. \nSweet, an investor from Michigan. Sweet, who later served as a U.S. \nCongressman and Assistant U.S. Secretary of Commerce for President \nWilson and President Harding, named the town after his wife's family, \nthe Fullers. The Fuller family ancestry includes Dr. Samuel Fuller, who \narrived in America on the Mayflower as a physician for the Plymouth \nColony. Edwin and his wife Sophia named their first son after one of \ntheir ancestors, Charles Carroll, an original signer of the Declaration \nof Independence.\n  Fullerton's most famous landmark, the Carroll House, has a wonderful \nhistory and has been a focal point of the community from the time its \ndoors opened in 1889. Built by Edwin Sweet and named after Edwin and \nSophia's first son Carroll Fuller Sweet, the hotel's ballroom was the \nmeeting spot for all town social gatherings, including concerts, gala \nballs, and church meetings. Through the years, the Carroll House has \nundergone extensive renovations and is now recognized as a national \nhistoric landmark. Visitors from all over the country stay at the \nCarroll House, and the hotel continues to host town events, like ice \ncream socials and silent auctions.\n  Fullerton is a fun and friendly community. The residents take great \npride in their dining, recreation, hotel, and park facilities, in \naddition to their agricultural background. To celebrate the 125th \nanniversary, the community is holding an all-school reunion. Other \nplanned activities for the weekend include the memorial tree planting \nceremony, an all-community reunion banquet, a community choir concert, \nan apple pie contest, and a parade.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Fullerton, ND, and its \nresidents on their 125th anniversary and in wishing them a warm \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4415-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4415-S4416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MONROE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the community of Monroe, SD, on reaching the 125th \nAnniversary of its founding. This tightly knit community will have a \nchance to reflect on its past and contemplate its future. I \ncongratulate the people of Monroe for reaching this milestone in their \nhistory.\n  The eastern South Dakota townsite that became Monroe was founded in \n1887 while it was still the Dakota Territory. Its location along the \nChicago and North Western Railroad fueled the town's growth, and it was \nincorporated as Monroe in 1901. The first building in the town was a \ngrain house, which was soon followed by a general store, which included \na post office. In the early 20th century Monroe experienced a great \ndeal of development and growth and that energy is still evident to this \nday.\n  Monroe sought to preserve their spirit of togetherness by \nconstructing a community center in 1990. The center houses the senior \ncenter and city office and was built using community funds and \ndonations from the alumni of Monroe High School. Many events are held \nat the center, and it is a point of pride for the community.\n  The people of Monroe plan to commemorate their town's anniversary \nwith many community events including a craft fair, poker run, all-\nschool\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nreunion alumni banquet, and fireworks display. In addition, the \ncommunity will host a tractor drive and ethanol plant tour to conclude \nthe celebration.\n  Monroe and its residents embody the small town values that make South \nDakota a great State to live and work in. I am proud to join with the \ncommunity of Monroe in celebrating the last 125 years, and look forward \nto what is, no doubt, a promising future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4416-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PIERPONT, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to the 125th anniversary of Pierpont, SD. The residents of \nPierpont exemplify the strong sense of community and welcoming spirit \nthat are defining traits of South Dakotans.\n  Pierpont is a tranquil town nestled at the foot of the Coteau Hills, \nin Day County. The early settlers of Pierpont tenaciously petitioned \nthe Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad for a side track, so that \nfarmers would have a nearby market for their grain. Charles Sheldon, a \nhomesteader who later became the second governor of South Dakota, was \nthe spokesman for the Pierpont farmers. Sheldon's negotiation was \nsuccessful, and the farmers paid $500 to the railroad for the \nconstruction of the side track.\n  In 1887, the first structures of what would become the town of \nPierpont were built by the Empire Elevator Company. By 1888, the Post \nOffice had opened and families began settling in the town. The turn of \nthe century found a thriving, booming community with businesses that \nlined Main Street.\n  To celebrate Pierpont's historical achievement, residents will join \ntogether for a weekend full of fun activities. An all-school alumni \nreunion, parade, car show, and a children's carnival are just a few of \nthe exciting events that will take place.\n  I am proud to recognize Pierpont on reaching this milestone and wish \nthem nothing but the best in the future. Pierpont continues to be a \nprime example of the successful pioneer spirit that built South \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4416-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SOUTH DAKOTA UNITED WAY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, acting through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration, in coordination with the \nSecretary of Education, to carry out a 5-year demonstration program to \nfund mental health first aid training programs at 10 institutions of \nhigher education to improve student mental health; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a very important \npiece of legislation--the Mental Health First Aid Higher Education Act. \nThe bill authorizes a nationwide demonstration program that treats \nMental Health First Aid like the first aid training offered by Red \nCross chapters across the United States.\n  Mental Health First Aid teaches the warning signs and risk factors \nfor schizophrenia, major clinical depression, panic attacks, anxiety \ndisorders, trauma, and other common mental disorders, crisis de-\nescalation techniques, and equips college and university staff with a \n5-step action plan to help individuals in psychiatric crisis connect to \nprofessional mental health care.\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\n  One in four adults and 10 percent of children in the United States \nwill suffer from a mental illness this year. We know what to do if \nsomeone has a heart attack, but how do we react to someone having a \npanic attack? Why do we wait for a tragic event to take notice and then \nbring out emergency measures?\n  When I was Mayor of Anchorage, we worked with the local NAMI \norganization to train our police in Crisis Intervention Teams, great \nwhen responding to a crisis by police officers, but now we need to go \nfurther. Mental Health First Aid is for the financial aid workers, the \ndormitory resident advisers, coaches, and faculty members, to name a \nfew. These are the front-line folks who will learn the warning signs \nand risk factors before tragedy strikes.\n  You have heard me say this before, an it is not something to be proud \nof in Alaska: we have one of the highest suicide prevalence rates in \nthe country. Further, we are a very rural State, where access to mental \nhealth care and medical services is often very difficult.\n  Even today, it is not widely known that fully \\2/3\\ of Alaska can \nonly be accessed by airplane. By educating the general public about the \nwarning signs of common mental disorders, we can intervene early, \nfacilitate access to care, improve clinical outcomes, reduce costs, and \nmaybe save lives.\n  My bill focuses on higher education because many mental illnesses are \n``adult onset conditions,'' meaning onset of full symptoms generally \noccurs in late adolescence or young adulthood--just as young people are \nheaded off to college. Therefore, the audiences for this vital training \nwill encompass on-campus counseling center staff, dormitory resident \nadvisers, university threat assessment teams, members of disciplinary \ncommittees, coaches and faculty members. The instruction will highlight \navailable mental health resources in local communities including \nCommunity Mental Health Centers, emergency psychiatric facilities, \nhospital emergency rooms and other programs offering psychiatric crisis \nbeds.\n  The program may also help to avert violence incidents; Mental Health \nFirst Aid gained wide public recognition in the aftermath of the tragic \nshootings in Tucson, AZ, involving our former colleague Rep. Gabrielle \nGiffords.\n  Mental disorders are more common than heart disease and cancer \ncombined and a recent Governing magazine article reports that many \nstates and localities are moving ahead--teaching their employees how to \nrecognize the signs of mental health problems and how to help.\n  In this time of austerity, the training is not only important, \nbecause it will save lives, it is also inexpensive. Courses costs about \n$180, a small price to pay to potentially save lives.\n  In closing, yes, we are in a presidential election year and the \npolitical season often highlights the issues that divide us as \nAmericans. But the Mental Health First Aid Higher Education Act is not \none of them.\n  In the Alaska tradition, I seek to work across the aisle, and I \nstrongly believe this legislation merits bipartisan support. Please \njoin me in supporting this vital education program that helps to avert \nsuffering, prevent violence and ultimately will save lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 3330. A bill to authorize the establishment of a Niblack mining \narea road corridor in the State of Alaska, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would potentially help in solving a significant unemployment \nproblem in my home state of Alaska. Today, joined by my colleague, \nSenator Mark Begich, I introduce the Niblack Mining Area Road \nAuthorization Act to permit road access to proposed multi-mineral mines \non southeast Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska.\n  Prince of Wales Island, formerly the main area for timber activity in \nSoutheast Alaska, has fallen on hard times during the past decade. In \n1990, when Alaska's timber industry in total harvested more than 1.1 \nbillion board feet of timber, Prince of Wales was the center of \nactivity. In 1994, for example, timber jobs accounted for 32.8 percent \nof all wages on the island. Six years later, with total regional \nharvests having fallen to about 350 million board feet, timber \naccounted for less than 19.8 percent of wages on the island, according \nto the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Today, \nwith total harvests of timber being just above 100 million board feet a \nyear in the region--just 35 million board feet being harvested from \nfederal lands in 2011--and timber jobs statewide having fallen from \nabout 4,000 to just over 400, Prince of Wales has been particularly \nhard hit. According to the State, timber jobs have fallen by more than \n1,700 positions on the island.\n  As of April, the unemployment rate on the island was ``down'' to 15 \npercent, compared to 18.1 percent in March. The rate in the Hoonah-\nAngoon census area, which covers the other potentially significant \ntimber area in Southeast, stood at 20 percent in April, compared to \n25.6 percent in March, 2012. Those rates are nearly 8 percent to 12 \npercent higher than the national average and higher than traditional \nrates, even after out migration from the island over the past decade.\n  While the Viking Lumber Co. of Klawock remains the largest private-\nsector timber employer on the island, the island, the third largest in \nthe United States, is badly in need of new employment opportunities. \nFortunately today's high metal prices are encouraging a resurgence of \nmineral development on the 2,231 square-mile island.\n  Currently, Heatherdale Minerals of Canada is considering reopening \nthe Niblack Mine, a gold, copper, zinc and silver deposit. The company \nis in advanced exploration and development study of the estimated 9 \nmillion-ton mine, forecast to cost $150 million to $200 million to \nreopen. The mine, likely to last at least 12 years, is forecast to \nproduce 1,500 tons of ore per day and require 130 workers at the mine \nsite, and another 60 at a processing mill, which could be located near \nthe site, or in Ketchikan, AK, 40 vessel miles away.\n  The Niblack property is also close to another mineral deposit that is \nin the advanced stages of economic feasibility review, the Bokan \nMountain Rare Earth Elements, REE, mine. Bokan Mountain, being \nconsidered for opening by Ucore Inc. of Canada, likely will employ 200 \nworkers. It, too, will involve an investment of between $150 million to \n$200 million for the mine and a preliminary tailings processing plant \nto process the heavy rare earths, REEs, located at the site of a former \nuranium mine. Both mines currently estimate they could be open within \nthree to four years, depending on final economic reviews and current \npermit approval timeframes. Bokan Mountain is located about 28 miles \nsouth of Niblack and can be accessed by boat by traveling down the \nrelatively protected Moira Sound to the end of South Arm.\n  The two mines could produce substantial numbers of high-paying jobs \nfor the residents of southern Southeast Alaska. Niblack, for example, \npredicts the average salary for mine workers at its facility will be \n$80,000 a year. The problem of getting those jobs to people who need \nthem is one of logistics.\n  There currently is no road access to reach either mine site, both \nlikely to be supplied by boat from Ketchikan, Alaska. That means that \npotential workers on Prince of Wales will need to travel by boat or \nmore likely by plane to Ketchikan, in order to turn around and take a \nmine boat back to the island to report for work--a costly, time-\nconsuming, often unpleasant and, sometimes, dangerous process given sea \nconditions in Southeast Alaska. Or they will need to pilot their own \nsmall boats to the mine site, a hazardous process given that reaching \nNiblack from the community of Thorne Bay to the north--a site that is \nlocated on the island's road system--will require a daily 60-mile one-\nway boat trip down perilous Clarence Strait, a difficult water body \nduring fall, winter, and spring storms when seas can easily top 20 feet \nwaves.\n  But the problem could be solved, if a road could be extended the \nroughly 26.3 miles to connect the Niblack mine, by means of existing \nlogging roads, to the State highway system on the island. Such a road \nwill involve at least 2.5 miles of logging road reconstruction and the \nconstruction of 26.3 miles of new road. Those roads, if built to \nexisting logging road standards, are estimated to cost $7.075 million--\nthe cost\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\ncertainly rising if the roads are built to Federal Aid Urban Highway \nstandards. The issue is that 18.3 miles of that new construction is \nacross federal lands in the Tongass National Forest and, more \nimportantly, across areas classified as inventoried roadless under the \n2001 U.S. Forest Service roadless rule, as it was reimposed on the \nTongass in 2009.\n  Looking at the topography of the area, located inside the Eudora \ninventoried roadless area, the road would begin at the Haida, Hydaburg, \nNative village corporation's West, Cholmondeley, Arm sort yard and head \nSoutheast through the Big Creek Valley and climb to a mountain pass at \nthe roughly 1,400-foot elevation. From there it will drop onto land \nowned by the Kootznoowoo Native village corporation of Angoon and \nfollow existing logging roads that lie on the western side of the South \nArm. The route then runs south and parallels South Arm on the west side \nuntil the southern end of the bay is reached. Then the route follows \nthe shoreline of the south end of the South Arm until the far southeast \ncorner of the bay is reached--the location of existing cabins and a \nState of Alaska Department of Fish and Game fish weir. From this point, \nthere are two potential route alternatives: the 1A route continues to \nrun in a southerly direction through a mountain pass of slightly more \nthan 500-feet elevation passing two unnamed lakes. Once it reaches the \nshoreline of Dickman Bay, the road turns in a more easterly direction \nand runs across the south end of Kugel Lake and Luelia Lake, and the \nnorth end of Kegan Lake. From the 900-foot elevation pass on the west \nside of Luelia Lake, the route continues to run in an easterly fashion \nand must cross 1,200- and 1,400-foot passes before the route turns \nnorth to reach the Niblack mine at tidewater. That total route is 26.3 \nmiles of new construction and a total distance of 28.8 miles. There is \nan alternative, Route 1B, early in the route corridor to reduce the \nelevation and add switchbacks required to reach the first pass--an \nalternative that would add 1.9 miles to the road.\n  There is another alternative route, Route 2A, that leaves from the \nsame location and runs on the same route until the south end of South \nArm. The second route then turns in a northerly direction and continues \nto follow the eastern shoreline of South Arm, Cholmondeley, for roughly \n1.5 miles. The route then turns in an eastern direction and climbs \nthrough a mountain pass of about 900-feet elevation. From this pass, \nthe route descends into the existing road system on Kootznoowoo lands \nnear the south shores of Miller Lake. At the eastern terminus of these \nexisting roads, the new route picks up again and continues in a \nsoutheast direction along the south end of Clarno Cove and Cannery Cove \nuntil Cannery Point is reached. From there the route turns into a \nsoutherly direction and climbs to another mountain pass of roughly \n1,000-feet elevation. The route then follows the hillside to the west \nof Niblack Lake and meets another mountain pass of the same elevation \nand then descends in a southerly direction along the west side of \nMyrtle Lake to reach the Niblack Mine and tidewater. That route \ninvolves 24.6 miles of new construction, 6.1 miles of road \nreconstruction and involves a total length of 30.7 miles, thus costing \nmore. It involves, however, constructing only one pass higher than \n1,200 feet, compared to 3 on the first route, but may have more \nenvironmental impacts given its route along Cannery Cove and Niblack \nLake.\n  I mention the two detailed routes only to indicate that substantial \nwork has been done to select a potential road corridor to the Niblack \nmine and to make clear that I am not prejudging the route with the \nfewest environmental impacts. I am leaving that to the Forest Service \nto decide after an environmental assessment or impact statement is \nundertaken. The legislation I am introducing simply says that the \nForest Service should permit development of a road along one of the two \nroutes, picking the route that both minimizes the costs, while also \nminimizing the effects on surface resources, prevents unnecessary \nsurface disturbances and that complies with all environmental laws and \nregulations.\n  This road, I need to point out, will not set a precedent in any way \nweakening the inventoried roadless rule's implementation in Alaska, \nregardless of how I feel about that rule. Under the original \nregulations governing roadless areas in Alaska issued by the Clinton \nAdministration in January 2001, Section 294.12(b)(7) permits roads to \nbe built across inventoried roadless areas if needed ``in conjunction \nwith the continuation, extension or renewal of a mineral lease on lands \nthat are under lease by the Secretary of the Interior. . . . Such road \nconstruction or reconstruction must be conducted in a manner that \nminimizes effects on surface resources, prevents unnecessary or \nunreasonable surface disturbance, and complies with all applicable \nlease requirements.''\n  The patents on the Niblack property certainly predate the creation of \nthe roadless rule. The mine was discovered in the late 19th century, \naccording to the U.S. Forest Service. Modest copper production occurred \nbetween 1902 and 1908 and modern exploration on the 2,000-acre site \nbegan in 1974, some 150 patented claims being in place at the mine.\n  The point is that Niblack is certainly a real prospect that offers \nthe likelihood of real employment for many who are unemployed on Prince \nof Wales Island, if they simply can access the site from their homes in \nCraig, Klawock, Hydaburg, Thorne Bay, Kasaan, Whale Pass and even \nCoffman Cove, located on the northeast end of the island. The need for \nthese jobs has prompted the City Council of Craig to formally request \nCongress to accelerate the approval of a road corridor to the mine \nsite. Such a road could be built by the mine, but more likely funded \nand built by the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public \nFacilities at state expense. Workers could then access jobs at the \nBokan Mountain facility by workboat, should a route to that mine never \nbe approved.\n  It makes no sense in a state that already contains 58 million acres \nof formal wilderness, and in the Tongass National Forest, that already \ncontains nearly 6.4 million acres of parks and wilderness areas, to bar \nconstruction of a road that does not cross any wilderness areas, but \ncould provide a good income to a third of all of the people, 363 \npeople, unemployed on the island as of April 2012, according to the \nAlaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development.\n  I would hope that this Congress would look favorably on allowing a \nroad to this mining area, so that residents on the island can get the \njobs they so desperately need in the years ahead.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 3335. A bill to ensure the effective administration of criminal \njustice; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the \nEffective Administration of Criminal Justice Act of 2012. This \nlegislation takes important new steps to ensure the fairness of our \ncriminal justice system for all participants.\n  First, this bill seeks to encourage States to adopt a comprehensive \napproach in using the Federal funds received through the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grant, JAG, Program. This will help to \nensure that their criminal justice systems operate effectively as a \nwhole and that all parts of the system work together and receive the \nresources they need. Specifically, the bill reinstates a previous \nrequirement of the Byrne JAG Program that States develop, and update \nannually, a strategic plan detailing how grants received under the \nprogram will be used to improve the administration of the criminal \njustice system. The requirement was removed from the Byrne JAG grant \napplication several years ago, but groups representing States and \nvictims have requested that it be reinstated in order to improve the \nefficient and effective use of criminal justice resources. The plan \nmust be formulated in consultation with local governments and all \nsegments of the criminal justice system. The Attorney General will also \nbe required to make technical assistance available to help States \nformulate their strategic plans.\n  This legislation also takes important new steps to ensure that all \ncriminal defendants, including those who cannot afford a lawyer, \nreceive constitutionally adequate representation. It requires the \nDepartment of Justice to assist States that want help developing an \neffective and efficient system of indigent defense, and it establishes \na\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\ncause of action for the Federal government to step in when States are \nsystematically failing to provide the representation called for in the \nConstitution.\n  This is a reasonable measure that gives the States assistance and \ntime needed to make necessary changes and seeks to provide an incentive \nfor States to do so. As a former prosecutor, I have great faith in the \nmen and women of law enforcement, and I know that the vast majority of \nthe time our criminal justice system does work fairly and effectively. \nI also know though that the system only works as it should when each \nside is well represented by competent and well-trained counsel. It was \npersuasive to me when Houston District Attorney Patricia Lykos \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee several years ago when this \nprovision was first considered that competent defense attorneys are \ncritical to a prosecutor's job. Our system requires good lawyers on \nboth sides, and incompetent counsel can result not only in needless and \ntime consuming appeals, but far more importantly, it can lead to \nwrongful convictions and overall distrust in the criminal process. In \nworking on this legislation, I have also learned that the most \neffective systems of indigent defense are not always the most \nexpensive. In some cases, making the necessary changes may also save \nStates money.\n  I remain committed to ensuring that our criminal justice system \noperates as effectively and fairly as possible. Unfortunately, we are \nnot there yet. Too often the quality of justice a defendant receives in \nour system depends on whether he or she can pay for an attorney. That \nis repugnant to the American sense of justice and we must do better. \nAmericans need and deserve a criminal justice system which keeps us \nsafe, ensures fairness and accuracy, and fulfills the promise of our \nconstitution for all people. This bill will take important steps to \nbring us closer to that goal and I urge all Senators to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3335\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \ncarry out a major medical facility project lease for a Department of \nVeterans Affairs outpatient clinic at Ewa Plain, Oahu, Hawaii, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an authorization \nmeasure for the Department of Veterans Affairs to Advance Leeward \nOutpatient Healthcare Access, ALOHA, lease in Ewa, HI, and to request \nthe facility be named after my dear friend and colleague Senator Daniel \nK. Akaka.\n  The new facility will provide support to our proud veterans in the \nState of Hawaii who live in West Oahu. In addition to serving the needs \nof our veterans, the facility will include a collocated clinic which \nwill serve our military servicemen and women, and their families. Both \nthe Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, VA, will also be able \nto share ancillary and support services.\n  I believe naming this joint facility after Senator Akaka is an \nappropriate and fitting way to honor his commitment to our military \npersonnel and veterans throughout his years in Congress. As a Member of \nthe Armed Services Committee and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nReadiness, he worked to ensure the Armed Services met their obligation \nto ``man, train, and equip.'' As the Chairman of the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Akaka also kept watch over and labored to improve \nthe quality of care received by our brave men and women who completed \ntheir military service and entered into the VA system.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting Senator Akaka who \nworked on behalf of the people of the State of Hawaii and this nation \nto improve the quality of life and care of our military personnel and \nour veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 49\n\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass, born Frederick Augustus \n     Washington Bailey in Maryland in 1818, escaped from slavery \n     and became a leading writer, orator, and publisher, and one \n     of the Nation's most influential advocates for abolitionism, \n     women's suffrage, and the equality of all people;\n       Whereas the contributions of Frederick Douglass over many \n     decades were crucial to the abolition of slavery, the passage \n     of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of \n     the United States, the support for women's suffrage, and the \n     advancement of African Americans after the Civil War;\n       Whereas after living in New Bedford, Massachusetts, \n     Frederick Douglass resided for 25 years in Rochester, New \n     York, where he published and edited ``The North Star'', the \n     leading African-American newspaper in the United States, and \n     other publications;\n       Whereas self-educated, Frederick Douglass wrote several \n     influential books, including his best-selling first \n     autobiography, ``Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, \n     an American Slave'', published in 1845;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass worked tirelessly for the \n     emancipation of African-American slaves, was a pivotal figure \n     in Underground Railroad activities in Western New York, and \n     was an inspiration to enslaved Americans who aspired to \n     freedom;\n       Whereas as a well-known speaker in great demand, Frederick \n     Douglass traveled widely, visiting countries such as England \n     and Ireland, to spread the message of emancipation and equal \n     rights;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass was the only African American to \n     attend the Seneca Falls Convention, a women's rights \n     convention held in Seneca Falls, New York in 1848;\n       Whereas during the Civil War, Frederick Douglass recruited \n     African Americans to volunteer as soldiers for the Union \n     Army, including 2 of his sons who served nobly in the Fifty-\n     fourth Massachusetts Regiment;\n       Whereas in 1872, Frederick Douglass moved to Washington, \n     D.C., after a fire destroyed his home in Rochester, New York;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass was appointed as a United States \n     Marshal in 1877 and was named Recorder of Deeds for the \n     District of Columbia in 1881;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass became the first African \n     American to receive a vote for nomination as President of the \n     United States at a major party convention for the 1888 \n     Republican National Convention;\n       Whereas from 1889 to 1891, Frederick Douglass served as \n     minster-resident and consul-general to the Republic of Haiti;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass was recognized around the world \n     as one of the most important political activists in the \n     history of the United States;\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass died in 1895 in Washington, D.C. \n     and is buried in Rochester, New York;\n       Whereas the statues and busts in the Capitol depicting \n     distinguished Americans number more than 180 and include only \n     2 African Americans;\n       Whereas that imbalance fails to show the historically \n     significant contributions of African Americans to the United \n     States;\n       Whereas it is time to display in the Capitol the statues \n     and busts of outstanding African Americans whose \n     contributions to the Nation deserve that recognition; and\n       Whereas Frederick Douglass's achievements and influence on \n     the history of the United States merit recognition in the \n     Capitol: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) not later than 2 years after the date on which this \n     resolution is agreed to by both Houses of Congress, the Joint \n     Committee on the Library shall accept from the District of \n     Columbia the donation of a statue depicting Frederick \n     Douglass, subject to the terms and conditions that the Joint \n     Committee considers appropriate;\n       (2) the Joint Committee shall place the statue in a \n     suitable permanent location in the Capitol; and\n       (3) all costs associated with the donation, including \n     transportation of the statue to, and placement in, the \n     Capitol, shall be paid by the District of Columbia.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill that would \nbring a statue depicting Fredrick Douglass to our Nation's Capitol. The \nlife and deeds of this great American need no introduction. He escaped \nthe shackles of slavery to become a leading writer, orator, publisher, \nand a leader in the abolitionist struggle towards equality for all. I \nam proud that Fredrick Douglass called Rochester, NY home for 25 years. \nBut others claim him as well. He was born into slavery in Maryland, and \nlived as a free adult in Massachusetts and, at the end of his life, in \nWashington, DC. He died here in the Nation's Capitol and is buried in \nupstate New York. During his time in Rochester, he published the \nleading African American newspaper in the country. His influential \nbest-selling autobiography, ``Narrative of the Life of Frederick \nDouglass,'' served as a rallying cry for the abolitionist movement and \nhelped bring an end to that cruel institution. It is therefore fitting \nthat this Fredrick Douglass statue should find its home in the Capitol.\n  The addition of this statue of Frederick Douglass to our Capitol is \nlong overdue. It is important that the Americans depicted in \nportraiture and in sculpture in the Capitol reflect the true heritage \nof our nation and the people who have helped to make it great. Today \ntoo few of our artworks depict the richness and diversity of great \nAmericans. In fact, of more than 180 statues and busts in the Capitol, \nonly two are of African Americans. This resolution is a small step \ntoward correcting that imbalance. The acceptance of this Fredrick \nDouglass statue into our Capitol is appropriate both because of who \nFredrick Douglass was as an American and because of who we all are as \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4423-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2461.

I now ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of and the Senate proceed to S. \nRes. 471.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 471) commending the efforts of the \n     women of the American Red Cross Clubmobiles for exemplary \n     service during the Second World War.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service of \nthe women of the American Red Cross Clubmobiles. These brave young \nAmericans served our country with distinction overseas during the \nSecond World War.\n  During the War, the Red Cross was charged by the Armed Forces to \nprovide for the recreational welfare of the troops. Wherever there was \na sizable group of American servicemen permanently assigned, the Red \nCross established canteens, which provided a bit of respite from \ntraining for war and were tremendously popular. But the canteens were \nfixed sites, and did not reach many of the combat troops garrisoned at \nsmall locations across the English countryside.\n  In order to extend a taste of home to the troops, the Red Cross \nCommissioner for Great Britain, Harvey Gibson, thought up the idea of \nthe ``Clubmobile,'' a mobile kitchen set up in an old London bus. In \nlate 1942, several of these Clubmobiles began operating between dozens \nof bases around the country, serving coffee and doughnuts to those \npreparing for D-day.\n  Shortly after the beachhead at Normandy was successfully secured, 80 \nClubmobiles and 320 volunteers crossed the English Channel to begin \noperating their mobile kitchens near the front lines. Each Clubmobile \ngroup, consisting of eight two-and-a-half ton trucks named for an \nAmerican city or State, was attached to an Army Corps and moved with \nthe unit's support elements, often going forward to provide the troops \nwith American music, hot coffee, and doughnuts. Like every soldier, the \nClubmobile women were in ``for the duration.'' By War's end, the \nClubmobiles were operating across Europe, from southern Italy to \nnorthern Germany, and in the Far East from the jungles of Burma to the \nshores of Tokyo Bay.\n  A visit from a Clubmobile was one of the most significant events for \na young G.I. in combat far from home, and the women of the Clubmobiles, \nyoung women from every single State, acted as friends and sisters to \nthe troops with whom they interacted.\n  These women were trailblazers, every bit as much as the Navy's Women \nAccepted for Volunteer Emergency Service--WAVES--the Women's Army \nCorps--WACS--and the Women Airforce Service Pilots--WASPS. They were \nyoung, independent, and patriotic. They joined for a variety of \nreasons, some for adventure, some to serve in uniform as close to \ncombat as they were then allowed, and some to honor the sacrifices of \ntheir own fathers, brothers, or friends. Every one of them was \ndedicated to their country, and volunteered for the Clubmobiles rather \nthan an easier or safer job at home.\n  The dangers of War were real. During the War, 52 Red Cross women lost \ntheir lives, some of them from the Clubmobiles. Their stories are those \nof a nation at war.\n  Elizabeth Richardson joined the Red Cross in 1944 after graduating \nfrom Milwaukee-Downer College and after a brief career in advertising. \nShe helped pilot the Clubmobile named Kansas City throughout England, \nHolland and France, listening to soldiers' stories while cracking jokes \nand sharing her own. Two months after V-E Day, Liz's plane crashed en \nroute to Paris. Liz Richardson, dead at 27, now lies interred at the \nNormandy American Cemetery. Before she died, she said about her \nservice, ``I wouldn't trade this for anything else.''\n  Those sentiments are shared by Margaret ``Margo'' Hemingway \nHarrington of Rye, NH, one of the few surviving Clubmobile women. She \nsaid, ``I just got itchy feet, and thought I should be doing something \nmore.''\n  The women of the Clubmobiles touched the lives of hundreds of \nthousands of U.S. servicemen. The Red Cross alone purchased enough \nflour to make 1.5 million doughnuts, most of which were served through \nthe windows of a Clubmobile.\n  To honor their memory, 70 years after they were established, Senator \nShaheen and I, joined by 11 of our colleagues, introduced Senate \nResolution 471, which commends the exemplary and courageous service of \nthe Clubmobiles, honors those that lost their lives, calls upon \nhistorians to not let this important piece of American history be lost, \nand urges the Red Cross to publically commemorate their stories.\n  Honoring them now is critically important, because only a very few of \nthese women remain. Their stories are every bit as vibrant and \nimportant to our victory as those of the men who valiantly fought to \ndefend our freedom. I urge every one of my colleagues to support this \nResolution.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to; a \nCollins amendment to the preamble, which is at the desk, be agreed to; \nthe preamble, as amended, be agreed to; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 471\n\n       Whereas, during the Second World War, the American Red \n     Cross was charged by the United States Armed Forces with \n     providing recreational services to the soldiers serving in \n     the war;\n       Whereas Harvey Gibson, the Red Cross Commissioner to Great \n     Britain during the war, conceived of the Clubmobiles in 1942 \n     as a means of providing hot coffee, fresh doughnuts, and a \n     vital connection to home to thousands of servicemen at dozens \n     of airfields, bases, and camps throughout Great Britain \n     during the buildup to D-Day;\n       Whereas thousands of young women, from every State in the \n     United States, volunteered to serve in the Clubmobiles, and \n     were chosen after a rigorous interview process;\n       Whereas, between July and August 1944, less than 1 month \n     after the invasion of Normandy, France, 80 Clubmobiles and \n     320 American Red Cross volunteers crossed the English Channel \n     and began providing coffee, doughnuts, and a friendly smile \n     to servicemen fighting on the front lines;\n       Whereas the Clubmobile volunteers saw service across Europe \n     in France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, and Germany, and later \n     in the Far East, touching the lives of hundreds of thousands \n     of United States servicemen until victory was achieved;\n       Whereas a visit from a Clubmobile, which could serve \n     gallons of coffee and hundreds of doughnuts every minute, was \n     often the most significant morale boost available to \n     servicemen at war;\n       Whereas 52 women of the American Red Cross, some of whom \n     served on the Clubmobiles, perished during the war as a \n     result of their service; and\n       Whereas 70 years have passed since the Clubmobiles were \n     founded, and only a few women who served in the Clubmobiles \n     remain to share their stories: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the exemplary and courageous service and \n     sacrifice of each of the patriotic women of the United States \n     who served in the American Red Cross Clubmobiles during the \n     Second World War;\n       (2) honors the Clubmobile women who lost their lives during \n     the Second World War;\n       (3) calls upon historians of the Second World War to \n     recognize and describe the service of the Clubmobiles, and to \n     not let this important piece of United States history be \n     lost; and\n       (4) urges the American Red Cross to publicly commemorate \n     the stories of the Clubmobiles and the amazing women who \n     served in them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/21/senate-section/article/S4429-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 25, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.
