Mr. President, as millions of Americans prepare to file \nincome tax returns, the Senate will consider one of the basic unfair \nprovisions in the Tax Code. Today the wealthiest 1 percent takes home \nthe highest share of the Nation's income since the early twenties, the \nRoaring Twenties. But while their bank accounts have grown, their tax \nbills have become smaller. The wealthiest Americans now pay the lowest \ntax rate in more than five decades. The rich pay less than they have \nfor more than 50 years. This unfair system has turned a gap between the \nrichest few and everyone else into a gulf, not a gap. Over the last few \ndecades, a small number of Americans have seen their incomes skyrocket \nby almost 300 percent, but for the rest of Americans wages have barely \nmoved. They have not kept pace with the price of a modest home, \ncollege, or, of course, a secure retirement.\n  Times are tough for many middle-class American families, but \nmillionaires and billionaires are not sharing the pain or the \nsacrifices--not one bit. Last year there were 7,000 millionaires who \ndid not pay a single penny in Federal income taxes. Seven thousand \nmillionaires did not pay a single penny in taxes. Instead, ordinary \nAmericans footed the bill. That is not fair. In recent years some \nAmericans earning north of $110 million a year paid a lower tax rate \nthan millions of middle-class families. That is also not fair. That is \nhow someone like our friend Warren Buffett winds up paying a lower tax \nrate than his secretary, which also is not fair.\n  When the richest few are making more than ever before, they can \nafford to shoulder their fair share of the burden and make this country \nprosper. And they should not be allowed to hide behind tax loopholes \nthat rig the system in their favor. The Paying a Fair Share Act, known \nas the Buffett rule, would restore fairness to a system that has \nfavored the interests of the wealthy for far too long. This legislation \nwould ensure that Americans who earn more than $1 million a year pay at \nleast 30 percent of their income in taxes. The bill would hold harmless \nnearly every small business in America. In fact, more than 99 percent \nof small businesses would be held harmless. It would maintain the \ndeduction for charitable giving. It would be a small but important step \ntoward restoring fiscal responsibility as our Nation makes difficult \nchoices about where to spend and what to cut.\n  Three-quarters of Americans believe millionaires and billionaires \nshould contribute more. Two-thirds of millionaires say it is time to \neven the playing field. Yet, everywhere, all Republicans except those \nwithin the beltway believe that is not the case. Republicans in \nCongress would rather end Medicare as we know it, set forth in the so-\ncalled infamous Ryan budget. They would rather slash education funding, \nas set forth in that same infamous budget, than ask the richest of the \nrich to contribute even a penny to make education more meaningful and \nto continue maintaining Medicare as we know it. As the Senate Democrats \nwork to make our tax system fair for all Americans, Republicans in the \nHouse continue to pursue a budget that would hand more tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest few--the so-called Ryan budget I was just talking about.\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\n  At its heart, this important debate and the Buffett rule are about \nsetting priorities. America can build a world-class education system \nthat will prepare our children and our grandchildren to compete in the \nindustries of tomorrow. We can honor our commitment to a generation of \nyoung men and women who put their lives on the line to serve and \nprotect our freedom, and we can ensure that seniors who worked hard all \ntheir lives look forward to a secure retirement and quality, affordable \nhealth care or we can keep protecting special tax rates for the richest \nof the rich. We cannot do both. We must make smart choices.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt once said:\n\n       In our personal ambitions we are individualists. But in our \n     seeking for economic and political progress as a nation, we \n     all go up or else all go down as one people.\n\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will join Democrats this evening as \nwe choose a path toward economic fairness that allows all Americans to \nrise together as one people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2288-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 5\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, if there is one thing on which every \nAmerican can agree right now it is that we have serious challenges in \nthis country and that time is not on our side. Action needs to be taken \nsoon. To cite a few things, everybody is holding their breath waiting \nfor the Federal debt to catch up with us. It is not a question of if, \nit is a question of when. Many young people are basically giving up on \nthe American dream. Seniors and those approaching retirement are \nconcerned about the safety and sustainability of entitlements. Working \nAmericans and those who employ them are frustrated by the growth and \nthe reach of government. And nearly 14 million Americans who cannot \nfind work are wondering how it got so hard to land a good-paying job in \nwhat is supposed to be the most prosperous economy on Earth. All these \npeople know we are in rough shape. They live it every day and, frankly, \na lot of them have given up hope that lawmakers here in Washington are \ninterested in doing anything at all that would help.\n  But the truth is that there is some good news to report out of \nWashington; that is, the growing bipartisan consensus not only about \nthe existence of these problems but also about the proper solution. \nJust about everybody agrees that comprehensive tax reform would help \nturn this economy around, strengthen entitlements, spur innovation and \neconomic growth, and create jobs.\n  The problem is that we have a President who seems more interested in \npitting people against each other than he is in actually doing what it \ntakes to face these challenges head on and to solve them in a \nbipartisan manner. And if anybody had any doubt about that, the \nPresident's relentless focus on this so-called Buffett tax over the \npast few weeks should have dispelled it.\n  This entire debate has been very illuminating for a lot of folks. It \nhas revealed a lot about this President. By wasting so much time on \nthis political gimmick that even Democrats admit will not solve our \nlarger problems, it has shown that the President is actually more \ninterested in misleading people than he is in leading. I know that may \nsound a little strong to some, but just step back and think about what \nis going on here. We have a $15 trillion debt. Some call it the most \npredictable crisis in history. We have the largest tax increase in the \nhistory of the country looming that will hit every single American who \npays income taxes in less than 9 months from today.\n  Well, President Obama looked at the options in front of him, sat down \nwith his political advisers, and said: You know what, let's go with a \npoll-tested tax increase on investment and job creation that will not \nfix anything and will not pass anyway, instead of actually doing \nsomething about the debt and the deficit. It is the same thing on gas \nprices; the President looked at $4-a-gallon gasoline and said: Let's go \nwith a poll-tested tax on energy manufacturers, which would increase \nthe price at the pump instead of actually doing something to solve the \nproblem. Is this not precisely the kind of thing President Obama \ncampaigned against in the first place--politics as usual? But that is \nall we get. The worse our problems get, the less serious he becomes. \nThe more people coalesce around a bipartisan solution, the more he \nfocuses on something that is completely irrelevant or that has \nabsolutely no chance of passing.\n  We are in a crisis here and, sadly, it is all politics all the time. \nSomewhere along the way this President seems to have forgotten why he \nwas elected. For him, it is not about jobs or the economy, it is about \nhis idea of fairness, about imposing it on others. And if we lose more \njobs in the process, oh, well, so be it.\n  Just take the Buffett tax. Anytime the President proposed anything in \nthe past, he told us how many jobs it would create, whether it was the \nFAA bill, the highway bill, the stimulus--you name it. Apparently, \nthose days are over. Nobody is even claiming this creates jobs. It is \nall about the President's idea of fairness now.\n  I think Americans are tired of the blame game. They want their \nPresident to solve problems, not point fingers. They think their \nPresident should spend his time working on a solution between the two \nparties instead of running around the country trying to distract people \nfrom his own inability to get the job done, instead of running around \nlecturing everybody on fairness.\n  The President is using two arguments in favor of the Buffett tax. \nFirst, he says it is a matter of fairness. Second, he thinks the \ngovernment would do a better job of investing the money than the people \nhe hopes to take it from. First, it is a matter of fairness and, \nsecond, he assumes the government would do a better job of using that \nmoney than the people he is taking it from.\n  On the first point, I think most people have heard enough about the \nPresident's notion of fairness to know it does not match up with \ntheirs. To most people, what is fair about America is that they can \nearn their success--earn their success--and expect to be rewarded for \nit. Nobody ever crossed an ocean or a desert to come here for \ngovernment health care. People come here because they think everybody \nhas a shot at something more than that.\n  It is a point my colleague, the junior Senator from Wyoming, hit home \npretty well this morning in an op-ed he wrote for Investor's Business \nDaily. It is entitled ``Buffett Tax Divides Americans, But Solves \nNothing.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\n             [From Investor's Business Daily, Apr. 6, 2012]\n\n           Buffett Tax Divides Americans, but Solves Nothing\n\n                        (By Sen. John Barrasso)\n\n       On Monday, the U.S. Senate will vote on President Obama's \n     Buffett tax. The bill is a political gimmick that's supposed \n     to distract Americans from the president's miserable record \n     instead of solving problems.\n       Americans know by now that the bill won't create a single \n     job and it won't ease the pain at the pump. And President \n     Obama and the White House have finally given up pretending \n     that his new tax will balance the budget.\n       Even if he did put the new revenue towards the debt, it \n     would only cover what Washington spends in about a day and a \n     half. All this bill does is waste time and continue to push \n     the president's distorted definition of ``fairness.''\n       President Obama thinks it's fair that our children and \n     grandchildren will be burdened with debt because of his \n     unprecedented reckless spending. Washington borrows 42 cents \n     of every dollar it spends.\n       He thinks it's fair to pile another $40,000 of debt onto \n     every household in the U.S. over the last three years. He \n     thinks it's fair to use college students as props for his \n     campaign-style rallies, without explaining how his bad \n     policies will leave them in debt.\n       He thinks it's fair to force hardworking taxpayers to \n     subsidize a wealthy person's purchase of a hybrid luxury \n     car--because it fits his idea for American energy.\n       He thinks it's fair to hand out hundreds of millions of tax \n     dollars to politically connected solar energy companies that \n     then go bankrupt.\n       He thinks it's fair to tell thousands of workers they won't \n     have jobs because he blocked the Keystone XL pipeline--to \n     solidify the support of a few far left environmentalists.\n       And apparently President Obama thinks it's fair that three \n     years of his policies have left us with more people on food \n     stamps, more people in poverty, lower home values, higher gas \n     prices and higher unemployment.\n       The American people strongly disagree. To the vast \n     majority, fair means an equal opportunity to pursue their \n     dreams. They also recognize that no man and no government can \n     provide a guarantee of success.\n       To President Obama, fair requires nothing less than a \n     totally equal outcome.\n       The waves of immigrants who came to our shores over \n     generations did so for freedom and for a chance to succeed. \n     They did not come here to be taken care of, or to have every \n     decision made for them by the government. That's what many of \n     them left behind. When President Obama pushes for equal \n     outcomes instead of equal opportunity, he pits one group of \n     Americans against another. He is telling people it's not \n     right for someone else to have something they don't have. \n     That may be a good campaign tactic, but it's not true--and \n     it's bad for our country.\n       One person getting more does not mean anyone else has to \n     get less. In America, it's possible for all of us to prosper. \n     That is part of what made America the best from the very \n     beginning. Here all of us can do better--not at the expense \n     of our neighbors, but by our own effort. Our country's social \n     safety net was established to catch people from falling--not \n     to entangle them so they cannot rise. It certainly should \n     never be used to justify burdening taxpayers with trillions \n     of dollars in new debt. Somewhere along the way, Washington \n     twisted the honorable American impulse to care for the least \n     fortunate among us.\n       The Obama definition of ``fairness'' now threatens to \n     produce a culture of dependency that weakens our society.\n       Today's debate over this new tax increase demonstrates the \n     two different approaches to this country's future. President \n     Obama may believe it's fair for Washington to dictate the \n     rules so that everyone is equal in the end. Republicans want \n     to promote economic growth for everybody, not equality of \n     outcome at everybody's expense.\n       Despite what President Obama believes, true fairness \n     requires equal opportunity, so that all may pursue their \n     dreams. America was founded on that idea. That's what will \n     lead us to a more prosperous future for all.\n       Americans deserve policies that promote growth and \n     opportunity, not more taxes and spending.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Here is some of what he wrote. This is Senator \nBarrasso:\n\n       President Obama thinks it's fair that our children and \n     grandchildren will be burdened with debt because of his \n     unprecedented reckless spending. Washington borrows 42 cents \n     of every dollar it spends.\n\n  The President thinks that is fair.\n\n       He thinks it's fair to pile another $40,000 of debt onto \n     every household in the U.S. over the last three years.\n\n  The President thinks that is fair.\n\n       He thinks it's fair to use college students as props for \n     his campaign-style rallies, without explaining how his bad \n     policies will leave them in debt.\n       He thinks it's fair to force hardworking taxpayers to \n     subsidize a wealthy person's purchase of a hybrid luxury \n     car--because it fits his idea for American energy.\n       He thinks it's fair to hand out hundreds of millions of tax \n     dollars to politically connected solar energy companies that \n     then go bankrupt.\n       He thinks it's fair to tell thousands of workers they won't \n     have jobs because he blocked the Keystone XL pipeline--to \n     solidify the support of a few far left environmentalists.\n       And apparently, President Obama thinks it's fair that three \n     years of his policies have left us with more people on food \n     stamps, more people in poverty, lower home values, higher gas \n     prices, and higher unemployment.\n\n  Senator Barrasso then explained what he thinks Americans actually \nthink fairness consists of: equality of opportunity and freedom for \neverybody to pursue their dreams without government blocking the way.\n  For the President, fairness is about taking from some and giving it \nto others. It is about taking from taxpayers and giving it to solar \ncompanies. It is about taking from the private economy and giving it to \ngovernment workers so they can blow it on an $823,000 awards dinner for \nthemselves. It is anything but fair.\n  As for the President's second argument--well, you tell me. What about \nthe way government spends the money it gets from taxpayers makes \nanybody think they would do a better job with the money they hope to \nget from this tax? Does anybody seriously think the government would do \na better job spending this money than the people from whom they would \nextract this additional tax? It is completely ludicrous. Until \nWashington can show that it is a better steward of taxpayer dollars, or \nthat it knows how to invest in a winner, it should not expect people to \nhand over another penny.\n  Here is my point: We have serious problems to address, and the \nPresident is not behaving seriously. There is a need and a growing \ndesire on both sides of the aisle to do something.

The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, on a late spring day 27 years ago, \nPresident Ronald Reagan addressed a group of high school students in \nAtlanta, GA. Many of the students in that audience that day were about \nto join the workforce, and President Reagan spoke about the \n``strange''--to use his word--tax system that would soon claim a \nportion of their paychecks.\n  In his speech President Reagan pledged:\n\n       We're going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that \n     have allowed some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their \n     fair share.\n\n  He went on to note that under the country's complex tax rules, it was \n``possible for millionaires to pay nothing, while a bus driver [pays] \n10 percent of his salary.'' President Reagan called this inequity with \nmillionaires paying lower rates than bus drivers--to use his word--\n``crazy.'' He said, ``It's time we stopped it.''\n  One year later, President Reagan signed into law bipartisan tax \nreform that closed many of the loopholes and ensured that the highest \nearning Americans paid a fair share. The 1986 tax reform deal set the \ntax rate on investment income--overwhelmingly earned by those at the \nvery top of the income ladder--at the same rate as regular wage income.\n  Unfortunately, in the years that followed, lobbyists have been all \nover Congress, and Congress has restored many of the loopholes \nPresident Reagan cut. It has repeatedly reduced tax rates on investment \nincome. The capital gains tax rate has gone from 28\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\npercent in the bipartisan Reagan tax reform to 15 percent today. Once \nagain, those at the very top of the income spectrum have opportunities \nto cut their tax bills that are not available to regular middle-class \nfamilies.\n  Let's look at where we are today, a quarter century after the last \nmajor overhaul of our tax system.\n  In this photo is a building that has stories to tell. This is the \nHelmsley Building on Park Avenue in New York City. Because this \nbuilding is large enough to have its own ZIP Code, we know from public \nIRS information gathered by ZIP Code that the very wealthy and \nsuccessful individuals and corporations that call this building home--\nwith an average adjusted gross income of $1.2 million each--paid, on \naverage, a 14.7-percent total Federal tax rate in the last available \nyear for which we have information. A 14.7-percent total Federal tax \nrate is less than the rate the average New York City janitor, the \naverage New York City doorman, or the average New York City security \nguard pays. The system is upside down.\n  It is not just in the Helmsley Building. Each year, the IRS publishes \na report detailing the taxes paid by the highest earning 400 Americans. \nLast May, the IRS published the most recent data on the top 400 \ntaxpayers--for the year 2008. They had an average income of $270 \nmillion each. That is not bad. In fact, that is wonderful. That is part \nof what makes America great.\n  But here is the ``crazy'' part--to quote President Reagan. On \naverage, these 400 extremely high earning Americans--making $270 \nmillion in 1 year--actually paid an average Federal tax rate of just \n18.2 percent on adjusted gross income. We have spent a fair amount of \ntime in the Senate debating whether the top income tax rate should be \n35 percent or something else--for example, 39.6 percent, as it was in \nthe Clinton boom years. But the ultra rich get around this top rate \nthrough a variety of tax gimmicks.\n  We looked at what level of income a single filer would have to make \nto start paying 18.2 percent or more in Federal taxes. It is $39,350. \nIf we look at the Department of Labor levels, that is about what a \ntruckdriver, on average, earns in Rhode Island. Mr. President, $40,200 \nis what an average truckdriver, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, earns in Rhode Island--more than the $39,350--which means \nthey are probably paying a higher tax rate as a single truckdriver in \nProvidence, RI, than a millionaire who made $270 million in the last \nyear.\n\n  That is just not fair, not right, and that is not the progressive tax \nsystem we have always had. I recently heard from one such truckdriver \nin Rhode Island. Mike Nunes, who is a member of Teamsters Local 251, \njoined me for a roundtable discussion on tax fairness in Cranston, RI. \nMike said:\n\n       I've been a middle-class worker here in Rhode Island since \n     I was in my early twenties. My wife and I pay our taxes, and \n     it's frustrating to hear that multi-millionaires are getting \n     special treatment to pay a lower rate.\n\n  Mike is right. I hear the same as I travel around my State. I know my \ncolleagues hear the same as they meet with their constituents across \nthe country. They all agree with President Reagan that a tax system \nthat allows many of the highest income earners among us to pay less \nthan a truckdriver must be fixed.\n  The problem goes beyond the top 400 income earners in the country. \nThe Congressional Research Service confirms that roughly one-quarter of \n$1 million-plus earners--about 94,500 taxpayers--pay a lower effective \ntax rate than over 10 million moderate-income taxpayers. Reuters \nreported this:\n\n       Taxpayers earning more than $1 million a year pay an \n     average U.S. income tax rate of nearly 19 percent.\n\n  The story goes on:\n\n       About 65 percent of taxpayers who earn more than $1 million \n     face a lower tax rate than the median tax rate for moderate \n     income earners making $100,000 or less a year.\n\n  Let me read that again:\n\n       About 65 percent of taxpayers who earn more than $1 million \n     face a lower tax rate than the median tax rate for moderate \n     income earners making $100,000 or less a year.\n\n  Our tax system is supposed to be progressive. The more one earns, the \nhigher the rate one pays. That is not class warfare; that is tax \npolicy. It has been that way for decades, if not even generations. We \nundermine that principle when we allow the highest income Americans to \npay a lower tax rate than a truckdriver pays. It is no wonder that so \nmany of the Rhode Islanders with whom I have spoken have lost \nconfidence that our tax system gives them a straight deal.\n  With the top 1 percent of Americans earning 23 percent of our \nNation's income and controlling 34 percent of our Nation's wealth--more \nthan one-third--it would be difficult to argue that our system is too \nprogressive.\n  Let's look at this other graphic. Of all of our Nation's wealth, the \ntop 5 percent of Americans own over 60 percent of it. Of all of our \nNation's wealth, the top 5 percent own more than 60 percent of all the \nwealth in the country. The top 1 percent control over one-third of it. \nThe 400 families at the very top--the 400 I talked about earlier--own \nalmost 3 percent of all America's wealth just among those 400 families. \nThese are proportions we have not seen since the Roaring Twenties, and \nthey are getting steadily worse.\n  We are not going to overhaul the Nation's tax laws this evening, but \nin a few hours we will have a chance to advance legislation to restore \nsome fairness into our tax system. This long overdue bill--the Paying a \nFair Share Act of 2012--would implement the so-called Buffett rule, \nafter Warren Buffett, who has famously lamented that he pays a lower \ntax rate than his secretary. To correct this glaring tax inequity, this \nbill would ensure that those at the very top pay at least the tax rates \nfaced by middle-class families.\n  I thank Senators Akaka, Begich, Leahy, Harkin, Blumenthal, Sanders, \nSchumer, Reed of Rhode Island, Rockefeller, Boxer, Durbin, and Levin \nfor cosponsoring this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Lautenberg as a cosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The structure of our bill is simple: If your total \nincome--capital gains included--is over $2 million, you calculate your \ntaxes under the regular system. If your effective rate turns out to be \ngreater than 30 percent, you pay that rate--the same rate you would pay \nwithout the bill.\n  If, on the other hand, your effective tax rate is below 30 percent--\nlike the 11 percent tax rate Warren Buffett paid in 2010--then you \nwould pay the fair share tax of 30 percent instead.\n  Taxpayers earning less than $1 million--which is more than 99.8 \npercent of Americans--would not be affected by this bill at all. For \ntaxpayers earning between $1 million and $2 million, the fair share tax \ngets phased in. Ultimately, when you earn over $2 million, you are \nsubject to the full 30-percent minimum rate.\n  The one exception the bill makes to the 30 percent minimum is to \nmaintain the incentive for charitable giving. Under the bill, taxpayers \nare permitted to subtract the same amount of contributions allowed \nunder the regular income tax from their taxable income. The reason for \nthis one exception should be self-evident: charity benefits others and \ntaxpayers should be encouraged to give.\n  Some say, given our fragile economic recovery, now is the wrong time \nto raise taxes on anyone. While middle-class families continue to \nstruggle through the recovery, it seems the boom times have already \nreturned for those at the very top.\n  According to a recent analysis by University of California at \nBerkeley economist Emmanuel Saez, 93 percent of the income growth in \n2010 went to the top 1 percent of income earners. Even more astounding, \n37 percent of the income growth in that year went to the few thousand \ntaxpayers in the top 0.01 percent. With so much income growth at the \nvery top and with looming budget deficits, it is hard to argue that \npeople with 7-, 8-, 9-, or even 10-figure incomes can't afford to pay a \nreasonable tax rate.\n\n  To be clear, it has been said on this floor this is a tax on \ninvestment and this is a tax on job creation. That is wrong. This is a \ntax on one thing: income.\n  Republicans have criticized the amount of revenue that would be \ngenerated by the bill. The ranking Republican on the Senate Finance \nCommittee called the $47 billion the Joint\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nCommittee on Taxation has estimated a meager sum. Well, in Rhode \nIsland, we don't consider $47 billion to be a meager sum. It is enough \nmoney, for instance, to permanently keep subsidized student loan \ninterest rates from jumping from the current 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent \nin July, which they will do unless we act. If we could use this bill to \noffset the cost of keeping student loan interest rates low, then there \nare millions of students out there who would call that benefit \nsomething other than meager.\n  We could use the $47 billion on badly needed infrastructure projects \nand create 611,000 jobs nationwide. In Rhode Island, we have 11 percent \nunemployment and a long backlog of transportation infrastructure \nprojects. At the top of that list is the viaduct bridge on Interstate \n95 through Providence. This critical link along the northeast corridor \nrunning up through Rhode Island has wooden boards inserted between the \nI-beams underneath to prevent the concrete in the roadway from falling \nin on the traffic below. Also, where the Amtrak rails go underneath, \nthere are wood planks to keep the roadway from falling in on the trains \nas they pass below. I don't think repair of this bridge and others \nwould be meager at $47 billion worth, particularly if we put it into an \ninfrastructure bank and leverage it for even more jobs.\n  It is worth noting this legislation would generate far more revenue \nthan the $47 billion the Republicans complain of if the Republicans \nwere to succeed in their quest to extend the very high-end Bush tax \ncuts. If the Bush tax cuts for people in this bracket continue, the \nrevenue from the bill jumps from $47 billion to $162 billion over a 10-\nyear budget horizon. Operating as a backstop, the Buffett rule can \nensure those at the top pay a fair share no matter what loopholes, no \nmatter what special treatments Congress adds to the Tax Code in the \nfuture.\n  Finally, the Senate Republican leader has described the bill as yet \nanother proposal from the White House that won't create a single job or \nlower the price at the pump by a penny. Well, the minority leader is \nabsolutely right. The aim of this bill is not to lower the unemployment \nrate or the price of gasoline. However, if you put the $47 billion into \ninfrastructure, you could create 611,000 infrastructure jobs and a lot \nof good infrastructure as well. And if you put the $47 billion into \nLIHEAP, you could help millions of Americans pay their energy bills.\n  But let me add an additional point. The Republicans are claiming this \nbill, which is a tax fairness bill, not a job-creating bill, will not \ncreate a single job. Of course, if you spent the revenue, it would, but \nthat is a separate discussion. At the same time they are making that \npoint, the Republicans in Washington are sitting on our highway bill \nwhich creates 3 million jobs and they won't call it up on the House \nside because they do not want to rely on Democratic votes. Three \nmillion jobs are awaiting action in the House on the bipartisan Senate \nhighway bill that had 75 Senators supporting it, and they won't call it \nup--the Republicans won't call it up--because they do not want to use \nDemocratic votes.\n  What kind of Washington insider logic is that? People across this \ncountry who will go to work on those roads and bridges don't think that \nmakes any sense. For Republicans now to be talking about jobs on this \nbill, while they have a jobs bill that creates 3 million jobs they are \nblockading in the House, the word ``jobs'' should turn to ashes in \ntheir mouths.\n  There are plenty of things this narrow tax fairness bill won't do. It \nwill not bring world peace, it won't save endangered whales from \nextension, it won't cure the common cold. It will do none of that. It \nwill restore the confidence of middle-class Americans in our tax system \nby assuring those at the very top of the income spectrum are not paying \nlower rates than regular families do.\n  In addition to restoring fairness to the Tax Code, the bill will \ngenerate considerable revenue to cut the deficit or invest in job \ncreation and critical programs. I happen to think that tax fairness and \ntens of billions of dollars in revenue or deficit reduction are reasons \nenough to pass the bill. And if the Republican leader wishes to work \nwith us on taxing other issues, I am wide open to that. But today's \nvote is about tax fairness. It is about undoing a gimmick in the Tax \nCode that allows people earning over $\\1/4\\ billion a year to pay lower \ntax rates than truckdrivers.\n  Unfortunately, this has become a partisan issue, which is surprising, \nbecause the principle of a progressive Tax Code has always been a basic \nAmerican tax policy principle. The arguments we are making today about \npaying a fair share were made exactly by Ronald Reagan. But things have \nchanged and so there is this squabble. Even business owners support \nthis bill. A recent poll conducted by the American Sustainable Business \nCouncil, the Main Street Alliance, and the Small Business Majority \nfound that 58 percent of business owners said those making over $1 \nmillion a year are not paying their fair share in taxes and 57 percent \nsupported increasing taxes for those at the top. That is out of the \nsmall business community.\n  These business owners know it is simply fair for the most fortunate \nand successful Americans to pay a larger share of their income in taxes \nthan less successful families do. That is what a progressive tax system \nis supposed to do. That is what it has always done. Sadly, over the \npast few decades, as income has soared at the very top, the effective \ntax rates have plummeted.\n  This chart, prepared by Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad, shows \nthe effective Federal income tax rate for the top 400 income earners \nsince 1992. As you can see, there has been a dramatic drop from 1995 to \n2008. These rates are for Federal income tax. If you add in the small \namount of payroll taxes paid by those at the very top--which is a \nseparate discussion, but they fall 100 percent on the income of middle-\nincome families but only on a small portion of the income of super-\nhigh-end income families--the total Federal tax rate for 2008 goes up \nto 18.2 percent, counting in that withholding. That is, again, the \neffective Federal tax rate of that truckdriver in Providence. The trend \nin falling tax rates for those making seven figures in income or more \nhas eroded the confidence of ordinary Americans who do pay their fair \nshare.\n\n  I will conclude with one more quote. This is another quote from \nPresident Reagan's 1985 speech on tax fairness. This is President \nReagan, the man whom so many conservative Republicans revere. He said:\n\n       What we're trying to move against is institutionalized \n     unfairness. We want to see that everyone pays their fair \n     share, and no one gets a free ride. Our reasons? It's good \n     for society when we all know that no one is manipulating the \n     system to their advantage because they're rich and powerful.\n\n  That was President Reagan in 1985. Today, his party is defending that \nmanipulation.\n  In the 27 years since that speech, the American playing field has \nbeen skewed ever more toward the rich and powerful. From bankruptcy \nreform, which favors big corporations over people, to the Citizens \nUnited decision, which has allowed corporations and billionaires to \nspend unlimited cash to influence American elections, to this lower tax \nrate for ultra-high income earners, the American people have simply not \nbeen getting a straight deal from Washington.\n  Many are calling the vote we will have on the Buffett rule bill today \na test vote, because it is on a procedural motion, and the pundits \ndon't expect it to pass. I agree. This is a test vote. But it is a test \nof a different sort. This is a test of Washington, DC, to do something \nthat is simple, to do something that is right, and to do something that \nis fair for the middle class. If we proceed to and pass this bill, it \nwill show the American people that Congress is capable of standing by \ntheir side, that Congress is capable of being on their side, that \nCongress is capable of saying no to a powerful and well-funded special \ninterest. If we fail, it will indicate exactly what President Reagan \nfeared--that the rich and powerful are able to manipulate the system to \ntheir advantage and we in Congress will do nothing about it.\n  One of the things America stands for in this world is that we are \nfair with each other; we get a straight deal and we give each other a \nstraight deal. That is one of the ways in which America stands as an \nexample to the rest of the world. There are plenty of countries where \nthe internal political and\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\neconomic systems amount to a racket--a racket that is rigged for the \nbenefit of the rich and powerful and against farmers and workers and \nsmall businesses and ordinary families. Some of those countries are so \nbad we call them kleptocracies. But that has never been America. That \nis not the America of the Founding Fathers. It is not the America of \nRonald Reagan. It is not the America that shines its light into the \nfour corners of the world as an example to the rest of the world. That \nis not the America we are here to serve.\n  We must be vigilant in protecting the ideals that make this country \nwhat it is. I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to \nheed the words of President Reagan and to support this legislation, \nwhich will ensure that a favored segment of the highest earning \nAmericans once again do something as simple as pay their fair share in \ntaxes. Let us show the American people that our Nation does stand apart \nas an exemplar of fairness and of equal opportunity and of equal \nresponsibility under the law.\n  I thank the Chair. I see colleagues in the Chamber, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we stand here today, the day before tax \nday--the day when all Americans have to get their income taxes \ntogether--and we also stand here in the middle of the weakest economic \nrecovery since the Great Depression--a time when economists across the \nspectrum agree there is an urgent need for us to take our Tax Code and \nmake it more efficient, to reform our Tax Code to help grow our economy \nand add jobs. And instead of an administration or leadership in this \nbody proposing serious tax reforms that will actually get people back \nto work, we are spending this week debating a political proposal that \nno one can credibly argue will create a single job, except maybe some \ntax accountants because it adds more complexity to an already way too \ncomplex Tax Code. Unfortunately, this has become ``tax gimmick week'' \nhere in Washington.\n  It is particularly disappointing because as a Nation we are stuck in \nan historically weak economy with high unemployment, record long-term \nunemployment, and anemic economic growth. This recovery we are in is \ndifferent, sadly. We are still millions of jobs down from where we were \nat the start of the recession, which was about 4 years ago. It is \ninteresting to compare it to other recoveries.\n  In 2001, the so-called jobless recovery, at this point in the \nrecovery about 4 years after the recession, the Nation had not only \nbrought back all the jobs that were lost in the recession but we had \nadded hundreds of thousands of new jobs.\n  Even in 1981, considered the deepest recession in modern history \nbefore the most recent one, at this time 4 years after the recession we \nhad added 6 million new jobs to the economy.\n  Unfortunately, today, as we stand here, we are still down 5.5 million \njobs. So instead of adding 6 million jobs, as we had during the Reagan \nadministration after the 1981 deep recession, today as we stand here we \nare still trying to find how to add back the jobs we lost in the \nrecession, 5.5 million jobs, 5.5 million families across this country \nwho continue to look for hope and opportunity.\n  So in the midst of this weak recovery, the weakest since the Great \nDepression, I think it is reasonable to expect that the President of \nthe United States and the U.S. Congress would focus on real solutions \nto create jobs; in particular, real solutions to reform our \ninefficient, complex, and outdated Tax Code, because there is a \nconsensus out there we need to do that.\n  To make the Tax Code more pro-jobs, to encourage work and savings and \ninvestment requires broad-based reform, and everybody knows it. The \nPresident's own commission, called the Simpson-Bowles commission, \nrecommended it. Most recently, the President's own Jobs Council \nrecommended it.\n  We need a proposal taken up by this Senate that is driven by good \neconomics. Instead, what we are getting this week is one that is driven \nby campaign rhetoric. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nsoon bring to the floor President Obama's proposed new tax targeting \ninvestment income, the Buffett tax, named after businessman Warren \nBuffett, which imposes a 30-percent minimum tax on anyone earning over \na certain amount--$1 million. Interestingly, for all of the chest \nthumping about this is going to reduce our deficit, this new tax will \nbring in less than one-half of 1 percent of the annual individual \nincome taxes that are paid. By the way, this will be enough to pay 1 \nweek's interest on our $15 trillion national debt. That is it. So it is \ncertainly not about deficit reduction at a time of trillion-dollar \ndeficits.\n  The President also says his new tax on investments on American \nbusinesses is necessary to, as he said, invest in what will help the \neconomy grow. This apparently means this will result in more government \nspending. Private enterprises that actually create jobs apparently are \nnot the ones that will be making the investments. Instead, it will be \ninvestments through government spending.\n  I think the Buffett rule is bad economics, I think it is bad fiscal \npolicy, and I think it is a distraction from the broader bipartisan \neffort underway to achieve fundamental tax reform that is necessary to \nunleash a true economic recovery--the proposals built, by the way, on \nthis notion that I heard from my colleague a moment ago that the Tax \nCode is not progressive. We can argue about what progressive means, but \nhere are some statistics:\n  According to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of income \nearners in this country pays a 28-percent Federal tax rate. By \ncontrast, Americans with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000 pay a 19-\npercent tax rate. Those earning between $35,000 and $60,000 pay a 14-\npercent tax rate.\n  Another way to look at this is that the top 1 percent of taxpayers \nnow pays 39 percent of all Federal income taxes. The top 10 percent now \npays 86 percent of all Federal income taxes. Those below the 50-percent \nmark now pay 1 percent of Federal income taxes. Is that progressive or \nnot? I would say it is progressive.\n  To my colleagues who are saying the income tax is not progressive, I \ndon't think that is the concern here. I think the concern is we have an \nincome tax code that has too many preferences, deductions, credits, \nexemptions--by the way, mostly taken advantage of by wealthier \ntaxpayers. We ought to reform the Tax Code.\n  But because the Tax Code is already so progressive, as we talked \nabout, this proposal from the President works primarily by increasing \nthe tax a lot of wealthy people pay on investment income, primarily \nwhat is known as long-term capital gains. Capital gains have \nhistorically been taxed in this country at a lower rate for \nindividuals, and they are taxed at a lower rate for good reason: \nCapital gains are the return on longer term investments and enterprises \nthat create jobs. That is something that we have always wanted to \nencourage in this country. A lower tax on capital gains drives job-\ncreating investment. According to the nonpartisan Congressional \nCommittee on Taxation, it increases wages over the long run. So by \nhaving a lower rate for capital investments, long-term investments in \njob creation, it will increase wages in the long run.\n  By the way, that is why Presidents Kennedy, Reagan, Clinton, and Bush \nall backed capital gains rate cuts. As President Kennedy said so well: \nA rising tide lifts all boats.\n  Second, we should realize that raising the capital gains rate doesn't \ntranslate directly into higher revenues. Why is that? It is because it \nis an elective tax. Think about it. You only pay it when you choose to \nsell an asset, when you choose to realize what is called a gain when \nyou sell something. So you don't have to incur this tax. Common sense, \neconomics, and experience teach that a higher capital gains rate causes \nsome investors to hold assets rather than sell them, just as a lower \ncapital gains rate will encourage more people to sell an asset because \nthe rate will be lower. And this is what has happened: After every \nrecent capital gains rate cut, in 1981, 1997, and 2003, capital gains \nrevenues actually increased.\n  So you had a cut in the rate in 1981, 1997, and 2003, and what \nhappened? The revenues actually increased: Lower rate, higher revenues. \nHow could that be? Well, because with the lower rate people sold more \nassets and created more economic activity.\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\n  Capital gains tax rates increased between 37 and 114 percent over 4 \nyears, and that is after inflation. By contrast, after a capital gains \nrate increase took effect in 1987--that was talked about a moment ago--\ncapital gains revenues actually dropped 55 percent over the next 4 \nyears.\n  So we can debate what the rate ought to be, but the fact is to say \nthat there is going to be a direct correlation between raising that \nrate and more revenue simply is not borne out by historical experience \nor by common sense.\n  Third, unlike other types of income, capital gains are often double \ntaxed. Think about a typical capital investment, someone buying \ncorporate stock--that is the most typical one, holding that stock for \nover 1 year--you have got to hold it for over 1 year--and then selling \nit for a profit. That gain has already been subject to a 35-percent \nrate at the corporate level. It is then followed by the capital gains \nrate, now at 15 percent, when the shareholder sells, for a combined 45-\npercent tax on that capital investment.\n  By the way, with global competitors such as Canada, Japan, the United \nKingdom, and others moving to cut their corporate tax rates in order to \ncreate jobs, this new tax on capital investment would move the United \nStates farther backward in terms of being competitive in the global \neconomy. Our corporate tax rate is already higher than all of our major \nforeign competitors. As of April 1, Japan lowered theirs, making us No. \n1 in the world in something you don't want to be No. 1 in, which is the \nhighest corporate rate. We don't need new barriers to growth and job \ncreation, and that is what would result.\n  Instead of an election year gimmick that won't help the economy, it \nis time to focus on fundamental tax reform to make American businesses \nand workers more competitive again, as the President's own Simpson-\nBowles commission has recommended and as the President's own Jobs \nCouncil has recommended.\n  I agree with what former Clinton Budget Director Alice Rivlin said \nabout the Buffett tax, which is the way to fix the Tax Code is to fix \nthe Tax Code, not to add another complication at the margins. The \nBuffett tax is an election year distraction from serious reform. Why \nnot focus on the elephant in the room--an outdated and complex Tax Code \nthat is hurting our economy, weighing down our economy, making it \nharder for us to get out of the kind of doldrums we are in right now \nwith this weak recovery.\n  I believe there is a consensus among economists and serious thinkers \nacross the political spectrum, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents \nalike, that with an increasingly competitive global economy, we have to \nreform our Tax Code to help us get out of this rut we are in, this \nhistorically weak recovery that leaves too many people vulnerable, too \nmany parents wondering if the future is going to be brighter for their \nkids and grandkids, as it was for them.\n  I believe there is also a growing bipartisan consensus about how to \ndo it, which is that we ought to do it by broadening the base--meaning \ngetting rid of some of these growing credits and deductions and \nexemptions I talked about earlier, lowering the marginal rates on \nAmerican families and on our businesses to be able to create jobs. That \nwill ensure that those who can afford to pay more will pay their \nshare--their fair share. And the economy will grow, a rising tide \nlifting all boats, truly helping families who are worried, for good \nreason, about their economic future.\n  The American people don't deserve more gimmicks, as we will see this \nweek in Washington. They deserve real leadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is interesting that my Republican \ncolleagues tend to refer to this as a tax gimmick. It was referred to \nas tax gimmick week because we are considering having people earning a \nquarter of a billion dollars pay a rate equal to what a truckdriver \npays. That doesn't sound very gimmicky to me. That sounds like pretty \nMain Street fairness to me.\n  But the bottom line is there is a gimmick at stake. It is the gimmick \nin the Tax Code that allows for that to take place, that allows for a \nhedge fund billionaire to claim a lower rate than a truckdriver. So if \nthere is a gimmick here, it is the gimmick we are trying to remove. It \nis not a gimmick that we are trying to pursue.\n  It has been said this is a tax on investment, a tax on job creation. \nIt isn't. It is a tax on income, when it is declared as income. And if \nour purpose should be how to add back the jobs lost in the recession, \nwe just passed a highway bill with 75 Senators supporting it, only 22 \nopposed--which, as we know around here in this partisan environment, is \na landslide. It came out of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nunanimously. It had 40 amendments accepted, and now 3 million jobs are \nbottled up on the other end of this hallway in the House of \nRepresentatives because the Republican Speaker doesn't want to use \nDemocratic votes. If you want to do something about jobs, tell the \nRepublican Speaker to pass the Senate highway bill. It is as simple as \nthat, 3 million jobs, bipartisan. So when we talk about jobs, I have a \ngood recommendation: Pass the big highway jobs bill that is being kept \nbottled up here.\n  The other point I wanted to make on the question of whether the tax \nsystem is progressive, the IRS and the Federal Reserve point out that \nthe top 1 percent in America in terms of wealth controls 33.8 percent \nof the Nation's wealth, but the top 1 percent in taxes pays only 28.3 \npercent of the taxes when all taxes are taken into consideration. The \ntop 5 percent controls 60 percent of the Nation's wealth, but the top 5 \npercent in taxes only pays 44.7 percent. So if you want to take numbers \nsort of without context, you can make it look as if it is very \nprogressive, but when you measure against the wealth inequality in this \ncountry and the income inequality in this country, it is hard to say we \nactually are running a progressive tax system. And that is why, as \nReuters reported, about 65 percent of taxpayers who earn more than $1 \nmillion face a lower tax rate than the median tax rate for moderate-\nincome earners making $100,000 or less a year, according to the \nCongressional Research Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2293-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2293-S2305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATT RUTHERFORD'S SOLO SAIL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, before the Easter recess, I came to the \nfloor to talk about a truly remarkable American--a visionary, a \ndreamer, an adventurer, and, most importantly, a young man who has \ndevoted himself to service to others far above and beyond the call of \nduty. The young man's name is Matt Rutherford, an Ohioan. He turned 31 \nabout a week ago.\n  Here is what he has done in almost the last year. On June 13 of last \nyear, this then-30-year-old young man got onboard a 36-year-old, 27-\nfoot-long Albin Vega sailboat, a small sloop-rigged sailboat, and he \nset out on one of the most audacious adventures ever contemplated by \nany sailor.\n  He set out to circumnavigate the Americas, solo and nonstop. Here is \nwhat he did. On June 13 of last year, he left Annapolis on this small \n27-foot sailboat. He sailed out of the Chesapeake Bay, he sailed up \naround Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Labrador, all the way up by \nGreenland--all by himself--and then sailed the Northwest Passage, all \nthe way through the Northwest Passage here.\n  If I remember right, he has been certified by the Scott Polar \nInstitute in Cambridge, England; he has been recognized as the first \nperson in recorded history to make it through the fabled Northwest \nPassage alone and nonstop in such a small sailboat. He came through the \nNorthwest Passage, rounded Alaska, went from Alaska all the way down to \nCape Horn.\n  Again, if you know anything about the treacherous waters of Cape \nHorn, you know someone in a small 27-foot boat probably doesn't have \nmuch chance of making it, but he did it. He went around Cape Horn, all \nthe way up the coast of South America, up through the Caribbean, and \ntoday as I stand here and speak, he is just outside of the mouth of the \nChesapeake Bay, off the coast of Virginia, the North Carolina-Virginia \nborder, and is going to make landfall this Saturday in Annapolis, 313 \ndays after he started--solo, nonstop, never touched land. This is one \nof the most historic adventures ever undertaken by a human being,\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\nsolo, nonstop, around the Americas--313 days in treacherous waters. He \nhas not set foot on dry land for the entire journey. He has not \nstopped.\n  I have had the privilege of talking to Matt. I never met the young \nman--not yet--but I had the privilege of talking with him on his \nsatellite phone just last week, when he said to me it would probably be \nthe last phone call he would make because all of his equipment is now \nstarting to fail. He said: It is like the boat is talking to me, and it \nknows the journey is almost over. His solar panels have died, his wind \ngenerator is gone, his engine doesn't work, and he is out of power. He \nis only under sail, he has no engine any longer, and he says that when \nbig waves hit, the boat creeks and groans. He is just about to make it \ninto the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. What a tremendous adventure. \nRight now he is about 15 miles off of Kitty Hawk, NC. So 313 days after \nhe began, he will make landfall this Saturday at the National Sailing \nHall of Fame dock in Annapolis, MD. That will be the first time he will \nset foot on dry land in 313 days.\n  I am in awe of Matt's courage, his character, and his audacity to do \nthis. He is in a class with a tiny group of explorers and adventurers, \npathbreakers who defied odds to accomplish greatness. I think of Joshua \nSlocum, the first person to sail singlehandedly around the world. It \ntook him 3 years. He covered 46,000 miles. He made many stops, but he \ndid it between 1895 and 1898--the first known solo circumnavigation of \nthe Earth. I think of Sir Francis Chichester, who sailed from Plymouth, \nEngland, in 1966, the first person to achieve a true circumnavigation \nof the world solo, from west to east, via the great capes. He did so in \n226 days with one stop in Australia. I think of Dick Rutan and Jeana \nYeager and their Voyager aircraft--now hanging in the Smithsonian--in \n1986, the first to fly around the world nonstop without refueling. I \nthink of the extraordinary feats of physical endurance and courage of \nRobert Peary in 1909, the first person to reach the North Pole; Roald \nAmundsen in 1911, the first person to reach the South Pole; and Sir \nEdmund Hillary in 1953, the first person to climb Mount Everest. Matt \nRutherford now finds himself in this very exclusive company and club of \naudacious adventurers.\n  However, I would say Matt Rutherford has in important ways surpassed \nthe feats of, say, Slocum and Chichester because Slocum and Chichester \nmade stops during their voyages. Matt is accomplishing his voyage solo, \nnonstop, on a small 36-year-old boat, 27 feet long, best suited for \nweekend sailors who do not want to venture outside of the Chesapeake \nBay. As I said, the Scott Polar Institute in England has already \nrecognized him as the first person in recorded history to make this \nsail solo through the Northwest Passage in a small sailboat.\n  Here, again, is where Matt is in a class by himself. Why is he doing \nit? Yes, he is going to set a very fantastic record. It has never been \ndone before. But he is doing it to raise money for Chesapeake Region \nAccessible Boating--CRAB for short. It is an Annapolis-based \norganization that provides sailing opportunities for physically or \ndevelopmentally disabled persons. You can see now why I am so \ninterested, as the lead sponsor of the Americans With Disabilities Act. \nI am deeply impressed by the fact that Matt has undertaken this \nhistoric voyage in a cause larger than himself to make it possible for \nmore people with disabilities to have the opportunity to experience and \nenjoy boating and sailing. One of the fundamental goals of the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act is that people with disabilities should \nbe able to participate fully in all aspects of society, and that \nincludes recreational opportunities such as sailing, which can be \nexhilarating and empowering for children and adults with a wide range \nof disabilities.\n  I salute Matt for his courage. He is almost home. He will be here \nthis Saturday. Here is the young man sitting on his boat. I assume that \npicture was taken when he was up in the Northwest Passage because he \nlooks pretty cold, but he is a young man with extreme courage. What an \naudacious undertaking. People advised him no, that he could never do \nit, that the odds of him surviving through all these treacherous waters \nwere very small, but he decided to do it nonetheless. He is setting a \ntremendous record. I salute him for wanting to share his love of \nsailing with the disability community, for using his adventure to raise \nawareness and expand access to sailing to Americans with disabilities.\n  I say to all, if you want to learn more about Matt and the mission, \nyou can go to his Web site. It is very easy to remember; it is just \nsolotheamericas.org, www.solotheamericas. You can go back and follow \nhim through this entire journey around the Americas--\nsolotheamericas.org.\n  I applaud Matt Rutherford for his vision and spirit. I wish him safe \npassage during this final leg of this epic journey. I hope to have the \nhonor of meeting him and thanking him upon his return. Matt Rutherford \nis one of those remarkable human beings who dream big, driven by big \nchallenges, who refuse to accept the limits and boundaries so-called \nreasonable people readily acknowledge, who put aside fear in order to \naccomplish great and good things, not just for themselves but for \nothers. That is Matt Rutherford. I again applaud him for his courage \nand for sticking with it. It is one of the great feats of ocean sailing \nthat have taken place in the entire history of sailing the great \noceans. He will be back this Saturday. As I said, we hope he has fair \nwinds and a following sea for the next 4 or 5 days.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, very soon the Senate is going to be voting \non whether to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to Paying a Fair \nShare Act of 2012, to enact the so-called Buffett rule. It is ironic \nthat we would be debating that subject right now because there is so \nmuch work we ought to be doing that would actually address the \nfundamental problems our economy is facing right now.\n  If you look at the President's focus on this particular issue and you \nlook at what his economic record consists of since he became President, \nhere is what we are looking at. Gas prices are up 111 percent since \nPresident Obama took office. There are now 38 months in a row where we \nhave had unemployment that exceeded 8 percent. We have seen college \ntuition go up by 25 percent. We have seen health care costs go up by 23 \npercent. The number of people on food stamps in this country is up by \n45 percent. The Federal debt we are handing off to our children and \ngrandchildren is up by 47 percent. That is this President's economic \nrecord.\n  It is ironic that we are here today talking about something even the \nWhite House admits is a gimmick that would do nothing to reduce the \nFederal debt, strengthen the economy, or move us toward the fundamental \ntax reform that is sorely needed for this country.\n  On April 1, just over 2 weeks ago, America claimed the dubious \ndistinction of having the highest combined corporate tax rates among \nadvanced economies when Japan implemented its corporate rate tax \nreduction. Yet, rather than debate how best to reform our Tax Code to \nhelp American companies compete in a global economy, we are instead \nspending our time on a politically motivated measure that everybody \nknows is not going to become law.\n  Before we consider why the Buffett rule is bad tax policy, let me \nstart by acknowledging just how inconsequential this change in law \nwould be. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the bill \noffered by Senator Whitehouse would raise tax revenue by $47 billion \nover the next 10 years. This means the legislation, if enacted, would \nraise each year about half of what the Federal Government spends every \nsingle day. Think about that for just a moment. President Obama has \nbeen flying around the country touting the importance of a proposal \nthat, if enacted, would raise about half of 1 day's worth of Federal \nspending. So between now and this time tomorrow we will actually spend \nmore Federal tax dollars than what this would bring in in an entire \nyear. Put another way, the revenue this legislation would raise each \nyear amounts to .03 of 1 percent of the $15.6 trillion national \ndebt--.03 of 1 percent of the Federal debt. This bill would raise less \nthan 1 percent of the $6.4 trillion in deficits projected over the next \ndecade under the Obama administration's budget.\n\n  This bill is clearly not about deficit reduction or taking any \nmeaningful action to get our fiscal house in order.\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\nWhat then is this legislation about? The President and many Democratic \nMembers of Congress stated they believe the Buffett rule is about ``tax \nfairness.'' Their view is that wealthy Americans are not paying their \n``fair share.'' Unfortunately for supporters of this legislation, the \nfacts simply don't support that view.\n  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, the United States already has the most progressive income \ntax system among its 34 member nations. In fact, in 2009 the top 1 \npercent of taxpayers by adjusted gross income paid 37 percent of all \nFederal income taxes even though they only accounted for 17 percent of \nall income. Let's take the top 5 percent of taxpayers. They paid 60 \npercent of all income taxes even though they only accounted for 32 \npercent of all income. In 2009, taxpayers with over $1 million in \nadjusted gross income accounted for 10 percent of income reported but \npaid 20 percent of income taxes.\n  In terms of effective income tax rates, the Congressional Research \nService recently reported that the average effective tax rate among \nmillionaires is already 30 percent. It is true that some millionaires \nsuch as Warren Buffett pay a lower effective tax rate because they get \na large percentage of their income from capital gains and dividends. \nThe lower tax rate on investment income is not a tax loophole; it is \nthe result of a deliberate policy by Congress and past Presidents to \nencourage new investments in our economy.\n  In fact, in 1997, Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law a \nreduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent. \nWhat was the result of that rate reduction? Taxable capital gains \nnearly doubled over the next 3 years. Unemployment fell below 4 \npercent, and the increased Federal revenue from capital gains \nrealization held a Federal budget surplus.\n  But rather than learning the lesson that lower taxes on investment \nincome lead to more investment, the Buffett tax would take us in the \nopposite direction. The Buffett tax is nothing more than a backdoor tax \non the nearly 60 percent of all capital gains and dividend income \nearned by upper income taxpayers. We can debate about how best to \nencourage new investments in clean energy and high technology or in \nother important sectors of our economy, but I hope we can all agree \nthat raising taxes on these investments is not the best way to \nencourage them.\n  We should bear in mind that the current U.S. integrated tax rate is \n50.8 percent, the fourth highest among OECD nations. It is bad enough \nthat America has the highest combined corporate tax rate. Perhaps some \nsupporters of the Buffett tax would also wish us to have the highest \ntax on investment income as well. Simply put, the Buffett tax is a \nsolution in search of a problem. Wealthy Americans are already paying a \nhuge share of income taxes. And for that small minority of wealthier \nAmericans such as Warren Buffett who feel compelled to pay higher taxes \nto the Federal Government, I propose that we make it easier for them to \ndo so.\n  Last October I introduced the Buffett Rule Act of 2011, which \ncurrently has 40 cosponsors here in the Senate. My legislation would \ncreate a box on the Federal tax forms that individuals or businesses \ncould check if they wish to donate additional dollars to the Federal \nGovernment for debt reduction. We should make it as easy as possible \nfor those who want to pay higher taxes to voluntarily make those \npayments, but let's not impose a new tax on entrepreneurs and small \nbusiness owners who believe they can spend their own dollars better \nthan Washington can.\n  Some have attempted to characterize this bill as a step toward \ncomprehensive tax reform. When I say this bill, I am talking about the \nbill we are going to be voting on later. Unfortunately, it is exactly \nthe opposite. Comprehensive tax reform is needed for many reasons, but \none major reason is because we desperately need to simplify our \nconvoluted tax system. How is a bill that adds a new layer of \ncomplexity to the Tax Code a step toward comprehensive tax reform? It \nis bad enough that we already have an alternative minimum tax that \nsnares millions of American families. The Buffett tax, if it is \nenacted, would become an alternative alternative minimum tax. It would \nbe a new layer of unnecessary complexity on top of an already existing \nlayer of unnecessary complexity.\n  We should not forget that the alternative minimum tax was originally \nput in place back in 1970 to ensure that 155 wealthy Americans paid a \nhigher rate of tax. Yet this year over 4 million Americans are going to \nbe hit by the alternative minimum tax. In fact, if Congress does not \nact to enact the AMT patch for tax year 2012, the Congressional Budget \nOffice projects that more than 30 million Americans will be subject to \nhigher taxes due to the alternative minimum tax. Clearly Congress's \nrecord of targeting tax increases at only the very wealthy is not very \ngood.\n  The Obama administration has stated that its intent is for the \nBuffett rule to replace the existing alternative minimum tax. Yet \naccording to an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, replacing \nthe existing AMT with the Buffett tax would add nearly $800 billion to \nthe deficit over the next 10 years. It is time for the gimmicks to stop \nand the Senate to get serious about the real tax issues that are facing \nus. The reality is we have a $5 trillion tax increase over the next 10 \nyears--the largest tax increase in our Nation's history--staring us in \nthe face come next year. If we don't act to extend the lower individual \ntax rates, the lower estate tax rates, the lower rates on capital gains \nand dividend and other expiring provisions, our economy will face a tax \nincrease of over $400 billion in 2013.\n  Allowing 2001 and 2003 tax rates to expire would be an enormous tax \nincrease on our economy equal roughly to 2.5 percent of the GDP. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, allowing the new tax \nincrease to go into effect would slow GDP from 0.3 percent to 2.9 \npercent. That would mean a loss of at least 300,000 jobs and could mean \nthe loss of as many as 2.9 million jobs. This massive tax increase \ncould mean the difference between a sustained economic recovery and \nfalling back into recession.\n  Yet here we are today discussing a bill that would not extend tax \nrelief for hard-working Americans. It would not forestall a massive tax \nincrease on our economy. The bill before us would do one thing and one \nthing only, and that is target higher taxes on a smaller subset of our \npopulation in order to serve a political purpose. It is time to end the \nclass warfare of pitting one group of Americans against another and \ninstead move forward with ensuring that tax relief is there for all \nAmericans. I hope that once the cloture motion fails later today, we \ncan pivot to what most American people want us to do and that is to \nenact measures that grow the pie, to expand our shared prosperity \nrather than the politics of envy and wealth redistribution.\n\n  The opportunity cost of all of these tax-the-rich proposals offered \nby our Democratic colleagues--whether the millionaire surtax or Buffett \ntax--is that they distract us from what should be our focus, and that \nis fundamental tax reform.\n  The former Director of the CBO, Doug Holtz-Eakin, recently released a \nstudy where he estimated that comprehensive tax reform could raise the \nrate of GDP growth by at least 0.3 percentage points annually. This \nfaster rate of GDP growth would result in increased Federal revenues in \nthe range of $80 billion to $100 billion each year, much more than the \nBuffett tax is projected to raise.\n  So I will say to my Democratic colleagues, if you want tax policies \nthat raise more Federal government revenue, broad-based, comprehensive \ntax reform is the way to get there. But, of course, tax reform is going \nto be difficult and it will require Presidential leadership as much as \nit required Presidential leadership back in 1986. It is easier to \npromote measures such as the Buffett tax that do nothing to improve our \ntax or our economy but that make for a good 30-second political ad.\n  I understand why some of my colleagues want us to have this political \ndebate today, but I hope we can move quickly to real progrowth tax \nreforms. That would be the best means by which to promote real tax \nfairness for all Americans. I believe all Americans want to see this \nCongress working in a way that expands the pie, not redistributes it.\n\n[[Page S2296]]\n\n  We should be looking at ways we can grow the economy and make and \ncreate more jobs for more Americans, raise the standard of living, \nquality of life Americans enjoy in this country. It is clear the one \nway not to do that is to raise taxes on the people who invest and \ncreate jobs in this country, and that is precisely what this particular \ntax would do. It is the wrong approach. It is clearly motivated by \npolitical purposes, nothing more than to create a good 30-second \npolitical ad in an election year. If the American people see through \nthis, they understand what plagues Washington, DC, is not a revenue \nproblem, it is a spending problem.\n  For those who want to pay more, we have a way of doing that. Let's \nenact legislation that allows people in this country who have that kind \nof income to be able to check a box to contribute more in tax revenue \ntoward tax reduction, but let's not impose and require and mandate \nthese types of taxes on the people in this country who are creating the \njobs and have an opportunity to help us grow this economy and put more \npeople back to work. After all, that is what the American people want \nus to be focused on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Montana National Guard\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, tomorrow 145 Montana Guardsmen will kiss \ntheir husbands and wives, hug their children, say goodbye to their \nfriends, and get on a plane from Billings, MT to Afghanistan. Two weeks \nfrom today 95 more Montanans will do the same. Together these 240 \nMontana Guardsmen are in the long line of thousands of Montanans to \ndeploy since 9/11. More Montanans signed up for service after 9/11 than \nany other State in the country per capita. Since then, 6,668 Montana \nGuardsmen were deployed. Montana's Guard has deployed at among the \nhighest rate in the country.\n  Each and every deployment requires enormous sacrifices from the \nGuardsmen themselves, their families holding down the fort at home, \ntheir employers, and entire communities. They make these sacrifices \nquietly. They perform their missions with excellence, professionalism, \nand without bragging. So I want to do a little bragging on their behalf \nand salute each and every one as they prepare for combat.\n  The 484th Military Police Company leaving tomorrow is based in Malta, \nGlasgow, and Billings. Their mission will be to help train the Afghan \nnational police. They will be immersed in the Afghan culture, working \nhand in hand with the local officers deep in the heart of the city \nprecincts. What an incredibly important and challenging task, and they \nare ready.\n  They have been training hard for this job for more than a year. Many \nof them will bring invaluable experience in civilian law enforcement \nthat will be critical to this mission.\n  The 260th Engineering Support Company will also leave Montana April \n30 for a year-long tour in Afghanistan. The unit is from Miles City, \nCulbertson, and Sidney. They will perform the dangerous mission of \nclearing explosives off roads and protecting U.S. convoys from Taliban \nattacks. The 95 members of this unit have received specialized \nexplosive training and they are ready to go.\n  This past February 60 members of the Bravo Company 1st of the 189th \nGeneral Support Aviation Brigade left Helena for a tour in Afghanistan. \nTheir unit flies and maintains six CH 47 Chinook helicopters and has a \nlifeline of supplies, ammunition, food, and water for air troops. They \nhelp get the troops where they need to go to accomplish their missions \nquickly and safely.\n  Last March, 12 Montana Guardsmen returned from duty in Iraq and \nKuwait. They flew C 12s, getting troops where they needed to go to \naccomplish top-priority missions.\n  In 2011, nearly 100 Montana troops deployed again to Iraq. They were \nCharlie Company 1st of the 189th, and they were among the last of the \ncombat troops on the ground. They provided medevac support for the \nfamous road march that brought our troops out of Iraq from Camp Adder, \nnear Nasiriyah, to the Khabari border crossing into Kuwait.\n  In 2010, more than 600 Montana Guard troops served in Iraq, and \nthousands more had deployed there in previous years.\n  Our Air Guard has been busy. In 2010, 99 members of the Red Horse \nsquadron, an engineer unit, spent a year working in Afghanistan. They \nbuilt about every kind of structure you can imagine to support the \nmission on the ground, from fixing airfields, so our troops could land \nand take off safely, to constructing observation towers vital to \nintelligence on the ground, to drilling wells to bring water to some of \nthe most dangerous parts of the country.\n  At the same time, dozens of Montana airmen have deployed to support \nthe Air Sovereignty Alert in the Pacific. They are our first line of \ndefense in the Pacific, on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  On top of all this, 53 Montana Airmen deployed individually to \nsupport missions over the course of the last year in Bahrain, Cuba, \nDjibouti, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, and a number of other locations around \nthe world.\n  The Guard has their mission at home as well. When flooding hit \nMontana last week, the Montana National Guard troops were some of the \nfirst folks to respond with a helping hand. When Highway 12 was washed \nout, the town of Roundup basically became an island. The Montana Guard \nwas their bridge, carrying supplies back and forth.\n  It is an understatement to say these guys are busy. They are \nvolunteers, and they are balancing their military service with their \ncivilian careers at home. We can't thank them enough for what they are \ndoing.\n  It is hard to capture the nature of their service unless one has seen \nit firsthand. During my visit to Afghanistan, I was so impressed by the \nservice and professionalism of our troops serving there. They were \nremarkable.\n  One brief story from a guardsman serving in Iraq in 2011 captures the \nspirit of who those men and women are. Montana Specialist Chvilicek was \nserving as a medic in a convoy near Balad. His convoy hit an IED which \ncut Specialist Chvilicek's arm and ear with shrapnel. Instead of \nattending to his own wounds, Specialist Chvilicek immediately sprang \ninto action, providing medical care to his fellow soldiers. That is \nremarkable, but it is not uncommon. That is exactly the kind of spirit \nthese troops have.\n  Our Nation has been at war now for more than 10 years. These men and \nwomen represent the 1 percent of our country serving in the military \nwho are bearing a very heavy load for the rest of us.\n  Montanans do not take these men and women for granted. Friends, \nfamilies, neighbors and communities show up to wish them well when they \ndeploy and greet them when they return home. They send care packages \noverseas and fill in as babysitters here at home. They provide hands to \nhold and ears to listen.\n  To every Montanan serving as part of that support system and to every \nemployer of a national guardsmen: thank you for what you do.\n  Last year I had the honor of attending a deployment ceremony in \nHelena. A mother told me about what it was like when her husband was \ndeployed.\n  To sum up what she said: It's not easy for these families. For \nmonths, there is one fewer helping hand around the house to help out \nwith the carpools, the homework, the leaky faucets, the lawn mowing, \nand everything else that goes into raising a family day to day.\n  Our military families shoulder a heavy load to support the loved ones \nwho deploy. But you will never hear them complain. They are proud of \ntheir service.\n  It is our job to do our part to make sure our troops and our families \nare taken care of when they come home. A big part of that is making \nsure they have jobs to come home to. Recent unemployment figures show \nthat 9.1 percent of current or past members of the Reserve or National \nGuard were unemployed. In Montana that number is as high as 20 percent \nfor our troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. We need to work \nhard to bring that figure down.\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\n  I was proud to work on getting a tax credit to help businesses hire \nour veterans.\n  And this week I am meeting with representatives from the Military \nOfficers Association of America to discuss more ways we can help.\n  One important piece is simply getting the word out. With the help of \nthe Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America the Employer Support of \nthe Guard and Reserve, the American Legion, and the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, we can make sure that both veterans and employers know about it \nand take full advantage of the credit.\n  In 1776, Thomas Paine wrote: ``These are the times that try men's \nsouls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this \ncrisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by \nit now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.''\n  The Montana Guardsmen leaving this month, their families and entire \ncommunities, will face a true trial in Afghanistan. We thank them \ndeeply for their service and sacrifice.\n  To every Guardsmen deploying tomorrow: Thank you for your service. \nAnd good luck. Please know you are on our minds and in our hearts each \nand every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I have risen many times over the past 3 \nyears to talk about the bad policy choices of the Obama administration \nand the harmful effects of these policies on our economy and on the \nAmerican people.\n  In many ways, the President's decisions have made things worse in our \ncountry. The bill before us today would impose what is being called the \nBuffett tax. It is just one more example of a policy that will hurt our \neconomy, not help it. This tax will take money from the pockets of \nsmall businesses that they would use to create jobs. More than one-\nthird of all business income reported on individual returns would be \nhit by this tax increase.\n  Back in September President Obama said this tax hike on American \nfamilies would raise enough money not only to pay for his increased \nspending but it would ``stabilize our debt and deficits for the next \ndecade.'' Back then he said: ``This is not politics; this is math.''\n  Of course, we now know the Buffett tax is only about one thing: \npolitics. The increased tax revenue would amount to about $5 billion \nthis year, which is about the same amount of money Washington will \nborrow over the next day and a half. The President would have to \ncollect his so-called Buffett tax for more than 200 years just to cover \nthe Obama deficit from last year alone. That is not just my math; that \nis the math from the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  The Buffett tax will not fix Washington's debt because Washington \ndoesn't have a revenue problem; it has a spending problem. Even one of \nPresident Obama's top economic advisers finally admits the Buffett tax \nwill not ``bring the deficit down and the debt under control.'' Based \non his record, it is clear the President would not put a single dollar \nraised by his new tax toward the debt. He will just spend it.\n  So the President has now changed his story once again. Now he says \nthis is no longer a way to pay down the deficit. Now he says it is just \na matter of fairness.\n  President Obama has been using the word ``fair'' in quite a few of \nhis campaign speeches lately. It is a word of great appeal to most \npeople. Just like ``hope'' and ``change''--the buzz words of the 2008 \nPresidential campaign--people can interpret it to fit their own \nmeaning. President Obama's idea of fairness doesn't match up with the \nAmerican people's idea of fairness.\n  Senator McConnell earlier made reference to an editorial I wrote in \nInvestors Business Daily. President Obama thinks it is fair that our \nchildren and grandchildren will be burdened with debt because of \nWashington's reckless spending, such as borrowing 42 cents of every $1 \nit spent so far this year. President Obama thinks it was fair to pile \nanother $40,000 of debt onto every household in the United States over \nthe last 3 years.\n  President Obama thinks it is fair to use college students as props \nfor his campaign-style rallies without explaining how his bad policies \nwill leave them in debt. President Obama thinks it is fair to force \nhard-working taxpayers to subsidize a wealthy person's purchase of a \nhybrid luxury car because it fits into his idea for American energy.\n  President Obama thinks it is fair to hand out hundreds of millions of \ntaxpayer dollars to politically connected solar energy companies that \nthen go bankrupt. President Obama thinks it is fair to tell thousands \nof workers they will not have jobs because he has blocked the Keystone \nXL Pipeline. Why? To solidify his support with a few far-left \nenvironmentalists.\n  President Obama thinks it is fair that more than half of his biggest \nfundraisers won jobs in his administration. That is right, more than \nhalf, which has been reported in the Washington Post. President Obama \nthinks it is fair to give important jobs to people who fail to pay \ntheir own taxes, such as his own Treasury Secretary.\n  Apparently, President Obama thinks it is fair that 3 years of the \nObama economy have left us with more people on food stamps, more people \nin poverty, lower home values, higher gas prices, and higher \nunemployment.\n  There are many ways in which the American people's understanding of \n``fairness'' differs from the way President Obama has been using the \nword. To the vast majority of Americans, ``fair'' means an equal \nopportunity to succeed. To President Obama, ``fair'' requires nothing \nless than a total equal outcome regardless of effort.\n  To most Americans, fairness allows for the pursuit of their own \ndreams. It also recognizes that no man and no government can provide a \nguarantee of success.\n  The waves of immigrants who have come to our shores over generations \ndid so for freedom and for a chance to succeed. They did not come to be \ntaken care of and to have every decision made for them by the \ngovernment. That is what many of them were leaving behind.\n  When President Obama pushes for equal outcomes instead of equal \nopportunity, he is trying to pit one American against another. He is \ntelling people it is not fair that someone else has something they \ndon't have. That may be a clever campaign tactic, but it is not true, \nand it is bad for our country. One person getting more does not mean \nsomeone else has to get less. In America, it is possible for all of us \nto prosper. That is what made America different from the very \nbeginning--the prospect that all of us can do better--not at the \nexpense of our neighbors but by our own effort.\n  There is something that threatens to keep all of us from success. It \nis the thing that threatens to keep us all from passing on to our \nchildren the hope for their own prosperity. It is the crushing debt, \nthe debt this administration has been forcing onto the backs of \nAmerican workers. It is the mountain of bureaucracy that stifles \nAmerican opportunity.\n  The old maxim says that a rising tide lifts all boats. President \nObama seems to think it is better to put holes in all of the boats as \nlong as that means they are all equal in the end. That is what he \nseemed to be saying in 2008 during one of the Democratic Presidential \ndebates.\n  Moderator Charles Gibson asked then-Senator Obama why he favored \nraising taxes on capital gains. Our history clearly showed that when \nthe tax rate has gone up, government revenues actually went down. \nSenator Obama said he wanted to raise taxes anyway ``for purposes of \nfairness.''\n  In the name of achieving what he considers to be fair, the President \nwas willing to hurt millions of hard-working families who already paid \ntaxes on their income--families who invested some of that income and \nnow would have to pay higher taxes again when they decide to sell some \nof those investments. The President didn't even care if Washington \nended up with less money as a result of his efforts to punish success. \nThe only important thing was that he thought it would be more fair.\n\n  That is a pretty extreme definition of what ``fair'' means, and it is \nnot one the American people share. In any fair society, doing better \nshould be a consequence of one's efforts. To President Obama, fairness \nmeans getting something for nothing.\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\n  The American dream is about people using ingenuity, ambition, and \nhard work. It is about overcoming obstacles. Americans admire the \ninventor who works long hours in the garage, building and failing and \ntrying again and again until this inventor succeeds. Americans speak \nwith pride about having worked their way through college washing \ndishes, pouring concrete, flipping hamburgers--whatever it took for \nthem to reach their goals.\n  Most Americans don't speak with pride about being bailed out by \nWashington or cashing a government check. The idea of people earning \ntheir success has been a vital part of our Nation's character since our \nfounding. It does not come from government. It cannot be redistributed.\n  The more government tries to redistribute success, the more strings \nit attaches because a handout from Washington always comes with strings \nattached.\n  The President's health care law is a perfect example. It is built on \nshifting millions of people onto Medicaid, a program designed to take \ncare of low-income Americans. Putting more people on Medicaid is not \nthe same as giving them access to the medical care they need.\n  Giving people unemployment benefits and funding short-term stimulus \njobs is not the same as freeing up employers to hire more workers and \nproviding long-term jobs and actual careers. Handing out benefits from \nWashington may provide a safety net in the short run, but when the \nshort run turns permanent it robs people of the tools and incentives \nthey need to succeed. It does even greater damage to our economy when \nPresident Obama pays for it by piling more debt on the backs of \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  We all recognize the value of the social safety net. None of us--I \nrepeat, none of us--wants to eliminate that protection. To be true to \nthis country's greatest traditions, it must be a real safety net to \ncatch people who are falling. It must never become a net to entangle \nthem so they cannot rise nor a comfortable hammock on which they choose \nto recline.\n  Somewhere along the way Washington twisted the honorable American \nimpulse to care for the most vulnerable among us. That shift now \nthreatens to produce a culture of dependency that weakens our society \nand hurts the people it was meant to help.\n  A half century ago, John F. Kennedy appealed to the great spirit of \nAmerica when he said:\n\n       ``Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you \n     can do for your country.''\n\n  Today, the Obama administration is trying to make Washington \nirreplaceable in the lives of Americans. The great irony, the great \ntragedy, is that no one is more trapped by this failed redistribution \nthan the poorest--the people the President so often claims to be trying \nto help. That is part of the downside to the culture of dependency. It \nis why Washington can never provide for people as well as people could \nand should provide for themselves.\n  President Obama is focused on fixing all of the faults he sees in the \nAmerican people. Republicans are focusing on giving the American people \nthe opportunity to succeed using their talents and their hard work. \nWhen Washington tells people: Don't worry; your government will take \ncare of all your needs, it does them no service. It only deprives \npeople of their freedoms to make their own choices, to stand on their \nown two feet, and to earn their success.\n  The American people don't want Washington to pick winners and losers. \nThey want a fair chance to win on their own. That is why they are \nasking for a clear and limited set of rules and the assurance that \nthose rules apply to all of us, even those who donate to President \nObama's reelection campaign. They are asking that the rules not change \non the whims of some unelected bureaucrat in Washington. They want to \nknow they still have the right to control their own choices.\n  President Obama says it is fair for Washington to make the decisions \nso that everyone is equal in the end. He says it is fair to take more \nmoney from hard-working families and small businesses through the so-\ncalled Buffett tax we are debating today.\n  Tax increases will not help our fragile economy, and they will not \nput the brakes on Washington's out-of-control spending. Republicans \nwant to promote economic growth for everyone, not equality of outcome \nat everyone's expense.\n  Despite what President Obama may believe, America is not an unfair \nplace. True fairness requires equal opportunity so all may pursue their \nAmerican dream. That is what America was founded on, and that is the \nphilosophy that must be allowed to lead us to a more prosperous future \nfor all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Buffett rule. How \nmuch time is allocated to me?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 18 minutes remaining on \nthe Senator's side of the aisle.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will take no more than 5 minutes.\n  I support the Buffett Rule because I do believe in fundamental \nfairness that if people live in the United States of America, if they \nbenefit from the United States of America, both its national security \nand its public institutions, and the public progress because of that--\nsuch as public education, land-grant colleges--they need to pay their \nfair share. This is what America is all about, fairness. And we are all \nin it together.\n  I have heard all afternoon about, oh, this hard-working entrepreneur, \nand, oh, this hard-working small business person. Nobody gets to be \nthat hard-working entrepreneur without the United States of America. \nThey have gone to public schools. They have enjoyed public \ntransportation. I could go through a variety of public institutions--\nsafety in our dams, now cybersecurity, wars that are fought by our \nmilitary for which they will not go or will never go. So we need to \nhave a way of paying our bills.\n  When we hear the great President John F. Kennedy quoted saying: ``Ask \nnot what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your \ncountry,'' it is called pay your share.\n  Let's talk about what the Buffett rule actually is and what the \nSenator from Rhode Island is advocating--and I salute him for offering \nit. This would ensure that high-earning Americans who make more than $1 \nmillion a year pay at least 30 percent income tax on their effective \nrate on their second $1 million.\n  Let me repeat what this is. People's first $1 million they keep at \nthe same tax rate it is right this afternoon. What we are talking about \nis changing the tax rate not on their first $1 million but on their \nsecond $1 million. I do not think that stifles entrepreneurship. I do \nnot think it breaks the neck of small business.\n  I know so many small businesses. They like to make that million bucks \nand then pay that. What the small business needs is not more tax \nbreaks; they need more customers, which is about more jobs.\n  I think this bill talks about this fairness. It would phase in \nadditional tax liability for taxpayers earning between $1 million and \n$2 million to avoid a tax cliff, and they are saying: Oh, well, let's \nkeep our money so we can give it to charity. This preserves the \nincentive for charitable giving.\n  Quite frankly, from what we are told, the highest earning 400 \nAmericans make about $270 million each. They are the ones who paid an \neffective tax rate of 18 percent. Just think, they make $270 million. \nThat is not exactly the entrepreneur in a garage. That is not exactly \nthat small businessperson, a florist, or like my grandmother running \nthat Polish bakery or like my father with his little grocery store.\n  Mr. President, $270 million each--they pay 18 percent. So here it is \nApril 16, they paid 18 percent. That, by the way, is the rule. All we \nare saying is they can pay that 18 percent on their first $1 million, \nbut on that second $1 million they have to get into the game and start \nto pay 30 percent.\n  I think this is a great idea. I want my colleagues, when we vote for \ncloture, to be able to do this. The Buffett rule supports fairness in \nthe Tax Code so executives do not pay a lower rate than the people who \nwork in the mail room or on the FedEx trucks delivering their products. \nIt does support prosperity and entrepreneurship. As I said, it does not \nkick in until their second $1 million, and then it is phased in slowly.\n  A lot of people are saying: We do not want these handouts from the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\nGovernment. It wrecks our entrepreneurship, our get-up-and-go.\n  I do not believe that. I do not believe that at all. If that were \ntrue, then why is it who gets the biggest handouts in our country but \nthose who get tax earmarks. We eliminated them in the Appropriations \nCommittee, but we are yet to eliminate the tax earmarks in the Tax \nCode.\n  Look how hard it was to get rid of the ethanol subsidy. Oh, my God. \nWhen we wanted to get rid of the oil and gas subsidy, one would think \nwe were Darth Vader on the Senate floor.\n  So every time we want to take away a lavish tax break that only helps \na few get more, we are stymied or stifled. Actually if they employed as \nmany people in their businesses as they employ lobbyists in Washington, \nwe would be able to lower the unemployment rate.\n  So the other party was willing to bring us to the brink of default--\nremember when we were dealing with the debt ceiling--rather than tax \nbillionaires. We continue now to have that same fight. This legislation \nwe would pass is a modest downpayment on reforming the Tax Code. We do \nhave to make it fairer, but this is a firm way to be able to do it.\n  Sure, we have to look at the corporate tax code. We have to look at \nhow to bring expatriated money overseas back home. Yes, we have to look \nat rates. Yes, by the way, we have to reward entrepreneurship and \nacknowledge the special challenges of being a small- and medium-size \nbusiness. But that is long range, and under the arcane rules of our \nSenate we are now so stymied in bringing up that legislation.\n  We could at least take one giant step forward to make our Tax Code \nfairer by passing the legislation called the Buffett rule, named after \nWarren Buffett, one of our great American people, a guy who gives \ncapitalism real meaning in our country. He says: Let me pay, and people \nlike me pay, the same rate of taxes as my administrative assistant in \nthe front office.\n  I think Buffett had a good idea. Let's codify it. Let's pass it in \nthe Senate today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let's ask ourselves a question. What is the \npurpose of taxes? Do we tax people to punish them for their success or \ndo we do it to raise revenue for the government? Well, the answer is, \nof course, at least up to now, the purpose of taxes is to raise the \nrevenue the government needs to perform its duties and to do that in \nthe least harmful way possible.\n  President Obama, however, has a different idea about the purpose of \ntaxes. He thinks the government should take more from some people just \nbecause they are rich, even if the tax increases hurt the economy.\n  So this week the Senate will vote on what is called the Pay A Fair \nShare Act or, as described by President Obama, the Buffett tax. This \nlegislation would create a new 30-percent alternative minimum tax for \nfilers who make $1 million or more, which would include many successful \nsmall businesses. Unfortunately, the legislation would hurt small \nbusinesses more than it would raise revenue for the government.\n  Today I want to talk about why this legislation is fundamentally \nmisguided and why it would be harmful to businesses, workers, and the \neconomy. The Buffett tax may make for good politics for President Obama \non the campaign trail, but it is bad policy. It is deeply flawed.\n  First, let's start with its premise. There is a key misconception \nabout Warren Buffett's tax rate. The notion that Mr. Buffett pays a \nlower tax rate than his secretary is based on a fundamental \nmisunderstanding of the Tax Code.\n  Mr. Buffett--and, I would add, many older Americans--obtains most of \nhis income from investments. That income is taxed at the capital gains \nrate. Mr. Buffett and President Obama would have us believe capital \ngains income gets preferential treatment in the Tax Code, but that does \nnot tell the real story.\n  Capital income is actually taxed twice. First, it is taxed at the 35-\npercent rate that corporations pay on their income--it is taxed; the \nmoney is paid to the government--and then it is taxed again when the \ndistribution of capital gains or dividends is made to the investors, \nwhen it is passed on to shareholders as dividends or capital gains. \nThat means the tax rate is already far higher than 30 percent. It is \nactually not exactly 30 plus 15 percent, but it is higher than 30 \npercent, and it is closer to 45 percent.\n  President Obama ignores these facts when he says Mr. Buffett pays a \nlower tax rate than his secretary. We have to count it twice, not just \nthe second time.\n  That leads me to my second point: the fairness of the current Tax \nCode. Does it really favor the wealthy at the expense of others, as \nPresident Obama argues? Perhaps one could cherry-pick some random \nstatistics to show that one person or another pays more or less, but \nthe actual tax numbers show the real progressivity of the American \nInternal Revenue Code. Interestingly enough, among all the \nindustrialized countries in the world ours is the most progressive.\n  In other words, the U.S. income-tax code has the wealthier people \npaying a far higher percentage of income taxes than any other country \nin the industrialized world--yes, even more than Sweden and even more \nthan France and even more than the other countries in Europe.\n  According to Congressional Budget Office data, the average tax rate \npaid by middle-income Americans is 14.2 percent. In contrast, the \naverage tax rate paid by a high-income American is 31.2 percent, more \nthan twice as much. So the average tax the secretary or somebody else \nlike that might pay is 14.2 percent. The average tax paid by high-\nincome Americans is 31.2 percent.\n  Incidentally, President Obama's effective tax rate this year is 20.5 \npercent. Should he be paying more or is that enough? He has a tough \njob.\n  Here are some other interesting tax facts. The top 1 percent of \ntaxpayers pays 38 percent of total income taxes--actually, I think \nthese numbers are dated; it is now closer to 40 percent--and that top 1 \npercent of taxpayers only earns 20 percent of the total income.\n  So here is the question of fairness: We have the top 1 percent--they \nare the top 1 percent because they earn the top 20 percent of all \nincome, the top fifth, but they pay almost twice as much in taxes, 38 \npercent in total income taxes.\n  How about the top 2 percent of taxpayers? Well, they pay 48.68 \npercent--nearly 50 percent, in other words--of income taxes, and they \nearn 27.95 percent of total income. So we have the top 2 percent paying \nalmost half of all income taxes. Is that fair?\n  The top 5 percent pays 58.7 percent; earns 34.7 percent. The top 10 \npercent pays 69.9 percent--let's say 70 percent--so we have the top 10 \npercent of taxpayers paying 70 percent of all the taxes, earning 45 \npercent of the income.\n  Well, those are certainly the wealthy, and they are certainly paying \na big share.\n  How about the less wealthy? Well, the bottom 95 percent--in other \nwords, everybody but the top 5 percent--pays 41.3 percent of income \ntaxes; earns 65 percent of the income. Is this fair? Maybe it is not \nfair that the top 2 percent pays almost half of all the income taxes. \nHow much would be fair? Should they pay 90 percent, 95 percent?\n  How about the 50 percent of households that pay no taxes and yet \nreceive the same or greater benefits than those who do? Is that fair?\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 51 percent of all \nhouseholds, which includes both filers and nonfilers, had either zero \nor negative income tax liability in 2009. People who do not share in \nthe sacrifice of paying taxes have little direct incentive to care \nwhether the government is spending and taxing too much. Maybe that is \nwhy the President has no problem with even more Americans getting a \nfree ride.\n  Here are a few more statistics. The highest 1 percent of income \nearners have not seen the share of the income tax burden decline. In \nfact, their share of income is essentially the same as it was in 2000, \nbut their share of taxes paid is higher. Collectively, only taxpayers \nwith incomes greater than $100,000 a year pay a share of taxes that is \ngreater than their share of income.\n  Actually, I think it is hard to argue that our current Tax Code that \ntaxes the wealthy to such a high degree is\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\nunfair. While the President says it is not fair, I find it interesting \nthat his own Treasury Secretary seems to agree that the current system \nis fair.\n  Let me read a portion of the transcript from a Finance Committee \nhearing with Secretary Geithner earlier this year. I asked him: Do you \nthink it is fair that the top 1 percent of earners in the United States \npays just about 40 percent of the income taxes? Secretary Geithner's \nresponse: I do, because I do not see how the alternatives are more \nfair. Next, I asked him if he thought it was fair that the top 3 \npercent pays as much as the other 97 percent of taxpayers in income \ntax. Secretary Geithner responded, ``Again, I do.'' So if we want an \nincome tax system that is fair according to the Obama administration's \nown standards, we already have it. The argument that top-tier earners \nare not doing enough just does not hold water.\n  The third problem with the Buffett tax is that it would harm many \nsmall businesses. According to the most recent Treasury Department \ndata, 392,000 tax returns reported income of $1 million or more. Of \nthose, 331,000 reported business income and 311,000 met the Treasury's \ndefinition of ``business owner.'' So this is a tax that would \ndisproportionately affect small businesses and other job creators.\n  Four out of five tax filers that would be affected by the Buffett tax \nare the very businesses we are counting on to lead us back to an \neconomic recovery. If enacted, these tax increases would have a \nnegative effect on employers trying to create jobs. And this is not \njust my opinion. Take, for example, the International Franchise \nAssociation, which recently said this: Franchise business owners could \nbe significantly challenged to grow and create new jobs as a result of \nthe Buffett rule, a tax increase on individuals and small business \nowners.\n  It continues:\n\n       Taxing job creators will seriously impede the ability of \n     franchise businesses to expand their operations and to create \n     new jobs, particularly multi-unit franchise operators and the \n     majority of franchise businesses who file their business \n     income on their own personal tax return.\n\n  So these are the very folks the Treasury Department identified as \npaying taxes as individuals but who are, in fact, business owners.\n  Under current law, a massive tax increase on income, capital gains, \nand dividends is already set to occur on January 1 of next year. In \naddition, under ObamaCare, some Americans will be hit with a 3.8-\npercent investment surcharge beginning next year. Imagine what all of \nthese taxes will do to small businesses and startup companies.\n  But that is not enough new taxing for President Obama in his war \nagainst investments and success. According to economist Stephen Entin, \ntax increases on capital are some of the most destructive to the \neconomy. He estimates that tax hikes on capital gains, dividends, and \nthe top two individual tax rates, which are already scheduled to occur \nin 2013, will shrink the economy by 6 percent, will lower wages by 5 \npercent, will decrease capital stock by almost 16 percent, and will \nlose the Federal Government almost $100 billion in tax revenue.\n  Adding an additional Buffett tax on capital will only decrease wages \nand economic growth even further. Why is this? Because high taxes on \nincome, particularly investment income, depress capital formation. \nThere are fewer investments, which damages the abilities of businesses \nto grow, to create jobs, or to pay higher wages.\n  I challenge my colleagues to ask a roomful of economists this \nquestion: Does increasing the cost of capital lead to higher or lower \neconomic growth and job creation? Well, the answer is obvious. As \nPresident Kennedy said when he endorsed a capital gains tax cut, ``The \ntax on capital gains directly affects investment decisions, the \nmobility and the risk flow of capital, as well as the ease or \ndifficulty experienced by new ventures in obtaining capital and thereby \nthe strength and potential for growth in the economy.''\n  It is also important to remember that we are not making tax policy in \na vacuum. We are competing for capital and investments with every other \nnation on Earth. The President has conceded that our high corporate tax \nrate harms our international competitiveness and has expressed tepid \nsupport for lowering it. But those benefits would be erased if capital \ngains taxes are increased dramatically.\n  As the Wall Street Journal points out, ``Lowering the corporate tax \nrate makes the U.S. more competitive, but the tax change is self-\ndefeating if it's combined with an even larger rise in the investment \nincome taxes on capital gains and dividends.''\n  According to a recent Ernst & Young study, the integrated tax rate on \ncapital gains is already over 50 percent--50.8 percent to be exact. \nThat is more than twice the rate in China, for example.\n  If Congress does nothing, capital gains rates will rise again to 56.7 \npercent next year. That is the second highest in the world. If the \nBuffett tax increase is layered on top, taxes will consume almost two-\nthirds of capital gains, and we will have the highest integrated rate \nby far of any of our international competitors. We have to remember \nthat in a mobile world economy, capital is highly mobile. Does anyone \nbelieve that such a confiscatory capital gains rate imposed by the \nBuffett tax would not lead to less investment in the United States and \nmore in other countries? As somebody said, this is not just shooting \nourselves in the foot, it is shooting ourselves in the head.\n  Let me address President Obama's suggestions that the Buffett tax \nsomehow constitutes fundamental tax reform and that President Reagan \nwould have supported it. I think I can imagine President Reagan \nresponding: Well, there you go again.\n  The Washington Post has a Fact Checker op-ed, and here is how they \nset the record straight on President Obama's claim that he was pushing \nthe same concept--his words--as President Reagan:\n\n       Contrary to Obama's suggestion that President Reagan was \n     specifically arguing for a new tax provision aimed at the \n     superwealthy, Reagan was barnstorming the country in an \n     effort to reduce taxes for all Americans, mainly by cutting \n     rates, simplifying the tax system, and eliminating tax \n     shelters that allowed some people to avoid paying any \n     taxes at all. In other words, Reagan was pushing for a tax \n     cut for everyone, not just an increase on a few.\n       Obama and Reagan did use similar anecdotes--and even the \n     phrase ``fair share''--but in service of different goals.\n\n  President Reagan's tax reform should never be confused with a harmful \npolitical gimmick such as the Buffett tax.\n  I would like to show how higher capital gains taxes have a negative \neffect on revenue.\n  Ever since the bipartisan capital gains cut in 1978, a pattern has \nrepeated itself over and over: Raising the capital gains rate reduces \nrevenues. Lowering it has led to revenue increases. That is partially \nbecause capital gains taxes are an elective tax. The tax is only paid \nwhen investors sell their assets. And frequently they wait to sell \ntheir assets for the rates to go down when it will cost them less to \nsell those assets.\n  The Wall Street Journal recently produced a chart to this effect, and \nI am just going to summarize it.\n  In 1978 President Carter signed an amendment into law that cut the \ncapital gains rate from 40 to 28 percent. What was the result? Less \nrevenue? No. Revenue from capital gains increased by nearly $3 billion, \nand yet the rate was reduced.\n  Congress cut the capital gains rate again to 20 percent in 1981 as \npart of the Reagan tax cuts. As the Journal notes, revenue did not fall \nin 1982. By 1983 capital gains revenues soared to $18.7 billion: Lower \nrate, higher revenue.\n  In 1986 the capital gains tax rate was returned to 28 percent as part \nof the tax reform package. Guess what. Revenues soared as investors \ncashed in their gains before the tax increases hit and then plunged in \n1987.\n  The point is investors get to play. They get to decide. When the rate \ngoes down, they can sell their property with less cost. When the rate \ngoes up, they hang on to their property. They do not sell it because \nthey will have to pay more when they do.\n  In 1997 President Clinton and congressional Republicans cut the rate \nback to 20 percent, and revenues from capital gains doubled by the year \n2000 to $127.63 billion.\n  The Journal notes:\n\n       Congress shouldn't be fooled by government forecasters who \n     predict a revenue boost\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\n     from a higher capital gains rate. They've blown this call \n     every time.\n\n  My last point addresses what the Buffett tax would do for the Federal \ndebt. The answer is next to nothing.\n  Let's examine the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation's estimate \nof the revenue that would be raised from the Buffett tax. Bear in mind \nthat these estimates do not include the effect on economic growth, \nwhich could dramatically reduce rather than raise Federal revenues, as \nhistory has shown. But let's take the score at face value. Even without \ncounting the negative impact on the economy, the Buffett tax would \nraise a mere pittance in the scope of Federal budgets.\n  When President Obama first proposed the tax, he declared that ``it \ncould raise enough money to stabilize our debt and deficits for the \nnext decade.'' He said, ``This is not politics, it's math.'' Well, \nlet's look at the math. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimate shows \nthat the Buffett tax would raise only about $1 billion this year. So \ninstead of a deficit this year of $1.079 trillion, we would have a \ndeficit of $1.078 trillion. That does not exactly raise enough money to \nstabilize our debt and deficits for the next decade, as the President \nsaid.\n  Over the first 5 years, the Joint Tax Committee shows that the \nBuffett tax would collect about $14.7 billion. To put it in \nperspective, that will amount to less than. 08 percent of the projected \nnational debt in 5 years. And in the year 2014 the proposal is \nestimated to actually lose over $6 billion in revenue. Why is this? \nAgain, because capital gains taxes are largely voluntary. The investors \ntargeted by the Buffett tax are generally able to decide when to sell \nan asset. They can manipulate their sale to stay below the triggering \nthreshold of $1 million in the bill. This produces a lock, in effect, \non capital as investments stay stagnant. So what is the end result? \nLittle if any revenue is actually raised. Business investments decline. \nIn turn, wages and hiring decline.\n  Again, if the purpose of taxes is to raise needed revenue rather than \npunish people, this bill completely flunks the test. So while this \nproposed tax increase might make some people feel good, it will not \nsolve any of our budget problems. It will likely destroy jobs and \ngrowth, and, as history has shown, depressed economic growth from a tax \nincrease will make our budget problems even worse than they are now.\n  In conclusion, the economy, as we know, is limping along at an anemic \ngrowth rate. Gas is $4 a gallon or more, and 20 million Americans are \nunemployed or underemployed. The economic downturn has taken a huge \ntoll on American families. They want Washington to focus on legislation \nthat will have an impact on jobs and gas prices. Instead, we are \ndebating a show bill that has no chance of passing and would not create \na single American job. What happened to jobs, jobs, jobs? Remember that \nfour-letter word, ``jobs''?\n  The President claims to be focused like a laser on the economy. \nInstead, it appears that there is only one job that he is focused on \nwith this political proposal. I submit that here in the Senate we \nshould be focused on jobs and energy legislation that can pass, not tax \nhikes through show votes that are designed to fail.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nthat the administration and my friends on the other side of the aisle \ncontinue to avoid making the hard decisions to address our Nation's \nsignificant debt and annual deficits. Instead, they are turning the \nNation's attention to a talking point, a shell, a sham, a political \nhoax designed to distract this country from our real financial problems \nand the real solutions we will need to get us out of this mess.\n  The Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012, dubbed the Buffett rule, that \nthey describe as restoring tax fairness does nothing to address the \nfiscal disaster we are facing. The Buffett rule is, by President \nObama's own admission, a gimmick. My friends, our country can no longer \nafford photo-op governance.\n  The national debt has risen to over $15 trillion, or nearly $48,000 \nper person in the United States, and this figure keeps rising under an \nadministration that consistently fights spending cuts of any kind. We \nmust make spending cuts if we are going to solve our fiscal problems.\n  Remember the President's debt commission, the Simpson-Bowles debt \ncommission the President appointed then summarily ignored? Not everyone \nhas ignored it. I continue to work with my colleagues on legislation to \nget the country back on track financially. I have introduced a bill \ncalled the one cent solution. It is also known as the penny plan or the \n1-percent solution. My one cent solution bill would cut spending by 1 \npercent for 7 years and achieve a balanced budget in the eighth year. \nEvery family can imagine taking one penny out of every dollar they \nspend. The Federal Government should be able to do the same.\n  In February, President Obama submitted his fiscal year 2013 budget \nproposal to Congress. I hope it was the last budget proposal he will \nhave the opportunity to submit. Like his budget last year in the \nSenate, the President's Budget in the House this year failed to get a \nsingle vote. Even Democrats shunned it. It failed 414 to 0. The Buffett \nrule is pulled from the same bag of tricks.\n  Despite his promises of fiscal discipline and cutting the deficit in \nhalf by the end of his first term, President Obama presented the \nAmerican people with another budget that spends too much, borrows too \nmuch, and taxes too much.\n  It is time for a change. Congress should take the lead by passing a \nbudget that includes strong deficit reduction provisions and sets the \ncountry on a path out of our $15 trillion debt. When you are in a hole, \nyou stop digging. When you are broke, you stop spending.\n  Rather than crafting a bipartisan measure to deal with these issues, \nthe administration instead has turned its attention to the Buffett \nrule. This bill is symptomatic of a much larger problem plaguing this \nadministration--the unwillingness to address the country's long-term \nfiscal imbalance and the diversion of the Nation's attention to a \nprovision marketed as enhancing ``tax fairness'' that ultimately could \nimpact very few taxpayers and does little to address the Nation's debt \nand deficits. The Buffett rule is estimated by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation to raise approximately $47 billion over 10 years under current \nlaw. Even if current tax rates are extended past their current \nexpiration date of December 31, 2012, the bill is estimated to raise \napproximately $160 billion over 10 years. The Nation's debt level is \nnow over $15 trillion, and yearly deficits are running over $1 trillion \nunder this administration. This bill is not a significant debt and \ndeficit reduction measure; instead, it is simply an attempt to raise \ntaxes on owners of capital and job creators when they can least afford \nit. And, no, it is not a step in the right direction because it \ndistracts us from real solutions. It is a political stunt.\n  The administration is ignoring the fact that four out of five people \nwith incomes over $1 million and who would be hit by higher taxes as a \nresult of the Buffett rule or any other millionaire tax are business \nowners, and these are the people the country needs to create new jobs. \nA millionaire tax increase like the Buffett rule means that over one-\nthird of all business income reported on individual income tax returns \nwould be taxed more. Particularly for those small businesses with \nnarrow profit margins, these additional taxes would take even more \nmoney out of their businesses and make it more difficult to invest, \nexpand, and hire.\n  Warren Buffett, for whom this bill is named, generated most of his \n$40 million in taxable income in 2010 from dividends and capital gains, \nwhich under current law is taxed at 15 percent. Taking into account his \nwages of approximately $100,000 that are taxed at up to 35 percent, Mr. \nBuffett's effective tax rate was approximately 17.4 percent. What if \nMr. Buffett and other millionaires who are corporate shareholders were \ninstead taxed like most small business owners who operate flow-through \nbusiness such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S \ncorporations, and are taxed immediately on their business profits at \nordinary income tax rates of up to 35 percent? Mr. Buffett's tax rate \nwould have been about 35 percent, double what he is reportedly paying \nnow. Given that his share of the corporate profits in any year could be \nmuch greater than the dividends he currently receives, Mr.\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\nBuffett himself could be paying significantly more in taxes to the \nFederal Government. I wonder if this would cause Mr. Buffett to \nreconsider his position on tax fairness. My friends, I am concerned \nthat under the guise of tax fairness this administration will continue \nto raise taxes in order to support its out-of-control spending binge.\n  This administration either fails or chooses not to recognize that the \ncurrent-law alternative minimum tax, or AMT, was put in place nearly 30 \nyears ago to do exactly what the Buffett rule is intended to do--ensure \nthat high-income taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of U.S. tax, \nregardless of various tax deductions and tax credits that they might be \nable to claim on their tax return. In that regard, this bill simply \nlayers on yet another complex tax provision on top of the already \ncomplex U.S. tax system rather than addressing the underlying problems \nof the overall Tax Code. The country needs and deserves comprehensive \ntax reform that makes the system simpler and fairer for all taxpayers. \nAt the very least, the administration should start by focusing on \nfixing the current Tax Code before adding yet another layer of \ncomplexity to it.\n  Those who named this bill want you to think it is an appropriate \nmethod by which to ensure everyone pays their fair share. We need \nfairness; however, the manner in which that goal is achieved is just as \nimportant as the goal itself. In that regard, the Buffett rule misses \nthe mark for each of the reasons I have just mentioned.\n  This bill is yet another missed opportunity for this administration \nto address the most pressing issues of the day, including significant \ntax issues that confront us at the end of 2012. The most notable tax \nissues include the prevention of a massive tax hike on all taxpayers on \nJanuary 1, 2013, as a result of the expiration of current income tax \nrates, the extension of tax provisions that expired at the end of 2011 \nand that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2012, providing a patch \nfor the AMT for 2012 so that it does not ensnare millions of middle-\nincome taxpayers, and reforming the estate tax to prevent a significant \nrate hike on January 1, 2013.\n  Taking all of this into account, is the President flying around the \ncountry trumpeting the Buffett rule as the solution to what he \nperceives is a tax fairness problem really the best use of his and the \ncountry's time? We have more to think about than his reelection. There \nis a better path forward to achieve the desired result of the Buffett \nrule. That path includes comprehensive tax reform that results in a tax \ncode that is simple, fair, and progrowth. If we combine that with \nappropriate spending cuts, our country will be able to get out from \nunder the heavy weight of our current and escalating debt burden.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I will vote in favor of proceeding \nto the President's latest tax plan because it is essential we begin the \ndebate on comprehensive tax reform. I do this despite my disappointment \nthat the President has not proposed a serious starting point. Our \nNation's tax code needs to be overhauled, from top to bottom. The tax \nplan offered by the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson Commission--a commission \nthe President himself created--offered a proposal a year and a half ago \nthat should have been the foundation for a serious debate for such an \noverhaul. But the President failed to show leadership, and allowed that \nproposal to wallow. Instead, he has asked us to consider a bill today \nthat he himself has called ``a gimmick.''\n  I believe we should be debating comprehensive tax reform aimed at \ncreating a simpler, fairer, pro-growth tax code. Such reform should \nlower rates for job creators and middle-income Americans, while \nincreasing the share of taxes paid by the wealthy.\n  A key to reform is simplification: just last year, according to the \nIRS, there were 579 changes to a tax code that is already more than \n65,000 pages long. No one can keep up such complexity--it hobbles our \neconomy, and exasperates the American taxpayer.\n  I have said that multimillionaires and billionaires can pay more to \nhelp us deal with our deficit, and I have voted for surtaxes on the \nvery wealthy in the past. In fact, I have even introduced legislation \ncalling for such surtaxes. However, I have maintained that any such \nlegislation must include a ``carve out'' to protect small business \nowners who pay taxes through the individual income tax system. Our \nnation's small businesses must not be lumped-in with millionaires and \nbillionaires and exposed to the same type of taxes designed for the \nvery wealthy. That is why a ``carve-out'' to shield small businesses \nowners from tax increases is so important. These small business owner-\noperators are on the front lines of our economy, and of the communities \nin which they live. The income that shows up on their tax returns is \ncritical to their ability to finance investment, and grow their \nbusinesses. Left in their hands, this income will lead to more jobs, \nand will buy the tools that help American workers compete.\n  Comprehensive tax reform and simplification is not only a matter of \nfairness, but is essential to laying the foundation for our nation's \nlong-term economic growth. There is no contradiction between fairness \nand growth--both can be advanced together. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in seeking true reform that advances both of these goals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Paying a \nFair Share Act. I commend Senator Whitehouse for introducing this \nimportant legislation.\n  It is absurd that at a time when our country has a $15 trillion \nnational debt and enormous unmet needs, the wealthiest people in this \ncountry have an effective tax rate that is lower than many middle-class \nworkers. It makes no sense that the richest 400 people in our country \nwho earned an average of more than $270 million each in 2008 pay an \neffective tax rate of just 18 percent, which is less than many small \nbusinessmen, nurses, teachers, police officers, et cetera. That is \nwrong from a moral perspective. It is also very bad economic policy.\n  The issue we are debating speaks to a much larger crisis that is \ntaking place in America; that is, that in many important ways the \nUnited States is departing from its democratic tradition, which has \nalways included a strong and growing middle class, and is moving \nrapidly into an oligarchic form of government in which almost all \nwealth and power resides in the hands of the very richest people in our \nsociety--the top 1 percent. That is not what America is supposed to be \nabout.\n  Let me mention a recent study that shows not only why we should pass \nthis Buffett rule but why we should go, in fact, much further. An \neconomist at the University of California, Professor Emmanuel Saez, \nstudying tax returns, found that in 2010, 93 percent of all new income \ngenerated during that year went to the top 1 percent. Let me repeat \nthat. Between 2009 and 2010--the last year we have statistics on this \nissue--93 percent of all new income went to the top 1 percent, while \nthe rest of the people--the bottom 99 percent--were able to receive 7 \npercent. Even more incredible is the fact that 37 percent of that new \nincome went to the top one-hundredth of 1 percent. In other words, of \nthe $309 billion in new income gained in 2010, $288 billion went to the \ntop 1 percent. Only $21 billion in new income went to the bottom 99 \npercent.\n  Today the top 1 percent earns over 20 percent of all income in this \ncountry, which is more than the bottom 50 percent. In terms of the \ndistribution of wealth, accumulated income, as hard as it may be for us \nto believe, as a country that believes in mobility, a country that \nbelieves in equality, today we have a situation where the 400 \nwealthiest people in America now own more wealth than the bottom half \nof America--150 million people. Four hundred people here own more \nwealth than the bottom 150 million Americans, and that gap between the \nvery rich and everybody else is now wider than it has been in this \ncountry since the late 1920s. We have, by far, the most unequal \ndistribution of income and wealth of any major country on Earth.\n  That is where we are as a nation, and it is not a good place to be. \nThe richest people and the largest corporations are doing phenomenally \nwell, while the middle class is collapsing and poverty increases. This \nis not what democracy looks like; this is what oligarchy and plutocracy \nlook like.\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\n  To compound this extremely unfair situation, when millionaires and \nbillionaires are paying nearly the lowest effective tax rate for the \nrich in decades, our deficit problems only grow worse. In other words, \nnot only are the real and effective tax rates for the rich lower than \nfor many middle-class workers, their low effective tax rates are having \na very negative impact on our deficit. In fact, as a result of the tax \nbreaks given to the wealthy and large corporations, revenue as a \npercentage of GDP is at 14.8 percent, the lowest in more than 50 years.\n  Let us pass the Buffett rule today, but let us do much more in the \nfuture. Instead of cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \neducation, and other programs of vital importance to middle-class and \nworking families in this country, as many of my Republican colleagues \nwould like to do, let us develop both personal and corporate tax \npolicies that are fair and will protect the best interests of our \ncountry.\n  Nobody should be talking about maintaining huge tax breaks for \nmillionaires and billionaires and in the same breath talk about cutting \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid--the needs of our children and the \nneeds of the most vulnerable people in our country. That is wrong and \nthat is not what America is about.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I come from humble beginnings. We did not \nhave a lot growing up but we always had what we needed. My mother and \nfather worked very hard to provide for our family and you can be sure \nthey paid their fair share of taxes on their living wage. In the nearly \n50 years that I have served in the Senate, I have watched the very rich \nand their supporters in the Congress whittle away at the Tax Code to \nthe extent that today the average tax rate paid by the highest earning \nAmericans has fallen to the point that one in four taxpayers with an \nannual income greater than $1 million pays less than millions of \nworking middle-class families. How is that fair? We are making critical \ndecisions about how we cut and spend government funds and it will go a \nlong way to reestablishing fiscal fairness in this country if the very \nwealthy pay their fair share to support government services and \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one of the unfortunate characteristics of \nthe American economy for the last few decades has been the rising gap \nbetween upper and middle-income Americans. Increasingly, those in the \nupper echelons of income and wealth have seen their fortunes rise, \nwhile the vast majority of Americans have coped with stagnant income \nand increasing insecurity. In recent decades, most families have had to \ncope with a reduced ability to afford the things middle-class Americans \nonce took for granted a comfortable home, college educations for the \nkids, and a secure retirement. At the same time, incomes have risen \nremarkably for those at the very top of the income scale. Today, by \nsome measures, income inequality is greater in our country than at any \ntime since just before the Great Depression.\n  This should worry us all. It should worry us because a way of life \nhas become endangered. That way of life--one in which, if you work \nhard, play by the rules and plan for the future, you and your family \nwill prosper came to be known as the ``American way.'' But \nincreasingly, the American way has been replaced by one in which the \nvery wealthy do well while everyone else struggles. Instead of all \nboats rising together, it is the yachts that have risen--good economy \nor bad--while all the other boats have been stuck in place and taking \non water.\n  Today we have a chance to begin the work of closing that income gap \nbetween the wealthiest Americans and the middle class. We can, by \nadopting this motion to proceed, begin the debate on how best to \naddress the worrisome and growing gap. But that debate cannot begin \nunless our colleagues on the Republican side agree to allow it to \nbegin. I, for one, am eager to have this debate--I believe the American \npeople want and deserve this debate. Our Republican colleagues have \nvery different ideas about this problem, and may even deny there is a \nproblem. But the people we represent believe this is a problem, and we \nshould respond to their concerns.\n  There are some who question whether income inequality is rising. \nThese denials melt away in the face of enormous evidence to the \ncontrary. To deny rising income inequality is to deny plain facts. Here \nare a few of those facts.\n  As of 2008, the richest 1 percent of Americans took home almost 24 \npercent of total income. This is up from 10 percent in 1980. Half of \nall income in the United States went to the top 10 percent of \nAmericans. And, the vast majority of Americans, the bottom 80 percent, \nreceived less than a quarter of total income in the United States.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued a report last year \non changes in income distribution since 1979. CBO's researchers found \nthat over that period, after-tax income ``for households at the higher \nend of the income scale rose much more rapidly than income for \nhouseholds in the middle and at the lower end of the income scale.'' \nCBO found that for the wealthiest one percent of Americans, real after-\ntax income grew by 275 percent. Those in the next 19 percent--that is, \nthe top 20 percent minus the one percent at the very top--saw after-tax \nincome growth of 65 percent. And for the 60 percent of Americans in the \nmiddle of the income scale, between the top and bottom 20 percent, \nafter-tax income grew by just 40 percent. So, income for the top 1 \npercent of Americans grew at a rate nearly seven times greater than \ngrowth in middle-class incomes.\n  There are two striking things about CBO's findings. The first is that \nthe biggest driver of growing inequality is the growing gap between \nthose at the very top of the scale and everyone else. Even those in the \ntop 20 percent of incomes--those doing very well by anyone's \nstandards--have fallen behind the top 1 percent.\n  The second striking finding is what CBO found about the effects of \nfederal tax and transfer policy. In fact, CBO reported that while the \nrise in inequality stems from a number of factors, one significant \ncontributor is federal policies--including the decisions we all make \nhere in this Congress. For instance, CBO said that the rise in after-\ntax income for the top 1 percent may come in part from tax changes we \nmade in 1986. Those changes lowered the top personal income tax rate \nbelow the top corporate tax rate, encouraging many wealthy Americans to \nreclassify corporate income as personal income to qualify for the lower \nrate.\n  More worrisome is the fact that CBO found that federal tax policy has \nactually made inequality worse. Inequality of after-tax income is \nhigher than inequality of pre-tax income. In part, that is because our \ntax system has shifted away from income taxes--which are progressive, \nasking the wealthier to pay a higher rate--to payroll taxes, a burden \nthat falls on all income-earners regardless of how wealthy. These are \nthe kinds of changes that have led to billionaire investors and hedge-\nfund managers paying a lower tax rate than their secretaries.\n  One way that government could fight this rising gap is with transfer \npayments--benefits paid by government to the less wealthy to try to \ncounteract difference in income. Some, including some of our Republican \ncolleagues, have made the case that transfer payments are growing \nlarger, or that government policy is making people increasingly \ndependent on government handouts. The CBO report answers this argument. \nCBO found: ``The amount of government transfer payments--including \nfederal, state, and local transfers--relative to household market \nincome was relatively constant from 1979 through 2007, ranging between \n10 percent and 12 percent with no discernible trend.'' So, while there \nhas been a rising gap in pre-tax income since 1979, and government tax \npolicy has widened that gap, federal transfer payments have done \nnothing to balance it.\n  These facts are telling. But we should not forget that behind all \nthese numbers, all these facts and figures, are real people--and most \nof those people are struggling to get by. They should be uppermost in \nour minds.\n  The rise in inequality is not the result of a single factor, and it \ndid not happen overnight. So we will not reverse it overnight. It will \ntake sustained effort. That effort starts with acknowledging that there \nis a problem, and I hope our Republican colleagues will avoid the \ndenialism that is all too\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\nprevalent on this issue. But if we can first acknowledge the problem, \nwe then can do something about it, beginning with this vote today.\n  The proposal before us simply says that those at the very top of the \nincome ladder, those making more than $1 million a year, will, at a \nminimum, pay a federal income tax rate of 30 percent on their income \nabove $1 million. Most Americans consider that simple common sense. The \nfact that wealthy corporate executives pay a lower tax rate than \nconstruction workers or waitresses or teachers or police officers is \nfundamentally unfair. And at a time when budgets are extraordinarily \ntight, and getting tighter, it makes no sense for government to \nsubsidize, through tax policy, the growing income gap between the top \nfew and ordinary Americans.\n  This bill will not solve all our problems. Even if it passes, there \nwill be much more work to do--especially because this problem is, \nthrough tax policy in particular, a problem Congress has helped to \ncreate. But that work must start somewhere. The debate must begin--and \nit will begin, if we vote to let it begin. I hope we will begin that \ndebate today.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the Paying a Fair Share Act \nbecause it will help bring fairness to our Tax Code. In large part \nbecause of the irresponsible policies of President George W. Bush, the \nvery wealthiest taxpayers have seen their tax rates drop by half over \nthe last 50 years, even as their incomes have skyrocketed. The Tax Code \nhas become so out-of-balance that one in four millionaires pays a lower \ntax rate than do millions of middle-class families, and in 2011 an \nestimated 7,000 millionaires paid no Federal income tax at all.\n  Responsible millionaires understand that a fair tax system is in our \ncountry's best interest. One Californian, Andy Rappaport, told my staff \nthat over the past 8 years, his average Federal tax rate has been only \n16 percent after charitable contributions. Meanwhile, working families \nmaking $60,000 to $100,000 per year pay average Federal tax rates of 17 \nor 18 percent.\n  Mr. Rappaport said: ``Those of us who are doing unprecedentedly well \nhave built our success on a foundation of widespread well being and \nopportunity, not to mention adequate investments in education, \nresearch, and infrastructure. . . . It's not fair to ask those who make \nless than us to do without or to shoulder more than their share of our \nnational investment burden.'' California entrepreneur Garrett Gruener \nwrote in the Los Angeles Times: ``For nearly the last decade, I've paid \nincome taxes at the lowest rates of my professional career. . . . For \nthe good of the country, we need to tax people like me more.''\n  In addition to opposing this common-sense proposal, our Republican \ncolleagues want to cut valuable social programs to pay for another tax \ncut for the rich. The House-passed Ryan Budget would give high-income \ntaxpayers an additional tax cut of at least $150,000 per year--a tax \ncut equal to three times the median household income, and more than ten \ntimes the average annual Social Security benefit--while cutting \nprograms like food stamps and Pell Grants which provide security and \nopportunity to millions of lower-income Americans. Our Republican \ncolleagues seem devoted to the interests of the wealthiest 1 percent \nabove all else.\n  The Paying a Fair Share Act would only affect the top one-tenth of 1 \npercent of taxpayers, those with adjusted gross income over $1 million \nper year. It preserves the incentive for charitable giving, which is so \nimportant for our religious organizations, nonprofits, and \nuniversities.\n  And these millionaires and billionaires are not the ``job creators'' \nthe Republicans say they are, because the vast majority of job creators \nare small business owners who earn far less than $1 million per year. \nIn 2009, only 1.3 percent of taxpayers with business income made more \nthan $1 million per year. The bill is supported by small business \ngroups including the Main Street Alliance, American Sustainable \nBusiness Council, and the California Association for Micro Enterprise \nOpportunity. It also has the support of AFCSME, AFL CIO, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters, United Auto Workers, the \nNational Education Association, and many others. I urge my colleagues \nto support this important legislation, which will bring much-needed \nfairness to our Tax Code.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my fellow Senator from \nRhode Island's effort to restore a basic level of fairness to our Tax \nCode. Senator Whitehouse has done an extraordinary job in fighting to \nreturn some sense of balance to a broken system.\n  Most Americans agree Senator Whitehouse's legislation is \nfundamentally fair and they want to see it become law because as we all \nknow, the Tax Code is riddled with loopholes that benefit the \nwealthiest Americans. It is past time we take this first step towards \nfixing a system that allows millionaires and billionaires to pay a \nlower tax rate than middle-class Americans. This is a defining vote--it \nis about who you stand for and with, working men and women or \nmultimillionaires and billionaires. This legislation signals to middle-\nclass Americans that the government should be focused on helping them, \nby ensuring that everyone pays their fair share to support essential \ngovernment programs that invest in education, infrastructure and our \nnation's future.\n  The Tax Code stacks the deck for the wealthy at the expense of the \nmiddle-class. The middle-class has already been squeezed enough by \nstagnant wages and a complex tax system that does not work for them. \nThe revenue raised through this measure is deficit reduction that is \nnot taken out on the backs of seniors or working American families. \nThis legislation will only impact 0.2 percent of Rhode Islanders that \nearn more than $1 million in income per year.\n  Senator Whitehouse's Paying a Fair Share Act would prevent \nmillionaires and billionaires from using tax loopholes that allow them \nto pay a lower effective tax rate than a school teacher in Rhode \nIsland.\n  Of millionaires in 2009, a full 22,000 households making more than $1 \nmillion annually paid less than a 15 percent income tax rate. Our Tax \nCode, riddled with loopholes and special giveaways, leads to lopsided \nand inequitable results. It is past time we correct these glaring \nloopholes and restore some fairness to our Tax Code.\n  The 400 highest-income households in 2008, who made on average $271 \nmillion--paid just an 18.1 percent rate. This is nearly half the 29.9 \npercent rate those households paid on average in 1995 under President \nClinton.\n  According to the Center on Budget Policy Priorities analysis, the top \n1 percent have seen their after tax income grow by 277% since 1979. The \nmiddle 60 percent of Americans have only seen a 38 percent increase and \nthe bottom 20 percent have only seen an 18 percent increase. This is a \nresult of a broken Tax Code that over the past several decades has been \ntilted to benefit the wealthiest Americans and not the middle-class.\n  The tax benefits for the wealthiest Americans have contributed to \nstaggering deficits. These deficits have increased pressure on our \nbudget and motivated Republicans to slash services that benefit middle-\nclass Americans in the name of deficit reduction.\n  This is exactly why I opposed the reckless Bush tax cuts that skewed \nso heavily towards the wealthy, the segment of our society that needed \nthe least help. In fact, it is estimated that the House Republican \nbudget would give millionaires an additional $265,000 in tax cuts each \nyear; unsurprisingly, Republicans want to double down on the misguided \nBush tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the wealthy.\n  We need comprehensive tax reform, but not reform that skews the Tax \nCode even more towards the wealthy while asking for more sacrifice from \nthe middle-class. The Paying a Fair Share Act is a first step in \nreversing this trend and reforming the Tax Code by restoring fairness.\n  Making sure that millionaires and billionaires don't pay a lower tax \nrate than middle-class Americans will help make our Tax Code fairer \nwhile addressing our budget deficit. This is common sense and I hope \nRepublicans will join us in taking the first step towards restoring \nfairness to our tax laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 3 minutes. \nThe Republicans have 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It is my understanding there are no further speakers\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\non the Republican side. If somebody comes, I will, of course, yield the \n4 minutes.\n  The latest report is that there are no further speakers until we move \non to the judicial nomination.\n  I wished to use the time remaining to respond to two of the points \nthat have been made. Before I do that, let me just say that as I have \nkept track during the debate, the minority party has discussed debt, \nbureaucracy, Presidential appointments, punishment of success, \nObamaCare, jobs, fuel prices, picking winners and losers, campaign \ncontributions, out-of-control spending, equal opportunity, and massive \nnew tax increases.\n  The subject at hand is actually much smaller than this; that is, the \nindisputable fact that at the very high end of the American income \nspectrum, people are paying lower tax rates than regular American \nfamilies--whether it is Warren Buffett's self-proclaimed example of \npaying only 11 percent in total taxes or the average of all the 400 \nhighest income earners in the country being only 18.2 percent. These \nare people earning--in the case of the 400--over one-quarter of a \nbillion dollars each in 1 year and paying the rate equivalent to what a \nsingle Rhode Island truckdriver pays. That is the issue.\n  We should have a progressive Tax Code. One of the speakers said we do \nhave a progressive Tax Code and that the income tax generates 31.2 \npercent of the total income tax revenue from high-income folks versus \n14.2 percent from the middle as their rate. But it is worth focusing on \nthe fact that when my Republican colleagues talk about taxes and they \nfocus on income taxes, they leave out the payroll taxes, which \nvirtually every American pays or a great number of Americans--more pay \npayroll taxes than income tax, I believe.\n  If we look at all those taxes and put them together, we find that the \ntop 1 percent of Americans do indeed pay 28.3 percent of the taxes. One \npercent pays 28.3 percent of the taxes. That sounds pretty progressive, \nuntil we realize the top 1 percent in America controls more than one-\nthird of the Nation's wealth; the top 1 percent holds more than one-\nthird of the Nation's wealth but pays only 28 percent of the taxes. \nThat is not progressive, if we are measuring in what we are usually \ntaxing, which is income and wealth, not just the existence of a human \nbeing on the planet.\n  If we go to 5 percent, then the top 5 percent pays 44.7 percent of \nall our taxes, which again is a lot. It is progressive but not when we \nconsider that 5 percent owns or controls more than 60 percent of the \nNation's wealth. We are a country in which more than half the wealth of \nthe country--more than 60 percent of it is concentrated in the hands of \none-twentieth of the population, the top 5 percent. So for them to pay \na higher rate makes a lot of logical sense. What we find is that they \nactually pay a lower rate all too often.\n  The other point I wish to address is the argument that this will take \nmoney from the pockets of small businesses. If we look at the Office of \nTaxation and Treasury's definition of a small business and look at how \nmany would be affected by this bill, it would be 3.3 percent; nearly 97 \npercent of small businesses would have zero effect from this bill. Of \nthe 3.3 percent that would be affected, it is hard to know how many of \nthose are high-income individuals who incorporated themselves for tax \npurposes but don't fit the ordinary definition of a small business.\n  When we look at the fact that Americans across the country have spent \nthe last week sitting down going through their receipts, filing their \ntax returns, sitting at the kitchen table trying to make sense of it \nall and get it filed on time, for a great number of those folks, what \nthey know from Warren Buffett and others is that the people making one-\nquarter of a billion dollars a year are paying lower rates than they \nare, and it is not right. It is not just me saying that is not right; \nit is Ronald Reagan saying that is not right. He said it was \n``crazy''--his word--that a millionaire should pay a lower tax rate \nthan a busdriver pays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has exhausted \nhis time. The Senator from Tennessee is here to speak.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 1 minute.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, this last March, 64 Senators--32 on each \nside--wrote a letter to the President asking for real tax reform and \nreal entitlement reform.\n  I think most of us know today's exercise is a political exercise. It \nis not intended to deal with deficits. It is intended to divide.\n  Last week, I heard the President speaking at a college in Florida \nabout the Buffett tax. In that speech, he was talking about spending \nall that money on things they were interested in. In other words, this \nmoney is not being used, per the President's speech, in any way to \nreduce deficits.\n  I encourage all those on both sides of the aisle--32 Senators on each \nside--who have spoken earnestly and sincerely about progrowth tax \nreform and entitlement reform to not follow this folly of division but \nto hold together, as we need to do something that is great for our \ncountry.\n  It is my hope that by later this year--possibly in a lameduck, \nalthough I hope something happens sooner than that--all of us who truly \ncare about solving problems, not about scoring political points, which \nthis bill is about, will come together and do something great for our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2305-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2305-S2313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF STEPHANIE DAWN THACKER TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                         FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Stephanie Dawn Thacker, \nof West Virginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fourth \nCircuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me make sure I understand. The time is \nnow divided for an hour until the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, and I welcome \nhim back after the break and all Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  The Senate is going to consider the nomination of Stephanie Dawn \nThacker, of West Virginia, to fill a judicial vacancy of the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, and I know the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, Senator Manchin, will be coming to speak in a few \nmoments.\n  I would note this is a judicial vacancy on which the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee voted unanimously more than 5 months ago, as the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer will recall, in favor of this \nnomination. After thorough debate and background, we voted for her \nunanimously. That was 5 months ago. She should not have had to wait \nthis long.\n  She should have been confirmed last year. With nearly 1 in 10 \njudgeships across the Nation vacant and the judicial vacancy rate \nremaining nearly twice what it was at this point in the first term of \nPresident George W. Bush, the Senate needs to do more to reduce \njudicial vacancies so that all Americans can have the quality of \njustice that they deserve.\n  The Federal Judiciary has been forced to operate with the heavy \nburden of 80 or more judicial vacancies for more than 3 years now. \nThere is nothing to justify this extended period with years of \nvacancies numbering more than 80 around the country. Congress has not \ncreated scores of new judgeships, as we did in a bipartisan fashion \nduring the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan and George \nHerbert Walker Bush. Indeed, when the Senate was confirming 205 circuit \nand district court nominees during the first term of President George \nW. Bush, we lowered vacancy rates more than twice as quickly.\n  I will include for the Record at the conclusion of my remarks a copy \nof the Internet article entitled, ``1000 days,''\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\nby Doug Kendall and Ryan Woo of the Constitutional Accountability \nCenter, on this point.\n  I also remind the Senate of the study by the Congressional Research \nService on the historically high vacancies for record amounts of time \nabout which I spoke earlier this year. This level of vacancies has been \nperpetuated for the entire Presidency of President Obama because Senate \nRepublicans have adopted ``new standards'' and refused to enter into \nprompt agreements to schedule votes on qualified, consensus nominees.\n  Today's vote is pursuant to the agreement reached by the majority \nleader and the Republican leader last month. This is the first Court of \nAppeals nominee to receive a vote pursuant to that agreement. This is \nonly the second Court of Appeals nominee to receive a Senate vote all \nyear. Both were qualified, consensus nominees who should have been \nconfirmed last year and would have been but for Republican filibusters.\n  It should not have taken 4 months and 2 days after being reported by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Judge Adalberto \nJordan to be considered by the Senate. Judge Jordan of Florida was \nfinally allowed to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Eleventh \nCircuit. Finally, after a 4-month Republican filibuster that was broken \nby an 89 to 5 vote, and after Republicans insisted on 2 additional days \nof delay, the Senate voted to confirm him 94 to 5. A superbly-qualified \nnominee, he is the first Cuban-American to serve on the Eleventh \nCircuit. His record of achievement is beyond reproach. Judge Jordan is \nby any measure the kind of consensus nominee who should have been \nconfirmed without such delay. Despite the strong support of his home \nstate Senators, Senator Nelson, a Democrat, and Senator Rubio, a \nRepublican, Senate Republicans filibustered and delayed his \nconfirmation in October, in November, in December, and in January. It \nshould not have taken another 2 days after the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to bring the debate to a close to have the confirmation \nvote.\n  The nomination of Stephanie Thacker is similar, and Senate \nRepublicans have acted in a similar, all too familiar pattern. When \nconfirmed, Stephanie Thacker will be the first woman from West Virginia \nto serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. \nShe, too, is strongly supported by both her home state Senators. She, \ntoo, is a qualified, consensus nominee. She has been forced to wait \n5\\1/2\\ months for Senate consideration, with no good purpose. Hers is \nnot a nomination that should have been delayed and filibustered by \nSenate Republicans after it was reported unanimously by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee last November 3.\n  Ms. Thacker is the kind of qualified, consensus nominee who in past \nyears would have been considered and confirmed by the Senate within \ndays of being reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. She is \nan experienced litigator, who, in her 21-year career as a Federal \nprosecutor and private defense attorney, has tried nearly two dozen \ncases to verdict or judgment and argued appeals before the Fourth \nCircuit and the West Virginia Supreme Court. Much of her career has \nbeen dedicated to public service. She served as an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney for the Southern District of West Virginia for 5 years and \nparticipated in the first prosecution in this country under the \nViolence Against Women Act--an important piece of legislation that I am \nworking with Senator Crapo to reauthorize.\n  She continued her career as a Federal prosecutor for another 7 years \nin the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Criminal \nDivision of the Department of Justice. There, she focused on \nprosecuting cases dealing with child pornography, child sexual \nexploitation, sex trafficking, sex tourism, obscenity, and criminal \nnonsupport offenses. She rose to Deputy Chief of Litigation and then to \nPrincipal Deputy Chief. While at the Justice Department, Ms. Thacker \nwas awarded the Attorney General's Distinguished Service Award.\n  Why would any Senator stall confirmation of this consensus nominee? \nWhat purpose did it serve? Must all nominees of President Obama be \ndelayed and obstructed and stalled?\n  I thank the majority leader for scheduling this vote. He has secured \nan agreement to vote on the long-delayed nomination of Judge Jacqueline \nNguyen of California to fill one of the judicial emergency vacancies \nplaguing the Ninth Circuit, the busiest circuit in the country. She, \ntoo, is a consensus nominee who could and should have been confirmed \nlast year. Her consideration has been delayed more than 5 months and \nwill not occur until May 7. But there are two more Ninth Circuit \nnominees to fill judicial emergency vacancies who are before the Senate \nawaiting final consideration. Paul Watford of California was reported \nfavorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee in early February. His \nnomination should be scheduled for a confirmation vote without further \ndelay. Justice Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona was reported favorably by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in early March. His nomination should also \nbe scheduled for a confirmation vote. There is no good reason for \ndelay. The 61 million people served by the Ninth Circuit are not served \nby this delay. The Circuit is being forced to handle double the \ncaseload of any other without its full complement of judges. The Senate \nshould be expediting consideration of the nominations of Judge \nJacqueline Nguyen, Paul Watford, and Justice Andrew Hurwitz, not \ndelaying them.\n  The Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, Judge Alex Kozinski, a Reagan \nappointee, along with the members of the Judicial Council of the Ninth \nCircuit, have written to the Senate emphasizing the Ninth Circuit's \n``desperate need for judges,'' urging the Senate to ``act on judicial \nnominees without delay,'' and concluding ``we fear that the public will \nsuffer unless our vacancies are filled very promptly.'' The judicial \nemergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit are harming litigants by \ncreating unnecessary and costly delays. The Administrative Office of \nU.S. Courts reports that it takes nearly 5 months longer for the Ninth \nCircuit to issue an opinion after an appeal is filed, compared to all \nother circuits. The Ninth Circuit's backlog of pending cases far \nexceeds other Federal courts. As of September 2011, the Ninth Circuit \nhad 14,041 cases pending before it, more than three times that of the \nnext busiest circuit.\n  If caseloads were really a concern of Republican Senators, as they \ncontended last year when they filibustered the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to the D.C. Circuit, they would not be delaying the \nnominations to fill judicial emergency vacancies in the Ninth Circuit. \nIf caseloads were really a concern, Senate Republicans would consent to \nmove forward with all three of these Ninth Circuit nominees to allow \nfor a final up or down vote by the Senate without these months of \nunnecessary delays.\n  None of these nominees should be controversial. They are all \nmainstream nominees with bipartisan support. Judge Nguyen, whose family \nfled to the United States in 1975 after the fall of South Vietnam, was \nconfirmed unanimously to the district court in 2009 and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee unanimously supported her nomination to the Ninth \nCircuit last year. When confirmed, she will be the first Asian Pacific \nAmerican woman to serve on a U.S. Court of Appeals in our history.\n  Paul Watford was rated unanimously well qualified by the ABA's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest rating \npossible. He clerked at the United States Supreme Court for Justice \nRuth Bader Ginsburg and on the Ninth Circuit for now Chief Judge Alex \nKozinski. He was a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. He has the \nsupport of his home state Senators and bipartisan support from noted \nconservatives such as Daniel Collins, who served as Associate Deputy \nAttorney General in the Bush administration; Professors Eugene Volokh \nand Orin Kerr; and Jeremy Rosen, the former president of the Los \nAngeles Chapter of the Federalist Society.\n  Justice Hurwitz is a respected and experience jurist on the Arizona \nSupreme Court. He also received the ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary's highest rating possible, unanimously well \nqualified. This nomination has the strong support of both his \nRepublican home state Senators John McCain and Jon Kyl.\n  Chief Justice Roberts and the Attorney General have both spoken about \nthe serious problems created by persistent judicial vacancies. More \nthan\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\n160 million Americans live in districts or circuits that have a \njudicial vacancy that could be filled today if Senate Republicans would \njust agree to vote on the nominations now pending on the Senate \ncalendar. The Senate should act to bring an end to the harm caused by \ndelays in overburdened courts and we should start with the Ninth \nCircuit. Senate Republicans should consent to votes on the Ninth \nCircuit nominees without more delay and obstruction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [From the Constitutional Accountability Center, Mar. 27, 2012]\n\n                               1000 Days\n\n                     (By Doug Kendall and Ryan Woo)\n\n       Today marks the 1000th consecutive day during which our \n     judicial system has been operating with the burden of 80 or \n     more vacancies on the federal bench. Aside from a completely \n     anomalous period following the creation of 85 new judgeships \n     in 1990, this is far and away the longest period of time \n     during which the federal courts have been forced to operate \n     at such an understaffed level. Across the country, these \n     vacancies have translated into rising caseloads for \n     overworked judges and unacceptable delays for the countless \n     Americans seeking justice in the courts. While it is possible \n     that the vacancy total will dip below 80 in the coming days \n     due to a slow drip of confirmations secured by a recent and \n     hard-fought-for deal in the Senate to allow confirmation \n     votes on 14 judicial nominees, this slow trickle is not \n     anywhere close to the decisive action that is needed to \n     resolve the vacancy crisis that has been plaguing the country \n     for nearly three years.\n       Although much has changed over the past 1000 days, one \n     thing that has remained constant is the partisan obstruction \n     by Republicans in the Senate that has kept the judicial \n     confirmation process moving at a crawl. While a backlog in \n     vacancies is typical at the beginning of a presidential term, \n     the vacancy rate is usually brought down to a more manageable \n     level well before a president's fourth year in office. \n     Indeed, by this point in the first terms of Presidents Bill \n     Clinton and George W. Bush, the vacancy totals were 55 and \n     45, respectively, and the Senate had already confirmed 181 of \n     President Clinton's nominees to the lower federal courts and \n     172 of President Bush's. By comparison, the Senate has only \n     confirmed 134 of President Obama's nominees.\n       The glacial confirmation pace that has kept the vacancy \n     number so high for the past 1000 days can be traced back to \n     Republican obstruction at all levels of the judicial \n     confirmation process. Most important, even uncontroversial \n     nominees are facing unprecedented cloture votes before they \n     can be confirmed. The process of delaying floor votes for \n     nominees has resulted in an average wait time of 111 days \n     between the Judiciary Committee vote and Senate confirmation \n     vote for President Obama's nominees. In sharp contrast, \n     President George W. Bush's nominees waited an average of just \n     22 days.\n       There should never again be a period when the federal \n     judiciary faces such a high number of vacancies for so long; \n     if the vacancy total dips below 80 in the coming days, it \n     will hardly be a cause for celebration. Rather, it will be a \n     reminder that even in an election year, the Senate must put \n     partisan wrangling aside and continue to staff the federal \n     judiciary. The Senate owes nothing less to the judges and \n     everyday Americans who bear the brunt of this politically-\n     inflicted judicial vacancy crisis.\n\n\n           Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, speaking of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nas we begin to work now after the Easter/Passover recess, I wish to \nthank all Senators who have come to the floor in recent weeks to \nexpress their bipartisan support of the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act and who have emphasized, and I agree, the need for \nthe Senate to take up and reauthorize this landmark legislation.\n  For almost 18 years, the Violence Against Women Act--called VAWA--has \nbeen the centerpiece of the Federal Government's commitment to \ncombating domestic violence, dating violence, domestic assault, and \nstalking. The impact of this landmark law has been remarkable. It has \nprovided lifesaving assistance to hundreds of thousands of men, women, \nand children, and the annual incidence of domestic violence has dropped \nby 50 percent since the act was passed.\n  Support for the Violence Against Women Act has always been \nbipartisan, and I appreciate the bipartisan support this \nreauthorization bill has already received. Senator Crapo and I \nintroduced the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in \nNovember. With Senators Heller and Ayotte joining as cosponsors in \nMarch, we now have 61 cosponsors in the Senate from both sides of the \naisle. I hope the Senate will take up and pass this bill soon.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is about responding to domestic and \nsexual violence. Its programs are vitally important. Our legislation \nhas looked at and learned from the experiences and needs of survivors \nof domestic and sexual violence from all around the country. We have \nalso heard the recommendations of those tireless professionals who work \nevery single day--I might say virtually every single night--to serve. \nIt builds on the progress that has been made in reducing domestic and \nsexual violence and makes vital improvements to respond to unmet needs, \nas we have each time we have reauthorized the Violence Against Women \nAct.\n  The provisions that a minority on the Judiciary Committee labeled \ncontroversial are, in fact, modest changes to meet the genuine, unmet \nneeds that service providers have told us they see every day as they \nwork with victims all over the country. This is what we have done on \nevery single VAWA reauthorization. We have looked at what we have \nlearned since the last one and then taken steps to recognize those \nneeds of victims that are not being met and find ways to meet them. \nThat is nothing new or different. It is what we have always done. \nBecause we have improved it each time, it is one of the reasons \ndomestic violence has dropped. This should not be a basis for a \npartisan division or delay.\n  The legislation also improves important changes to respond to current \neconomic realities. We all know while the economy is now improving, \nthese remain difficult economic times, and we have to be responsible in \nhow we spend the taxpayers' money. That is why in our bill we \nconsolidate 13 programs into 4. We remove duplication and bureaucratic \nerrors. It is another thing we do each time we reauthorize to make it \nbetter. It would cut the authorization level for VAWA by more than $135 \nmillion a year. That is a decrease of nearly 20 percent from the last \nreauthorization.\n  The legislation also includes significant accountability provisions, \nincluding audit requirements, enforcement mechanisms, and restrictions \non grantees and costs. Again, we are saying we want to do the right \nthing in the Violence Against Women Act, but we also want to protect \nthe taxpayers' dollars. That is why it is a bipartisan bill. It is a \nproduct of careful consideration, and that is why it has widespread \nsupport.\n  There is no reason not to take it up and debate it and pass it. The \nJudiciary Committee passed this bill after considering a number of \namendments, including a substitute offered by the minority. I have \nreached out to the distinguished ranking member, Senator Grassley, and \nasked about possible amendments and time agreements for consideration. \nWe should do what we have always done ever since the first VAWA years \nago and pass it with strong bipartisan support. These problems are too \nserious for us to delay.\n  Any one of us who has served in law enforcement has gone to a scene \nwhere somebody has been severely battered, sometimes killed. I know \nwhen I have gone to the scenes I never heard a police officer say: Is \nthis a Republican or a Democrat? They say, is this a victim? What do we \ndo to help them? That is what this is. It is not a Republican or \nDemocratic bill; it is a sensible bill to help the victims of violence.\n  This is crucial, commonsense legislation. It has been endorsed by \nmore than 700 State and national organizations, numerous religious and \nfaith-based organizations, as well as our law enforcement partners. The \nlast two times the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized, it was \nunanimously approved by the Senate. It seems sometimes that partisan \ngridlock has become the default in the Senate in recent years. We are \nbetter than that. We should rise above gridlock. There is no reason we \nshould delay considering this bill. It has the support of 61 cosponsors \nacross the aisle. Let us pass it.\n  As I have said before, domestic and sexual violence know no political \nparty. Violence happens to too many people in this country. Its victims \nare Republicans and Democrats. They are rich and poor, young and old. \nThey are male and female. They are straight and gay. Nobody falls into \na category where they are immune to this kind of violence. So let us \nwork together and\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\npass this strong VAWA reauthorization legislation and let us do it \nwithout delay. It is a law that has saved countless lives. For my \nfellow Senators, I would say this is an example of what we in the \nSenate can accomplish if we work together.\n\n\n                        Paying a Fair Share Act\n\n  Lastly, before I came to the floor, I heard the strong support for \nthe Paying a Fair Share Act. It has been called the Buffett rule. The \nBuffett rule is a commonsense bill, ensuring that taxpayers at the top \nof the economic ladder pay at least the same tax rate paid by hard-\nworking middle-class families in my State of Vermont and all other \nStates. No longer should handsomely compensated CEOs or those who live \noff trust funds pay a lower effective tax rate than the people who work \nfor them.\n  Frankly, I think it is remarkable and regrettable that such a \nprinciple of tax fairness should evoke controversy. It is more \nregrettable still that opponents have erected a supermajority barrier \nin an effort to prevent debate on this straightforward principle. We \nshould debate whether the wealthiest should pay at least the same rate \nof taxes as hard-working middle America and then vote for it or vote \nagainst it. If a Senator wants to vote to protect the wealthiest \nAmericans, fine, stand and vote that way or vote to protect hard-\nworking American families. But when we filibuster, what we are doing is \nvoting maybe. That is voting maybe.\n  Let's have the courage to vote for the millionaires and protect them \nfrom any kind of a tax such as ordinary Americans pay or vote for \nordinary Americans and say everybody should pay the same kind of tax. \nVote one way or the other, but don't duck it by having a filibuster, \nwhere we can say: I looked at it and I voted maybe. We are not elected \nto vote maybe.\n\n  I am pleased to join Senator Whitehouse and others as a cosponsor of \nthe bill which calls for a minimum 30-percent tax rate for taxpayers \nwith adjusted gross incomes above $1 million. This just says they are \ngoing to pay at least the tax rate paid by middle-class families, and \nit also will reduce the deficit by $47 billion over the next decade.\n  While hard-working Vermont families and small businesses are \nstruggling to make ends meet in a difficult economy, tax fairness has \ncontinued to erode, benefiting the wealthiest 1 percent at the expense \nof the rest of the country. Right now, a very large proportion of \nmillionaires pay a smaller percentage of their income than do a larger \nshare of moderate-income taxpayers.\n  Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, noted in a \nNew York Times op-ed article last year that he paid taxes of only 17.4 \npercent on his taxable income--a lower percentage than paid by any of \nhis 20 employees. They paid from 33 to 41 percent. In fact, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service studied these claims and \nconfirmed Mr. Buffett's assertion that a large proportion of \nmillionaires pay a smaller percentage of their income than average \nworking Americans and Vermonters do.\n  Let us end the loopholes. Tax day is upon us. Let us stand and say we \nare going to end the loopholes, we are going to end these special \nprovisions that allow some of the wealthiest to pay less than hard-\nworking Americans. It is simply a matter of fairness.\n  Again, let us vote yes or no. If someone wants to vote to protect the \nmillionaires, then, fine, vote no. If someone wants to say have it be \nfair, then vote yes. But let us vote. Having a filibuster means we vote \nmaybe. None of us get elected or paid to vote maybe.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia on the floor and I see his distinguished colleague.\n  I am sorry, I now see the Senator from Pennsylvania. Before I yield \nthe floor, I ask unanimous consent, if there are quorum calls during \nthis hour, the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent when the time goes \nback to this side, that first the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia be recognized and then his distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia, Senator Manchin, be recognized, both to speak for the \ntime remaining to the Senator from Vermont.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when time is yielded back to me, the \ntime remaining to the Senator from Vermont, which will be approximately \n15 minutes, be divided between the two Senators from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as though \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Tax Fairness\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak against the \nso-called Buffett rule. This is a gimmick. It is a political gimmick. \nThis is not a serious effort to deal with a ridiculously broken Tax \nCode. This is not a serious effort to deal with a completely broken \nbudget. And, frankly, it is very disappointing to me that we are \nwasting time on this instead of dealing with both of those things.\n  We have a Tax Code that is ridiculous, impossible to understand, \ncounterproductive to economic growth, and that badly needs a complete \noverhaul that would simplify the Code, get rid of much unfairness, \nlower marginal rates, broaden the base, and encourage strong economic \ngrowth. Instead, we have this little gimmick because we don't have the \npolitical leadership to deal with the underlying real problem of a \nbadly flawed Tax Code.\n  Likewise on budget policy, this does nothing meaningful for our \nmassive budget deficits that we have been running. In fact, this body \nchooses again for the third consecutive year not to even have a budget. \nIt is unbelievable. Instead, we are going to waste time arguing about \nthis political stunt.\n  The President proposed a budget, at least. Unfortunately, it was not \na serious budget, not a serious attempt to deal with the massive \ndeficits we are running. It is the fourth consecutive year of trillion \ndollar deficits. Instead of dealing with that, we have this gimmick.\n  Let's be clear. This is not a serious attempt to deal with tax reform \nor the budget. This so-called Buffett rule, this tax increase, would \nraise less than $5 billion a year. That amounts to about one-half of 1 \npercent of the $1 trillion deficit the President has proposed that we \nrun. In fact, it would cover about 2 days' worth of the deficits we are \nrunning for 2013.\n  Here is a chart that illustrates the deficit we will have under the \nPresident's policies without the Buffett tax. Here is the deficit we \nwill have if we pass the Buffett tax. If you can't tell the difference, \nit is because there is no meaningful difference.\n  Folks, we ought to be dealing with the real tax reform that we need \nto encourage economic growth and help reduce this deficit. Instead, we \nare wasting time with this.\n  Since we are not doing what we ought to do, why are we having this \nargument? Unfortunately, it looks as though it is an effort on two \nfronts. One is to simply engage in class warfare, generate envy and \nresentment, and try to use that for political gain. And, secondly, it \nis an effort to distract from the underlying mismanagement of economic \npolicy and fiscal policy we have seen from this administration.\n  I know what the claim is from the other side. We hear this is all \nabout making sure the rich pay their fair share. I have to say I have a \nlittle trouble taking lectures on fairness from folks who think \ntaxpayers ought to be made to put $500 million into a solar energy \ncompany that does not have a competitive product, which drives it into \nbankruptcy at the cost to the taxpayers, from the same folks who want \nto force taxpayers to continue subsidizing plug-in cars people don't \nwant to buy. That kind of crony capitalism and distorting of our \neconomy at the expense of taxpayers doesn't strike me as fairness, so I \nhave a hard time taking a lecture on fairness from people who advocate \nthose things.\n  But let's look at this Tax Code. If we want to talk about fairness, \nthat is fine. How about the fact that, according to the Joint Committee \non Taxation, almost half of all Americans today pay no income tax at \nall or actually receive money through the income tax code? The other \nhalf pays all of the taxes. We are hearing from our friends\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\nthat that is not enough; they need to pay still more.\n  My second chart will illustrate the point that according to the CBO, \nif we look at all Federal taxes, the middle quintile, the middle 20 \npercent of wage earners in America, pays about 14 percent as an average \ntax when you combine all the kinds of Federal taxes that are paid. The \ntop 1 percent pays 30 percent. So it is more than twice as high--29.5, \nactually.\n  If we look at just the income tax, the disparity is even bigger. If \nwe look at the income tax alone, the middle quintile, the middle class, \nthe middle 20 percent, when it comes to income tax alone on average \npays about 3.3 percent as an effective average income tax rate. The top \n1 percent pays 19 percent; that is, on average, almost 6 times as high.\n  The fact is we have a very progressive tax system, not just by the \nhistorical measures of our own previous tax systems, but look \neverywhere else in the world. In fact, the United States, according to \nthe OECD, has the most progressive tax system in the industrialized \nworld.\n  This is a chart that measures progressivity. Greater progressivity is \nin this direction; less is in this direction. As you can see, this \nranking shows all the countries around the world that have less \nprogressivity than the United States, which means that higher income \nAmericans pay a greater share of income taxes and taxes generally than \nin any other country in the world. But again, we are told this is not \nenough.\n  Clearly there is something else going on here, and here is what \nconcerns me the most. The real consequence of this so-called Buffett \nrule, this tax increase, are that it is meant to be a tax on investment \nreturns. It is a tax on capital gains and dividends. It is a tax that \nwould upend decades of established law with respect to the \ndifferentiation we have put in place with respect to dividend income \nversus wage income. And it disregards the very sound reasons why we \nhave created that distinction, one of which is that investment returns \nare taxed multiple times.\n  We don't hear so much about that during this debate from my friends \nwho are advocates for this new tax increase. But the fact is, first of \nall, it is only aftertax income that can be invested in the first \nplace. So someone had to pay taxes on their earnings, and then after \nthey have spent what they need to for their cost of living and if they \nhave managed to save something which they then invest, they have \nalready paid tax on that. Now the investment they have made--and let's \nsay this is an investment in a corporate stock. Let's keep in mind that \nthat corporation has to pay tax before they have an opportunity to \nprovide a return on the investment that is made. And as it happens, in \nthe United States, our corporations pay the highest corporate tax in \nthe entire industrialized world, 35 percent.\n\n  We have got a terrible corporate Tax Code that needs to be reformed \nin many ways. One of them is to lower this top marginal rate, but right \nnow it is 35 percent. And what the proponents of this rule are saying \nis that after a corporation pays that 35 percent tax on whatever income \nthey can earn, and when they then choose to dividend some of that \nremaining aftertax income to the people who own that company, they want \nthose owners to pay yet another tax that is even higher than we pay \nnow.\n  We have a chart here that illustrates what the net effect of this is. \nGiven that we have a 35-percent top corporate tax rate, and if we were \nto adopt this proposal to impose this 30-percent minimum tax, for an \nindividual who has dividend income, first the company in which they \ninvest pays a tax. Not all companies pay the 35-percent rate, but that \nis the top rate and it is in effect on many companies. Well, if the \ncompany has to pay 35 percent of a given $100 of income, they are left \nwith $65 in corporate aftertax income. If that company then decides \nthat the people who own it ought to get a dividend reflecting their \nownership on that $65 that is available to be paid out as a dividend to \ninvestors, the proponents of the Buffett rule would have those \ninvestors pay another 30 percent. That is $19.50, leaving the investors \nwith $45.50 out of the $100 of income. In other words, the government \ntakes the lion's share of the income from this investment.\n  The net effect of that, of course, is that it diminishes the \nincentive to make these investments in the first place. It makes other \ncountries more attractive places to invest capital, to invest in a \nbusiness to try to generate a return.\n  There is another aspect that is disturbing about this which is, if \nyou ask me, it is very reminiscent of the alternative minimum tax. We \ntried that once. In 1969, Congress decided there were some people who \nweren't paying enough in tax, and they said we are going to target a \nhandful. Literally, it was 15 people--not 155,000 but 155 people who \nwere subject to the alternative minimum tax, which was this confession \nof the absurdity of the Tax Code in the first place. Right? Junk the \nentire existing Tax Code and have yet a second parallel Code that will \napply to just those rich 155 people. Well, guess what. Today that \napplies to tens of millions of Americans, and every year Congress has \nto do a temporary fix because it wasn't intended to do that.\n  I would suggest if we go down this road, we are going to find that \nthis tax--which we are told today would only apply to millionaires and \nbillionaires, well, pretty soon the hard cold reality of the fact that \nit doesn't generate any revenue to speak of if you apply it just to \nmillionaires and billionaires, means it is going to be expanded to the \nmiddle class and far more people, very much to our detriment.\n  Finally, let me say that it is a bad idea to confiscate the capital \nwhich is the lifeblood of an economy. This next chart illustrates the \ncritical role that investment plays in economic growth and in job \ncreation.\n  A couple of squiggly lines. But one thing you notice if you take a \nquick look is there is an inverse relationship here. When the black \nline goes up, the red line is going down. The black line is investment \nas a percentage of our economy. And when investment climbs--the red \nline is unemployment--you see, unemployment goes down. This is very \nwell understood. It is capital invested in the economy that creates \ngrowth and creates jobs. What this rule would do is it would impose a \nnew layer of additionally higher taxes on that very lifeblood of our \neconomy.\n  It is capital also that drives wages higher. We should never forget \nthat fact. It is capital that allows the hunter-gatherer to have a hoe \nand become a farmer. It is capital that allows the farmer with a hoe to \ncast aside the hoe and drive a tractor and become far more productive. \nIt is capital that allows the laborer who is digging with the shovel to \nput aside the shovel and drive a backhoe. And as I think everybody \nunderstands or should understand, the farmer who is using a tractor is \nproducing more and has a higher income than the poor guy who is using a \nhoe. And the guy who is operating a backhoe has far more income and is \nfar more productive than the guy who is using a shovel. It is capital \nthat makes that possible.\n  There is a metaphor I like about this, and I am not sure who to \ncredit it to, but certainly I didn't invent it. I may not do it \njustice, but the gist of it is this:\n  The comparison to the economy is that of a fruit tree.\n  A farmer who has a fruit tree cultivates that tree so it will produce \nfruit, and the fruit is the income the farmer earns from the work he \nputs into cultivating that tree.\n  If the government comes along and takes some of the fruit as a tax, \nas long as it doesn't take too much it still makes sense for the farmer \nto cultivate that tree so he can have that aftertax income. And as long \nas the government only takes a portion of the fruit, then the \ngovernment is not diminishing the ability of the tree to produce that \nfruit.\n  But if the government comes along and says in addition to taking a \nwhole lot of the fruit, we want to saw off a branch because we want \nsome firewood, that is a whole different matter. Because whatever you \nthink of how many of those apples or whatever portion of that fruit you \nwish to take from the farmer, once you start cutting at the tree you \nare diminishing the ability of the tree to produce income for the good \nof the farmer and for society.\n  That is what happens when we restrict capital, and I am afraid this \nis the path we would be going down if we\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\nadopt this. This is bad economic policy. We already have the most \nprogressive Tax Code in the world, and very progressive by our own \nhistorical standards.\n  For the sake of job growth, economic growth, and in the hopes that we \nwill instead have a meaningful discussion about budget policy and tax \nreform, I urge my colleagues to vote no today on the cloture motion on \nthe Buffett rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, 1 year ago last month our Nation lost \nan esteemed public servant and an outstanding human being, Judge M. \nBlane Michael, who served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit for a number of years.\n  With his passing, we were therefore left with a great void not only \non the Federal judiciary but also in the hearts of his family and his \nmany friends. So it is with a profound sense of obligation to the \npeople of West Virginia and America that I set out to find a nominee to \nfill his vacancy. My duty to provide advice and consent took on, to me, \nadditional significance.\n\n  In West Virginia, we are fortunate to have many talented and worthy \nlawyers who are capable of serving--and willing to serve--on the \nFederal bench.\n  But the nominee before the Senate today, Stephanie Dawn Thacker, \ncompletely stood out to me--and (in turn) to President Obama--as \nsomeone who is uniquely qualified to carry on in her own way, Judge \nMichael's legacy of independence, humility, and intellectual honesty as \na Federal judge.\n  There is no question that Stephanie Thacker has reached the heights \nof the legal profession, both as an award-winning public servant and as \nan esteemed lawyer in private practice.\n  Her rise is all the more impressive because of the challenges she \novercame The circumstances of Stephanie Thacker's early life were not \neasy. Her home town, Hamlin, WV, is in one of the poorest counties in \nthe nation--a place where nothing is taken for granted and where every \nsuccess is hard-earned.\n  Stephanie credits a supportive family and community, and the \ninfluence of two strong women who assumed her ability to achieve \nagainst the odds.\n  While still in the crib, Stephanie's mother and grandmother told her \nevery day that she would go to college, and then in college they told \nher she would succeed in law school. They instilled in her the value of \neducation and a strong sense of public service and duty to her country, \nwhich we fulfill again today.\n  Ms. Thacker heeded their advice, graduating magna cum laude from \nMarshall University and second in her class from the West Virginia \nUniversity College of Law, where she was an editor of the Law Review.\n  Over the next 21 years her passion and respect for the law, along \nwith her drive to seek justice for her clients, resulted in an \nillustrious career. Ms. Thacker's reputation is as a compassionate yet \ntough attorney who makes thoughtful, very well-researched, and \ntherefore confident arguments that are always based on the law and \nfacts of her cases.\n  These skills and character are evident in her 12 years of service as \na federal prosecutor, where she rose to be Principal Deputy Chief of \nthe Department of Justice's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section. \nAmong her accomplishments are prosecuting the first federal Violence \nAgainst Women Act case and helping to develop the nationwide Innocence \nLost initiative to combat child sex trafficking, which to date has led \nto the rescue of more than 1,600 children and the conviction of more \nthan 700 sex offenders.\n  She co-authored the Federal Child Support Prosecution handbook, \nworked reviewing and amending West Virginia's domestic violence laws, \nprosecuting notorious child sex offender Dwight York, and training \nnational and international law enforcement officials on the prosecution \nof child exploitation crimes.\n  This body of work has rightfully earned her bipartisan praise over \nthe years from United States Senators, FBI Director Mueller and former \nAttorney Generals Gonzales and Ashcroft, who awarded her the \nDistinguished Service Award, which is among the Department's highest \ncommendations.\n  These accomplishments are illustrative of the experience and \nqualifications that Stephanie Thacker offers in service to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.\n  She has the courage to make tough decisions, and will not back down \nfrom a challenge.\n  She has the superior intellect necessary to analyze the complex legal \nissues that come before the Federal appeals courts. She will look at \nevery case with a fair and open mind and will issue opinions that are \nguided by our Constitutional principles and always grounded in the law \nand she will never forget her solemn duty to uphold fairness and \njustice for everyone, regardless of social status or economic means.\n  In conclusion, it is with great optimism, pride, and a renewed spirit \nthat I look to the future, knowing that this important appellate \nvacancy will be filled with such a qualified nominee as Stephanie Dawn \nThacker.\n  I yield the Floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today first of all to thank the \nsenior Senator, my friend Senator Rockefeller, for nominating such a \nqualified jurist upon the passing of our dear friend, Judge Blane \nMichael.\n  Stephanie Dawn Thacker is a native of Hamlin, WV. We are awaiting her \nconfirmation this afternoon with a vote which I know will be in the \naffirmative. It is my privilege and my honor to speak on her behalf \nalso.\n  Stephanie Thacker's impressive background and extensive list of \naccomplishments in both the public and private sectors make her an \nexceptional judge for the 4th Circuit. She is renowned in our state for \nher mastery of the law and of the courtroom, and I have no doubt that \nshe will make a highly successful federal judge.\n  Ms. Thacker has dedicated much of her career to fighting some of the \nworst offenses in our society. As a trial attorney, Deputy Chief of \nLitigation, and Principal Deputy Chief, she spent several years \nprosecuting cases, as you have heard, on Child Exploitation and \nObscenity at the Department of Justice. Her outstanding work and \nleadership earned her a number of honors at the Department of Justice, \nincluding four ``Meritorious'' Awards and two ``Special Achievement'' \nawards.\n  Her impressive performance in prosecuting the case of United States \nv. Dwight York earned her the Attorney General's ``Distinguished \nService'' award, one of the Department's highest honors. She was also a \nrecipient of the Assistant Attorney General's awards for ``Special \nInitiative'' and ``Outstanding Victim and Witness Service.''\n  Prior to her service at the Department of Justice, Ms. Thacker worked \nwith the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of West \nVirginia, where she prosecuted a wide variety of criminal cases, \nincluding money laundering and fraud. While at the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice, Ms. Thacker participated on the trial team prosecuting United \nStates v. Bailey, the first case ever brought under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  Since 2006, Ms. Thacker has been a partner at the law firm of Guthrie \n& Thomas in Charleston, West Virginia. There, she has concentrated on \ncases involving product liability, environmental and toxic torts, \ncomplex commercial defense, and criminal defense.\n  Ms. Thacker was a model student in both her undergraduate and legal \nstudies. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, \nmagna cum laude, from Marshall University, and her J.D., Order of the \nCoif, from West Virginia University College of Law. While at West \nVirginia University she was a recipient of the Robert L. Griffin \nMemorial Scholarship and Editor of West Virginia Law Review's Coal \nIssue. She has also recently been named ``Outstanding Female Attorney'' \nby WVU Law's Women's Caucus.\n  Ms. Thacker's wide-ranging expertise in civil and criminal matters, \nher impressive track record in the courtroom as both a prosecutor and a \ndefense attorney, and her outstanding academic accomplishments will \nmake her a first-rate addition to the 4th Circuit. I am proud to call \nher a fellow West Virginian and I am pleased that she will finally be \nconfirmed.\n\n\n                            the buffett rule\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I had the enormous privilege to spend the\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\nlast 2 weeks traveling around my great State to hear from the people of \nWest Virginia.\n  It is always so refreshing to get a dose of commonsense from people \nwho are working hard every day to balance their family budget, put food \non the table and give their kids a better life.\n  And I can tell you that the people of West Virginia are so frustrated \nand losing confidence in this government, especially when it comes to \nour broken tax system.\n  Whether it was in Beckley, Ravenswood or Wheeling, I heard the same \nthing from the people of my great State.\n  We just don't understand why hardworking, middle income people are \npaying a much higher tax rate than some of the wealthiest people in \nthis country. Take our coal miners, who go to the mine every single day \nto make a living for themselves, for their families, but who are paying \na higher tax rate than some people making a million dollars a year. \nWhere I come from, that's not fair. Where I come from, that doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  Where I come from, that means our system needs to be fixed--in a \nreal, responsible and fiscally sound way that reduces our debt.\n  Now, let me be clear: I am not begrudging anyone who's worked hard, \nwho has taken a risk or who has done well. But we have to have a solid \ncountry under us to achieve those goals. And we need to put fairness \nback in the tax system to get this country on solid ground again. And \nif we want a fair system, that means that there should not be \nprivileges that allow the very wealthy to pay a lower rate than \nhardworking, middle class Americans.\n  Right now, the average person does not have those opportunities or \nprivileges. But when people believe the American Dream is in reach, \nthey will all pull harder.\n  Today I rise to speak about my support for the Buffett Rule, which \nwould take a small step toward fixing this unfair system and paying \ndown this country's nearly $16 trillion debt.\n  A lot of people here believe that this bill will fail because of \npolitics on a mostly party line vote. That is a shame because the only \nline we should vote is the American line.\n  For a year-and-a-half, I have been coming to the Senate floor to urge \nmy colleagues to put party and politics aside and vote for the good of \nthe next generation, whether it is a Democratic idea or a Republican \nidea.\n  But even though this vote on the Buffett Rule might fail today on \nparty lines, we cannot give up--we have to find a way to come together \nfor the next generation.\n  I have said before that the Buffett Rule alone does not address the \nfull scope of the problem. All it does is nibble around the edges of \nour broken tax code. We still have too many corporations that can take \nadvantage of too many loopholes, credits and exemptions. We are pushing \n$16 trillion dollars in debt and we are still spending more than a \ntrillion dollars more than we take in every year. That does not make \nsense.\n  We have to fix the whole thing so that we can start reducing our \ndeficit, paying down our debt and putting our fiscal house back in \norder for the next generation.\n  To do that, we have a plan with bipartisan support--the Bowles-\nSimpson framework, which would reduce loopholes, exemptions and credits \nacross the board, lower tax rates and get everyone to pay their fair \nshare. Just as importantly, it would cut spending and start paying down \nour debt.\n  I can't tell you how important that is to the people of West \nVirginia, the taxpayers in every single income bracket who don't trust \nthe government to spend their tax dollars wisely.\n  Just like all Americans have the responsibility to pay their fair \nshare, Washington has the responsibility to show the people of this \ncountry--no matter how much money they make--that we are using their \ntax dollars wisely and effectively--just as we did in West Virginia.\n  That is why I believe we must--and I will continue to fight--to cut \nback on our spending. We have to eliminate the $125 billion dollars \nthat we spent in waste, fraud and abuse last year alone. And most \nimportantly, we have to pay down the nearly $16 trillion dollar debt \nhole that has been dug for the next generation.\n  The Buffett Rule would take a small step to show the American people \nthat we are trying to correct those problems and--most importantly--put \nsome basic fairness back into our tax system.\n  Even though this vote might fail, in West Virginia we will continue \nto work hard. We will continue to pay our taxes. And we will continue \nto fight to make sure that when our coal miners send in their taxes, \nthat people who bring in a million dollars a year aren't getting away \nwith paying less.\n  The future of this country depends on those of us here in Washington \nworking together to restore confidence in this great nation because \nwhen people believe that everyone is paying their fair share, they are \nall willing to pull their load a little harder. And if people start \nbelieving in this country again, there's no stopping us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, again we are moving forward under the \nregular order and procedures of the Senate. This year we have been in \nsession for about 37 days, including today. During that time we will \nhave confirmed 15 judges. That is an average of better than one \nconfirmation for every 2\\1/2\\ days we have been in session. With the \nconfirmations today, the Senate will have confirmed nearly 75 percent \nof President Obama's article III judicial nominations.\n  Despite this progress, we still hear complaints about the judicial \nvacancy rate. We are filling those vacancies. But again, I would remind \nmy colleagues that of the 82 current vacancies, 50 have no nominee. \nThat is over 60 percent of vacancies with no nominee.\n  Another complaint we hear, which is a distortion of the record, is \nthe so-called delay in confirming nominees. Those who raise this \ncomplaint only focus on the time a nominee is reported out of committee \nuntil confirmation. But the confirmation process is more than just \nSenate floor action.\n  For those who may not be familiar with the confirmation process, let \nme review. Once a nomination is received, the committee takes an \nappropriate amount of time to review the nominee's Senate questionnaire \nand background and review written materials. The Committee holds a \nhearing on judicial nominees and then holds the record open for \nadditional written questions. Of course there is debate on the \nnomination in committee, then the nomination is reported to the floor. \nAll of this takes time. Every step is important. Not all nominees make \nit through each step.\n  The average time for this process for President Bush's circuit judge \nnominees was 350 days. That means it took, on average, nearly 12 months \nfrom the time a nomination was received in the Senate until final \nconfirmation.\n  For President Obama's circuit nominees the average time from \nnomination to confirmation is 243 days. That means President Obama's \ncircuit nominees are being confirmed faster than those of President \nBush. So to those who ask What's different about this President? I \nwould respond that one thing that is different is that this President's \ncircuit nominees are being treated much more fairly than President \nBush's nominees were treated.\n  As I stated, not all nominees make it through every step of the \nprocess. In the case of our nominee today, she completed that process \nin about 220 days, below the average for President Obama and much \nquicker than the average for President Bush. She will likely be \nconfirmed and take her place on the Court of Appeals for the fourth \ncircuit.\n  This was not the outcome for many of President Bush's nominees to the \nfourth circuit. Let me review just a few of the highlights from those \nfailed nominations.\n  I wonder if my colleagues remember William Haynes, President Bush's \nnominee to sit on the fourth circuit. In the 108th Congress, my \nDemocratic colleagues held up his nomination for 638 days on the Senate \ncalendar alone before it was returned to the President. All in all, he \nput his life on hold for 1,173 days and never received an up-or-down \nvote.\n  Later, at a point during the 110th Congress, the fourth circuit had a \nvacancy rate of 33 percent and desperately required judges. The \nPresident\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\ndid his duty and submitted four nominations. Unfortunately, all of them \nwere needlessly delayed.\n  Judge Robert Conrad was nominated to a seat on the fourth circuit \nwhich had been designated as a judicial emergency, Both home State \nSenators supported his nomination. Furthermore, he had received \nunanimous support from the Senate on two prior occasions--first when he \nwas confirmed to be a United States Attorney and again when he was \nconfirmed by voice vote to be a United States District Judge for the \nWestern District of North Carolina. The American Bar Association's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave him a \nrating of well qualified.\n  Judge Conrad met every standard to be considered a well qualified, \nnoncontroversial, consensus nominee. Yet, his nomination stalled. He \nwas nominated on July 17, 2007. Despite his extensive qualifications, a \nhearing was never scheduled. On October 2, 2007 Senators Burr and Dole \nsent a letter to the chairman asking for a hearing for Judge Conrad. On \nApril 15, 2008 they sent a second letter to the chairman requesting a \nhearing for Judge Conrad.\n  Their request was never granted. After waiting 585 days for a hearing \nthat never came, Judge Conrad's nomination was returned on January 2, \n2009.\n  Steve Matthews was another nominee to the fourth circuit, nominated \non September 6, 2007. He was a graduate of Yale Law School and had a \ndistinguished career in private practice in South Carolina. He also had \nthe support of his home State Senators. On April 15, 2008 Senators \nGraham and DeMint sent a letter to the chairman asking for a hearing \nfor Mr. Matthews. Despite his qualifications, Mr. Matthews waited 485 \ndays for a hearing that never came. His nomination was returned on \nJanuary 2, 2009.\n  Rod Rosenstein was nominated to a fourth circuit seat designated as a \njudicial emergency on November 15, 2007. The American Bar Association's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him well \nqualified. Previously, in 2005 he had been confirmed by a \nnoncontroversial voice vote as U.S. Attorney for Maryland. Prior to his \nservice as U.S. Attorney, he held several positions in the Departm6nt \nof Justice under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n  On June 24, 2008 Senator Specter, the ranking Republican Member, sent \na letter to Mr. Rosenstein's home State Senators pointing out that the \nseat to which Mr. Rosenstein had been nominated had been vacant since \nAugust 2000--at the time nearly 8 years. He requested they return their \nblue slips on his nomination. That request was declined, reportedly \nbecause the nominee lacked ties to Maryland and was doing too good of a \njob as the U.S. Attorney for Maryland. I find that rationale somewhat \nperplexing, if not inconsistent.\n  Nevertheless, despite his stellar qualifications, Mr. Rosenstein \nwaited 414 days for a hearing that never came. His nomination was \nreturned on January 2, 2009.\n  Judge Glen Conrad was another failed nomination to the fourth \ncircuit. Nominated on May 8, 2008 he had the support of his home State \nSenators, one a Republican, the other a Democrat. Judge Conrad had \npreviously been supported by the full Senate when he was confirmed to \nbe a United States District Judge for the Western District of Virginia \nby a unanimous, bipartisan vote of 89 0 in September 2003. Despite his \nextensive qualifications, Judge Glen Conrad waited 240 days for a \nhearing that never came. His nomination was returned on January 2, \n2009.\n  What was the reaction to this Democratic obstruction to President \nBush's fourth circuit nominees? A December 2007 Washington Post \neditorial lamented the dire straits of the fourth circuit writing: \n``[T]he Senate should act in good faith to fill vacancies--not as a \nfavor to the president but out of respect for the residents, \nbusinesses, defendants and victims of crime in the region the 4th \nCircuit covers. Two nominees--Mr. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews--should \nreceive confirmation hearings as soon as possible.''\n  In 2008, another Washington Post editorial stated that ``blocking Mr. \nRosenstein's confirmation hearing . . . would elevate ideology and ego \nabove substance and merit, and it would unfairly penalize a man who \npeople on both sides of this question agree is well qualified for a \njudgeship.''\n  I would note that the seat to which Mr. Rosenstein was nominated went \nvacant for over 9 years. When President Obama made his nomination to \nthat vacancy, the nominee fared far better. He received a hearing a \nmere 27 days after his nomination and received a committee vote just 36 \ndays later.\n  So today, as we confirm another of President Obama's nominees to the \nfourth circuit, I hope my colleagues understand, recognize, and \nacknowledge that President Obama's nominees are being treated in a fair \nmanner.\n  Stephanie Dawn Thacker is nominated to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the fourth circuit. She graduated with honors from West Virginia \nUniversity College of Law in 1990 and received her B.A., magna cum \nlaude, from Marshall University in 1987. Ms. Thacker began her legal \ncareer as an associate in the Pittsburgh office of Kirkpatrick & \nLockhart, now K Gates. There she worked on complex commercial and \nasbestos defense litigation.\n  In 1992, she worked for a brief period as an assistant attorney \ngeneral in the Environmental Division of the Office of the West \nVirginia Attorney General. There she represented the State of West \nVirginia on environmental issues involving permitting and compliance. \nShe then joined King, Allen & Betts--now Guthrie and Thomas--as an \nassociate, where she worked from 1992 to 1994 on cases involving \ncommercial litigation defense, white collar criminal defense, and legal \nmalpractice and professional responsibility defense.\n  In 1994, she joined the United States Attorney's Office for the \nSouthern District of West Virginia as an assistant United States \nattorney in the General Criminal Division. As an assistant United \nStates attorney, she prosecuted cases on a wide range of criminal \nmatters including money laundering, fraud, firearms, and tax evasion \nmatters. She eventually developed a niche in domestic violence, child \nsupport enforcement, and coal mine safety.\n  In 1999, she became a trial attorney with the Department of Justice's \nChild Exploitation and Obscenity Section. She was promoted to deputy \nchief for litigation in 2002 andl principal deputy chief in 2004. As a \ntrial attorney, she prosecuted cases around the country involving child \npornography, child sexual exploitation, sex trafficking, and obscenity. \nAs deputy chief and principal deputy chief, she was responsible for the \nmanagement and professional development of the section trial attorneys.\n  In 2006, she became a partner at Guthrie and Thomas--formerly King, \nBetts & Allen--where she previously worked basis as an associate. She \nhas specialized in complex litigation, environmental and toxic tort \nlitigation, representing large companies, as well as handling some \ncriminal defense cases representing individuals.\n  A substantial majority of the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary gave her a rating of well qualified; a minority of that \ncommittee rated her as qualified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, many Americans sat down last week to \nprepare their taxes, knowing from Warren Buffett and others that the \nhighest income Americans very often are paying a lower tax rate than \nthey have to. The 400 highest income Americans, the most recent data \nshows, paid an all-in tax rate of 18.2 percent, on average. Some paid a \nlot less. One year Warren Buffett paid an 11-percent tax rate.\n  Reuters reported today that about 65 percent of taxpayers who earn \nmore than $1 million face a lower tax rate than the median tax rate for \nmoderate-income earners making $100,000 or less a year. This bill will \nraise between $47 and $162 billion that could go for deficit reduction \nor hundreds of thousands of infrastructure jobs or to keep student \ninterest rates at 3.4 percent and end the absurd inequity in our Tax \nCode that lets a hedge fund billionaire pay a lower tax rate than a \nRhode Island truckdriver. I hope my colleagues will vote yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, everyone knows this is not going to pass. \nThis is a political exercise. I urge my colleagues to vote no. The fact \nis on average the people in the upper two brackets pay more than twice \nas much in their income tax rates as the people we call the middle-\nclass taxpayers.\n  So the basis, the factual basis upon which this is allegedly founded \nis incorrect. The truth is this legislation will do nothing with regard \nto job creation, with regard to gas prices, with regard to economic \nrecovery, or any of the other matters the American people care about. \nAs a result, to focus attention on something like this is to try to \ndraw attention away from the issues about which the American people are \nmost concerned.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 51, the nays are \n45. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I know there are many who dismiss the \nPresident's proposal of the so-called Buffett rule as an election year \ntactic which has no chance of being enacted. But, for me, it must be \ntaken as a serious proposal because it touches important economic \nprinciples at a very difficult economic time for our country. Although \nI was unable to be present for this afternoon's vote, I would have \nvoted against the motion to proceed to the Paying a Fair Share Act of \n2012, S. 2230, and I want to explain why.\n  I am not opposed to the Buffett rule because I am opposed to raising \nincome taxes on the wealthiest Americans. I am opposed to the Buffett \nrule because it would double to 30 percent the capital gains tax on one \ngroup of investors and therefore reduce exactly the kind of capital \ninvestments we need to get our economy growing again and create jobs. \nTo protect America from being drowned in public debt we will eventually \nhave to raise revenues, hopefully through broad tax reform, and, of \ncourse, we will also have to cut expenditures, particularly the rate of \nincreased spending on so-called entitlement programs. But that is \ndifferent from the question of how to tax gains on capital investments. \nI have long believed in the value of having a lower tax on capital \ngains than on regular income because capital investments are\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\none of the engines that has driven this great economy of ours, made us \nthe land of opportunity, and created the American middle class. Someone \nonce said that if you take the ``capital'' out of capitalism, all you \nhave left is an ``ism.'' There is a lot of truth in that play on words.\n  My support for a lower capital gains rate was probably born when one \nof the great political inspirations of my life, President John F. \nKennedy, advocated lower capital gains taxes as part of his ``a rising \ntide raises all boats'' fiscal policy. During my first term in the \nSenate in 1989, I supported President George H.W. Bush's proposal to \nlower the capital gains tax. I was one of a small group of Democrats to \ndo so. During the 1990s, I worked alongside the late, great Jack Kemp \nin support of lower capital gains rates, especially for gains made on \ncapital investments in low-income urban and rural areas which we called \nenterprise zones. Throughout the years, I cosponsored broad proposals \nto lower the capital gains tax with Senator Hatch and other Members of \nthe Senate from both political parties. To me, economic history proves \nthat lower capital gains taxes grow our economy and higher capital \ngains taxes don't increase revenues. This particular tax increase is \nespecially ill-timed, since it is clear that literally billions of \ndollars are now being held back from new investments in America by \nindividuals and businesses because they are uncertain about the future \nof our economy and the future of government policies that will affect \ntheir businesses and their investments. The best thing we could do to \nregenerate economic growth is to adopt broad-based tax and entitlement \nreform that would bring our government books into balance and give \nAmerican businesses and investors a sense of certainty about the \neconomic environment in which they will be living for years to come. \nThe Buffett rule, on the other hand, targets a particular kind of \neconomic activity--capital investments--which are what America's \neconomy and people urgently need now. And that is why I would have \nvoted against the Buffett rule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2314-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I will be closing the Senate very \nshortly, but before I do I want to say a few words about a topic that \ncame up today. Obviously, I was pleased that a majority of the Senate, \nindeed a bipartisan majority of the Senate, has just voted to eliminate \nan unfortunate gimmick in the Tax Code that allows people who make \nnorth of a quarter of a billion dollars a year to pay lower tax rates \nthan a Providence, RI truckdriver pays if he is single. I think that is \npretty hard to justify, frankly. I think a lot of Americans spent last \nweek preparing their taxes and having heard from Warren Buffett who 1 \nyear paid an 11-percent all-in Federal tax rate, a rate obviously \nhigher than his secretary paid, something Mr. Buffett himself has \ncomplained about, there is a pretty wide sense that the American Tax \nCode serves special interests and people who have phenomenal amounts of \nwealth much better than it serves regular middle-class taxpayers.\n  That is particularly true if you avoid doing what my Republican \ncolleagues have done, which is focus on the most progressive part of \nthe Tax Code, the income tax part, and ignore the most regressive part \nof the Tax Code which hits the working families the hardest, which is \npayroll taxes. Almost everything they will say about the American Tax \nCode conveniently omits the taxes that most Americans pay--more \nAmericans pay than the income tax, frankly.\n  But we had a good discussion on that subject. I think because it was \nso difficult for so many of my colleagues to come out in favor of an \nupside-down tax situation in which somebody making a quarter of a \nbillion dollars pays a lower rate than somebody making $100,000 or \n$90,000, other topics were brought up. We kind of had a march through \nall the topics one could think of. One of them, very central to all of \nus here in the Senate today, is jobs, and it was pointed out that the \ntax fairness bill is not a jobs bill. Of course it would be if you took \nthe $47 billion to $162 billion in revenue it creates and put it toward \ninfrastructure. Then it would create literally hundreds of thousands of \njobs. But because it does not define where the revenue is going to go I \ncannot say it is a jobs bill. It is a tax fairness bill. That was its \nintention.\n  But we do have a jobs bill here in Congress. We have a very \nsignificant jobs bill. We have a highway transportation bill. The \nPresiding Officer serves with me on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and knows how hard we worked to get that bill through the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. It is exactly the kind of bill \nthat people from outside of Washington, looking in at Washington, want \nto see us do. You had a chairman on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Barbara Boxer of California, and a ranking member on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, who \nare from about as polar opposite political points of view as they could \nbe, but they found a way to come together on this bill. They worked \nwith all of us on the committee. As a result the bill passed out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee unanimously, every Republican \nand every Democrat.\n  Then it came to the floor, and there are complaints from time to time \naround here that stuff gets jammed on the floor and there is not enough \nof an open amendment process. There were 5 weeks of debate and \namendment of this bill on the Senate floor. I think 41 amendments were \nadded to the bill, either by vote or by agreement during the course of \nthat--Republican amendments, Democratic amendments. When the dust \nsettled on the whole process and everybody had their say and everybody \nhad their votes and all the amendments that could be considered were \nconsidered, we voted on it and 75 Senators either voted for it or were \nout of town and have said that they would have voted for it had they \nbeen here. So you had an effective vote of 75, I think, to 22. By our \nstandard here that is a colossal bipartisan landslide.\n  The bill itself was supported by everybody from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce--which is probably the most active Republican lobbying and \npolitical organization in the country--to environmental groups, to the \nlabor unions. This is a bill that everybody supports. From a jobs point \nof view it is 2.9 million jobs. It is 9,000 jobs in my home State of \nRhode Island. This is a big deal.\n  The bill was sent over to the other side of the Capitol and there it \nsits. The Speaker will not take it up. What I hear is because he does \nnot want to count on Democratic votes. To somebody who wants a job or \nwho wants a cousin or a sister to have a job--to be out working, \nrebuilding roads, rebuilding bridges, rebuilding highways, rebuilding \nour national infrastructure--it is pretty hard to explain why you would \nwalk away from a bill that creates 3 million jobs, a bill that is \nbipartisan, that went through a full process in the Senate, when they \nhave no bill whatsoever of their own, and do so because they do not \nwant to use Democratic votes. That is sort of the ultimate Washington \ninsider reason for not doing something important for the country.\n  When we talk about jobs in the Senate, until we get action in the \nHouse that creates a real bill, I don't think we should be getting any \nlectures about jobs from our Republican colleagues. I am told that the \nHouse is passing another extension. As the Presiding Officer knows, \nthese extensions cost a ton in the way of jobs. It has been estimated \nby our Director of Transportation that it would be a thousand jobs lost \nin Rhode Island from the extension we have already agreed to through \nthe end of June. If we pass that through the end of September, there \ngoes the entire building season. That is going to hurt.\n  I spent time in Rhode Island when we were home over the recess period \nwith the Director of Transportation, who is a very able Director. He \nhas worked under Republican and now Independent Governors. He describes \nthat they have a list this long of projects that they\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\nwant to get done this summer, in the building season, but if they do \nnot know until July what the funding is going to be, he said, I have to \ndrop a lot of those projects off the bottom. When I do that, that is a \nlot of jobs. It is unnecessary. We could be passing this bipartisan \nSenate bill through the House very quickly. Democrats would vote for \nit. Many Republicans would vote for it. All those jobs would be able to \nstart up right away. If we extend it further into September, that makes \nit even worse. So it is urgent that we not continue down a path of \ndelay and delay of the bill.\n  It is not only me saying this. The folks at Standard & Poor's have \ncome out with a report that is entitled ``Increasingly Unpredictable \nFederal Funding Could Stall U.S. Transportation Infrastructure \nProjects.'' They point out that:\n\n       As the construction season begins in the northern half of \n     the country, this continuing uncertainty in funding could \n     force states to delay projects rather than risk funding \n     changes or political gridlock come July.\n\n  That is exactly what Director Lewis told me, that simply the \nuncertainty will move jobs off the list that can be done in this \nconstruction season. The report continues that `` . . . the political \ngridlock in Washington, DC''--i.e. the Speaker being unwilling to call \nup a bipartisan, 75 to 22, Senate bill with Democratic and Republican \namendments, everybody supporting it, unwilling to call that up because \nhe doesn't want to have to rely on Democratic votes, that is political \ngridlock for sure--``and the doubts surrounding federal funding are \nmaking it difficult for issuers throughout the infrastructure sector to \ndefine long-term plans for funding necessary capital projects.''\n  Then this report goes on to say:\n\n       Once a long-term authorization is approved, we believe it \n     will provide an impetus for transportation agencies to \n     reconsider high priority projects that have been shelved \n     because of lack of funds, but if the authorization is \n     extended by even more continuing resolutions, such high \n     priority projects will remain in limbo.\n\n  Jobs are at stake. It is a multimillion-jobs bill. It is sitting over \nthere, not because of any problem they have with the bill per se. They \ndon't have a bill of their own. They don't have anything they prefer. I \nhear they are going to send over another extension to September--\narguably, if I hear correctly, with some politically very contentious \nissues attached, which makes it even more difficult. Remember, this was \na bipartisan bill here on the Senate side. That is where we are stuck.\n\n  So I wished to take the time this evening to urge my colleagues on \nthe Republican side of the aisle to use whatever powers they have of \nconversation or persuasion to get the House to call up the bill. If we \nhave to get this bill over, the alternative is, if it is only another \nextension, that is going to cost--I don't know--another 1,000 jobs in \nRhode Island. We need to make sure we have a bill that will take us to \nconference and that we get to conference as quickly as possible. Once \nwe are in conference, we need to pass a real authorization that avoids \nthese problems as quickly as possible. The American people expect no \nless.\n  It is not rocket science to pass a transportation bill. Congress has \nbeen doing this since the days when President Eisenhower established \nthe Federal highway program. If we cannot get this done, what does that \nsay about our prospects of doing something complicated, such as \ncybersecurity or other issues we will have to face? This should be a \nslam dunk, particularly with a bipartisan bill that everybody supports \nthat came through the Senate after such a clear, transparent, rigorous, \nand open process. I will end my remarks there.\n\n\n                         Arts Advocacy Day 2012\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, at a recent HELP Committee hearing on \neducation and the economy, representatives of the business community \ntold us that it is not enough for our education system to produce \ngraduates who can read, write, and do math. Employers need workers who \ncan apply creativity, collaboration, and communication in their jobs to \nsolve problems, produce ideas and make connections. These are the keys \nto innovation and success in the knowledge economy of the 21st century. \nIndeed, they are essential if we are to move our economy forward, \ncreate jobs, and ensure our national security. But I ask you, How can \nwe produce graduates who are creative and collaborative if we don't \nvalue the arts in our society and teach it in our schools?\n  Today is Arts Advocacy Day. Advocates for the arts have come to \nWashington to remind their elected officials about the importance of \nFederal investments in the arts. Why investment at the Federal level? \nBecause arts are essential to the fabric of our society. Arts education \nteaches critical skills--not just creativity, but also a rigorous and \npractical application of other skills. The arts make us think. The arts \nimprove our quality of life. The arts provide an outlet for personal \nand political expression. Collectively, our arts express who we are as \na nation. This very building, the United States Capitol, an enduring \nsymbol of freedom and democracy, is an especially powerful example. \nFederal funds built this building. Federal funds also support vital \nprograms such as the Iowa Arts Council Big Yellow School Bus grants, to \npay the costs of busing students to museums or live orchestra concerts. \nFor many students, this is the only opportunity they have to experience \nthe arts.\n  It is imperative that we continue to promote a society where all \ncitizens are exposed to the arts and where all students--no matter \ntheir socioeconomic background, community, family, or ability--have \nequitable access to a high-quality, public, well-rounded education that \nincludes the arts.\n  Unfortunately, recent data from the Department of Education show that \ninequities persist. Schools serving the poorest students are less \nlikely to offer instruction in the arts. For example, availability of \nmusic instruction in secondary schools on average has remained at about \n90 percent for the last 10 years. Meanwhile, it has actually decreased, \nfrom 100 percent to 81 percent for schools with the highest poverty \nconcentration--a 19 percentage point decrease.\n  We all want our kids to succeed in school, and to be inspired in \nschool. Many students find the motivation to learn through \nparticipation in the visual arts, drama, band, orchestra, choir, or \ndance. Every child should have the opportunity to do something that \ninspires and excites them, that teaches them creativity, collaboration, \nand communication, no matter their socio-economic status, their \nneighborhood, their local tax base. Research has shown that arts \neducation improves not only children's creativity, but also their \nability to learn and be productive in school, as well as their self-\nconfidence and social skills.\n  Christine Dunn, a music teacher at Harlan Community Elementary School \nin Harlan, IA, wrote me a letter urging me to continue my support for \nthe arts. She told me that without the arts, ``our students may never \nbe able to see, understand or express feelings, thoughts and ideas \nfully. I try to imagine a world without the arts and it looks very \nbleak. The arts give us creativity and the freedom to be ourselves.''\n  Today on the occasion of Arts Advocacy Day, I would like to recognize \nthe outstanding advocacy of Iowans like Ms. Dunn, Barry Griswell, and \nSuku Radia--and the wonderful contributions that Iowans have made to \nthe arts throughout our nation's history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2315-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2315-S2316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT CHARLES ROBERT `BOB' STOKES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished veteran of our Nation's great Armed Forces, Master \nSergeant Charles Robert ``Bob'' Stokes of East Bernstadt, KY. MSG \nStokes enlisted in the United States Air Force on June 6, 1955. He had \njust graduated from London High School the week before; he was 18 years \nold.\n  There was a wide variety of disciplines Bob could have entered within \nthe Air Force. He prayed all throughout his basic training for God to \nput him in the field he would be best suited to. Being the son of a \nmechanic, he possessed natural tendencies to fix things, and had worked \non machinery previously in his life. So after much praying, Bob was \nassigned to be an aircraft mechanic, an act he later would refer to as \na ``divine intervention.''\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\n  Stokes had never traveled much before the service, but he soon found \nhimself stationed all around the country at Air Force bases in \nMissouri, Arkansas, and Puerto Rico, to name a few. Stokes eventually \nlanded a spot on the presidential squadron put in charge of the famous \npresidential aircraft, Air Force One. He was part of that outfit \nthroughout the administrations of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and \nGerald Ford.\n  Stokes's career in the Air Force continued to prove fortuitous. He \nsaw the world through the window of Air Force One, visiting places that \nhe had dreamed of seeing his entire life. He witnessed monumental \nhistoric events, like Nixon's resignation, from an arm's length away. \nHe executed his job superbly, ensuring the President would always \narrive safely on the ground. And finally, Bob received the greatest \nbenefit he would ever come across while running the presidential \nsquadron, meeting his wife Varlene. She too was serving on Andrews AFB \nat the time.\n  Bob and Varlene retired to East Bernstadt in 1976, where they reside \nto this day. The two have three children--Robert Jr., Tricia, and Ward, \nall of whom appreciate the dedication their mother and father have \nshown to our great Nation throughout the years.\n  Mr. President, in November 2011 there was an article published in \nLaurel County, Kentucky's local periodical magazine, the Sentinel Echo: \nSilver Edition. The article noted the accomplishments of Mr. Stokes \nthroughout his many years of service in the United States Air Force.\n  At this time, Mr. President, it is my wish that my colleagues in the \nUnited States Senate join me in honoring Master Sergeant Charles Robert \nStokes for his dedication to our great country; and I ask unanimous \nconsent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]\n\n                         History in the Making\n\n                          (By Carrie Dillard)\n\n       When retired Master Sergeant Charles Robert ``Bob'' Stokes \n     was in basic training at Sampson Air Force Base, N.Y., \n     waiting to speak to a counselor about which career field he \n     would be best suited for, he prayed.\n       Having enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, Stokes knew he \n     couldn't be a cook--he can't cook, he said, but he likes to \n     eat. He didn't want to be an air policeman either. But he had \n     a mechanical background, came by it honest from his father. \n     ``It was in my blood,'' he said.\n       So when only two men in his class were assigned to be in \n     aircraft mechanics, Stokes called it divine intervention--a \n     guiding hand that led him into the company of presidents, and \n     ultimately to meet his wife.\n       Stokes graduated from London High School on May 28, 1955. \n     He went into the service on June 6.\n       ``I didn't have a summer vacation that year,'' he said. But \n     he would get to see and experience many places in the United \n     States and around the world that he had never dreamed of \n     visiting.\n       For a small town boy from Laurel County, New York was quite \n     a culture shock.\n       ``How green I was,'' he said. ``I'd never even seen a pizza \n     in my life, never tasted one until I went to New York. It \n     looked terrible.''\n       But Stokes changed his mind about the pizza, and adapted to \n     his new surroundings, albeit with a lot of homesickness. He \n     completed aircraft and engine school in Amarillo, Texas, and \n     was then stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo.\n       ``I was a homesick boy,'' Stokes said. ``I don't think I'd \n     been any place other than Ohio and Tennessee before that, \n     besides Kentucky.''\n       At 18 years old, he was the youngest crew chief, or \n     ``glorified mechanic,'' at Whiteman AFB, maintaining B 47s. \n     He'd later be stationed in Arkansas, Puerto Rico, and back to \n     Missouri again, where he received orders to deploy to Guam.\n       Stokes was aboard B 52s, flying combat missions over \n     Vietnam. As a crew chief, Stokes would fly beside the pilot.\n       ``I supposed it made the pilot feel better knowing there \n     was someone beside him who knew how to fix the plane,'' he \n     said.\n       As the person who made sure the craft was ``airworthy'' by \n     keeping it properly maintained and fueled up, it was rare for \n     Stokes not to feel confident in an airplane. He said there \n     was only one time when he felt like he might perish in one. \n     It was during his time at Andrews Air Force Base.\n       Stokes was stationed at Andrews AFB during the \n     administrations of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald \n     Ford. He saw the world through the window of Air Force One, \n     as a crew chief on the presidential squadron.\n       The presidential outfit was made up of 30 to 40 planes to \n     be used by anyone from the president or vice president to \n     cabinet officials. There were smaller jets used to shuttle \n     dignitaries between Andrews AFB and Camp David, and Marine \n     helicopters to fly the president back and forth between the \n     White House and Andrews. Stokes was assigned to a VC 135, a \n     plush plane strictly for VIP travel.\n       As a man who loves to study history, the 74-year-old \n     realizes now, more than ever, that he had a ``window'' into \n     American and world history.\n       ``I saw history,'' he said. ``The poor people's march on \n     Washington, riots of the 1960s, Watergate.''\n       He remembers the day Nixon returned from a diplomatic trip \n     to China. It was the first time a U.S. president had visited \n     the People's Republic of China, strongly considered an \n     adversary at the time.\n       ``It [the trip] was very hush-hush,'' said Stokes. ``But \n     when he came back, they let all the Air Force personnel and \n     their families know about it. We gathered around the hangar \n     as he taxied into the hangar.''\n       He also remembers the day Nixon resigned. Actually, he saw \n     him leave.\n       ``When Nixon left, he got on a plane to California,'' \n     Stokes said. ``We liked Nixon. But he got involved in that \n     Watergate.''\n       On the flight where he thought he might perish, the \n     presidential squadron had flown a delegation to a state \n     funeral in Brazil. While it was standard to fly with enough \n     fuel to make a landing at nearby alternate locations, the \n     plane was nearly to their destination when they discovered \n     the airport had closed. Low visibility and haze kept the \n     plane from landing in Brazil, and they burned up most of the \n     fuel circling the runway.\n       ``I was sweating bullets. It was the closest I've ever come \n     to losing my life in an aircraft.''\n       Truth be told, Stokes didn't want to go to Andrews AFB in \n     1967 when he was selected.\n       ``I tried to get out of it, Stokes said. ``I was on B 52s, \n     in combat, making combat pay, I was staff sergeant. I was \n     living pretty good.''\n       Andrews AFB had the safest flight record and highest \n     standard of excellence in maintenance. ``If you were \n     selected, you were the cream of the crop. You had to be good \n     or you wouldn't last,'' Stokes said.\n       But at the time, he didn't know what Andrews was all about; \n     he didn't even know what he'd been selected for.\n       Upon arrival at Andrews AFB, SSG Stokes was escorted into \n     the hangar bay by a master sergeant. Another master sergeant, \n     at the time, was taking out the trash.\n       ``I thought it was unusual to see a master sergeant doing \n     this type of work, and what are they going to be having me, \n     the staff sergeant, doing, scrubbing toilets,'' he said.\n       ``But that's just the way it was. The master sergeant \n     (escorting me) told me `every man on crew takes a turn at \n     hangar detail.' '' And they did.\n       ``We'd sweep and mop that hangar floor. You could eat off \n     it. I'd wax and polish the airplanes. Nobody was scared to \n     work.''\n       Besides, it had to be perfect. It was the home of the Air \n     Force One, and Stokes had just made presidential squadron.\n       ``When we were overseas, nobody would touch that airplane \n     but me,'' Stokes said. ``I'd check the oil, pre-flight and \n     post-flight and put it to bed.''\n       Upon landing anywhere in the world, Stokes would service \n     the plane, fuel it up and make sure it was ready to go for \n     the return trip. He was the last person to see and touch the \n     plane before guards were stationed around the plane--inside \n     the hangar and outside the hangar. No other soul was getting \n     near it.\n       It's why one night when Stokes got a call that he needed to \n     check the plane due to a bomb threat, he said ``no way.'' He \n     was confident how he'd left the plane.\n       ``I said no way,'' he said. ``But we had to inspect it. I \n     went over it from top to bottom, couldn't find anything.''\n       But tensions were high then. Not long after the alleged \n     bomb threat, they heard word there'd been an attack on the \n     Vice President's (Spiro Agnew) motorcade in Dallas, Texas. \n     However, it wasn't a sniper, but heat, that had made the back \n     window shatter on the car.\n       Stokes met his wife, Varlene, while serving at Andrews AFB. \n     She was working for the Department of Agriculture at the \n     time. The two met at a cookout hosted by a mutual friend.\n       Although Stokes claimed he was a ``confirmed bachelor'' at \n     the age of 31, he said Varlene ``changed his mind.'' They \n     were married in October 1968.\n       ``The best thing that ever happened to me was meeting \n     her,'' he said.\n       The couple raised three children--Robert Jr., Tricia, and \n     Ward. After every trip, Stokes would bring home a boon for \n     his young family. A spoon for Bobby, a doll for Tricia, and \n     foreign coins for his wife, Varlene, although he wasn't \n     actually supposed to keep the coins. ``We were supposed to \n     turn them in before we left the country,'' he said. The \n     Stokes's third child, Ward, wouldn't come along until after \n     he left Andrews AFB, missing out on the collections.\n       The couple retired to East Bernstadt in 1976, where they \n     still live today.\n       ``The more you look back on it, I'm just blessed,'' Stokes \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2315-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2315-S2316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT CHARLES ROBERT `BOB' STOKES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

He \n     completed aircraft and engine school in Amarillo, Texas, and \n     was then stationed at Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo.\n       ``I was a homesick boy,'' Stokes said. ``I don't think I'd \n     been any place other than Ohio and Tennessee before that, \n     besides Kentucky.''\n       At 18 years old, he was the youngest crew chief, or \n     ``glorified mechanic,'' at Whiteman AFB, maintaining B 47s. \n     He'd later be stationed in Arkansas, Puerto Rico, and back to \n     Missouri again, where he received orders to deploy to Guam.\n       Stokes was aboard B 52s, flying combat missions over \n     Vietnam. As a crew chief, Stokes would fly beside the pilot.\n       ``I supposed it made the pilot feel better knowing there \n     was someone beside him who knew how to fix the plane,'' he \n     said.\n       As the person who made sure the craft was ``airworthy'' by \n     keeping it properly maintained and fueled up, it was rare for \n     Stokes not to feel confident in an airplane. He said there \n     was only one time when he felt like he might perish in one. \n     It was during his time at Andrews Air Force Base.\n       Stokes was stationed at Andrews AFB during the \n     administrations of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald \n     Ford. He saw the world through the window of Air Force One, \n     as a crew chief on the presidential squadron.\n       The presidential outfit was made up of 30 to 40 planes to \n     be used by anyone from the president or vice president to \n     cabinet officials. There were smaller jets used to shuttle \n     dignitaries between Andrews AFB and Camp David, and Marine \n     helicopters to fly the president back and forth between the \n     White House and Andrews. Stokes was assigned to a VC 135, a \n     plush plane strictly for VIP travel.\n       As a man who loves to study history, the 74-year-old \n     realizes now, more than ever, that he had a ``window'' into \n     American and world history.\n       ``I saw history,'' he said. ``The poor people's march on \n     Washington, riots of the 1960s, Watergate.''\n       He remembers the day Nixon returned from a diplomatic trip \n     to China. It was the first time a U.S. president had visited \n     the People's Republic of China, strongly considered an \n     adversary at the time.\n       ``It [the trip] was very hush-hush,'' said Stokes. ``But \n     when he came back, they let all the Air Force personnel and \n     their families know about it. We gathered around the hangar \n     as he taxied into the hangar.''\n       He also remembers the day Nixon resigned. Actually, he saw \n     him leave.\n       ``When Nixon left, he got on a plane to California,'' \n     Stokes said. ``We liked Nixon. But he got involved in that \n     Watergate.''\n       On the flight where he thought he might perish, the \n     presidential squadron had flown a delegation to a state \n     funeral in Brazil. While it was standard to fly with enough \n     fuel to make a landing at nearby alternate locations, the \n     plane was nearly to their destination when they discovered \n     the airport had closed. Low visibility and haze kept the \n     plane from landing in Brazil, and they burned up most of the \n     fuel circling the runway.\n       ``I was sweating bullets. It was the closest I've ever come \n     to losing my life in an aircraft.''\n       Truth be told, Stokes didn't want to go to Andrews AFB in \n     1967 when he was selected.\n       ``I tried to get out of it, Stokes said. ``I was on B 52s, \n     in combat, making combat pay, I was staff sergeant. I was \n     living pretty good.''\n       Andrews AFB had the safest flight record and highest \n     standard of excellence in maintenance. ``If you were \n     selected, you were the cream of the crop. You had to be good \n     or you wouldn't last,'' Stokes said.\n       But at the time, he didn't know what Andrews was all about; \n     he didn't even know what he'd been selected for.\n       Upon arrival at Andrews AFB, SSG Stokes was escorted into \n     the hangar bay by a master sergeant. Another master sergeant, \n     at the time, was taking out the trash.\n       ``I thought it was unusual to see a master sergeant doing \n     this type of work, and what are they going to be having me, \n     the staff sergeant, doing, scrubbing toilets,'' he said.\n       ``But that's just the way it was. The master sergeant \n     (escorting me) told me `every man on crew takes a turn at \n     hangar detail.' '' And they did.\n       ``We'd sweep and mop that hangar floor. You could eat off \n     it. I'd wax and polish the airplanes. Nobody was scared to \n     work.''\n       Besides, it had to be perfect. It was the home of the Air \n     Force One, and Stokes had just made presidential squadron.\n       ``When we were overseas, nobody would touch that airplane \n     but me,'' Stokes said. ``I'd check the oil, pre-flight and \n     post-flight and put it to bed.''\n       Upon landing anywhere in the world, Stokes would service \n     the plane, fuel it up and make sure it was ready to go for \n     the return trip. He was the last person to see and touch the \n     plane before guards were stationed around the plane--inside \n     the hangar and outside the hangar. No other soul was getting \n     near it.\n       It's why one night when Stokes got a call that he needed to \n     check the plane due to a bomb threat, he said ``no way.'' He \n     was confident how he'd left the plane.\n       ``I said no way,'' he said. ``But we had to inspect it. I \n     went over it from top to bottom, couldn't find anything.''\n       But tensions were high then. Not long after the alleged \n     bomb threat, they heard word there'd been an attack on the \n     Vice President's (Spiro Agnew) motorcade in Dallas, Texas. \n     However, it wasn't a sniper, but heat, that had made the back \n     window shatter on the car.\n       Stokes met his wife, Varlene, while serving at Andrews AFB. \n     She was working for the Department of Agriculture at the \n     time. The two met at a cookout hosted by a mutual friend.\n       Although Stokes claimed he was a ``confirmed bachelor'' at \n     the age of 31, he said Varlene ``changed his mind.'' They \n     were married in October 1968.\n       ``The best thing that ever happened to me was meeting \n     her,'' he said.\n       The couple raised three children--Robert Jr., Tricia, and \n     Ward. After every trip, Stokes would bring home a boon for \n     his young family. A spoon for Bobby, a doll for Tricia, and \n     foreign coins for his wife, Varlene, although he wasn't \n     actually supposed to keep the coins. ``We were supposed to \n     turn them in before we left the country,'' he said. The \n     Stokes's third child, Ward, wouldn't come along until after \n     he left Andrews AFB, missing out on the collections.\n       The couple retired to East Bernstadt in 1976, where they \n     still live today.\n       ``The more you look back on it, I'm just blessed,'' Stokes \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2316-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2316-S2318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MR. MARTIN YOUNG\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a devoted and \nloyal serviceman from the United\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\nState Navy: Mr. Martin Young of London, KY. Martin enlisted in the Navy \non September 22, 1942, when he was 19 years old. His brother was in the \nArmy, so Martin decided to go a different route. He knew that he would \nhave to leave home, but what he didn't know is that he was going to \nexplore a variety of foreign locales and cross the Atlantic Ocean 14 \ntimes.\n  Up until his enlistment in the Navy, Martin had lived in Perry \nCounty, KY, his entire life. He was first sent to basic training at \nGreat Lakes Training Center in Illinois. After basic training, Mr. \nYoung decided he would attend gunnery school in San Francisco Bay, CA.\n  After his 6-week stint in gunnery school, Martin was finally prepared \nto take to the high seas. He was assigned to the Joseph Gale, a supply \nship that carried ammunition and supplies as well as airplanes. During \nhis first deployment on a ship, Mr. Young remembers that he didn't see \nland for 32 long days.\n  While aboard the Joseph Gale, Mr. Young traveled through New Guinea \nand the Loyalty Islands in the South Pacific; Tocapilla, Chili in South \nAmerica; the West Indies; and Cuba, all before an emergency port in St. \nAlbans, NY. The ship's bow was badly damaged by a torpedo from a German \nsubmarine and the crew had no choice but to stop for repairs on dry \nland.\n  Once in New York, Mr. Young returned to work on the tanker SS \nManassas, a ship that hauled fuel to England. He would go on to make \nthe journey 14 times while serving on that ship. Looking back, Mr. \nYoung remembers the tension amidst the crew on the Manassas during the \nFrench Invasion. Although not involved in the attack, the ship was in \nthe English Channel, and all members had to constantly be on alert, \nready at a moment's notice to enter the fight.\n  Once Mr. Young returned to the States, he was given a 32-day furlough \nin which he and some Navy buddies hitchhiked from San Francisco to St. \nLouis before finally taking a bus to his eastern Kentucky home. During \nhis leave the war ended, and Mr. Young returned to the Navy without the \nthreat of combat looming over him.\n  Although the war was over, Mr. Young still had time in the Navy to \ncomplete, so when he heard about an opening in the Naval Barber Shop, \nhe applied. He got the job, and cut hair during the days while \nattending barber school in the evenings. He enjoyed it so much that \nwhen he returned to Perry County on August 8, 1946, he continued to \nwield the scissors in the Commonwealth.\n  The Navy offered Martin Young the journey of a lifetime. He traveled \naround the world more than once and had the opportunity to port in \nbreathtaking and beautiful locations on several continents.\n  Now retired, Martin Young enjoys the finer things in life, such as \nspending time with his children, grandchildren, and great-\ngrandchildren. Although he has retired from cutting hair, he still uses \nhis hands to make woodcrafts and play several different musical \ninstruments. While Martin would probably say the Navy has given him so \nmuch, today I wish to recognize him and say that it is he who has given \nus so much. Martin Young's service to his country during World War II \nis something that each and every American to this day should be truly \ngrateful for.\n  An article was recently published in London, KY's local newspaper \nmagazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition. The article highlighted \nthe many achievements made by Martin Young throughout his eventful \nlifetime.\n  At this time, I wish to invite my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to \njoin me in commemorating Mr. Martin Young and his dedication to our \ngreat Nation, and I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]\n\n                         Back on His Home Land\n\n                            (By Sue Minton)\n\n       Martin Young, 89, a member of what has become known as \n     ``America's Greatest Generation,'' enlisted in the Navy on \n     Sept. 22, 1942. In the Spring of '42, Young graduated from \n     high school, and that fall the 19-year-old ventured forth on \n     a journey that would take him across the Atlantic 14 times.\n       He traveled from his home in Perry County to Louisville to \n     be processed, examined and sworn in. ``My brother was in the \n     Army, so I decided on the Navy,'' Young said.\n       Following basic training at Great Lakes Training Center in \n     Illinois, Young chose gunnery school over submarine duty and \n     was transferred to Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay, \n     Calif. ``We trained on three guns, the 20-millimeter, 5-inch \n     38, and 3-inch 50.'' After completing six weeks of gunnery \n     school, Young was assigned to U.S. Navy Gunner Armed Guard \n     Unit.\n       After the gun crew assignment, Young and his comrades \n     departed for Portland, Ore., to begin their first sea duty. \n     They boarded the Joseph Gale, a supply ship that carried a \n     cargo of ammunition and supplies as well as airplanes. This \n     voyage also included a training trip along the west coast, \n     down to San Francisco and then across the Pacific Ocean. \n     ``For 32 days I did not see land,'' Young recalls.\n       I wanted to be out there,'' Young said. ``But I got seasick \n     on the first ship.'' He remembers a gunner mate telling him \n     he had a sure cure for seasickness. ``They called us all \n     Mack,'' he said. ``He said to me, `Mack, go lay down under a \n     big shade tree,' but where would you find a shade tree out in \n     the ocean?''\n       The Joseph Gale and crew members sailed to the South \n     Pacific and dropped off supplies at various ports New \n     Caledonia, Loyalty Islands, Solomon Island, and New Guinea.\n       After crossing the Pacific, Young and his shipmates \n     returned to South America Antofagasta and Tocopilla, Chili,'' \n     he said.\n       From South America, the crew sailed back to the States, \n     docking in Charleston, S.C. There they boarded a destroyer \n     escort also used to transport supplies.\n       For a short time the crew sailed the waves of the Caribbean \n     Sea. ``The Caribbean Sea was a hot spot, a lot of ships were \n     sunk there,'' Young recalled.\n       While in the Caribbean, the bow of Young's ship was \n     severely damaged by a torpedo from a German submarine. The \n     sailors abandoned the ship and the wounded were sent to Cuba, \n     Young among them. After arriving in Cuba, the wounded boarded \n     the SS Shiloh en route to the U.S. Navy Hospital in St. \n     Albans, N.Y. Seaman Young remained at the hospital for two \n     months recovering from his injuries and surgery.\n       Young returned to duty on the tanker SS Manassas hauling \n     fuel to England. This ship made seven trips from New York to \n     England (14 trips across the Atlantic). ``We also hauled \n     gasoline from Port Arthur, Texas,'' Young said. ``We would \n     sail up the coast and join a convoy, maybe 60 ships. Several \n     ships were sunk by German submarines during the seven \n     crossings.''\n       The Manassas was rammed by an Allied vessel in the English \n     Channel and was docked at Belfast, Ireland, a short time for \n     repairs. ``While the ship was docked for repairs, we still \n     carried on with our duties,'' Young said. ``This was just \n     before the invasion of France, and the crew had to be alert \n     at all times.''\n       Young recalls being in the English Channel after the \n     invasion of France and once again was transferred to a supply \n     ship, the SS Willard Gibbs. ``This time we took supplies and \n     ammo to Omaha Beach,'' he said.\n       The Willard Gibbs could not get near the beach, so supplies \n     were loaded onto barges and transported to the beach. \n     ``During the unloading of the ship, the crew members went \n     ashore and walked on Omaha Beach,'' Young said. ``This was \n     about a month after the invasion.''\n       Once more Young's ship returned to New York, reloaded with \n     supplies, and returned through the Panama Canal across the \n     Pacific Ocean to the Philippine Islands Leyte, Luzon and \n     Samar as well as the Mariana Islands, Caroline Island, and \n     several others.\n       This passage was to be Young's last ocean voyage. When he \n     arrived back in Los Angeles aboard the SS Willard Gibbs, he \n     received 32 days travel time to return to New York.\n       Instead of taking a bus to the east coast, Young and three \n     crew members hitchhiked. ``We were on Old Highway 66, and we \n     got a ride with one fellow all the way to St. Louis,'' he \n     said. ``It took us three days and nights, and at St. Louis we \n     split up, got bus tickets and headed home.''\n       After a short furlough at his home in Perry County, Young \n     went back to New York. But during his 32 days travel time, \n     the war ended.\n       After his furlough was over, Young reported to Lido Beach, \n     Long Island, New York, where he was told there was a \n     possibility he would not have to go back out to sea but would \n     have shore duty. The New York base was turned into a USN \n     Personnel Separation Center, and Young remained on land.\n       While Young was finishing his tour of duty in New York, he \n     attended barber school. ``An announcement came over the \n     loudspeakers that barbers were needed for 12 chairs at the \n     Navy barber shop, and I applied,'' Young stated. ``On the \n     ships, we didn't have any barbers so we cut each other's \n     hair. I enjoyed it.'' While working mornings in the barber \n     shop, Young attended barber school in the afternoons and \n     evenings.\n       On Aug. 8, 1946, just a few weeks short of four years since \n     his enlistment, Young was discharged from the U.S. Navy. He \n     returned to his native eastern Kentucky home, went to \n     Frankfort, took and successfully passed the State Barber \n     Board examination, and received his barber's license.\n       While serving in the U.S. Navy, Young received several \n     medals the Good Conduct\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\n     Medal, the American Theater Medal, the European Theater \n     Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Medal, the Philippine Liberation \n     Medal, and the Victory Medal.\n       Three years after being discharged, he married Lela Baker \n     of Hazard, and for 20 years he lived and cut hair in his \n     hometown.\n       In 1965, Young, his wife, Lela, and two children, David and \n     Judy, moved to the Sublimity area of Laurel County. In 1995, \n     his wife passed away, and today Young's family includes son \n     David and wife, Lillie; daughter, Judy Smith and husband, \n     G.J.; three grandchildren, David Ryan Young, Cameron Justin \n     Smith, and Trey Jordan Smith; and one great-grandson, David \n     Rylan Young.\n       Young retired from the swivel chair and scissors several \n     years ago, but his hands do not remain idle he makes wood-\n     crafted items and plays several musical instruments. This \n     talent got him an appearance in 1947 on the first official \n     broadcast of the Hazard radio station.\n       Today, not in good health, like most World War II veterans, \n     Young spends his days reminiscing and visiting with family \n     and friends who stop by Laurel Heights Home for the Elderly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2318-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT MICAH B. MASON AND PRIVATE FIRST CLASS MICAH \n                                J. MASON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a father \nand son who are bravely serving in our Armed Forces simultaneously: MSG \nMicah B. Mason and his son, PFC Micah J. Mason, both of London, KY. \nMaster Sergeant Mason has served in the National Guard for 28 years. He \nnow has had the opportunity to see his son, Private First Class Mason, \nlearn, work, and grow in the same organization that the elder Mason \nbegan his career in almost three decades ago.\n  Not only are the Mason men both involved in the same service branch, \nthey also served on the same mission, in the same truck. Master \nSergeant Mason was excited to be given the opportunity to work \nalongside his son in ``real world'' missions. He feels that he is lucky \nto be able to experience a work environment firsthand with his son in a \nway very few parents get the chance to do.\n  Private First Class Mason is excited to be able to go on missions \nwith his father. The 22-year-old didn't know that his father was going \nto be on the same truck as him until the day they deployed. He is \noverjoyed to show his father the proficiency at which he does his job \non a day-to-day basis.\n  There is obviously a certain level of concern when deploying on a \nmission solo, and that level increases when there are not one but two \nmembers of the same family on a single mission. Nonetheless, the two \nhave expressed that at the end of the day, they are glad they have each \nother for support.\n  The resiliency and strength shown by these two individuals in such a \ntolling work environment is truly remarkable. With men like the Masons \nserving in our Armed Forces, we have little reason to doubt our \nmilitary's abilities. These men are true American heroes who have given \nmuch so that we may sleep soundly at night and know that our freedoms \nand liberties will always be protected.\n  Master Sergeant Mason and his son Private First Class Mason deserve a \ngreat deal of recognition, just as all those in military service do, \nfor what they have done to protect the citizens of their community, the \ngreat State of Kentucky, and our great country of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate to \njoin me in recognizing the hard work, dedication, and sacrifice of MSG \nMicah B. Mason and his son, PFC Micah J. Mason.\n  There was recently an article printed in Whitley County, Kentucky's \nlocal newspaper, The Times-Tribune, which highlighted the outstanding \nservice of this father and son duo who have so graciously contributed \nto our Nation's defense throughout the years. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                [From the Times-Tribune, Oct. 12, 2011]\n\n             Father and Son Team Up To Go Outside the Wire\n\n               (By Corbin, special to the Times-Tribune)\n\n       As soldiers complete their pre-mission checks and get \n     everything loaded for transport, it would seem the job of \n     escorting supply trucks from Joint Base Balad to Contingency \n     Operating Site Mosul is just another mission for the soldiers \n     of Delta Company, 1st Battalion, 149th Infantry Regiment, \n     77th Sustainment Brigade, 310th Expeditionary Sustainment \n     Command.\n       However, a rare occasion has been marked, not only in the \n     149th Infantry Regiment, but in the military as a whole. A \n     father and son are going out together on not only the same \n     mission, but in the same truck.\n       ``It's a unique experience for sure to actually be doing \n     real-world missions with your son as a gunner and seeing him \n     in that atmosphere,'' said Master Sgt. Micah B. Mason, an \n     assistant operations noncommissioned officer with \n     Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 149 Inf. Regt., a \n     native of London. ``It's something very few parents get to \n     do. I'm excited to actually go on a mission and experience it \n     first-hand with my son.\n       Master Sgt. Mason, 46, who served in the Guard for over 28 \n     years, usually watches convoy escort missions unfold as a \n     shift battle NCO in charge of the 149th Inf. Regt.'s tactical \n     operations center. However, the unit sent him on this mission \n     as part of their ongoing efforts to ensure everyone in the \n     tactical operations center is able to see what goes on first-\n     hand during the missions they monitor on a daily basis.\n       ``I have a lot of concerns . . . if something does happen \n     (on the mission),'' said Master Sgt. Mason. ``I'm glad I'm \n     there with him, though.''\n       Master Sgt. Mason said he's only told two people back home \n     about him and his son doing this mission together and that \n     ``they're just in awe.''\n       ``I didn't know he was going, 'til I saw him sitting out by \n     the trucks,'' said 22-year-old Pfc. Micah J. Mason, a gunner \n     with Delta Company, 1/149th Inf. Regt., also a native of \n     London. ``It just makes me happy to actually do something \n     with him, to let him see what I do on a day-to day basis.''\n       Pfc. Mason said he had been waiting to be able to go on a \n     mission with his father, as not many people can say that they \n     have done that. After the mission, Master Sgt. Mason had only \n     good things to say.\n       ``Things went very smooth,'' he said. ``The convoy escort \n     team knew their jobs very well and were professional every \n     step of the way.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to an \nexceptional veteran of the United States Navy who wore the uniform \nduring World War II, First Class Seaman James Francis of Laurel County, \nKY.\n  James was born in Monroe County, KY, in 1924. His family lived on a \nfarm where they raised just about everything they ate. The family moved \nto Indiana in 1937 when James' father got a job working for the \nrailroad. James was drafted into the Navy in 1941, on his 19th \nbirthday.\n  Although James never entered combat, he was an intricate part of the \nwar effort in the South Pacific. He was stationed on a Merchant Marine \nship that delivered ammunition to the soldiers who were on the front \nlines. After his time aboard ship, James spent 18 months in Hong Kong \ncutting hair at a G.I. barber shop. He was discharged in May 1946.\n  Mr. James Francis is most assuredly deserving of commemoration for \nthe sacrifices he made for each one of us and for our great Nation, as \nwell as his years of service to the betterment of his community and to \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  There was recently a feature article published in the Sentinel Echo: \nSilver Edition magazine in November 2011, highlighting the upstanding \nlegacy of Mr. James Francis and his commendable dedication to our \nNation's Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, it is my wish that my colleagues in the United States \nSenate join me in honoring the loyalty and bravery shown by Kentucky's \nown James Francis. And I ask unanimous consent that said article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                  [From the Sentinel Echo, Nov. 2011]\n\n                             Navy Supplier\n\n                            (By Carol Mills)\n\n       First Class Seaman James Francis was a Merchant Marine \n     during World War II.\n       In time of war, the Merchant Marine is an auxiliary to the \n     Navy and delivers troops and supplies for the military.\n       Francis went to Great Lakes Boot Camp in Illinois, near \n     North Chicago, and gunnery school in Gulf Port, Miss., and \n     then went to California and caught a ship.\n       ``We were shipped out,'' Francis said. ``I went to the \n     Philippines the first trip, came back to the States, and then \n     went to Australia and the South Pacific for six months\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\n     and then came back again. I served on a Merchant Marine ship. \n     We didn't do any fighting. We took a load of ammunition to \n     the Philippines, 150 tons, unloaded it, and the Japanese blew \n     it up that night. We took supplies to other countries, but I \n     can't remember. It's been 65 years since I got out. I stayed \n     in Hong Kong, China, cutting hair for 18 months in a G.I. \n     barber shop before I came home. I didn't have enough points \n     to get out (Navy).'' Navy training counts for retirement \n     points, so Francis decided to learn how to cut hair.\n       Besides ammunition, Francis also delivered airplane fuel to \n     the Philippines.\n       Francis was discharged in May 1946. His experience in the \n     Navy was all good.\n       ``There was no bad. I won't take nothing for what I seen \n     went on, but I wouldn't go do it again.''\n       Francis, 86, was born in Monroe County in 1924 to Herman \n     and Maye Francis. His father had a farm between Tomkinsville \n     and Mud Lick.\n       ``We raised about everything we ate,'' Francis said.\n       The family moved to Indiana in 1937, where his father got a \n     job working for the L Railroad.\n       When Francis was 19, he was drafted into the U.S. Navy on \n     Dec. 2, 1941, on his birthday. Two or three years after he \n     was discharged, he married Irene Barton when he was 27 or 28.\n       ``She was a Kentucky woman. I met her in Indiana,'' Francis \n     said. ``We moved back down here in 1966. She was born and \n     raised in Corbin. When she died, I married Lola Boggs. I've \n     been a widower for about two years now. When she (Lola) died, \n     I moved to Carnaby Square Apartments. I'm too old to get \n     married again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2319-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2319-S2320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM A. SANTOR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay tribute \nto a man who has been successful in serving his country, in his career, \nand in building longlasting relationships with family and friends, all \nbecause he has learned to incorporate his passion into all that he \ndoes: Mr. William ``Bill'' A. Santor of Lexington, KY.\n  Bill Santor lives on the Griffin Gate golf course with his wife of 72 \nyears, Nettie. He tries to play golf at least twice a week, sometimes \nmore. Mr. Santor turned 100 years old on Easter Sunday of this year. \nDespite his age, he is a competitor through and through; he recently \naccumulated an astonishing score of 42 strokes after playing 9 holes.\n  Mr. Santor truly loves the sport of golf, so much, in fact, that he \npassed his knowledge of the game down to both of his children as they \nwere growing up. Now they, too, have fit the game into their \nlivelihoods in one way or another. His son, Tom, played golf in college \nat the University of Kentucky, while his daughter, Patty Driapsa, \ninstructs professional golfers at the Club Pelican Bay in Naples, FL. \nBoth children are not only amazed that their father is still able to \nplay the game but are also awestruck by how good he is. Despite his \nage, after a long lifetime of practice, he still has exceptional skill.\n  Bill was first exposed to the game when he began caddying in \nYoungstown, OH, at age 12. The pay he received was usually 25 cents for \nworking an entire 18-hole game. He picked up a few spare clubs here and \nthere and began playing himself at the age of 15. Bill quickly found \nthat he was a natural-born golfer, and he began playing in and winning \nlocal tournaments.\n  When World War II began Bill enlisted, but he never ceased to play \ngolf. He was stationed at Fort Knox, close to the Lindsey Golf Course, \nwhere Bill would eventually play against Byron Nelson, winner of two \nMasters, a U.S. Open, and a PGA, in the Kentucky Open in 1943. Although \nBill didn't win the tournament that year, just being able to \nparticipate is one of Bill's fondest memories to this day.\n  Not long after the Open, Bill was deployed to Europe, but again he \nfound himself in close proximity with the game he loved so dearly. Bill \nworked maintaining a golf course on the Czechoslovakia-Germany border. \nMilitary officers would come to the course when they were on leave to \nplay, relax, and enjoy their time off. One of the visitors was Bob \nHope, with whom Bill had the opportunity to play nine holes. All these \nyears later, Bill will be the first to tell you he won that game.\n  When Bill returned home after the war, golf was a big part of his \nfamily and work life. His wife Nettie remembers most of their family \nvacations were to golf destinations, where the whole family would play. \nBill worked for a business equipment company for almost 50 years and he \nspent a lot of time with clients discussing business over a game of \ngolf. But Bill's competitive nature would never allow him to let a \nclient win.\n  To this day Bill tries to fit a round of golf into his schedule every \nchance he gets, which is something he has done his whole entire life. \nBill can drive a golf ball 175 yards, and he has a running count of 10 \nholes-in-one to this day. Bill's children both agree that golf is what \nkeeps their father going; it is something that he has built his life \naround. Golf has opened many doors for Bill throughout his life, and \nfor that he is grateful.\n  It is my wish at this time that my colleagues in the Senate join me \nin celebrating the successful and still very active life of Mr. William \n``Bill'' A. Santor.\n  Mr. President, there was recently an article published in the \nLexington newspaper the Herald-Leader. The article featured the legacy \nof Mr. Bill Santor and the love and passion he has for his country, his \nState, his family, and the game of golf. I ask unanimous consent that \nsaid article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Apr. 1, 2012]\n\n   At Almost 100, Bill Santor Looks Back on His Colorful Life in Golf\n\n                            (By Mike Fields)\n\n       To Mark Twain, golf was a good walk spoiled, but to Bill \n     Santor, who will mark his 100th birthday on Easter Sunday, \n     golf has been and still is a wonderful life lived.\n       ``It's given me so much,'' Santor said. ``Great experiences \n     and great memories.''\n       Like when he competed against Byron Nelson in the Kentucky \n     Open. Or when he played nine holes with Bob Hope during World \n     War II. Or when he teed it up in the same tournament as Babe \n     Ruth. Or when he made two holes-in-one in a two-week period \n     at age 87.\n       In his prime, Santor was one of the best amateurs in Ohio. \n     He passed the golf gene on to his children. His son, Tom, \n     played at the University of Kentucky. His daughter, Patty, \n     played at Bowling Green State and is now a teaching pro in \n     Florida.\n       Bill Santor still plays golf a couple times a week at \n     Griffin Gate, where he's lived since 1991 with his wife of 72 \n     years, Nettie.\n       His legs are failing him, and so is his eyesight, but \n     Santor is still capable of scoring well. Just last week, he \n     carded a 42 for nine holes.\n       He has shot his age so many times that he laughs off the \n     accomplishment as if it were a tap-in putt.\n       ``It's crazy,'' his son Tom said when asked about his dad's \n     knack for still hitting the sweet spot.\n       ``He's a freak show.''\n       Patty Driapsa, who works at the Club Pelican Bay in Naples, \n     Fla., said she finds it ``incredible'' how solid her father \n     still hits the ball. ``He has a little trouble maneuvering in \n     and out of the cart, but hey, at 100 years old, you'd expect \n     to have a few challenges.''\n       Bill Santor's introduction to golf came when he began \n     caddying as a 12-year-old in Youngstown, Ohio. He earned 25 \n     cents for 18 holes.\n       He got a few hand-me-down clubs and started playing when he \n     was 15. A natural athlete, he quickly found his groove and \n     was winning area tournaments within a few years.\n       He continued to caddy on occasion to earn entry-fee money \n     for tournaments. One of his best gigs was looping for Ben \n     Fairless, president of U.S. Steel.\n       ``He'd give me $30 for expense money,'' Santor said. ``That \n     was like $300 then.''\n       In 1935, Santor played in a tournament in Cleveland and the \n     field included Babe Ruth, the most famous athlete on the \n     planet at the time.\n       When World War II began, Santor enlisted in the Army and \n     was stationed at Fort Knox. He was upset when he was told the \n     post's golf course was mostly restricted to officers. But \n     Santor's golf talent and gift of gab got him playing \n     privileges.\n       He was second low amateur in the 1943 Kentucky Open, which \n     was held on Fort Knox's Lindsey Course. Byron Nelson, who had \n     already won four majors (two Masters, a U.S. Open, and a \n     PGA), won that Kentucky Open.\n       When Santor was shipped overseas during the war, he still \n     played some golf.\n       As a staff sergeant, he was part of a Third Army team that \n     won a military golf competition in Paris in 1945. The spoils \n     of victory included an engraved gold watch that he's worn for \n     65 years.\n       Part of Santor's time in Europe was spent running the golf \n     course at a resort called Marienbad on the Czechoslovakia-\n     Germany border. It was where troops on leave would go for \n     rest and relaxation. And it was where Bob Hope visited during \n     a USO trip.\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\n       ``The manager came up to me one day and said, Billy, you've \n     got to play with Bob Hope this afternoon.' I said, What?!' I \n     went out and played nine holes with him, and I beat him,'' \n     Santor said.\n       Before he returned home after the war, Santor got in a lot \n     of golf at Marienbad.\n       ``I played every weekend with a captain, a colonel and a \n     general, and here I was a staff sergeant,'' he said.\n       ``They gave me the colonel for a partner, and he couldn't \n     hit a bull in the ass with a handful of gravel. I'd have to \n     take out $6 every time we played.''\n       Golf was also an integral part of Santor's civilian life.\n       Patty remembers that family vacations were usually golf \n     destinations. Nettie also played in those days, so there was \n     a family foursome.\n       Bill worked for a business equipment company for almost 50 \n     years, and he did his share of schmoozing on the golf course. \n     Ever the competitor, however, he never lost to a client on \n     purpose.\n       ``One guy asked me if I played customer golf.' I said no, \n     and I threw a 68 at him,'' Santor said, laughing.\n       While luck is a factor in getting a hole-in-one, there's \n     skill involved, too, especially when you've had 10, Santor's \n     running total. In 1999, he aced the par-3 fourth hole at \n     Griffin Gate on May 3, and aced it again on May 14.\n       New technology in golf clubs and balls has helped Santor \n     stay in the swing of things after 85 years in the game. His \n     odd-looking interlocking grip his left thumb is tucked under \n     the club still allows for a smooth stroke that can send a \n     drive 175 yards.\n       ``I can't swing too hard, but I can still hit it OK,'' \n     Santor says proudly.\n       Patty Driapsa said golf ``is basically what keeps my dad \n     going. It's the world he lives in. It's been a game of a \n     lifetime for him, that's for sure.''\n       Tom Santor, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, said golf has been \n     ``one of the cornerstones'' of his father's life ``his family \n     life, his business life, his social life. When he's on a golf \n     course, wherever that might be, he feels like he's home.\n       ``I think that's where he's most at peace.''\n       And still fairly close to par.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2320-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2320-S2321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS POST 4075 HONOR GUARD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a group \nof individuals who have been working to make a difference in the lives \nof local veterans in their community for over 60 years. The honor guard \nof Frankfort, Kentucky's Veterans of Foreign Wars Office Post 4075 has \nbeen providing an official military funeral ceremony for local veterans \nin the central Kentucky area since the 1950s.\n  Veterans K.B. Johns, Ralph Spooner, Bill Hampton, and Charlie Mauer \nfounded the first VFW Post 4075 color guard over 60 years ago. The men \nworked together to increase the size of the color guard over the next \ndecade into a full honor guard with 11 members: 2 flag folders, 7 \nriflemen, 1 bugler, and 1 leader. The honor guard takes any and all \nrequests to play at a fellow serviceman's funeral, free of charge.\n  The honor guard is made up of veterans from World War II, the Vietnam \nwar, the Korean war, Operation Desert Storm, and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. They may be from different generations, but they all share the \nsame respect for one another. Charlie Mauer is the only surviving \noriginal member of the troop; he is 85 years old.\n  Mr. Mauer is joined by three other World War II veterans: Mr. Burnett \nNapier fought with the U.S. Marines in the Battle of Peleliu in the \nPacific Theater at the age of 19. He is now 87 years old, and he is the \nrecipient of the Purple Heart and the Silver Star, two of the highest \nhonors awarded by the U.S. military. Mr. Charlie Hinds, who is 88 years \nold, served as a scout for GEN George Patton for 2 years. He enlisted \nin the Army at age 18. The youngest of the WWII veterans at age 84 is \nJim Wolcott. He was stationed in Europe from 1944 to 1947.\n  According to Charlie Mauer, the honor guard is ``a great bunch of \nguys.'' The men have conducted ceremonies for hundreds of funerals \nthroughout the program's lifetime and expected nothing in return. They \nare driven by compassion for their fellow servicemen who have gone on \nand their families who are left behind with only the memories of their \nloved one. The men are honored to get the chance to pay tribute to \nFrankfort veterans who have passed away. When asked, all of the men say \nthat they plan to stay involved in the honor guard as long as they are \nable to.\n  It is inspiring to witness others who truly receive joy and \nsatisfaction from helping their fellow man. The men of Frankfort's VFW \nPost 4075 honor guard will sometimes perform at as many as three \nfunerals a day, all for free. These men have all been involved in \nhistoric battles throughout our Nation's history, and they have served \ntheir country valiantly. And although they have already given so much, \nthey are still far from done giving back to their community, State, and \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask that my fellow colleagues in the \nSenate join me in recognizing the valiant dedication to service shown \nby these brave individuals. There was recently an article published in \nthe Lexington Herald-Leader that featured Frankfort's Veterans of \nForeign Wars Office Post 4075. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Mar. 26, 2012]\n\n      Frankfort VFW's Honor Guard Members Feel Privileged To Serve\n\n                        (By Kayleigh Zyskowski)\n\n       When the phone rings at the Frankfort Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars Post on Second Street, 85-year-old Charlie Mauer answers \n     it.\n       On the other end is not a question about the day's soups or \n     the next bingo night, but a request for the VFW Post 4075 \n     honor guard to pay final respects to a fellow veteran.\n       It's a call Mauer, honor guard commander, has been \n     answering for years, and he's honored to take it.\n       K.B. Johns, Ralph Spooner, Bill Hampton and Mauer the only \n     living original member founded the first VFW Post 4075 color \n     guard in the early 1950s.\n       Within the next decade they were able to support a full \n     honor guard, which takes at least 11 members: two flag \n     folders, seven riflemen, one bugler and one leader.\n       Four of the current members are World War II veterans, and \n     the rest served in Vietnam, Korea, Desert Storm and Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom. They are from different generations, but the \n     men say they share the same respect for each other.\n       ``We've got a good bunch of guys,'' Mauer said.\n       Mauer, a World War II veteran, says serving the community \n     and paying tribute to Frankfort veterans is something he's \n     glad to do. And because he grew up in Frankfort, he knows \n     many of those who've died, which makes the job more important \n     to him.\n       Several days after the call comes in, Mauer arrives at the \n     post ready to greet the other members and prepare the \n     equipment.\n       ``We don't get paid,'' says World War II veteran Jim \n     Wolcott, ``other than a free lunch and a beer.''\n       The men arrive wearing dark-blue uniforms decorated with \n     gold cords, white gloves and polished black shoes.\n       They shuffle into the game room of the VFW where the rifles \n     are stored in a locked cabinet.\n       After they are prepared to leave for the funeral service, \n     the group stands in the doorway teasing each other about \n     their weight and asking the kitchen crew what's for lunch.\n       There's no need for practice or rehearsal; each man knows \n     his role because the group has done it so often.\n       The group has attended as many as three funerals in one \n     day, Mauer says, but the number is usually several per month. \n     Over the years, they have provided services for hundreds of \n     funerals.\n       The men have braved every kind of weather for funerals, and \n     this morning is chilly and rainy. Luckily, they've heard the \n     sky will clear before the service starts.\n       The 11 men divide into separate vehicles and make their way \n     up East Main Street to Frankfort Cemetery.\n       As they wait for the family to arrive at the cemetery's \n     chapel, Charlie Hinds asks Burnett Napier, ``What are you \n     doing lately?''\n       ``As little as possible,'' Napier jokes.\n       Both Napier and Hinds are World War II combat veterans--\n     Napier in the Marines and Hinds in the Army.\n       By 19, Napier was fighting in one of the Marine's deadliest \n     battles in the Pacific on Peleliu Island with the 1st Marine \n     Division.\n       It was September 1944 when Napier ended up on the coral \n     island fighting against the Empire of Japan. He was a \n     corpsman, or medic, when he ran to the side of a fallen \n     Marine, performed first aid on the man under machine-gun fire \n     before carrying him to safety.\n       Shrapnel hit him later in the same battle, and he suffered \n     a concussion.\n       Napier, an honor guard member for 15 years, received the \n     Purple Heart and the Silver Star while in combat on the \n     island, which is present day Palau Islands.\n       ``They didn't stay in one place for too long. I was all \n     over the Pacific,'' he said.\n       ``According to the citation, a Marine was caught in \n     crossfire with machine guns, and, according to the citation, \n     I administered first aid under fire and carried him back to \n     relative safety,'' Napier said.\n       Charlie Hinds, 88, has been a member of the honor guard for \n     about 16 years.\n       He served in seven campaigns and was an Army scout for \n     General George Patton for two years.\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\n       ``He wasn't a really nice guy; he wouldn't ever come up and \n     want to know about you personally,'' Hinds said about Patton. \n     ``He just wanted to tell you what to do, but he was a good \n     general.''\n       Hinds and his brother enlisted after graduating from high \n     school because his father didn't have enough money to send \n     him to school. He was 18 years old.\n       ``With about two weeks left in the war, I was the only \n     (one) left in my platoon,'' Hinds said.\n       Family members of the deceased begin to arrive at Frankfort \n     Cemetery. Vince LaFontaine--who has played in hundreds of \n     Frankfort funerals since he was a teenager--warms up with \n     scales, and the men take their positions.\n       The weather predictions were correct.

Mr. President, I stand before you today to commend and \npay tribute to a Kentuckian who spent time with the Marines serving in \nAfghanistan in 2009. Although he was far from home and a visitor in a \nforeign land, LCpl David Mays of London, KY, treated the Afghan people \nwith the utmost respect, proving that he exemplified the \ncharacteristics the U.S. Marine Corps upholds: character, compassion, \nhonor, courage, and the integrity to always do what is right. Lance \nCorporal Mays enlisted during his senior year of high school at the age \nof 18.\n  In May of 2009, just 2 days before his second deployment with the \nMarines, David's firstborn son, Landon, came into the world. David left \nfor Afghanistan before his newborn son was able to leave the hospital \nin London. Although David was greatly saddened about having to leave \nhis baby boy behind, he proudly answered the call of duty, and for the \nsecond time David returned to the Middle East. However, this time \naround, David was a different man: he was a father now. Fatherhood \ncaused him to take an interest in the local Afghan children. David felt \nthat interacting with the children helped him to not miss his own son \nas much.\n  David missed his boy back home terribly, but he would play with the \nAfghan children and buy them gifts. In turn, the children would offer \nDavid and his fellow marines fruit as a token of their gratitude. The \nkinship David and his men built with the local children was the \nfoundation of a successful relationship with the local Afghan tribe \nleaders.\n  During his time overseas, David had limited contact with his family \nin Kentucky, but his mother, Wanda Caudill, sent letters and care \npackages as frequently as possible. She would also send photos of \nLandon. The gifts from home and the relationships David made with the \nlocal people, local children, and fellow marines all helped to console \nhim until he finally returned home just before Christmas in 2010.\n  It had been almost a year since David had seen his son Landon, who \nwas only 2 days old at their last meeting, There was no way that the \nlittle boy could have remembered his father's presence. But when David \nfirst saw his son Landon at the airport that December, Landon reached \nfor him as if he had never left and kissed him three times.\n  David has since joined the London-Laurel County Rescue Squad and \nLondon Fire Department. He is still in the Marines Active Reserve, but \nhe plans to stay as involved as he can in his 2-year-old son's life. \nDavid decided that missing 1 year of his son's life is enough, and he \nis not missing any more.\n  Mr. President, an article appeared in the Laurel County publication \nthe Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition in November 2011 that profiled the \nupstanding character of LCpl David Mays. I ask unanimous consent that \nsaid article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                  [From the Sentinel Echo, Nov. 2011]\n\n                      Finding Family Far From Home\n\n                          (By Magen McCrarey)\n\n       He left his first-born son, Landon, at the hospital in May \n     of 2009, born two days before his second deployment. David \n     Mays, a lance corporal of the 1st Battalion, Fifth Marines, \n     hoped to take Landon home for a warm welcome; instead he \n     arrived in Afghanistan with one of his own.\n       ``As we landed we heard bullets ricocheting off the \n     helicopter,'' Mays said. ``We were there, and there was no \n     turning back.''\n       The sweltering desert heat was in excess of 115 degrees as \n     Mays and his squad walked three days with more than 100 \n     pounds strapped to their backs heading towards Helmand \n     Province. Their compound was far off from any city and water \n     was limited.\n       With a shovel-like tool in hand, Mays began digging a hole \n     for his bed and covered it with a tarp.\n       ``Everybody dug their own hole, scattered, in case we got \n     attacked by mortars,'' Mays said. ``I told my buddy if we're \n     worried about mortars, we dug our graves right here so it \n     don't matter.''\n       Mays always wanted to be a Marine. When Mays was in fourth \n     grade at Cold Hill Elementary, his class received a visit \n     from a U.S. Marine, a pilot shot down behind enemy lines and \n     a Kentucky native. The Marine's recollection of brotherhood \n     and camaraderie influenced Mays in more ways than just \n     portraying an intriguing narrative.\n       ``It was like a family away from your own family, and I'd \n     get to see the world and meet people,'' Mays said.\n       He and a group of friends enlisted in the Marines their \n     senior year of high school at 18 years old. They knew they \n     may not be placed in the same company throughout their \n     service, but they all had the same objective.\n       ``We all had one thing on our minds: to become Marines \n     together,'' Mays said.\n       The objective of the Marines within the Helmand Province \n     was to win the hearts and minds of the Afghans. With the \n     British recently vacating the country, Afghans were \n     apprehensive about the Marines' arrival.\n       Tribe leaders would only converse with Marine commanders. \n     They'd offer tips about the Taliban's whereabouts and when \n     they were arriving in the area. The Taliban had a reputation \n     for entering into towns at night.\n       Mays and his squad of four would respond to the information \n     given and perform night operations to keep watch over a town. \n     Walking 20 miles and back again to keep watch for suspicious \n     travelers was a frequent and meticulous task.\n       ``We did what we had to do. We were doing our job \n     protecting each other,'' Mays said, ``just like anybody \n     around here will protect their family.''\n       Contact with family via satellite while in Afghanistan was \n     few and far between, but they received mail often. Mays's \n     mother, Wanda Caudill, sent a letter every chance she got, \n     and many care packages.\n       ``She sent me newspapers and I knew exactly what was going \n     on in London,'' he said.\n       Caudill also sent photos of Mays's son so he wouldn't feel \n     as if he was missing out on his child's life. Away from his \n     own child, Mays often thought about the children in \n     Afghanistan.\n       ``We'd give the kids rides on our shoulders, and we'd buy \n     them stuff,'' Mays said.\n       The Afghan boys would offer fruit to the Marines and even \n     allowed them to participate in their Muslim holiday of \n     Ramadan. As the sun set, the day of fasting would cease and \n     they would enter in an evening feast. They had offered a goat \n     for slaughter to the men, and taught them how to give it a \n     death without suffering.\n       ``I think it made me think about when my son was going to \n     get that age, and didn't make me miss him as much. But, of \n     course, I missed him because he was my boy,'' Mays said.\n       After days of patrolling a foreign country, battling an \n     unseen enemy, and losing men that were a part of his family \n     away from home, Mays returned to his own. Days before \n     Christmas 2010, Mays arrived at the Louisville airport \n     greeting his family with one gripping hug after another, \n     saving his son for last.\n       ``I was scared he was going to cry and not recognize me,'' \n     Mays said.\n       But Landon came right to him as if he never missed a beat. \n     He reached for Mays and kissed him three times.\n       ``My mom started crying and said, `He never kissed nobody,' \n     Mays recalled. ``It was like I was gone only a minute or \n     so.''\n       After returning from deployment, Mays has learned to \n     appreciate the small things in life and take advantage of \n     every opportunity to serve the public, he said. He's joined \n     the London-Laurel County Rescue Squad and London Fire \n     Department. Mays has completed four years of active duty in \n     the Marines and is currently in the four-year active\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\n     reserve program. He said if he didn't have his son before he \n     began active duty, he would have made a career out of the \n     Marines.\n       ``I decided one year's enough,'' Mays said. ``I'm not \n     missing any more of his life.'' Landon is now two years old.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2322-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MASTER SERGEANT CHARLES HAYES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of MSgt Charles \nHayes of London, KY. Master Sergeant Hayes served in the U.S. Air Force \nfrom 1972 to 1996, and was involved in both the Vietnam and gulf wars. \nHayes volunteered to join at age 21 and continued to be a volunteer for \nthe duration of his two-decade stint in the military.\n  During Hayes's extended period of time in the Air Force, he had the \nopportunity to visit a variety of foreign countries, including Germany, \nTurkey, and Thailand, just to name a few. Hayes enjoyed every aspect \nthat went along with being a part of the Armed Forces. He flourished as \na member of the U.S. Air Force in more ways than one.\n  What Hayes enjoyed most about the service was experiencing history in \nthe making. Hayes remembers participating in the evacuation of Saigon, \nSouth Vietnam, in April 1975. It was a mission in which Hayes and his \nteam were given the objective of recovering an American merchant ship \nthat had been pirated by the Khmer Rouge navy. The ship was \nsuccessfully recovered on May 13, 1975, and Hayes was an instrumental \npart of the operation, one that many of us remember paying close \nattention to while back home in the States.\n  Hayes also enjoyed the Air Force because it inspired its members to \nshow initiative. In 1987, Charles was assigned public affairs duties \nfor his section. He remembers how difficult and ``utterly impossible'' \nthe men told him it was to get an article published in the base \nnewspaper. Hayes took on the challenge of getting a story published \nhead on, and that year he had 37 articles and 17 pictures with captions \npublished in the newspaper.\n  Lt. Col. Richard Vaught recalls that Hayes was one of the best \nsergeants he has ever commanded. It wasn't unusual for those who worked \nwith Hayes to speak highly of him. While serving as the squadron safety \nnoncommissioned officer from 1990 to 1996, Hayes's unit received \nnumerous honors and awards, including Best Small Unit Safety Program \nAward and Best Additional Duty Safety NCO Award.\n  Many different attributes have been used to describe Charles Hayes \nover the years. Talented, ambitious, reliable, and persevering are just \na few of the countless positive references of the master sergeant. \nLieutenant Colonel Vaught is recorded as saying, ``Charlie always knew \nhow to get everything when nobody else could. If you go to war, he's \nthe one you want to go with you. He'll get you everything and then \nsome.''\n  Charles Hayes exemplifies every characteristic of a successful member \nof our Nation's Armed Forces. His dedication and service to our great \ncountry over 24 years will most certainly not go unnoticed and is the \nvery cause of my standing here today. It is my wish that my colleagues \nin the Senate join me in commemorating MSgt Charles Hayes at this time.\n  There was an article published in Laurel County's local news \nmagazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, in November of 2011. The \narticle highlighted Charles Hayes and the outstanding dedication he has \nshown throughout the years in his involvement with the U.S. military. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]\n\n                           A Part of History\n\n                            (By Carol Mills)\n\n       Master Sergeant Charles Hayes, a Vietnam and Gulf War \n     veteran, volunteered to join the United States Air Force when \n     he was 21, serving from 1972 to 1996. He worked for 12 years \n     in security police and 12 years in computers.\n       What Hayes liked most about his 24 years of service was \n     being a part of history.\n       ``While my part was very small, the unit I was assigned to \n     (56 SPS, Nakhon Phanom RTAF, Thailand) was responsible for \n     assisting in the evacuation of Saigon, South Vietnam, and \n     Phenom Phen, Cambodia, in April 1975,'' 60-year-old Hayes \n     said. ``We were part of the recovery of the American merchant \n     ship, Mayaguez, which had been pirated by the Khmer Rouge \n     Navy. I lost 18 buddies on May 13, 1975, during the \n     operation.''\n       During the 1991 Gulf War, his unit (608 APS, Ramstein AFB, \n     Ramstein, Germany) was responsible for shipping all munitions \n     to the air bases in the desert, as well as thousands of tons \n     of other supplies.\n       ``I remember looking at what seemed to be miles of pallets \n     and wondering when we would get them all shipped down \n     range.''\n       After the Gulf War, Hayes's unit was kept busy supporting \n     United Nations' humanitarian missions in Eastern Europe and \n     Africa. In 1992, one of Russia's largest cargo planes arrived \n     at Ramstein AFB to receive donations. He was in charge of \n     ground safety while his unit loaded the plane.\n       ``We weren't able to use forklifts because the plane wasn't \n     configured for them. Because I was all over the operation, \n     the plane's crew must have figured I was a big wheel of some \n     kind and gave me three cases of Russian vodka.''\n       Hayes also liked the Air Force because it allowed him to \n     show initiative.\n       ``While sometimes routine duties were a little mundane, \n     additional duties allowed personnel an opportunity to show \n     initiative. In 1987, I was assigned public affairs duties for \n     my section. I was told that it was almost `impossible' to get \n     an article printed in the base newspaper and utterly \n     `impossible' to get an article published anywhere else.''\n       That year, Hayes had 37 articles and 17 pictures with \n     captions published in the base newspaper. Two articles were \n     published in command-level publications and two in a local \n     newspaper.\n       Lt. Col. Richard Vaught said Hayes was one of the best \n     master sergeants he ever commanded.\n       ``He's the type that if you needed anything done, he always \n     found a way to get it done when everyone else couldn't,'' he \n     said. ``He was the ultimate scrounger. I would say he was a \n     very talented individual. Charlie always knew how to get \n     everything when nobody else could. If you go to war, he's the \n     one you want to go with you. He'll get you everything you \n     need and then some. He just knew how to use all the various \n     avenues. I was quite happy to have him in my command.''\n       From 1990 through 1996, he was assigned the additional duty \n     of squadron safety non-commissioned officer. During his \n     tenure as safety NCO, his unit received a Best Explosives \n     Safety Program Award from both the command and USAF as well \n     as a Best Small Unit (under 600 personnel) Safety Program \n     Award. He also received a Best Additional Duty Safety NCO \n     Award.\n       Hayes also liked associating with other patriots.\n       ``When situations got tough, everyone got tougher,'' he \n     said. ``We all regarded a challenge as something to overcome, \n     not something to shy away from. Esprit de corps was highest \n     when things were toughest. I served with some of the best \n     people in the world.''\n       Hayes enjoyed the opportunities the Air Force had to offer. \n     ``I always held the attitude that I was stationed in the best \n     section of the best squadron on the best Air Force base in \n     the United States. I learned that education was the least \n     expensive hobby a person could have and completed a master's \n     in education before I retired.''\n       During his service he traveled throughout the British \n     Isles, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, Turkey, \n     Thailand, and several other countries to a lesser degree, and \n     has driven through every state except Maine, New Hampshire \n     and Vermont. He has also been to Alaska and Hawaii during his \n     service.\n       Before Hayes had lived in London, Ky., for five months, he \n     had spent more time in London, England, than in London, Ky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2322-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2322-S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   2012 NATIONAL DAYS OF REMEMBRANCE\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to pay my respects to the \nvictims, survivors, and heroes of the Holocaust. April 19, 2012, marks \nHolocaust Remembrance Day, which is observed during a week-long \nmemorial, the National Days of Remembrance, created by Congress in 1980 \nand led by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Through this year's \ntheme, ``Choosing to Act: Stories of Rescue,'' we remember the \ncourageous men, women, and children who stood up and saved lives, at \ngrave risk and sometimes deadly consequences to themselves. On the \nanniversary of the Warsaw ghetto uprising and the liberation of \nEuropean concentration camps, we honor all who embraced their own \nhumanity to save others, abandoning self-interest for selfless bravery.\n  This week of commemoration that spans Sunday, April 15 to Sunday, \nApril 22, is deeply personal. My father came to this country in 1935 to \nescape persecution. Speaking barely any English, he set down my \nfamily's roots with very little but memories of loved ones who had \nperished in the Holocaust and faith in the American dream.\n  The Days of Remembrance is a living memorial, altered by every \ncitizen who\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\ndares to speak up and open their mind and heart. It is more than an \noral history project. It ties the past with our present, inspiring \nproactive, positive transformation in our daily lives. We recall that \nthe brave individuals whose stories we bring to light were acting out \nof loyalty to their neighbors. Small communities held each other \ntightly. Each year, we come together at a national ceremony in the \nCapitol Rotunda, but this collective power is also felt through smaller \ngroups, including State and local governments, civic organizations, \nplaces of worship, schools, offices, and military bases.\n  Organizations such as the Holocaust Child Survivors of Connecticut \ndocument the personal histories of living survivors--children of the \nHolocaust. Sadly, as time goes on, our future generations will not have \nthe privilege of hearing from them. We must work to perpetuate their \nmessages beyond words. We must teach our Nation's children the lessons \nwe have learned--about human betrayal, war crimes, and genocide, about \nheroes, hope, and honor--through our own activism.\n  This Wednesday, the Holocaust Memorial Museum is awarding Aung San \nSuu Kyi the Elie Wiesel Award at their 2012 National Tribute Dinner for \n``her exceptional courage in resisting tyranny and advancing the \ndignity and freedom of the Burmese people.'' By honoring a woman who is \na living hero for victims of a present-day dictatorship, the Holocaust \nMemorial Museum seamlessly unites history with the persecutions of \ntoday to create a new space of memory and action for generations to \ncome.\n  As we soberly recall those who were not rescued, we can remain \nhopeful through the memory of the rescuers--those who followed their \nheart, beliefs, or religion to help victims in desperate need. This \ncompassion is inspirational for me, and I hope for all those who \nwitness human suffering and confront feelings of helplessness. As we \ngather this week to remember, we are choosing to be actively \ncompassionate. Memories of the Holocaust inspire us to live today and \nevery day with kindness, generosity, and an undying commitment to \nstrengthening our bonds as human beings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2323-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I join my fellow Senators in \npaying tribute to my dear colleague and friend Senator Barbara Mikulski \nfor the tremendous landmark she has reached as of March 17, 2012. She \nis now the longest serving female Member of our Congress. But the \nnumber of years is inadequate as a measure or metric. More telling are \nher monumental accomplishments and record of successfully tackling \ntough problems and making a real difference in lives. Senator Mikulski \nis unquestionably one of the most dedicated, inspiring, and influential \npublic servants in our Nation's history.\n  Her generous spirit, flair, and eloquence as a speaker make her both \nloved and powerful as an advocate. Her standard of intellect and \nintegrity has motivated me and inspired countless others. Like Senator \nMikulski, I am humbled and driven by the legacy of members of my family \nwho emigrated from Europe, striving for the American dream with a \nstrong work ethic and a firm belief in progress. I am especially drawn \nto Senator Mikulski's determination to fight for her constituents and \nher deep sense of caring. She is an excellent role model for women and \ngirls around the globe--and for anyone, whether a freshman Senator such \nas myself or a veteran legislator--devoted to a life of public service.\n  I am proud to work with Senator Mikulski on the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions, joining her, for example, as a \ncosponsor of her Paycheck Fairness Act to continue the civil rights \ndebate that started decades ago and is unfortunately still unresolved. \nWe must, once and for all, secure protections for women in the \nworkforce, reaching pay equity and ending all instances of sex \ndiscrimination.\n  I respect Senator Mikulski's efforts to reduce costs while furthering \ninnovation and am a strong supporter of her focus on research and drug \ndevelopment for chronic conditions, as laid out in her SPRINT Act. Her \nadvocacy for America's seniors and success leading immigration reform \nare equally inspiring, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of her Visa \nWaiver Program Enhanced Security and Reform Act.\n  I especially enjoyed partnering with Senator Mikulski to advance the \neducation we provide to our Nation's students. We offered an amendment \ntogether in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to increase \nfunding and research to meet the unique needs of gifted and talented \nstudents.\n  Special recognition is past due for Senator Mikulski, who makes the \ntime to recognize others, most recently sponsoring S. Res. 310, \ndesignating 2012 as ``Year of the Girl'' and congratulating the Girl \nScouts for its centennial.\n  Senator Mikulski has been an extraordinary mentor and model for \ncountless men and women who emulate her dedication and drive, her \ncommitment and common sense. She leads by her example, particularly for \nwomen who endeavor to hold public office. When considering the \nopportunity to run, they can look to the legacy she has built and the \npath she has traveled from social worker to city council member to a \nnational figure in the Halls of Congress.\n  I look forward with pleasure and pride to serving alongside Senator \nMikulski for years to come.

Still active in veterans and community \naffairs, Mrs. Cohen was recently the guest of honor at a California \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, CalVet, reception honoring the \nachievements of women in the military during Women's Military History \nWeek.\n  As CalVet noted, ``Women have contributed to the rich military \nhistory of our country even before they were officially allowed to \nserve. The first known American woman soldier was Deborah Sampson of \nMassachusetts who, disguised as a man, served in the Revolutionary War. \nThroughout the history of our country, women have consistently shown \nthemselves as dedicated patriots, willing to put their lives on the \nline in order to protect our nation and the freedoms of our people.''\n  The life of Bea Cohen is a living testament to the incredible \ncontributions our service women make each and every day. Born in \nRomania in 1910, Bea Abrams came to America through Ellis Island in \n1920 with her mother, brother, and sister. When the United States \nentered World War II, Bea vowed to do all she could to help her adopted \ncountry. She went to school to learn the machinist trade and then \nworked at Douglas Aircraft Company in Santa Monica as a real-life Rosie \nthe Riveter.\n  Though she loved this work, Bea wanted to do more. In 1942, at age \n33, she joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, WAAC, turning down a \nsalary increase at Douglas. After going through basic training in Iowa, \nshe did administrative work for the WAAC in Utah and Colorado.\n  By 1943, Bea took a second oath to become part of the new Women's \nArmy Corps, WAC, which unlike the WAAC was now a part of the Regular \nArmy. She was soon shipped overseas. Crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a \nship that zigzagged to avoid enemy submarines, Bea arrived in England \njust in time for D-day. There, she worked in Army headquarters \nproducing documents and operating a low-cost printing machine called a \nmimeograph. After 2 years of service, Bea was honorably discharged and \nreturned to Los Angeles.\n  In late 1945, Bea met Marine MSgt Ray Cohen through family friends. \nRay Cohen had served in the Pacific and had been a prisoner of War on \nthe Philippine island of Corregidor for 3\\1/2\\ years. Bea and Ray were \nmarried the following year and had two daughters, Janiece and Susan. \nLater, during the Korean war, Ray was deployed for over\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\na year while Bea raised the girls and volunteered with the Jewish War \nVeterans of the United States.\n  After Ray retired in 1955, the Cohens remained active with the Jewish \nWar Veterans. To this day, Bea volunteers at the Veterans Affairs \nMedical Center in Los Angeles. For her 102nd birthday party, Bea \ndisplayed her lifelong dedication to troops by asking her guests to \nbring socks for veterans rather than presents for herself. Bea has \ndedicated more than 70 years to providing support for American troops \nand their families. She is an enduring reminder of the contributions of \nthis nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I know all of my colleagues will join me today in \nhonoring Bea Abrams Cohen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2324-1", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING MR.

Brennan, Jr. Mr. Brennan \npassed away on December 20, 2011.\n  Mr. Brennan was a long-time aide to Florida Congressman Claude \nPepper. He worked for Mr. Pepper from 1963 to 1989, when Mr. Pepper was \nin the U.S. House of Representatives. He was Mr. Pepper's closest \nadvisor through the Congressman's chairmanships of the House Aging \nCommittee and House Rules Committee.\n  Mr. Brennan was devoted to Florida. One of his biggest priorities was \nhelping Florida's seniors, both as Mr. Pepper's aide and later as a \nboard member and advisor to the Claude Pepper Foundation in \nTallahassee.\n  Throughout his years working for Mr. Pepper, Mr. Brennan had the \nsupport of his wife Yolanda. They had 12 children and 28 grandchildren.\n  Florida is lucky to have had a public servant like Mr. Brennan, and \nhis service to the State and the country will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2324-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2324-3", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2324-4", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on March 30, 2012, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nthat the House agrees to the concurrent resolution (S.

Res. 418\n\n       Whereas 80 brave American airmen volunteered for an \n     ``extremely hazardous mission'' without knowing the target, \n     location, or assignment and willingly put their lives in \n     harm's way, risking death, capture, and torture;\n       Whereas the mission was the first offensive action by the \n     United States military following the attack on Pearl Harbor \n     on December 7, 1941;\n       Whereas the Doolittle Raid represented the first time in \n     which the Army Air Corps and the Navy collaborated in a \n     tactical mission by flying 16 Army B 25 medium bombers off of \n     the USS Hornet;\n       Whereas the flying of bombers from a Navy carrier had never \n     been done before, making the mission extremely hazardous from \n     the very start;\n       Whereas after encountering Japanese picket ships 170 miles \n     from the prearranged launch point, the Raiders, led by \n     Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle, proceeded to launch 650 \n     miles from the target of Tokyo;\n       Whereas by launching more than 170 miles early the Raiders \n     deliberately accepted the risk that the B 25s might not have \n     enough fuel to make it beyond the Japanese lines in occupied \n     China;\n       Whereas the additional risk virtually sealed the fate of \n     the Raiders to crash land in China or on the home islands of \n     Japan, subjecting them to imprisonment, torture, or death;\n       Whereas because of that deliberate choice, after hitting \n     their military and industrial targets in Tokyo and five other \n     cities on the island of Honshu, low on fuel and in setting \n     night and deteriorating weather, none of the 16 airplanes \n     reached the prearranged Chinese airfields;\n       Whereas the total distance traveled averaged 2,250 nautical \n     miles over a period of 13 hours is the longest combat mission \n     ever flown in a B 25 Mitchell bomber;\n       Whereas of the 8 Raiders who were captured, 3 were \n     executed, 1 died of disease, and 4 came home; and\n       Whereas, the Doolittle Raid led the fight for the eventual \n     victory of the United States in the Second World War: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the 5 living members and 80 original members \n     of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders for their participation in the \n     Tokyo bombing raid of April 18, 1942; and\n       (2) recognizes the valor, skill, and courage of the Raiders \n     that proved invaluable to the eventual defeat of Japan during \n     the Second World War; and\n       (3) acknowledges that the actions of the Raiders helped to \n     forge an enduring example of heroism in the face of \n     uncertainty for the Army Air Corps of the Second World War, \n     the future of the Air Force, and the United States as a \n     whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/04/16/senate-section/article/S2326-2", "month": "04", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2326-S2333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 40--SETTING FORTH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET \n  FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013, REVISING THE \n APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012, AND SETTING FORTH \n  THE APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013 THROUGH 2022\n\n  Mr. PAUL (for himself, Mr. DeMint, and Mr. Lee) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                            S.
