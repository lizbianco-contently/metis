Madam President, saying you want to cut government spending \nis an easy applause line. We all want to lower the deficit. We all wish \nAmericans had less debt sitting in the treasuries of other countries. \nNone of us wants to leave the most difficult decisions to the next \ngeneration. They deserve better from us.\n  But actually figuring out what and where to cut is the hard work. \nThat is an entirely different story. The American people do not need to \nhear an applause line. They need us to ease the burden on our Nation's \nbottom line, and there is a fine line between doing so responsibly and \nrecklessly.\n  It is our job to do that hard work, to figure out what and where to \ncut, to do the math carefully and practically and with common sense. It \nis our responsibility to remember we are not just taking numbers off a \nledger. In many cases, these proposals may mean taking workers off the \nassembly line, taking teachers out of the classroom or police officers \noff the street.\n  I want to talk about taking police officers off the street. In the \nRepublicans' haste to make as many cuts as possible, they have proposed \neliminating the COPS hiring program. COPS stands for Community Oriented \nPolicing Services, and it has helped put thousands and thousands of \npolice officers and sheriffs on patrol around the country, about 450 of \nthem in Nevada.\n  Under the Republican plan, many could lose those jobs and many more \nwho want to join the force will not be able to. The COPS program also \nhelps our law enforcement departments afford the computers and \ncommunications equipment they need to do their jobs. These jobs are \nkeeping us safe. So cutting COPS does not just put them at risk, it \nputs all of us at risk.\n  This is not the kind of investment we gain from losing. This extreme \nplan does nothing to grow our economy or keep us competitive. It does \nnot make our future more secure; it makes our neighborhoods less so. We \nhave to cut responsibly. That is not the kind of cut we have talked \nabout, wiping out the COPS program. We cannot support that.\n  When we talk about cutting government waste and excess, this is what \nwe mean, among other things. We mean eliminating handouts to oil \ncompanies that are already making record profits. We mean cutting \nbillions in wasteful Pentagon spending to contractors such as \nHalliburton. It means stopping the government giveaways to companies \nthat ship American jobs overseas. These are commonsense cuts and a good \nplace to start the conversation.\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\n  But so far Republicans have shown no interest in meeting us halfway \nand have shown every intention of protecting their rich corporate \nfriends. As this conversation continues, Democrats do not need any \nlectures from the other side on fiscal responsibility. Remember, we \nwere the ones who balanced the budget during the Clinton years. We did \nit. We were accused of reducing the deficit too much. We were spending \nless money than we were taking in. Because of the work we did during \nthe last of the Clinton administration, even President Bush, during his \nfirst year, because he got all of the largess from the Clinton \nadministration, turned in a record budget surplus. But as soon as his \npolicies went into effect, he changed that very quickly. In a matter of \nmonths, he turned a record surplus into a record deficit that we are \nfighting today.\n  In conclusion, any budget debate is going to be about numbers. That \nis the way it should be. But that is not the real priority, and those \nfigures should not blind us to the real story behind the numbers. Our \ngoal and our charge is not to cut billions of dollars just to say we \ndid it. Our task is to make our government more efficient, our economy \nhealthier, and our future more secure. Our challenge is to do so in a \nway that does not put our public safety at risk or break our promise to \nseniors.\n  So we need to think about what we are cutting and making sure those \ncuts are not counterproductive. We need to pay attention to the quality \nof those cuts, not just the quantity of those cuts. After all, you can \nlose a lot of weight by cutting off your arms and legs but no doctor \nwould recommend it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/10/senate-section/article/S638-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I thank the majority leader for \nhis support on our upcoming efforts. I am joined on the Senate floor by \nSenator Casey, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, who has been a \nleader for workers in this body.\n  I want to make some brief comments about something very important for \nworkers and businesses and international trade. Then Senator Casey will \nmake a couple of unanimous-consent requests. He will make one that I \nhope is agreed to. If it is, then he will not need to make a second, \nand I will not need to make a third.\n  In December, just before the 111th Congress adjourned, it extended \ntwo critical trade programs which Senator Casey and I were on the \nSenate floor working on. First, we extended the Andean Trade \nPreferences Act, thanks in part to Senator McCain of Arizona. It \nprovides assistance to Latin American countries and also helps American \nbusinesses and workers by granting access to new inputs and products.\n  Second, critically important to our two States, Pennsylvania and \nOhio, and I know to the Presiding Officer's State of Minnesota, we \nextended trade adjustment assistance. That is the least we can do when \nthis Congress passes wrong-headed trade agreements.\n  We extended the health coverage tax credit so that together workers \nwho lose their jobs because of bad trade agreements, such as NAFTA and \nCAFTA, and bad trade positioning such as PNTR for China, can at least \nget some help for retraining so they can get back to work in comparably \npaying jobs, we hope, and get some assistance, some tax credits to buy \nhealth insurance for them and their families.\n  As a result, thousands of workers and retirees who depend on TAA and \nthe HCTC made it through the holidays, when we did this in late \nDecember, at the last minute--it should not have been that long, but in \nthe last minute--with these critical sources of support.\n  The Andean Trade Preferences Act has brought benefits for our \nbusinesses and workers. It is nice that sunflowers from Colombia will \nbe in florist shops for Valentines Day next week because of this act. \nBut the difficult reality faced by too many workers reliant on TAA, \nreliant on the health care tax credit, reminds us of the effects of \ntrade and globalization, the downside of trade and globalization.\n  It reminds us that our actions bring consequences. We hear Presidents \nand Congresses trumped the advantages of free trade. Yet they forget \nabout fair trade, what happens to too many workers. Good for investors, \ngood for some companies, good for some countries, not always good for \nour workers--they forget about that.\n  By this weekend, if we fail to act, crucial improvements to TAA and \nthe health care tax credit will expire. Workers again will be hurt not \njust by loss of jobs but loss of these benefits. It will expire at the \nexpense of workers who played by the rules, who lost their jobs, most \nof their pensions, and their health care--or all three.\n  Just last month I visited the Mahoning Valley on the Pennsylvania \nborder in Northeast Ohio--the Mahoning Valley One Stop to visit with \nworkers who are using TAA to develop new skills and training to find \nnew secure jobs. One industrial manufacture worker, I believe, in her \nforties has a child, a daughter, I believe, in her late teens. She and \nher daughter both were in the same school studying to be health care \nworkers, both becoming professionals, both getting their lives and \ntheir futures in order--the mother able to do it because of trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  I was there with a simple message: We cannot keep passing trade \nagreements that undermine Ohio workers and then turn our backs on those \nworkers when their jobs are offshored.\n  The TAA and HCTC enhancements are not expensive; they are not \ncomplicated. They are modest improvements that Congress passed to \nprograms that help tens of thousands of Americans either get back to \nwork or regain some measure of the financial security that had been \nstripped unceremoniously from them.\n  Last week, 12 Senators and I, including the majority leader, sent \nHouse leadership a request for a long-term extension of trade \nadjustment assistance, the health care tax credit, and the Andean Trade \nPreferences Act. TAA is a critical part of our Nation's competitiveness \nstrategy.\n  In the last 2 years, more than 155,000 additional trade-affected \nworkers across the country who might not have been certified under the \nformer TAA program became eligible for TAA benefits because a year and \na half, almost 2 years ago, in the Recovery Act, we added expanded \ntrade adjustment to help those workers who had lost their jobs because \nof trade.\n  These Americans are rubber workers from Johnson Rubber Company in \nWood County. They are furniture makers from Masco in Jackson County or \naluminum castings workers from Mansfield Brass and Aluminum in my home \ncounty of Richland. In addition, workers in the service industry are \neligible for TAA because of these changes. Those workers include \nengineers at Belcan Engineering in Cincinnati and computer programers \nat Electronic Data Systems in Fairborn, a suburb of Dayton. It includes \nresearchers at the Transportation Research Center in Moraine.\n  In total, 360,000-plus workers nationwide have been certified \neligible for TAA since 2009. These workers use TAA to acquire new \nskills to return to work as quickly as possible. This is not theory; \nthis is not some game. This is workers who have lost their jobs because \nof decisions in this body and in the White House that cost people those \njobs. And it is helping those workers so they can get back on their \nfeet.\n  It is not a game; it is not a happy time. It is the least we can do \nfor those workers. Health coverage tax credit programs also help those \nsame trade-affected workers and retirees who lose their benefits. I \ncould go on about this. I will stop.\n  I hope Republicans do not object. The combination of TAA and HCTC, \ntrade adjustment and health care tax credit, is a winner for business. \nThe combination is a winner for workers; it is a\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\nwinner for our economy. It will boost the economy. It is too important \nfor the country. For decades there has been bipartisan support for the \nTAA program.\n  In 1962, President Kennedy, when this was conceived, said: Those \ninjured by foreign competition should not be required to bear the brunt \nof it.\n  When there are no replacements for good-paying, secure jobs, TAA and \nHCTC are there. They help workers acquire new skills. They help \nbusinesses compete. They are keys to our Nation's economic recovery. \nThey are keys to our competitiveness. They are, simply put, the right \nthing to do.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I believe, for a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/10/senate-section/article/S639-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S639-S641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--H.R. 359\n\n  Mr. CASEY. First, I thank Senator Brown and others who have helped us \nin this battle. Just a couple of words about trade adjustment \nassistance as it relates to Pennsylvania and, more importantly, \nPennsylvania workers.\n  As many people know, the trade adjustment assistance provisions were \nenhanced by amendments made to the program in 2009. It was updated in \ntwo critical ways. First, it expanded coverage to more workers, \nincluding service workers and workers whose jobs have been offshored to \nplaces around the world. The change was essential because it made \nworkers whose jobs were lost to China and India eligible for assistance \nwhich these days is an essential safeguard for those workers. The \namendments also increased and improved training, health coverage, and \nother benefits available to trade adjustment assistance certified \nworkers.\n  What does that mean for Pennsylvania? The 587 certifications issued \nin Pennsylvania cover an estimated 67,000 workers. To give one example, \nGeneral Electric announced in 2009 that they would be cutting 1,500 \njobs. We have worked with them and others to get them through this \nperiod. They recently got a solution in the form of trade adjustment \nassistance. As a result of their certification, the workers have been \nable to go to school, feed their families, and contribute to the local \neconomy. So General Electric in Pennsylvania is hiring again with the \nhelp of trade adjustment assistance.\n  With that by way of background, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 359, which was \nreceived from the House and is at the desk; that a Casey substitute \namendment providing an 18-month extension of trade adjustment \nassistance and the Andean Trade Preference Act be agreed to; the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time and passed; and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, reserving the right to object, the \nSenator's unanimous-consent request contains components he knows are \ncontroversial and opposed by numerous Senators and for that reason that \nproposal cannot pass the Senate today. Specifically, the proposal would \nextend the TAA-related provisions of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the failed stimulus package, \nwhich most Members of this side of the aisle strenuously opposed for \nvery sound reasons. That stimulus spent approximately $1 trillion under \nthe guise that it would keep unemployment rates below 8 percent. Yet \nnearly 2 years later, we are still at a point where unemployment rates, \nwhich had risen to the area of 10 percent, are now still at 9 percent. \nI am reminded this is nearly double the average annual rate of the last \nadministration.\n  It would be one thing if there was clear evidence that differing TAA \nprograms were effective in meeting these intended goals, but research \nsuggests the efficacy of the TAA training funding is not as convincing. \nAt the insistence of Senators Coburn and Enzi, the GAO found that in \nfiscal year 2009, nine Federal agencies spent approximately $18 billion \nto administer 47 separate employment and job training programs, \nincluding TAA. Despite large Federal spending, GAO could not conclude \nwhether the programs have had any meaningful benefit. The GAO report \nstates:\n\n       Little is known about the effectiveness of the employment \n     and training programs we identified because only 5 reported \n     demonstrating whether outcomes can be attributed to the \n     program through an impact study.\n\n  As a result, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, will the Senator from Wyoming \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Is he aware that 155,000 new workers have been \ncertified, that under the new TAA program since May 2009, 155,000 \nAmericans have been assisted under TAA?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would be happy to, as a matter of \nrecord, submit for the record the GAO study that was reported by \nSenators Coburn and Enzi to outline the entire study and the reason I \nam objecting today.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, if the Senator would be willing \nto give us more specifics, it is very important to those 155,000 \nworkers. I know a lot of them live in Pennsylvania. I don't know how \nmany of them live in Wyoming. I could find that out. I understand his \ncriticism of the Recovery Act, but that is a debate for another time. I \nunderstand Senator Coburn's disagreement and perhaps his too with \nworker training programs. I wish to see a better consolidation. This \nPresident is actually beginning to do that. President Bush, I don't \nbelieve, ever attempted that.\n  More precisely, strip away all the other discussions of the Recovery \nAct. Precisely what did we do that you object to when we expanded the \nTAA language in the Recovery Act? We have the Recovery Act in place. We \nhave the TAA in place. We expanded TAA so that more workers could be \ncovered, those workers who lost their jobs from trade agreements--not \nfrom trade agreements, lost their jobs from trade losses from trade, \nnot just in countries we had free trade agreements with but other \ncountries. We expanded it there. We also expanded it to service \nworkers. Since you are speaking for Mr. Coburn and others, what \nprecisely was the expansion in TAA that you objected to? This is not a \ndebate on all the worker training programs. This is a debate on making \nthem more efficient. We should have that debate. We should make it more \nefficient. This is not a debate on the Recovery Act, even though any \nfair-minded economist will say it is not a well-known failure. It \nactually worked. But that is another debate.\n  But precisely the expansion of TAA to cover service workers and to \ncover those workers who lost jobs to countries with whom we did not \nhave an FTA, what is your objection to those, the precise specific \nexpansion of TAA that Senator Casey's unanimous consent is trying to \nexpand, to continue?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I do look forward to having those \nadditional discussions and debates on all the issues raised by my \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio. That is why, after the two \ndistinguished Senators on the floor today offer the three different \nproposals, I have a counterproposal that I hope they would accept, an \nalternative package that maintains the underlying bill H.R. 359. It \nextends the Andean Trade Preference Act for 18 months and extends the \npermanent staffing prohibition for 18 months. I will be offering that \nafter we have finished an additional discussion by the other side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I have a second unanimous-consent request \nwhich I will offer. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 359, which was received from the House \nand is at the desk; that a Casey substitute amendment providing for a \n4\\1/2\\ month extension of trade adjustment assistance and the Andean \nTrade Preference Act be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed; and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and for\n\n[[Page S640]]\n\nthe reasons I have stated during the previous request and debate, I \nobject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I am not surprised by this, but I \nam very disappointed. These are American workers who have lost their \njobs. This body is responsible in part with a bunch of multinational \ncorporations that have moved jobs out of this country, in some cases to \nget cheaper labor, to get trade advantages, to take advantage of tax \nbreaks, to evade environmental laws, to evade worker safety and labor \nlaws. They have moved out of this country with assistance from this \nChamber. I don't know if it is Senator Barrasso or Coburn or who, but \nwe are turning our backs on those workers who have lost jobs not \nthrough their own doing. I am very disappointed.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 359, which was received from the House and is at \nthe desk; that a Brown substitute amendment providing an 18-month \nextension for the health insurance cost tax credit be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, reserving the right to object, this \nthird proposal deals solely with the health coverage tax credit, \nincluding the increases contained in the stimulus that went from 65 \npercent to 80 percent. It is important to note that the health coverage \ntax credit is not going away. It is merely reverting to the previous \nlevel which will require recipients to increase their contribution for \nhealth coverage. The health coverage tax credit stimulus level of 80 \npercent, which represents one of the most generous health care premium \nsubsidies provided by the Federal Government, is unsustainable.\n  As a result, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I am again disappointed. This is \na tax credit. The Senator from Wyoming knows this, as many colleagues \ndo. This brings back the issue of health care generally. A bunch of us \nin this body who get our health insurance from taxpayers are not \nwilling to assist people who have lost their jobs. The health care tax \ncredit is available, just as COBRA is available. But tell me for most \nAmerican workers that COBRA is not a cruel hoax. COBRA is what you get \nif you lose your job. You can keep your insurance. You have to pay the \nemployer side and your own side. You are working at a job making \n$40,000 a year. You pay your insurance, and your employer pays part of \nyour insurance also. If you lose your job, you keep paying your own \ninsurance, but you have to pay the employer's part too. What kind of \nworkers can get laid off and have the money to pay both? Is it still \navailable? Sure it is. Isn't that a wonderful thing? Aren't we great in \nthis body?\n  The fact is, it is not available. For Senators who want to repeal \nhealth care, for Senators who want to strip any assistance, because in \nthe end it does strip assistance that the health care tax credit gives, \nit is basically turning our backs and saying to these workers: Sorry \nabout that. Sorry about NAFTA. Sorry about PNTR. I know you lost your \njob because of the trade agreements. Sorry about losing your health \ninsurance. Sorry about not having any job training money. And if your \nhouse is foreclosed on, that is just too damn bad too.\n  I don't get this. I don't understand why people in this body can't at \nleast help those citizens who don't dress like this every day, who \ndon't make $170,000 a year, who don't have good health insurance \nprovided by taxpayers. Why are we turning our backs on them?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, let me add a few words to what Senator \nBrown said.\n  Think of what is happening here, what happened in the last couple \nminutes. We had three unanimous-consent requests. The first one I \noffered was an 18-month extension of trade adjustment assistance. What \nare we talking about? Trade adjustment assistance is basic to people's \nlives when they lose a job. Over the years it has had a lot of support \nfrom both parties. It is about training, income support, reemployment \nso people can get from joblessness through no fault of their own to a \njob. It is a very basic program. It works well. The evidence is clear. \nI asked for an 18-month extension. That was objected to.\n  Then we tried again. The next consent request I offered was a 4\\1/2\\ \nmonth extension. Just as we were leaving here in December, Senator \nBrown and I worked out an agreement with two Members of the Republican \nside, two Members who said: Let's extend it for a short period, a much \nshorter period than I wanted and a much shorter period than Senator \nBrown wanted, but we got an extension. That is what we are asking for \nhere, helping people in the midst of what is still a very tough \neconomy, almost 14 million people out of work, 13.9 according to the \nlast number. That is what we are talking about, not some fuzzy \ntheoretical program. This is a program we know works. It is a program \nthat helps people get from here to there, from joblessness to a job, \nand provides some training and skills. Why is this objected to time \nafter time by people on the other side? Then you add to that the health \ncare provisions Senator Brown talked about.\n\n  Everyone in this Chamber--every elected official in this Chamber--has \nboth a steady income and health care. All we are asking for is to \nextend, for a very short period of time, a program that helps people in \nthe midst of a tough economy, and the other side objects and objects \nand objects.\n  It is hard to understand, as Senator Brown said. It makes no sense. \nThis is not some new program we are experimenting with. This is a \nprogram that works. As I said before, in our State, 67,000 workers are \npositively impacted by this program. So I would like to hear more from \nthe other side about why they keep objecting to a program we know works \nin every State and we know people need at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, there are those folks around the \ncountry--and I go home to Wyoming repeatedly; I will be there again \ntomorrow evening--who are concerned about a $14 trillion debt this \ncountry is trying to live with, a deficit this year of $1.5 trillion. \nThe United States, in this last year, spent $3.7 trillion and brought \nin $2.2 trillion. That is not sustainable. It cannot continue. We \nsimply cannot continue at this level, where 41 cents of every dollar we \nspend in this country is borrowed, much of it from people overseas.\n  It should not catch anyone by surprise today that the stimulus \nprovisions we are talking about--the provisions from that stimulus \npackage--are set to expire. In fact, it has been well known since the \nday the stimulus passed.\n  The current financial position of the United States forces us to \nexamine all Federal programs and make some very tough and difficult \ndecisions.\n  I agree the Senate should extend the prohibition on implementation of \nthe Department of Labor's merit staffing rule which I believe is \nharmful and unnecessary. For these reasons, I propose an alternative \npackage that maintains the underlying bill, H.R. 359, regarding the \nelimination of the taxpayer-funded Presidential election campaigns, \nextends the ATPA, the Andean Trade Preference Act, for 18 months, and \nextends the merit staffing prohibition for 18 months.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of H.R. 359, that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken, the amendment at the desk be agreed to, and the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I reserve the right to object.\n  I cannot walk out of here--and I think Senator Casey feels the same--\nsaying yes to workers governed by the Andean trade preferences--in \nother words, yes, we are going to help workers in Colombia and Peru and \nEcuador and Bolivia--we are going to say yes to workers there--but the \nSenator from Wyoming wants us to walk out and\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\nhave said no to workers in Harrisburg and Columbus and Toledo and Erie \nand Sharon and Youngstown, so, Madam President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I think both sides understand these \nshould move together as a package, both trade adjustment assistance and \nthe Andean trade preference legislation as well. But let's try \nsomething here. We have talked about the arguments back and forth.\n  I would ask my friend from Wyoming if he would agree to an extension \nthrough Mother's Day, which is Sunday, May 8. I would ask him to \nrespond to that request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. What you have just heard is another objection. They object \nto another short period of time. Let me go through it again. They \nobject to a 4\\1/2\\ month extension, they object to an 18-month \nextension, and now they object to an extension through Mother's Day. I \ndo not think it is asking that much to go from here to May 8.\n  I do not think we are helping the economy at a very difficult time \nwhen there is objection after objection. But I hope the American people \nunderstand what is at stake here in the midst of a still recovering and \nfor some people still--for many people I should say; millions of \npeople--a horrific economic circumstance.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/10/senate-section/article/S641-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LINCOLN'S FAREWELL SPEECH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to recognize the work of organizers \nin Springfield, IL, who are kicking off the national Civil War \nSesquicentennial observation by reading President Abraham Lincoln's \n``Farewell Address'' on the 150th anniversary of its original delivery. \nThe speech will be reenacted in Springfield and individuals across the \nNation are invited to join them online for a simultaneous reading of \nit. Organizers hope to set a Guinness World Record for the most people \nreading aloud from the same document simultaneously.\n  This year marks the sesquicentennial of two momentous chapters in our \nnational history: President Abraham Lincoln's inauguration and the \nbeginning of the Civil War. Two years ago, we celebrated the \nbicentennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth. As part of that earlier \ncelebration, the Library of Congress displayed a remarkable collection \nof Lincoln artifacts. They included copies, written in Lincoln's own \nhand, of his first and second inaugural addresses and his immortal \nGettysburg Address. Also included was a copy of President Lincoln's \npoignant ``Farewell Address'' to Springfield, his adopted home, on \nFebruary 11, 1861. More than a thousand residents came out that day to \nwish Mr. Lincoln goodbye as he headed to Washington to become \nPresident. He delivered his remarks extemporaneously:\n\n       My friend--No one, not in my situation, can appreciate my \n     feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the \n     kindness of these people, I owe every thing. Here I have \n     lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to \n     an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is \n     buried. I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may \n     return, with a task before me greater than that which rested \n     upon Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being, \n     who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance \n     I cannot fail. Trusting in Him, who can go with me, and \n     remain with you and be every where for good, let us \n     confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care \n     commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will commend \n     me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.\n\n  President Lincoln, of course, did not live long enough to help write \nall of the chapters of American history that he had hoped for us. It \nhas fallen to each generation of Americans since him to take up that \npencil and write the next chapters: the Civil Rights Act, the Voting \nRights Act . . . the first African American president, another lanky \nlawyer from Illinois. But we know there are chapters that still need to \nbe written.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to join me in recognizing the 150th \nanniversary of President Lincoln's first inauguration, even as people \nin Springfield and around the country recite his Farewell Address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/10/senate-section/article/S641-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nSenator Nelson's amendment preventing the establishment of an extra \nadvisory committee for NASA.\n  It is ironic that in his recent State of the Union Address, President \nObama spoke of needing a ``sputnik'' moment to push America forward \nwhile the administration is supporting actions that complicate and \nweaken NASA and outsource its core capabilities.\n  Why should we transfer the responsibility for deciding how to affect \naeronautics research from the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, the responsible agency? NASA provides the Nation's \nfundamental aeronautics research capability and any further dilution of \nits capabilities will negatively impact not only our research and \ndevelopment abilities but America's future space missions.\n  Furthermore, the advisory committee's function would directly and \nadversely affect the separate authorization of appropriations, Public \nLaw 109-155, for NASA, wherein the Agency's lead role in civil \naeronautics research was reaffirmed--Sec. 411.\n  This is why I voted in favor of Senator Nelson's amendment, which \npassed by a vote of 96 to 1. It is good that the formation of this \ncommittee has been struck by the Nelson amendment. The proposal has not \nbeen fully considered. It is unwise and goes against what Congress has \nalready established.\n  I strongly believe it is of critical importance for the United States \nto maintain our competitive edge in human space exploration and civil \naeronautics research. We should not abandon our position as an \ninternational leader in human space exploration. Creating another \nbureaucracy, blurring lines of responsibility and complicating \ndecisionmaking by the responsible agency, NASA, will not be a step \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/10/senate-section/article/S641-4", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S641-S642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAMES BOYD\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak today about the \nnoble service of a great American from the State of Alabama, Mr. James \nBoyd. Mr. Boyd serves the city of Anniston as a police officer and has \nserved as a civilian adviser to the Afghani Police Force in Khost and \nKabul, Afghanistan, from November of 2009 to November of 2010. He is \ncurrently featured in the laudable project ``100 Faces of the War \nExperience.'' This exhibition displays portraits and brief stories of \nthose who have served in the multitude of possible ways in the theatres \nof war. The portraits are not for sale and not done at any cost to the \nparticipants. Mr. Boyd's story is as follows:\n\n       January 7th was the day of my war experience. I was \n     embedded with the U.S. military in Afghanistan, advising the \n     Afghan border police. We returned to our combat outpost at \n     3:20 PM after a supply mission. Right away I noticed that the \n     local border police we lived with were all but gone and my \n     police instinct immediately told me something was wrong. My \n     partner and I were talking to the Lieutenant and Sergeant \n     outside our building and decided to change into cold weather \n     gear for the night. Just as it got dark, we started receiving \n     heavy enemy gunfire; it was relentless and was all at head \n     level. I could hear the Sergeant yelling, ``Incoming!'' A \n     suicide bomber drove a 4,000 lb vehicle-\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\n     borne improvised explosive device into our compound wall \n     injuring 13 U.S. soldiers. I ran to those who were calling \n     for help and found the Sergeant I had been speaking with \n     moments before; he was severely injured and later died. My \n     partner and I ran back-and-forth across the compound under \n     heavy gunfire to get medical bags and stretchers, and to give \n     combat aid. More than a dozen Taliban tried to breach our \n     compound throughout the attack but the team held them back. \n     The rush of emotions throughout was unbelievable--the highest \n     of highs and lowest of lows. The carnage of war is \n     horrendous. The valor of warriors is inspiring. We should all \n     be grateful to the members of our military who defend our \n     enduring freedom and I am honored to support them in their \n     mission.\n\n  I thank Mr. Boyd and his family for their honorable contributions \ntoward the goals of our great Nation. I wish him and his family only \nthe best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/10/senate-section/article/S642-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 188.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to issue \npermits for a microhydro project in nonwilderness areas within the \nboundaries of Denali National Park and Preserve, to acquire land for \nDenali National Park and Preserve from Doyon Tourism, Inc., and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce \nlegislation, cosponsored by my colleague Mark Begich from Alaska, that \nrepresents an important step in the conversion to renewable energy \nsources in rural Alaska.\n  Today I introduce the Kantishna Hills Renewable Energy Act of 2011.\n  The Kantishna Roadhouse, owned by Doyon Tourism, Inc., is located 100 \nmiles inside Denali National Park and Preserve. The settlement of \nKantishna was founded in 1905 as a mining camp near the juncture of \nEureka and Moose Creeks. Gold in the region brought a flurry of \nprospectors in the early days, but as the gold began to run out, so did \ninterest in mining the Kantishna Hills. The original roadhouse at \nKantishna was built in the early 1900s, serving as a private residence, \na community center, post office, and informal hotel accommodations for \nthose who visited Kantishna in Denali Park.\n  The Roadhouse, like many structures within Denali National Park, is \nentirely off the grid and generates all of its electricity needs with a \ndiesel generator. As a result, all guests and supplies, including \ndiesel, are trucked through the Park to the Roadhouse over National \nPark roads. The construction of the micro hydro project would allow the \nRoadhouse to cut down their diesel usage by approximately 50%, which \nwould result in a decrease in diesel truck traffic on the Park Road, \nimproved local air quality, and less sound pollution in this remote \narea, as well as reduce disturbance and vehicle impacts on park \nwildlife, allowing for an enhanced visitor experience for tourists \nwithin the National Park.\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\n  My bill will authorize the National Park Service to exchange roughly \n10 acres of National Park land for an equivalent amount of land \ncurrently owned by Doyon Tourism, and would allow the National Park \nService to obtain the highly desired Galena tract of land, located just \noff the Park Road in the Kantishna region. Doyon Tourism would obtain \nland over which the hydro project would be implemented. In the interim \nperiod, prior to completion of the land exchange, the National Park \nService will issue a permit to allow Doyon Tourism, Inc., to construct \nthe micro hydro unit.\n  I want to emphasize how important I believe that this bill is. The \nbenefit to the citizens of Alaska, especially rural Alaska, of reducing \ntheir dependence on expensive diesel generation through access to \nrenewable and clean sources of energy is enormous. This type of Micro-\nHydro project within Denali provides an excellent blueprint for others \naround the State to follow suit.\n  I would like to thank Senator Begich, an original co-sponsor of this \nbill, for his and his staff's hard work in moving this bill forward. It \nis our hope that this bill will receive quick but careful consideration \nas the very short construction season in Alaska lasts only from May \nthrough September.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 317. A bill to allow for use of existing Section 8 housing funds, \nso as to preserve and revitalize affordable housing options for low-\nincome individuals; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Affordable \nHousing Preservation and Revitalization Act. I am delighted and honored \nto be joined in this effort by my good friend and colleague, Senator \nJeff Merkley. It has been my privilege to work with Senator Merkley and \nhis staff on an issue that is so important to our State of Oregon and \nto folks around the country.\n  There has been a lot of talk about housing in the media over the past \nyear. The topic of most of these conversations has been the foreclosure \ncrisis and the continued fallout from the mortgage meltdown.\n  But there is another housing story here, even though it may not get \nthe same attention or airtime: It is the story of homelessness and the \nstruggle to find affordable housing, and for thousands of Oregonians \nit's a daily reality.\n  Like many States, Oregon is experiencing a sharp rise in \nhomelessness.\n  The most recent count available from Oregon, found 19,208 people \nhomeless on a particular night. That number represented a 12 percent \nincrease in homelessness over 2009.\n  This same count also indicates that 31 percent of those experiencing \nhomelessness were children and the number of homeless families with \nchildren rose 33 percent from 2009.\n  In times like these, the Federal Government can hardly stand to lose \nits stock of affordable housing. Sadly, that is exactly what's \nhappening.\n  As long-term contracts are coming due, many landlords are leaving the \nbusiness of affordable housing for the private market. As these owners \nconvert to market rents, which is in their economic interest, the low-\nincome tenants will be unable to afford their homes. With fewer and \nfewer places to turn, many of these folks will end up on the street.\n  Some of these properties have what are known as residual receipts--\nfunds left over once the operating expenses and owner's distribution \nhave been paid. Currently, this money can only be used in the most \nextreme of situations. As a result, many of these residual receipts \nhave accumulated for nearly 3 decades. In Oregon alone, estimates \nsuggest there are more than $10 million in untapped residual receipts.\n  Senator Merkley and I believe these funds represent a substantial \nasset that could be used to help preserve affordable housing projects \nwith expiring contracts. That is why we are introducing the Affordable \nHousing Preservation and Revitalization Act.\n  Our legislation would permit residual receipts to be transferred with \naffordable housing properties that are sold to non-profits, provided \nthe non-profits commit to preserving and maintaining the housing stock \nas affordable.\n  Our legislation isn't a magic bullet and it certainly will not ensure \nthat every American can put a roof over their head. But we think it's \nthe kind of commonsense approach that Americans can get behind. I hope \nthat our colleagues will join us in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Vitter, Mr. McCain, \n        Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brown \n        of Ohio, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. \n        McCaskill, Mr. Begich, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 319. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nrespect to the importation of prescription drugs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Pharmaceutical \nMarket Access and Drug Safety Act of 2011. I am enormously grateful to \npartner with Senator Stabenow in this endeavor and to have the support \nof 17 additional bipartisan cosponsors. I also want to salute former \nSenator Byron Dorgan, who was such a tremendous ally on this issue for \nnearly a decade.\n  During health reform, I was disappointed with the $80 billion deal \nstruck by the drug industry in exchange for supporting the legislation. \nMake no mistake--this is hardly a generous offer from the industry. \nConsider the fact that last August, a report issued by AARP on retail \nprices of brand-name drugs showed that the 217 products most used by \nolder Americans increased by an average of 8.3 percent during 2009, \neven as inflation was negative. So in other words, we have the industry \nsetting a new pricing baseline that is entirely off kilter with the \nrest of the economy . . . widely unaffordable for the American people . \n. . and clearly unsustainable for the future. Negotiating concessions \nis no substitute for instilling market competition--which is exactly \nwhat this legislation will do.\n  It is unconscionable that more and more individuals are forced to \nskip doses or split pills as prices increase while our economy \ncontracts. Today our bill could already be providing the access that \nAmericans deserve to the more affordable drug prices available in other \nindustrialized nations. It is simply indisputable that Americans pay \nfar too much for prescription drugs--when other countries pay 35-55 \npercent less. And the cost of brand drugs in the U.S. increases at two \nto three times the inflation rate.\n  When nations institute safe, regulated trade in pharmaceuticals they \nsee results--as Sweden did when it entered the European system of trade \nand saw a reduction of 12-19 percent in the price of traded drugs. Now, \nopponents claim importation will cause harm, but they fail to note the \ngreatest prescription drug threat to the safety of Americans . . . that \nthe inability to take a drug as it is prescribed . . . exacts a \ntremendous toll on thousands of American lives every year.\n  The bottom line is that safety is the foundation of our bill--our \nlegislation not only addresses the safety of imports, but also was the \nfirst to provide FDA with the resources to improve inspection of \nforeign drug plants--many of which today produce medications marketed \nhere by U.S. firms which consumers assume to be ``domestic.''\n  They have also failed to understand or acknowledge we have left no \nstone unturned to assure importation will be safe . . . why we require \nFDA approval of all imported drugs . . . that the agency regulate, \ninspect and monitor those who handle medications . . . that we require \nstrong prescription controls, improved labeling, anticounterfeiting \ntechnology and tracking of shipments to assure the security of \nmedications. We don't rely on ``certifying safety''--this legislation \nensures safety.\n  Indeed when all the provisions of this legislation are considered, \nthis legislation will set a new standard for domestic drug safety. \nBecause, right now--today--many of the drugs which Americans use every \nday are in fact manufactured in foreign factories. Yet today foreign \nplants are seldom inspected--it can be as many as 12 years between \ninspections. The fact is, global sourcing\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nof production to lower cost countries--including those with inadequate \nregulatory oversight--means that FDA simply must be examining all \nfacilities where our medications are made.\n  Under our bill, such plants--and in fact every step in the drug \nsupply chain--are to be inspected and regulated by FDA. And we include \nlong-sought incentives, to improve drug safety such as anti-\ncounterfeiting technologies, drug ``pedigrees,'' and improved \nregulation and oversight of the handling of prescription drugs.\n  At the same time, this legislation will ensure that importation is \neffective in delivering savings to consumers. The Congressional Budget \nOffice reports our bill will generate savings of $19.4 billion to the \nFederal Government alone. Isn't that exactly the kind of savings we \nshould achieve at a time of escalating health care costs?\n  So it is clear that the time for enactment of this legislation is \ncertainly long overdue--and today the need for this legislation is \nactually greater . . . not less. Among working age adults--only those \nwith Medicare coverage saw any improvement in their ability to fill \ntheir prescriptions. All others saw a rise in their inability to obtain \nneeded medications! Among the uninsured more than 1 in 3 individuals \nwent without a required prescription--and in those with chronic disease \nthat number doubles! So despite manufacturer assistance programs--\ndespite the increased use of generics--the high and escalating cost of \nbrand name drugs is directly impacting the health of millions.\n  It is indeed time to engender more competition, and the more \naffordable pricing that will bring. That is why I look forward to \nmoving forward together to see passage of our bill this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 324. A bill to amend the Chesapeake And Ohio Canal Development Act \nto extend to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park \nCommission; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to re-introduce \nlegislation to support greater public involvement in the administration \nof one of Maryland's most treasured National Parks. The Chesapeake and \nOhio Canal National Historical Park Advisory Commission Act ensures \nthat the communities located along the 184.5 mile long C Canal \nNational Historical Park have a voice with the National Park Service \nregarding decisions affecting the administration of the Park. The \nCommission keeps the people and small businesses most affected by the \noperation of the C Canal National Historical Park informed and \ninvolved in the decisions surrounding the Park. Citizen involvement in \nthe governmental process is a hallmark of our democracy and the C \nCanal National Historical Park Advisory Commission Act exemplifies the \ngoal of ensuring the public's role in government decision making.\n  The importance of the Commission is intrinsically tied to the \nuniqueness of the C Canal National Historical Park. The Park covers \nan area of 20,000 acres winding North and West along the Potomac River \nfrom the heart of Georgetown's old industrial district in Washington \nD.C. to Cumberland, MD nestled in the valleys and mountains of Western \nMaryland. The Park's watered canal, contiguous towpath, popular among \ncyclists, backpackers, day hikers and runners, hundreds of historic \nstructures and towns like Hancock, Hagerstown, Harpers Ferry, \nWilliamsport and Sharpsburg that grew during the Canal's heyday, all \ntell the story of how the C Canal once served as a crucial East/West \ncommercial link. The Park also preserves pristine views of the Potomac \nRiver, evocative of the C Canal's working days. At its widest points, \nthe C Canal National Historical Park spans less than \\2/10\\ of a mile \nacross and in many areas directly abuts neighboring commercial and \nresidential properties bordering the Park.\n  During the commercial operation of the C Canal, these towns were \nlocal commercial centers where area farmers and tradesman utilized the \ncanal boats to deliver their goods to market. Today, the hospitality \nand tourism industries of these communities thrive upon the C Canal \nNational Historical Park's popularity and are integral to enhancing the \npark user experience. Whether it is hotel or bed and breakfast to spend \nthe night in, a restaurant or diner to grab a meal, stores to shop in \nand perhaps stock up on camping provisions, boathouses to rent a canoe \nfor the afternoon, bike shops to service a flat tire or make repairs to \nyour bike or any of the myriad of goods and services park visitors may \nneed, the communities along the C Canal are as important to the Park \nuser experience as the Park's users are to maintaining their \nbusinesses.\n  In 2009, more than 3.75 million people visited the C Canal National \nHistorical Park. To put it in perspective, in 2009, more people visited \nthis historic treasure than the number of people who visited \nYellowstone, Yosemite, the Everglades or Shenandoah National Park. Much \nof the C Canal National Historical Park's success is attributable to \nthe positive relationship that has developed over time between the \nNational Park Service and the local community leaders that span the \nlength of the Park. The Park's Commission has greatly facilitated this \nrelationship.\n  The Commission provides the vital link between the affected committee \nthat the Park runs through and the National Park Service. The \nCommission ensures that the public is engaged in the numerous processes \nsurrounding operational policy and infrastructure maintenance and \nrestoration projects on the C Canal National Historic Park. The \nCommission plays a vital consultation and planning role for park \nactivities and operations. The cooperation that has developed between \nthe Commission and the National Park Service helps ties to the Park to \nits communities. The Commission serves a purely advisory function and \ndoes not have the authority to make binding park policy.\n  The Commission was first established as part of the 1971 Chesapeake \nand Ohio Canal Development Act sponsored by Rep. Gilbert Gude, R-MD. \nEvery ten years, a bill like mine comes before congress, when the 10-\nyear extension of the Commission's authorization expires. Three times \nover a 40-year period extension bills have passed by unanimous consent \nand without controversy. My bill is another 10-year extension of the \nAdvisory Commission's authorization and makes no changes to the \nCommission's authority. Legislative precedent has never set an \nauthorization amount for the Commission, but the Commission has always \nfunctioned at a nominal cost.\n  The General Services Administration's Federal Advisory Commissions \nAct database determined that the C Canal Advisory Commission's \nexpenses totaled $33,199 for fiscal year 2010. All expenses came out of \nthe National Park Service's general operating budget. Expenses covered \nthe cost of travel for commission members, $295, Federal staff time, \n$28,074, and miscellaneous expenses, $4,830, like meeting space, \nprinting, supplies and website maintenance.\n  The National Park System is a showcase of America's natural and \nhistorical treasures. So much of the National Park System's success is \nrooted in the citizen stewardship projects and the involvement of \ncaring citizens and community leaders. Like so many of our National \nParks the C Canal National Historical Park has an extensive backlog \nof maintenance and repair projects. The Commission plays a critical \nrole in helping keep these projects moving forward and assisting the \nNational Park Service with their completion because there is \nrecognition of the shared responsibility between the Park Service and \nthe Commission about the importance of continuing to make the Park a \ndesirable tourism and outdoor recreation destination.
